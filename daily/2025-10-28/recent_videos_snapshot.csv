The professor emphasized that the clothes must be thrown into the trash can after wearing them. At night, the moths occupied New New York and and all the residents had fashionable clothes to wear. Schwaburg also got a girlfriend thanks to the clothes, but he was curious about what was in the trash can. To demonstrate, the professor threw peanuts into the trash can. The next second, his pet drilled into it. Fry and his group also flew their ship into the trash can and came to a desolate planet. Clothes were constantly floating in the sky, and their ship was soon crushed by the clothes. Everyone had to walk on foot. On the road, they encountered giant caterpillars. Swabberg found his old pants, but they were occupied by the professor's pet. Kara picked up a fashionable backpack and drove off the pet. The two ran towards the ship at the critical moment. Swabberg grabbed Fry's belly, but Kara was left on this planet. After returning to the company, everyone blamed the professor for destroying the planet, so the professor used a machine to lock onto the planet's coordinates. Discovered that the destroyed planet was future earth. They had been throwing waste clothes to the future, and humanity had destroyed itself with their own hands. Meanwhile, a portal appeared outside the window, and countless clothes began flying out of it, heading toward earth.

The man's neck always drooped downward. They'd never seen each other's faces, even when they were in the same room. One day, the man sat in a cafe waiting for his medical results. He noticed couples all around him. His heart suddenly felt hollow, longing for love of his own. When his diagnosis was placed before him, he saw a triangle on the scan. His heart sank. His neck would never be the same. In that moment, he remembered how people tilt their heads when they kiss. So he stole a billboard of a beautiful woman from the poolside. Wearing his finest suit, he bent down to kiss her picture. But no matter how hard he tried, he could never reach her lips. In the end, he even snapped the head off the billboard. Just then, he heard bird song outside. Leaning out to look, he saw a woman for the first time. Their eyes met. In that instant, they both thought, maybe this is the one. He rushed home to put on his best jacket. She fixed her hair, both longing for their first meeting. But tragically, because of their bodies and height, they circled around for a long time and still couldn't see each other. Then they walked away, one upstairs, the other downstairs, as if fate played a cruel joke. Yet in the moment, they brushed past each other. The little bird sang again. They both turned around. At last, their Eyes aligned perfectly and love began to bloom.

Veteran journalist Gersch Kunsman roams the city fixing eligible plates one car at a time. And this is what's interesting about this car. Oh, my goodness. He looked up this vehicle's history. This guy used to get speeding tickets fairly regularly until about late 2020. So presumably he's had this condition for a few years and he's avoided speed camera tickets. And you wouldn't believe who it belongs to. He's got a placard that says NYPD. That's right. He's an NYPD cop. A spokesman claims it was natural wear and tear that the officer only recently noticed. But cops must have been watching as we scoped out the plate. Two hours later, we're back and look at this, brand new plates. And that wasn't the only government employee who was driving around with suspicious plates. According to the placard, this car is owned by a district attorney consultant. What caught my eye was these two little white patches. And sure enough, he's got KDE turned into KDF.

I still can't believe this actually happened. It was presented as a team building night, a way to build friendships before graduation. Parents were told everything would be strictly supervised, teachers on duty all night, full security, nothing to worry about. But that turned out to be a lie. After midnight, the teachers gathered in the staff lounge, poured themselves a few drinks, laughed a little too loudly, and one by one they fell asleep. Meanwhile, the students were wide awake. They began sneaking into classrooms, locking doors, closing blinds. And what followed was a night of complete chaos without any adult watching. By morning, everything looked normal. Smiles in the hallways, selfies on social media, teachers congratulating them for good behavior. No one realized that this single night would change 12 families forever. Days later, the absences started. Girls missing class, excuses about stomach pain, doctor visits, not feeling well, until parents began running into each other in the same clinic for the same reason. And that's when the truth came out. Every clue pointed back to that night.

It wasn't a serious matter. Her older sister could scold her a bit and that would be enough. But the white plantation owner was very displeased. He thought it disturbed the invited guests and insisted on punishment. Even the white lady next to him pleaded for the black slave. But the plantation owner wouldn't back down. He insisted that his wife punished the girl in front of everyone. Get her. You go now, girl. After the girl sadly left, the man calmly had his servant pour him a drink, almost as if showing off his treatment of slaves. That evening, Emma told sunny to follow the rules or she'd have to work in the fields. Honey cried, but she was also angry, swearing to get revenge on the hateful white plantation owner. The next morning, the girl quietly sneaked into the kitchen when no one was around. She hadn't had the chance to admire the things she hadn't seen yesterday. Today, she curiously looked around, and when she saw the delicate silverware, she couldn't help but play with it in her hands. Just then, the mistress happened to notice her. Sunny quickly put the items down, but she couldn't avoid a harsh scolding from the plantation owner's wife. Luckily, Emma stepped in just in time, criticizing the girl's behavior and preventing further punishment. But it wasn't over yet. As the mistress left, he left a stern warning, if I catch you misbehaving, Again, I'll throw you into the fields to work in the big house. Sunny had to not only clean, but also look after the plantation owner's young son. So she walked into the young master's room and without realizing it, lay down on his big bed, enjoying a comfort she had never felt before. What she didn't notice was a little boy quietly watching her. I can't take care of the child. The child's almost grown and he ain't even house broke. Change him fast and do your best now. We are waiting on you.

I don't have a cell phone, sir. Well, then what's. It's a robot for our project. When do you think I was born? Depends. How old are you now? There's no school policy to cover this one. So the good news, we can all put this incident behind us. My daughter gets her hands on this filth and we're supposed to put it behind us. It's not yours. Of course it's. Oh, mine. Oh, sick. It's mine. Oh, why won't you look at. I don't wanna discuss this now. I'm sorry. You're not having sex, are you? Of course not. So why would you be interested in a thing like that? I barely know what it's for, but everyone at school does. I guess I never expected you to be interested in sex toys. But I'm, I'm not. I just, I'm not using them, but I am curious about other things. Let's talk about them. How'd it go with the parental unit? My mom answered most of my questions. It was informative. My mom would never talk to me about that kind of stuff. I think that's just for me to know. Starting with sex toys early, little Edwards, what would Jesus say? That masturbation is normal and no one should be Embarrassed about it, really. And if you tried it once in a while, maybe you wouldn't be so mean.

So there's no reason for you to say no, is there? I guess not. This is for you, um, to wear over your clothes later. Where are we going? Space. Why have you never had a girlfriend? Mr. Simpson says that my brutal honesty and passion for science are things that girls may not appreciate in high school, but. Well, after being lied to by a few guys, I can get behind brutal honesty. You're just saying that because I haven't offended you yet. You seem like you want a kiss. Am I that obvious? Should I move in? Maybe dating Connor is not a good idea. Maybe he's all wrong for me, and I just can't see it because it feels so good to hang out with a nice guy for once. But before you commit. You know when I told you to stay away from my brother? Your brother was a jerk to me. I might be biased, but he's changed. I think you two Would be perfect together. Thanks a lot, Becky. Now I really don't know what to do. If he likes me, why didn't you say so instead of waiting for your sister to do something? Look, I felt like I messed up so bad with you, and then when I tried again the other day, I messed up again. Well, what'll be different this time? I need a girl like you to keep me in line. And how about a date? What were you thinking? You know what? Uh, yeah. This was a huge mistake. Oh! Oh! Stay away from my girlfriend.

Mr. Griffin, what I do with my husband is none of your business. Husband? Morning, Pete. Hope you and Molly can still join us for dinner tonight. Come here, baby. Let's go play school girl and guy who has sex with school girl. Brian, what the hell is going on? We were only in 1984 One night. Now everything's all messed up. I think I can explain it to you, Peter. This line represents the normal flow of events. Here's where you met Lois, here's where you got married, and here's the present. And here's the night at the bar.

Yes, Dave? Did you take my money again? What do you mean? The money I've been saving for four years. Oh, don't be so grumpy. We needed it. What does that even mean? For your sister's wedding. What? Yes, we needed to impress her in laws. I spent four years collecting that money so that I can finally move out. And you think it's okay to take my money just like that? Yes, I have the right to. As your mother, I carried you in my stomach for nine months. After all that and raising you, this is how you're going to treat me? Excuse me, mom, I gave you at least 200 dollar every week. That's not enough. I've been working since the second I turned 16, okay? And I deserve to keep my own money. Oh, please. You really are spoiled. Just like Sarah said, huh? You don't even deserve that money. Your sister needs it more. Why can't she pay? She's literally 25. She's a salaried employee. No, she can't do that. He makes more than me. That doesn't matter. You're her brother. This isn't fair. Life's too short to worry about trivial things like money. This is my future, my college funds, my future rent, okay? Your sister's wedding is more important. I saved at least 15 K. Yes, and it was a great contribution to the wedding. I can't believe this. And does Sarah know you're spending my savings on her wedding? Well, of Course she knows. She's the one who suggested it. Get me my money back. No. Why? Why are you being so crazy? It's just money. If it's just money, then why don't you spend your own money? Actually, even better. Why doesn't Sarah spend her own money on her own wedding? No, son, that makes no sense whatsoever. I will ruin her wedding if I don't get my money back. You wouldn't. And you're still not getting the money back. Fine then. I didn't wanna have to do this. What could you possibly threaten me with this time? Not only will I ruin Sarah's wedding, I'll ruin your marriage too. What is this, some sort of joke? No. I can tell father that you're cheating on him. You don't even have proof. You're crazy. That's rich coming from someone who is sleeping with not only her boss, but her assistant as well. Like I said, you're crazy. And I even have pictures of not only the text messages, but of the two of you together. You wouldn't. Oh, yes, I would. You want your money back? Yes. Every penny. But I can't. You can and you will. But I already spent it on things for the wedding. We'll figure it out. I won't forgive you for this. Good. So now you know how it feels. I wish I never birthed a son as selfish as you are. Oh, and that reminds me. I also want my other 5 K that You previously took from me, so that makes it 20 K. What? How am I supposed to make that? Much the same way I did. By working my ass off. I can't believe you. Lol. That's what I said. This is no laughing matter. You have until the end of this month, mother, or it will all come crashing down. And a little piece of advice. Selling some of that jewelry might be a good idea.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

I can't believe. Shoo! You paired me up with my ex, who cheated on me with the entire football team for the final physics project that could have saved my failing grade. All gaily did the entire time was flirt with me. Then today, when we were supposed to turn the project in, she sent me this. She fed the project to her freaking dog! How could you do this to me? Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face. Sit next to me, Bailey. You completely ruined my life. You're a selfish brat who destroyed our project because I didn't want to get back with you. I'll never be with a girl like you ever again. Oh, come on, Luki Puki. It's not that serious. You know what would be so romantic? Failing this class together because we both gave up on the project to fall in love. Stop with this. You destroyed the project and fed it to your dog, all because I didn't want to be with a bop like you. You're being dramatic. Can't Tina app bring me roast Master robot help me roast my bop X that keeps trying to get me back? Say, what man in their right mind would wife a garden tool? What man in their right mind would wife a garden tool? Wow. Lucas Shrieley, stop talking to me. I'm going to make sure you and Miss Geisha get what you deserve. Yeah, right. Have fun with that. Ha ha ha! I'll be sitting here waiting for you to come back, my king. Shut it! Mr. Reynolds, I need your help. What's going on, Lucas? Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey? Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything. Wait, I see something. What? Comment part three.

He needs time for himself. He's got his own things, like his gym routine and social life. I have a job and study, mom. Your brother deserves better. You're just not as responsible as him. I'm the one who runs errands and helps around the house. That's because you're older. It's your job to handle these things. I knew you always had a favorite. I don't have favorites.

The only family you have is me and your brother. I don't know if you know this, mom, but I work every day. Unlike you and my brother, who just sit on the couch all day. So are you living on the street? At least I'll have company. Company? You're ridiculous. I work. I rented a place for myself. What about the rent for this house? I don't know. Didn't you say this was your house? Now you can pay the rent. It's not my problem anymore. I didn't give you the right to talk to me like this. You don't have any rights, mom. Don't you see? You don't control anything anymore. The only person you control is my brother. Where is your place? My place is close to your heart. And where is my heart? It's in an empty place. Tell me now! We won't be able to pay the rent and the bills. Maybe you could get a job for my brother so he can help you with the bills. No. Your brother is a prince. He can't work. He needs to go to Paris. Why? So he can know what it's like to live life, to enjoy life, to have a good life. And I can't have that, right? No. Now tell me the address. I need to go there.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The the moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

I'm sorry, but I had to stand up for Anna. No, she's not fine. She. He's in the ER. What? What are you talking about? After you told her you never wanted to see her again. It hurt bad. I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what?

She's going to The door. Tell her not to open it. She already did. There's no one there. Check the window again. They're gone. But they left the watch on the porch. Don't touch it. Too late.

When I went to flush the toilet, there was a similar high pitch sound and some rattling. I told her that I would get a plumber to fix it caused there was clearly something wrong. At night again, while I was sleeping, my daughter woke me up and said, daddy, I fixed the toilet. I told her that was excellent thinking she was joking around. But then she said, look, I have a surprise for you. I asked her what the surprise was. So I got up and she LED me to her room. In her room, she turned on the lights and showed me a shoebox that kept on moving. When I opened it, there was a wet rat running around with a long tail. I slammed it shut immediately and put a book on top of it so the rat couldn't escape. I asked her if the rat scratched or bit her and she told me no. Still, I rushed her to the hospital to get her tested for rabies and I called animal control for the rat. Luckily, my daughter was clear of rabies, but my wife wasn't. My wife, while on the toilet, had been scratched by the rat. She told me she felt fine and that she never noticed the scratch. When we got her tested, they said there was a high possibility to prepare for the rest. Apparently the chances of a rat or snake coming up your toilet isn't as impossible as you think. The rat had been coming up and down for days before anyone noticed. When my daughter saw it, she grabbed it and decided that it was gonna be her new pet. After a very long hospital trip, my wife was clear of rabies. We were so scared of using the toilet that for a week we used a litter box.

Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face.

Ha ha ha! I'll be sitting here waiting for you to come back, my king. Shut it! Mr. Reynolds, I need your help. What's going on, Lucas? Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey? Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything.

I know how mom made you. Thank you very much. Bro, you're so pressed. Unlike your nose. That thing is the opposite of flat. You can't talk. Your nose is like a bridge. I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college. Whenever I mess around about something, you take it seriously. I'm just kidding. Obviously. Hello? I know you can read this, you hole. You wouldn't know. You're barely 8 years old. I'm literally 13, bro. I hate you. I love you too. Happy birthday. I don't care. You don't even come over on holidays anymore. Why would I respond to you? Okay, why are you so different? It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too. Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried. Boys aren't supposed to cry. But you told me. It's okay. I love you. Do you still love me, too?

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists had Loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still Arguing on the phone by his truck, the front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious right now? Excuse me? Ben is 12, mom. 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore.

It's on the school website. But you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No. All you do is talk, and all I do is listen. I'm done. Mom, I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I'm listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself. And I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk, okay? Actually, no, I will listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way, you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are you Talking about. What are you doing? Elizabeth? Elizabeth?

Don't tell me you forgot what today is. Mom, not now, please. My girlfriend Anna is in labor. We're at the ER. Our baby is coming. So you did forget. I guess your little girlfriend made sure of that, huh? Of course she'd go into labor today on my birthday. What a coincidence. Are you serious right now? You think Anna planned this? She's going through it right now. The doctor said they don't know if she'll be okay. Oh, please. That girl has always had a flare for drama. She does this every stinking time. Every time I try to see you, something urgent comes up. I haven't seen my sweet boy in months. Mom, you really think she's faking this to make me miss your birthday? Are you actually that jealous of her? I see right through her. She's been trying to pull you away from me since the moment she met you. Last time you missed dinner because of period cramps. Oh, please. That girl will say anything to keep you from spending time with me. Are you out of your mind? Anna is about to risk everything, bringing in your grandchild, and you're going on some jealous rant? Don't yell at me. You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me. I carried you. I raised you, and you're choosing her over your own mother on my 50th birthday? Because this is serious. Anna could lose it all, and you're crying about cake? And candles. That girl stole you. She made you cold. You used to call me every night. Now I have to beg to hear your voice. Do you know how that feels? I'm not a little boy anymore. I'm a father now. And you refuse to accept that. You changed the day you met her. You stopped coming over. You didn't show up for the family cookout. You said you were tired. But I know it was her. And now I spent weeks planning this birthday dinner. Everyone's here. Your uncle, your aunt, even grandma. And my son's seat is empty. Did you even freaking hear what I said? The doctor said Anna's fate is uncertain, and you're talking about a dinner? You were my baby first. All I wanted today was a hug from my son. One picture, one memory. You think your little family matters more than the one that raised you? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. You're evil. You want me to leave the woman I love? Well, she's fighting for everything. Just so you don't feel left out. Cantina. Ask. Bring Robert. Help me cook. My son for choosing his girlfriend over his own mother. Tell him. Bro really peed his pants at 16 and thinks he's grown. If your girl knew she'd vanish, but mommy still cleaned it up. Bro really peed his pants at 16 and thinks he's grown. If Anna knew she'd vanish, but mommy still cleaned it up. Mom, I swear it's Cantina app roast bot, son. Get it? I just want my son back. I want the boy who made me laugh, the boy who asked me to braid his hair, who watched Disney movies with me on the couch. Now all I see is this bitter, distant man, and it's all because of her. Wow. You know what? I hope one day you realize how insane you sound. And until that day comes, I never want to talk to someone as selfish as you again. You don't mean that. Please tell me you don't mean that. Chris. Chrissy, baby, don't do this to your mama. Chrissy. You selfish, freaking brat! Do you even realize what you just did to your mother? Dad, not you, too. Are you really siding with her on this? Anna is in labor. Don't you dare try to flip this. You hurt your mother on her 50th birthday. She'll be fine. She always does this. I'm sorry, but I had to stand up for Anna. No, she's not fine. She. He's in the ER. What? What are you talking about? After you told her you never wanted to see her again. It hurt bad. I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what? Some freaking cake? Anna is in labor! They Don't know what will happen. I had no choice. There's always a choice. And you made yours. Don't call me dad anymore. It's Peter to you now. Dad, no.

Oh, my god. I was just about to do the same thing. Our phones were switched. I know. I hate this stupid school. They are the only ones who take our phones for assemblies. It's so annoying. Anyways, when can we meet? Uh, about that. What? My family and I were going on a road trip right after school, and we already left. We are an hour away, and trust me, I can't make them mad by asking to go back. You're lying. What the hell am I going to do with your phone for however long you are gone? I'm gone for the weekend. What? I can't wait three days. I have things to do. You know, sorry, Adam, but I don't know what to say. You're going to have to wait. Wait. How do you know who I am? Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I heard of you, at least. But how did you know it was my phone? When you texted me, I clicked on the notification and it showed your messages. Your last text was from your mom. So we are going through each other's messages now? No, no, it wasn't like that. I didn't mean to. Ha ha. I know. I'm just playing with you. So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice. Unless you wanna drive six hours to meet us at our first stop, be my guest. Yeah, I don't know about all that. Anyways, let's make this interesting. How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes. Hey, I have a question. Are you still dating Emma? Emma? How do you know about her? Everyone was talking about you guys and how great of a couple you were. Oh, well thankfully that's no longer. Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Oh. Anyone in mind? Uh, I don't know. I guess you could say I have a little crush. Really? Who? Ha, ha. You aren't gonna find out that easy. Oh, my god, you are really going to make me wait. Well, you are making me wait 3 days for my phone, so I think you can wait as well. Okay, maybe you're right. Ha, ha. It's getting kind of late. I think I'm gonna head to bed. Okay. Good night, Adam. Good night, Lily. Good morning, Lily. I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh, my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Ha ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Oh, okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Some girls arrive at college ready for a fresh start, but Madison arrived like high school never ended. She lived three doors down and had somehow decided that my late night water runs were her business. The crime, existing in a tank top without a bra. The verdict, she was about to make it everyone's problem. It started with a knock on my door one Tuesday night. I just walked 10 yards to the water fountain in a white tank top, no bra because why would I? ANK was fitted but not see through. You could maybe see the outline of my nips if you were actively looking. Madison stood there twisting her rose gold ring, speaking in that fake concerned voice. Hey, so sorry to ask, but could you maybe put on a bra when you're in the hallway? My boyfriend's visiting and he was, um, staring a little. I'm non confrontational to a fault so I actually apologized. Yeah, sure, no problem. For the rest of that night, I threw on a hoodie every time I left my room. Whatever. Pick your battles, right? But the next morning my roommate came back from the bathroom looking pissed. You'll never guess what I just heard. She turns out Madison was in there with her squad doing a full Broadway reenactment of my water fountain trip. According to her version, I've been Practically topless, bending over suggestively, taking my sweet time while her poor boyfriend struggled to keep his virgin eyes off me. She actually demonstrated my supposed poses at the sink, complete with hair flips I definitely didn't do that night. I passed Madison and her friends in the hallway wearing pajama, no bra again because I forgotten her stupid request. She looked directly at my chest, whispered something and they all started giggling like middle schoolers who just discovered Urban Dictionary. The moment I snapped the email, R R a sent a building wide message about appropriate hallway attire and respecting communal spaces. Anonymous complaint, she said, but I knew exactly who'd submitted it. Some passive aggressive bull crap about keeping things covered up for everyone's comfort. Challenge accepted. If Madison was so worried about her boyfriend seeing the vague outline of my nips through a tank top, maybe the real problem wasn't my outfit. I did what any petty genius would do, research. Took me five minutes to find what I needed. See Madison's boy.

One many years ago, a guy said he had a huge Willy and I was like, okay, whatever. He was like, no, I'm dead serious. We were just hooking up. So I asked for a pic and something to scale. It was huge both in length and girth, like at least 8 inches long. I felt adventurous and decided to try it. Even fully turned on and wet, we needed copious lotion. It was so big that we could only do missionary because every other position it didn't fit and was painful for my mouth. I could literally only fit the tip because it was too big for my mouth. That's how I Learned I am not a size queen. I don't want anything above 6 inches. 5 to five and a/2 is the sweet spot. Six starts to hurt in certain positions more and I'll probably be crying and not in the fun way. 2. Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. I just, I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. 3. Shower. Love making in a normal size shower. 4. We were in the shower more than large enough for both of us. I just wanted to kneel in front of her and eat her. It seems so hot. But within seconds I realized I am kind of waterboarding myself as I could not breathe due to the water being everywhere. Not attractive being able to eat only if you are holding your breath.

So I made her wedding about everyone's future marriages. Allison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during posts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cake cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Allison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here. She announced, pulled her boyfriend Craig up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guests erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Allison Show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told Me? I was being dramatic. She just excited about becoming a mother. She said you should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Alison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. Two months later, at Sunday dinner, Alison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Craig sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions, just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theatre friends first. My roommate, Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled with delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Alison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help after hearing About my wedding, the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released doves during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned guests, everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table four and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Alison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else at 6:45 during the champagne toast.

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time, I knew I didn't belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street, and their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school, and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background at first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, saying I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead. Grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. Never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much? She asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt, but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad, I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected, and desperate to adopt. But no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. His mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then, and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits, and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans. Hired expensive lawyers, claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder through Nathan. The final blow. Came when they offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy. She was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was given

Court clerk for eight years. This divorced dad was fighting for custody of his six year old daughter. His ex wife claimed he was an alcoholic who endangered their kid. She came prepared for war, had photos of beer bottles scattered around his house, testimony from three neighbours about loud parties and even a police report about a disturbance at his address. Her lawyer was this slick eye in a three thousand dollar suit who clearly done his homework. The evidence looked damning. Photos showed empty bottles everywhere, kitchen counter, coffee table, bathroom sink, even one in the kids toy box next to her stuffed bunny. The neighbours swore they'd seen him stumbling around drunk at two PM on weekdays, music blasting at all hours. One elderly neighbour claimed she'd called C P. S twice because the little girl looked neglected and scared. Her lawyer painted him as a complete deadbeat, said he missed scheduled visitations because he was too drunk to drive. Claimed the daughter came home crying, talking about daddy's angry voice, how the house smelled like yucky medicine. The guy sat there quietly throughout the whole character assassination. No fancy suit, just wrinkled khakis and a polo shirt, clutching a Manila folder like his life depended on it. I've seen plenty of custody battles and this one looked over before it started. The judge was taking detailed notes, nodding along with the ex wife's testimony. She was Crying at all the right moments, playing the devastated mother perfectly. Even I was starting to feel sorry for her. Judge looked ready to rule against him. When he finally asked to speak, his voice was shaky. Nervous. Your honor, when exactly did she say I missed those visits? October 15th, 22nd and 29th. The ex wife replied confidently, stabbing her eyes with a tissue. He opened his folder with trembling hands. Here's my work schedule from the fire station. I'm a paramedic. I was saving lives. Those exact dates, 24 hour shifts, two car accidents and a heart attack on the 15th. Apartment fire on the 22nd, three car pile up on the 29th. The paperwork was official.

In my family, there was one rule. I needed my twin's permission to seek medical help. I was watching Vanessa practice her birthday speech when my lungs seized up. I reached for my inhaler on the coffee table, but mom snatched it away. Vanessa, does Ellie need this? My twin didn't even look up from her phone. She used it at lunch. She fine. You heard your sister. Mom dropped my inhaler in her purse. No attention seeking today. It's Vanessa's sweet 16th. The rule had been in place since we were 12. The day I faked pneumonia during Vanessa's ballet recital. I hadn't faked it, but Vanessa said I had, so that became the truth. From then on, every headache, every fever, every asthma attack had to be verified by the golden twin. Can't breathe. The wheeze was starting. That whistling sound my doctor called your body's alarm bell. Ellie! Dad's voice boomed from the door way. What do we do when you claim you're sick? I knew the script. Ask Vanessa first. And what did Vanessa say? Vanessa finally looked up, annoyed. I said, she's fine. Gosh, Ellie, do you have to make my day about you? My chest was tightening like someone was sitting on it. Spread out like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. Please! I gasped. Need hospital, mom! Vanessa whined. She's doing it again. Make her stop! Mom rushed to comfort Vanessa. Don't worry, Sweetie! Ellie, go to your room if you're going to act like this. The modelling scout will be here soon. I tried to stand, but had to grip the couch. My fingernails were starting to tinge blue. Look! I held up my hands. Vanessa laughed. She probably painted them blue. Remember when she faked passing out at my recital? I hadn't faked it. I had an asthma attack. But Vanessa told everyone I was jealous. So my parents refused to leave her performance. The doorbell rang. Party guests started to arrive. Ellie, disappear! Dad ordered. Vanessa's modelling scout is coming. We don't need you wheezing in the background. I couldn't move. My lungs were working overtime through my shirt. Every breath was a battle I was losing. Mom, please! I need hospital! Vanessa! Mom called out sweetly, your sister's asking for the hospital. What do you think, Vanessa? She stood directly in front of me, blocking my parents view for a second. I saw something flicker in her eyes. She's faking! Vanessa announced loudly. She's just mad Ted's coming. Ted? My childhood friend who Vanessa stole just because she could. I knew it! Mom shouted, Ellie, stop this immediately! That's when I started coughing blood. Vanessa's best friend, Jenny walked in and froze. Oh my gosh! What's wrong with Ellie? Nothing, Vanessa said quickly. She's being dramatic, Vanessa. She's coughing blood! No, they're not! Vanessa stepped in front of me again. Everything's perfect. Go help with decorations. But Jenny was Premed. She pushed past Vanessa and grabbed my wrist. Her pulse is racing. This is a medical emergency. We don't do medical emergencies without Vanessa's approval. Dad said like it was totally normal. House rules. What? Jenny looked horrified. Vanessa knows Ellie best, mom explained. She can tell when Ellie's really sick. Versus performing. Performing? Jenny was already dialling 9 1 1. She's in respiratory failure. Give me that phone!

My grandmother told me stop renting apartments and buy the worst house in the best neighborhood you can afford. Fix it up yourself and you'll thank me in 20 years. When I was 24, I just got my first real job as a nurse and was looking at nice rental apartments. Everyone my age was living in trendy downtown lofts, showing off their granite countertops and gym amenities. But grandma pulled me aside at Sunday dinner and made me drive with her through this expensive neighborhood I'd never considered. She pointed at this tiny rundown house with peeling paint and an overgrown yard that I saw has been on the market for eight months. She said nobody wants it because it looks terrible next to these million dollar homes, but the bones are good and you can't fake location. I looked at her like she was crazy. The house was hideous, broken shutters, dead lawn, probably needed everything redone. Grandma, I don't know how to fix houses. I barely know how to change a light bulb. She laughed. I didn't know how to raise four kids until I had them. You learn by doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks. I toured shiny rental apartments with my friends. Finally, I called a realtor and looked at Grandma's ugly house. It was worse inside, carpet from the 1970s, pink bathroom tile, kitchen cabinets that looked like they belonged in a Trailer. But it was in the best school district in the city, walking distance to parks and surrounded by houses worth 10 times more. I put in an offer, $40,000 below asking price. Accepted immediately, my friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they'd show off their modern amenities while roasting my dump. One friend said I could never live somewhere that embarrassing. What if I brought a date home to that disaster? Another kept joking that I was living in the neighborhood crack house. They brag about their rooftop pools and doorman, then ask if my house had running water yet. I'll admit pulling up next to their luxury buildings in my beat up Honda, I wondered if grandma was wrong. But then, and I'd remember her saying, pretty apartments make you a renter forever. Ugly houses make you wealthy. For three years, I spent every weekend at Home Depot learning to do everything myself. You two became my construction university. I love and drywall, plumbing, electrical work, landscaping, whatever needed fixing. My social life basically ended because everyone assumed I was too broke to go out. While my friends were posting Instagram stories from expensive restaurants, I was covered in paint trying to make my house livable. Slowly, I started recognizing what good bones actually meant. The foundation was solid. The roof just needed new shingles. The plumbing was old but function most importantly, three more houses on my street sold to young families willing To renovate, and property values started climbing fast. The neighborhood was gentrifying, exactly like grandma predicted. Coffee shops opened, new restaurants moved in. The elementary school got renovated and started winning awards. Then the pandemic hit and everything changed suddenly.

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and dreaming. They genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes, and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off and college was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day. Sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise we had zero relationship. Last month my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed, actually laughed, said my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

I was driving out of my gated community when this lady jumped off the curb right in front of my car. She was screaming and waving her arms like she was directing airplane traffic. I slammed my brakes and coffee went everywhere. She rushed to my window, demanding to know if I lived there. Her face was red and spit flew as she yelled about watching me drive through her neighborhood. Her husband jogged over, looking mortified in his cargo shorts and polo shirt. Karen, please, he said, grabbing her elbow. This is our neighbor from the Blue house. She shook him off and demanded my driver's license like she was neighborhood security. Her pom pom slippers made her authority act even more ridiculous. Instead of getting mad, I just started laughing. You know what, come over for drinks this afternoon. Let's get to know each other better as neighbors. The husband's jaw dropped. That's, that's very kind of you. Karen kept sputtering about documentation while her husband. I dragged her away, apologizing. I drove home sticky with coffee, but oddly amused by the whole thing. Four hours later, I walked to their house carrying red and white wine. Mitchell answered, looking shocked. I actually came behind him, Karen shrieked. Absolutely not. From their living room, Mitchell's face went crimson as he stood in the doorway doing that awkward shuffle. I'm so sorry she's, she's not feeling social, but maybe I could stop by Your place in an hour. I shrugged and walked home. Sure enough, an hour later, Mitchell knocked, carrying a six pack. We sat on my porch and he practically collapsed into a chair. I'm really sorry about this morning. Karen's been getting worse lately. She watches the neighborhood Facebook page like it's her job. We cracked open beers and talked. Mitchell was a software engineer who worked from home and seemed desperate for normal conversation. We discovered we both loved craft beer and hated the HOA rules. After his third beer, he admitted Karen had called the police on three other neighbors this month alone. I keep telling her she's going to get us sued, but she thinks she's protecting property values, he said, miserably. We ordered pizza and moved inside to watch the game. Mitchell relaxed for the first time all day. He kept thanking me for being understanding and not filing a complaint about the morning incident. You know what's crazy, Mitchell said during halftime. In 23 years of marriage, this is the first time I've just hung out with a friend without asking permission. We were laughing about the HOA's latest ridiculous rule about grass height when Mitchell's phone started buzzing. He ignored it. Then it rang and rang and rang. Maybe you should answer, I suggested. Mitchell shook his head. She's probably calling to demand I come home. For once, I'm going to enjoy my evening. His phone finally stopped. We high fived and opened another Beer, the third quarter had just started when I noticed something odd. A car had driven past my house three times, then another. They were moving slowly like they were looking for addresses. Hey, hey, Mitchell, does Karen know my exact house number? No. Why? That's when we heard the sirens. Not just 1 or 2, but what sounded like every cop car in the county. The noise got louder and louder until red and blue lights were flashing through every window. I peeked through the blinds and my blood went cold. Multiple police cars had surrounded my house. Officers were taking positions behind their vehicles with weapons drawn. More cars kept arriving. I could see officers moving through my backyard. They had the whole property surrounded. Oh, my god, Mitchell whispered, looking through another window. What did she tell them? In my driveway, I can see Karen talking animatedly to what looked like a police captain. She was gesturing wildly at my house and I could see her mouth forming words that looked like dangerous and hostile. Even from here, her pom pom slippers looked ridiculous against the severity of what was happening. A megaphone crackled to life. This is the police. We have the house completely surrounded. We know you're in there. Mitchell and I looked at each other in terror. Whatever Karen had told them, it was clearly more than just my husband is watching football. The tactical positions the officers were taking suggested they thought something Serious was happening inside. Should I go out there? Mitchell asked, his face pale. Wait, I said, let me think. If she, if I tell them you're in danger and you walk out, fine, they'll know she lied. But if they think I'm dangerous, the megaphone crackled again. You have 30 seconds to respond before we escalate. Release the hostage immediately. Hostage, she told them Mitchell was a hostage. My hands started shaking as I realized how bad this could get. At one wrong move and this could end with me dead on my own living room floor. Mitchell reached for the door handle, but I grabbed his arm. Outside I could hear more sirens approaching. Whatever happened next would happen fast. Through the window, I saw an officer with s W. A. T. Gear arriving on scene. The megaphone counted down 20 seconds. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe. Mitchell looked at me with panic in his eyes as we both realized Karen might have finally gone too far. 10 seconds. Full story link below.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever, she makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realised immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realise. She just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realise she's literally sitting. They're refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 and a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses the client. Client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps, Women's Health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in.

The principal stops reading my college rejection letter, my third one this week, and looks up at me. Your GPA is excellent, she reads, frowning at her screen. But it says here you have zero extracurriculars. I explained to her that I stay after school every day to help other students, but the principal frowns, saying, the activities log shows you've never joined a single club or done even an hour of community service. I tell her I'm literally in room 2:03 until 6:30 p m. Every day, sometimes until 9 during playoffs. Just ask Mister Hayes. She pulls up security footage on her computer, and there I am in room 2:03 with five varsity football players, including our state champion quarterback, writing five different essays while they're on their phones. The principal's face goes white as she asks me, you're doing their homework? I'm confused. I explained to her that Mister Hayes says it's pure tutoring for my college application, but she types something into her laptop and turns the screen toward me, saying, there's no record of any tutoring program in our system. My mouth goes dry, and I feel my stomach drop through the floor because I've been doing this for three years, every single day after school, all while Mister Hayes told me Harvard loves students who help athletes succeed. However, I can only assume Harvard doesn't love students who do athletes homework for Them. The principal calls in the guidance counselor, who pulls my record, saying, you've missed every college prep meeting. I explained that Mister Hayes said the tutoring was more important. The counselor's fingers freeze over the keyboard. The counselor asks, did you write your own college essays yet? And I tell them that I started them, but Mister Hayes said they needed editing. He asked me if he edited them, and I admit no. He said I should focus on helping the team first. The counselor's face goes pale, and she grips the edge of the desk as she says, you missed your own deadline, helping others meet theirs. But I defend him, my voice getting smaller, saying, Mister Hayes says the team brings in thousands of dollars to the school, and my grades are good enough as is. I should help those who have a lower chance of success. The principal shakes her head, and something in her eyes makes my chest tight as she says, your grades are excellent, but colleges rejected you because you're a ghost with no activities, no personality, no recommendations that aren't about how helpful you are to others, just grades. When it hits me like a punch to the stomach, I realized I spent so much time writing everyone else's story, I forgot to write my own. Mr. Hayes freezes in the doorway when he sees us, his coffee cup halfway to his lips, and he tries to turn around and leave, but The principal calls him in. Ask

So I made sure he found out on Father's Day that he was right. When mom married Eric, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was three, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike, and never missed my school plays. But everything changed when my half brother, Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly. When he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's Future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through Mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate. Under father, it listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who'd abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking first you can and speaking. Hi, I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god! He interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks well. I never stopped looking, showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks. Mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful, and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret. While planning my revenge, Pierce helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived, and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

My daughter's 4th grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin, just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an er nurse at Mercy General and I was working the three PM shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something, I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained when We draw blood with these. It never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and check the publication date, 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation.

When she claimed he was too drunk to see his daughter, her lawyer's confident smirk started melting. Then came the kicker. He pulled out his phone and here's security footage from my apartment building. The video was crystal clear. Time stamp showed 2:00am, three days before the hearing. There was his ex wife. You. Using a spare key to enter his apartment. She had a grocery bag full of beer bottles, the exact same brands from her photos, placing them strategically around the living room, even staging one near a children's book. The courtroom went dead silent. Her lawyer started shoving papers into his briefcase like the building was on fire. But he wasn't done. Second video showed her coaching their daughter in the parking lot after visitation. Remember, tell Mommy if daddy's house smells like the yucky stuff. Can you say daddy was sleeping when you needed him? Practice your sad face. The little girl nodding innocently, not understanding she was being weaponized. Judge's face went from sympathetic to furious in seconds. Custody awarded to father effective immediately. Supervised visitation only for mother pending psychological evaluation. Three months later, she lost visitation rights entirely when two more recording surfaced. One of her calling his workplace, pretending to be a concerned citizen, reporting him drunk. Another of her paying the elderly neighbor $200 and a script to memorize. The neighbor felt so guilty after seeing the little Girl crying that she confessed everything. The ex wife got charged with perjury, filing false reports, witness tampering and harassment. Dad got full custody back, child support and legal fees covered. Her lawyer dropped her and reported her to the state bar for fraud. Last I heard, that little girl's thriving with her father. She's in soccer now, on a roll at school and lights up whenever someone mentions her daddy. He brings her to court sometimes for routine paperwork and she always waves at me from across the lobby. Some victories just hit different when you see justice served to someone who truly deserves it.

Court clerk for eight years. This divorced dad was fighting for custody of his six year old daughter. His ex wife claimed he was an alcoholic who endangered their kid. She came prepared for war, had photos of beer bottles scattered around his house, testimony from three neighbours about loud parties and even a police report about a disturbance at his address. Her lawyer was this slick eye in a three thousand dollar suit who'd clearly done his homework. The evidence looked damning. Photos showed empty bottles everywhere, kitchen counter, coffee table, bathroom sink, even one in the kids toy box next to her stuffed bunny. The neighbours swore they'd seen him stumbling around drunk at two PM on weekdays, music blasting at all hours. One elderly neighbour claimed she'd called C P. S twice because the little girl looked neglected and scared. Her lawyer painted him as a complete deadbeat, said he missed scheduled visitations because he was too drunk to drive. Claimed the daughter came home crying, talking about daddy's angry voice, how the house smelled like yucky medicine. The guy sat there quietly throughout the whole character assassination. No fancy suit, just wrinkled khakis and a polo shirt, clutching a Manila folder like his life depended on it. I've seen plenty of custody battles and this one looked over before it started. The judge was taking detailed notes, nodding along with the ex wife's testimony. She Was crying at all the right moments, playing the devastated mother perfectly. Even I was starting to feel sorry for her. Judge looked ready to rule against him. When he finally asked to speak, his voice was shaky. Nervous. Your honor, when exactly did she say I missed those visits? October 15th, 22nd and 29th. The ex wife replied confidently, having her eyes with a tissue. He opened his folder with trembling hands. Here's my work schedule from the fire station. I'm a paramedic. I was saving lives. Those exact dates, 24 hour shifts, two car accidents and a heart attack on the 15th. Apartment fire on the 22nd, three car pile up on the 29th. The paperwork was official.

My sister Simone and I used to finish each other's sentences. We had that weird twin thing where we'd show up wearing the same colour without planning it. People thought it was cute. I thought we'd be close forever. We grew up at our grandparents place after our parents died in a crash when we were 7. Grandpa Roy raised us. He was the type who'd make pancakes every Sunday and let us stay up late watching old game shows. He always told us we were equals. When he turned 70, he sat us both down at the kitchen table and said, when I'm gone, you girls split everything 50. 50. That's final. I moved to Portland when I was 26, got married, had two kids. Life got busy. I called Grandpa twice a week, visited every few months. It wasn't perfect, but I tried. Simone stayed local. She lived 20 minutes from him and helped with groceries and doctor appointments. When Grandpa died last March, I flew in the next day. The funeral was small. Simone barely looked at me. I figured she was just grieving. Then came the will reading. The lawyer, this older guy named Mister Hoffman, opened the folder and started reading. House to Simone, savings to Simone, the pension he'd been collecting all Simone. I sat there like I'd been slapped. Wait, what about me? Hoffman looked uncomfortable. There's no provision for you in the current Will, which was updated 14 months ago. I turned to Simone. She wasn't even surprised. She was staring at her hands. This has to be a mistake, I said. Grandpa always said 50, 50. Simone finally looked up. Her voice was flat. He changed his mind. You weren't around. I was the one taking him to chemo appointments and cleaning his house and cooking his meals while you were busy in Portland. I called him all the time. I visited when I could. I have two little kids, Simone. Exactly. You chose them. I chose him. He rewarded loyalty. I felt sick. So you're just taking everything. We're twins. He raised us the same. She stood up. The will is legal. It's done. I couldn't believe it. This was my sister. We used to build pillow forts and share secrets and cry together when we missed our parents. Now she was looking at me like I was a stranger.

She seemed fine with it at the time, yet here we were the night before my party and she'd forgotten that crucial detail. I typed back, sorry, Ellen, no kids allowed. Remember what happened last year? My apartment still hasn't recovered. Her response appeared instantly. They were just being children. Besides, I already bought their costumes and told them they're going to Aunt Katie's spooky party. You wouldn't disappoint kids on Halloween, would you? That's just cruel. Actually, I would. And I wasn't about to let emotional manipulation ruin another Halloween. Instead of arguing further, I had a better idea. My neighbour, Mike, works as a professional clown for children's parties. But here's the thing about Mike. He's 6 4, covered in tattoos and has this naturally intense stare. Kids are terrified of him. Despite his best efforts to be friendly, I called Mike and explained my situation. He laughed and agreed to help for $200 and unlimited access to my Halloween punch. Next evening, as my adult guests began arriving, Mike took up his position on my front porch. He wore his standard clown costume but with blood splatters added to his white makeup and carried a sign that read, adults only party. Children will be entertained by me on the porch. At exactly seven thirty PM, Ellen's minivan pulled into my driveway. I watched through the window as she parked and started unloading her vampire twins. Then she spotted Mike sitting eerily still on My porch swing, slowly twisting a balloon animal while staring directly at her car. The look on her face was priceless. She frantically rolled up the car windows and locked the doors. The twins were pressing their faces against the glass, their vampire makeup now streaked with tears. Ellen reversed so quickly she knocked over my mailbox in her escape. My phone lit up with a furious text. What kind of sick joke is this? I simply replied, adults only means adults only. Enjoy your evening. The party was perfect. No broken heirlooms, no emergency vet visits and not a single fish was harmed. Mike turned out to be the hit of the party. He makes incredible balloon martini glasses. Ellen hasn't spoken to me since, but several family members have thanked me privately. Apparently, I'm not the first victim of her. Kids will be kids parenting style.

What kind of vegetables taste this good? My wife and I are dying. Trying not to laugh, the nurse whispers, should I tell her? I shake my head frantically. Jade finishes the entire cup and asks for more. This magical vegetable juice is healing my soul. I can feel the plants giving me their energy. She drank three more cups before the anesthesia wore off. When she finally came to her senses, she looked at the empty cups and asked, what was that amazing broth? The nurse, trying to keep a straight face, said, it was, um, special healing broth. I knew it. I could taste the life force. Vegetables are so generous. We never told her the truth about her magical vegetable juice. But the real comedy came during her second chemo session. Jade was so nauseous she couldn't keep anything down. The hospital served her this sad piece, some grilled chicken. Jade stared at it for 10 minutes. Then she looked at me and whispered, dad, I think the chicken is judging me. Honey, it's dead. It can't judge you. But what if its spirit is watching? What if there's a chicken afterlife and I'm about to commit a hate crime? Finally, she picks up the fork, closes her eyes and takes a tiny bite. Then she opens her eyes wide and goes, oh, my god, what it tastes like that magical healing Broth from surgery. Why didn't anyone tell me this could taste this good? She devoured the entire piece in about 30 seconds, then immediately started crying. I'm a hypocrite. I'm carnivore. I'm everything I hate. The chickens will never forgive me. The nurse walked in during this breakdown and Jade grabbed her arm. I ate a chicken. I'm a monster. Do you think it had a family? The nurse, bless her heart, just patted Jade's hand and said, honey, that chicken lived its best life so you could live yours. Jade sobbed harder. That's the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me. Three months later, Jade's in remission. She's still mostly vegan, but now she eats what she calls medical meat twice a week. She convinced the animals are sacrificing themselves for her health. Last week, she was eating a Turkey sandwich and suddenly stopped mid bite. Thank you, Turkey. Your death was not in vain. Now she refers to me and my wife as her protein dealers and asks us to handle the dirty work. While she maintains plausible denial ability, she still doesn't know about the magical vegetable juice incident.

My 17 year old daughter Jade has been vegan for 3 years and I mean aggressively vegan. She once broke up with a guy because he ate a cheeseburger on their date. She named our chickens so we couldn't eat eggs. Last month, Jade got diagnosed with leukemia. The oncologist, doctor Gabe, is this serious no nonsense guy. He sits us down and says very gravely, Jade needs to increase her protein intake immediately. Her body needs complete proteins to handle chemotherapy. Jade crosses her arms. I'm not eating animals. Find another way, Doctor Gay blinks. Jade, this is life or death. You need at least eight e grams of protein daily. Then I'll die with a clear conscience. The next week was like a sitcom from hell. My wife tried sneaking chicken broth into Jade's soup. Jade took one sip, spit it out and yelled, mom, this tastes like blood. I attempted hiding ground Turkey in her spaghetti sauce. She took one bite, ran to the bathroom and came back with a toothbrush. I need to scrub the death from my mouth. We brought in a nutritionist who suggested protein powder. Jade screamed, way protein? That's cow juice powder. You're trying to turn me into a dairy vampire. By week two, Jade had lost eight pounds and Doctor Gabe was getting desperate. He tried reasoning with her. Jade, even plants want to live. You're still ending life. Jade gasped dramatically. Did you just compare a carrot to a cow? A carrot doesn't have feelings, Doctor Gabe, how do you know? Because carrots don't have faces. Then my wife had this brilliant idea. She went to this fancy vegan restaurant and explained the situation. The chef created these protein shakes that looked like green smoothies but were packed with he protein, hemp hearts and spirulina. He drank them religiously, calling them her life force elixirs. Her protein levels shot up. But here's where it gets absolutely hilarious. Jade needed a minor surgery to insert her chemo port. When she woke up from anesthesia, she was completely loopy. The nurse brought her some chicken broth to help with nausea. Still high as a.

My cousin Ellen texted me last night at 11 p m. The kids are so excited to be vampires at your party tomorrow. I nearly dropped my phone. I never invited her kids. Not after what happened last year. For context, I've hosted an elaborate Halloween party for the past five years. It's my. I think I spent months planning the decorations, curating the perfect playlist, and mixing signature cocktails. My friends look forward to it all year. Last October, Ellen called me crying because her babysitter canceled last minute. Please, I haven't been out in months. Twins will behave, I promise. They're better now. Against my better judgment, I said yes. I mean, how bad could a couple of seven year olds be? Catastrophic. As it turns out, within 20 minutes of arriving, they were running laps around my apartment. Ellen just sipped her drink and chatted, completely oblivious. The first disaster happened when they decided to play hot lava and jumped from my couch to my antique coffee table. The table, a 2 hundred year old family heirloom my grandmother left me, collapsed under their weight. Ellen barely looked up. Kids will be kids, he shrugged. An hour later, I found them in my bedroom dumping out my makeup collection onto my white bedspread. We're doing monster makeup, they announced, proudly covered in my fifty dollar foundation. While I was Cleaning up the makeup disaster, they somehow got into the Halloween candy I had set aside for trick or treaters. They not only devoured most of it, but also fed several chocolate bars to my dog, pepper. By midnight, pepper was violently ill. I had to leave my own party to rush her to the emergency vet. The Bill? $600. When I returned home at 3:00am, exhausted and worried about pepper, I discovered one of the twins had gotten sick and vomited directly into my fish tank. My surprise Betta fish, the one I'd raised from a tiny fry, was floating at the top the next morning. Ellen's response to all this destruction. They were over tired. You shouldn't have so many breakable things if you're going to invite children. I didn't invite children. She invited them. So this year, I sent beautifully designed invitations with adults only written in bold Gothic lettering at the top. I even called Ellen specifically to

I'll keep it brief. She promised just three simple questions. He leaned back, clearly amused. Go ahead. When exactly did you purchase that Mercedes? She asked. Three weeks before the storm, he answered proudly. Custom ordered from Germany, she nodded. And what was its purchase value? $94,000, he dated confidently, as our evidence shows. One last question, she said steadily. What was your insurance deductible on that vehicle? The businessman's face fell. I don't recall exactly. Missus Peterson turned and made her way back to her table. She opened her folder and withdrew a document which she handed to the judge. This is a copy of Mister Harrington's insurance claim filed the morning after the storm. She explained quietly. He listed the car's value at $38,000 and received full compensation minus his $500 deductible. The insurance company has confirmed this in writing. The silence in that courtroom was deafening. From her folder, she produced emails between the businessman and three tree removal companies, all dated the week before the storm. These weren't requests to remove her tree, but inquiry specifically about insurance coverage for storm damage. The businessman started the protest, but Mrs. Peterson had saved her most damning evidence for last, presented security footage from the businessman's own camera showing him dragging additional branches onto his already damaged Mercedes the morning after the storm. This footage is time stamped 6:00am, approximately four hours after the tree fell. She explained, my grandson works in Digital security and helped me request these records legally. Judge Reynolds reviewed everything. In silence, the businessman and his attorneys whispered frantically among themselves. Finally, the judge looked up. Case dismissed, he announced firmly. Furthermore, I'm referring this matter to the district attorney for investigation of potential insurance fraud. As the businessman stormed out, Mrs. Peterson gathered her folder in Kane. I helped her down the courthouse steps afterward and she told me she'd lived next to that horrible man for 12 years. Sometimes, she said with a small smile, people think being old means being helpless. That's their mistake. I later heard the businessman faced insurance fraud charges and was ordered to pay Missus Peterson's legal costs. The elderly woman walked away with her dignity intact and a story that taught everyone in that courtroom a powerful lesson about underestimating people.

I was a bailiff for 15 years and saw one that still gives me chills. This wealthy businessman sued his elderly neighbour for property damage after her oak tree fell during a storm, crushing his Mercedes. He walked in like he owned the courthouse, tailored suit, gold watch flashing under the lights, flanked by two attorneys carrying matching leather briefcases. Kind of legal team you assemble when you're not just trying to win but trying to bulldoze someone. Mrs. Peterson, the defendant, shuffled in alone, 76 years old, barely 5 feet tall with thinning white hair and hands gnarled from arthritis. All she carried was a weathered Manila folder and the wooden cane she needed to walk. Judge Reynolds called the court to order and the businessman's attorney launched into their presentation. It seemed airtight. Your honor, our evidence clearly demonstrates Missus Peterson's negligence. The attorney began displaying photographs of the destroyed Mercedes. The damage was extensive. The massive oak had completely flattened the luxury car's roof. They called an arborist to testify. The tree was obviously diseased and structurally compromised for years. He pointed to cross sections showing internal decay. Any responsible property owner would have addressed this hazard long ago. The plaintiff's team presented maintenance estimates totaling 167,000, $84,000 for the total loss Mercedes, $43,000 for damage to a decorative stone wall and $30,000 for emotional distress. When the businessman took a stand, he spoke with the Confidence of someone unaccustomed to being questioned. I warned Mrs. Peterson about that hazardous tree at least five times, he testified. I even offered to split the cost of removal, but she refused. Now she claims she can't afford to pay for her negligence. But that's not my problem. Throughout this entire presentation, Missus Peterson said nothing. She just sat quietly, occasionally taking careful notes with shaking hands. I remember thinking how hopeless her situation looked. No lawyer, no expert witnesses, just an elderly woman against a legal steamroller. When her turn came, she slowly rose to her feet, leaning on her cane. The businessman smirked as she shuffled toward the witness stand. The courtroom was silent. Everyone expected a rambling plea for mercy. But Missus Peterson surprised us all. Her voice was soft but clear as she asked if she could question the plaintiff, if directly.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center, the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She, she was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I to my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My coach told me that they were not bringing me in for the next season. What he didn't mention was that I'd been his starting point guard for three years, team captain since junior year. My whole future depended on those three games. I even got my Jersey number tattooed on my shoulder. 23, the same number my dad wore when he played. But when Coach Miller called me into his office that Monday morning, he couldn't even look me in the eye. Just stared at his desk, shuffling the same papers over and over, clicking his pen repeatedly, like he always did when he was nervous. My nephew Keith, just transferred from Preston Prep. He needs stability right now. I just nodded quietly, even though my chest felt like it was caving in. Whatever's best for the team, I said. He seemed shocked I wasn't arguing. Probably expected me to beg, maybe cry, like Johnson did when he got cut last year. Instead, I cleaned out my locker in complete silence, folded my practice gear with the same precision I used for my pregame rituals. My Jersey hanging on the hook, the one with the captain's patch my mom had sewn on herself. Keith was already in the gym, wearing my number, running my plays, using my parking spot. That afternoon, I drove across town to our biggest rival school, hands shaking the whole way. Their star player had just torn his knee at a party trying to dunk on a lowered rim. Coach Thompson nearly fell over when I walked in. You serious? He asked, already reaching for transfer paperwork before I even finished explaining. Two days later, I was practicing with my new team, wearing No.. 5 because my number was already taken. Strange faces, different plays, but hungry eyes that reminded me why I loved basketball. First game in the new uniform, I played the best game of my life against the defending state champions. The same team that had destroyed us.

When I was 11, I started noticing this weird thing. Whenever someone lied to me, my tongue would tingle, like when you lick a battery. The first time it happened was at school when my friend Mia said she didn't take my pencil. My tongue buzzed like crazy, and later I found it in her desk. I thought it was just in my head, but it kept happening. In middle school, when kids said they didn't copy my homework. Buzz. When they claimed they weren't talking about me behind my back. Buzz. By eighth grade, I realised I had some kind of superpower. But it freaked me out. I stopped shaking hands with people because what if they were lying about something and I could taste it? I stopped eating at potluck because what if someone lied about washing their hands? My classmates already thought I was weird, so I never told anyone. But my gift made me unbeatable at group projects and friend drama. People thought I just had really good instincts about people. I didn't correct them. Then junior year happened and everything changed. My mom had been dating this guy, Trevor, for about six months. He was one of those smooth talkers who remembered everyone's birthday and always brought flowers. Mom was totally smitten. But every single time Trevor opened his mouth around me, my tongue went fuzzy. Not just a little tingle, but full on electric. Shock mode when he said he loved spending time with our family. Buzz when he complimented my mom's cooking. Buzz when he claimed he was just looking out for us. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The guy was a walking lie detector nightmare. I tried telling my mom about my bad vibes, but she brushed it off as teenage attitude. She said I was just protective and needed to give him a chance. But I knew something was wrong. One afternoon, I came home early from school and caught Trevor in my room. He was holding my tablet, scrolling through it like he owned the place. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed. Hey, kiddo, just checking this for viruses, he said with that fake smile. Your mom asked me to make sure you're staying safe online. My tongue practically exploded. The buzzing was so intense, I could barely think straight. He was lying through his teeth. My mom would never ask you to do that, I said. He shrugged. She worries about you. You know how moms are. More buzzing. I grabbed my tablet from him and told my mom everything when she got home. But Trevor had already spun some story about me being disrespectful and trying to cause problems in their relationship. Mom took his side. That's when I decided to set a trap. I left my tap

I hired him at my construction company and watched him work for three months without him knowing I was her father. My daughter, Sophia, started dating this guy, Ethan, about eight months ago. Seemed like a decent kid. Said he was looking for work in construction since he'd moved to town. Sophia mentioned he had experience with roofing and electrical work. She kept asking if my company was hiring. I run a construction business with about 20 guys. We were looking for someone with his skills. But something made me wanna test this guy. Before mixing family with business, I told Sophia we weren't hiring. Then I had my form and post a job listing online. Ethan applied within two days. His resume looked good, five years experience, solid references, willing to start an entry level. I decided to interview him personally but never mentioned I was Sophia's dad. Just introduced myself as the owner. Ethan had no idea who I was. Sophia always called me dad around him. During the interview, Ethan seemed genuine, talked about wanting stable work, supporting his girlfriend through nursing school. He answered technical questions well. I hired him on the spot. For the first month, Ethan was exactly what you'd want. Showed up early, Ayed late, helped other guys with projects, never complained about hard jobs. The crew liked him. He was respectful to everyone. But I noticed he treated some people differently when he thought I wasn't around. I started paying closer attention. Ethan would make jokes about the his panic workers when they didn't understand English perfectly, called them lazy behind their backs, said they were taking jobs from real Americans. This bothered me since half my crew speak Spanish as their first language. One day, I overheard Ethan talking to another new guy during lunch. He was bragging about his.

This is two year old Kaimir Jones of Michigan. This is his mother, Adriana Jones. On October 4th, she took her son to Stacy Cobb's home. Stacy was a well recommended babysitter in the area. This isn't the first time that she had taken Chimera there while she was at work. A motherly intuition kicked in that something was wrong on this day because usually her and Stacy would communicate about how Chimera was doing during the day. On this day, three hours had gone by and there was no response from the babysitter. Adriana decided to leave work and go check on her son at the babysitter's house. To her shock, when she got there, tons of police were already there. Premier's mother walked into a horrific scene where she had to see her son mauled by this babysitter's dogs. He had lost his life. What's even worse is that she says that the police didn't even call her and try to let her know. This is how she found out. Adriana made a gofundme, which I'm going to link in my bio. In some news articles, it tells you that the babysitter said that she just went to take a nap. We're going to share what Adriana did, and this is all alleged per camera footage. She says that her son was not being watched by the babysitter. He was left alone for up to two hours. While she was allegedly unconscious on the floor due to substance abuse. Eventually, you see Chaimir unlocking the door to go outside, where there were two pitbulls. These dogs ended up mauling him to death. And then you can see what else she said about how this situation took place hours before she even knew about it. And she wasn't called. She had to walk into this scene, just watching everybody take. Take pictures of what was going on. Now, Stacy alleges that she took a nap and that she thought that Chaimer was taking a nap as well. She has been charged with second degree unaliving

Sam, this is John Sheptock. He was born with no arms and one of his legs shorter than the other. He's associated with the First Montgomery Church. He's known as an inspiration for dealing with the adversities of his disability. He's also known for going to prisons and speaking and preaching there, as well as singing. All of this came to a halt, however, on September 29th of this year, 2025, when he was arrested for distributing child porn, which we're going to call it like it really is, which is. See, Sam, he was found and arrested while he was ministering to prison inmates at the time. Some of his accusations include gaining access to a teenager's icloud account, stealing private photos, and then attempting to coerce her into sending more explicit images. Also showed the same victim nude photos of underage girls. Following his arrest, the church immediately made a statement saying John had been arrested on these charges and that they removed him from all responsibilities at the church. October 7th, they also put out another statement with a new allegation against John from an adult connected to the church. When there's one rat, there's usually 50 more. So there's no telling what else is going to come out in this case. But why am I increasingly not surprised at the types of cases of judges, people in authority, politics, churches, schools, that Are doing this kind of stuff

Please take a wild guess at what you think this woman did as she just sits here chewing her gum. This is Shanda Vander Ark who is currently on trial for the passing of her 15 year old child that was found weighing 69 pounds surrounded by soiled adult diapers. His passing was determined to be from malnutrition and signs of hypothermia. So how does that happen in a home where everyone else is totally okay? Let's go over the last 24 hours of hell that Timothy Ferguson, her son, had to go through at the hands of Shonda and her other son, Paul Ferguson. The day before Timothy's passing, Paul made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with some eggs, which is a gourmet meal compared to what he was normally fed, bread with hot sauce on it. Timothy was having a very difficult time waking up. So Shonda tells Paul, give him an ice bath. So Paul monitors Timothy in the bath for the first half of the day. Shonda had recently passed the bar and was working at a courthouse, so he had to watch him. Shonda even had Paul make him pizza rolls to hold in front of him. And when he would reach out for it, he would pull it away from him. And later on in the day, Shonda takes over. Timothy spends nine hours, nine hours in this bath. The following Morning, she finds out that Timothy is not breathing and she tells Paul, I don't want to call 9 1 1. She waits 20 minutes and finally decides to call. She tells a 9 1 1 operator to hold on a minute. She needs to get Timothy out of the bed. But Timothy wasn't laying in a bed. He didn't even have a bed. He slept on a closet floor on a blue tarp. Timothy had nothing on but an adult diaper. So she has Paul get him dressed to be presentable for the cops. The police arrive and she already has a story that Timothy was on a hunger strike because of all the life stress that they currently had. Her husband earlier in the year had had a stroke and because they had stairs, he had to move in with his parents because he just physically could not live in that home. So now she's having to do everything by herself. She had to go to law school by herself and pass the bar by herself. And now she has a job and she's taking care of everything by herself and she's exhausted. When the police get there, they immediately notice how frail and thin Timothy is. They also notice police grade leg cuffs, that there's hot sauce in the bathroom and that all the food sources in the house are locked up and there are cameras everywhere. There was even a motion sensor camera in the bathroom. There was no privacy in this home.

This guy just found a random rock, painted it red, sprinkled a few coins around it, and boom, a new deity was born. In no time, people were lining up to donate money and pray. Some even bowed down in deep reverence. In just 10 minutes, the pile of coins multiplied by 10 times. While using religion to scam people is nothing new in India. Even this alien dude got totally ripped off. His name is Jack, and he came to earth a year ago in his spaceship to do some research. But as soon as he landed, he got mugged. This old geezer saw Jack's necklace and figured it must be worth a pretty penny. He snatched it right off Jack's neck and then quickly hopped on a train, fading into the distance. This was Bad News Bears. That necklace was actually the remote control for Jack's spaceship. Without it, he was stranded on earth. But since it was his first time here, he didn't know squat. So he started observing. He noticed that everyone was wearing clothes, so he swiped a couple of outfits from a car, thinking he could finally blend in with the crowd. But he couldn't figure out why everyone was laughing at him. It was only after trying on a few different get UPS that he gradually realized clothes were gender specific. Then Jack discovered something else. Pieces of paper with an old dude's picture on Them. Amazingly, you could trade these papers for stuff, and getting your hands on them wasn't too hard. You could snag them from clothes in parked cars, or get them from the blind folks on the overpass. Now that he had food and clothes sorted out, there was still one big problem left. The language barrier. Like, he could see that this one guy's clothes were a bit off, but he couldn't tell him. All he could do was personally help him adjust them. But the dude seemed pretty ticked off. Had Jack messed with his fashion sense. On the way back, a kind hearted driver took Jack in. But Jack kept staring at the driver intensely. Then out of nowhere, he grabbed the guy's hand. The driver was so freaked out, he hit the brakes immediately. The thing is, by holding his hand, Jack was actually trying to acquire language skills, because on his planet, people have this unique ability. Just by holding someone's hand, they can gain all of that person's skills. So will he eventually find his remote control? The name of this hilarious movie is PK the Alien Fool.

Immediately afterward, he felt an irresistible urge to urinate and rushed to the top of the mountain. However, as he relieved himself, the elder nearby was dumbfounded. Not only was it a massive amount of urine, but it also sprayed out at an extremely high angle. Just then, a fire erupted in the valley. This sudden flood instantly extinguished the flames. But the next second, the stream of water suddenly changed direction, striking a giant rock on the Mountain Top that was about to roll down and crush the villagers. The water stream deflected the rock at the last moment, saving everyone. When everyone looked at the source, they were all amazed to discover that this was the doing of a single person. At this point, a widow carefully examined the man's face and immediately ran to tell the entire village. The whole village erupted in excitement. All the women brought out their dowries, eager to marry this man. Before long, they all became pregnant with his children, and the children born inherited his genes, becoming exceptionally strong.

The woman ripped out her own heart. But the man was completely unmoved. Take it. Watching her die with the same coldness he had shown Angie 200 years ago. Angie, a former maid for the Collins family, had a secret affair with him, but Collins ultimately left her to marry an aristocrat. Consumed by jealousy, Angie began her revenge. First, she directed a statue to crush Colin's parents. Then she cursed a lock of his fiance's hair. Under the spell, the fiance walked straight off a cliff. Collins tried to save her, but could only watch his beloved fall to her death. No! Losing both his parents and his lover, Collins was consumed by despair. He jumped off the cliff to die with her, but survived. Crawling on the ground, he wept tears of blood. Angie had already cursed him, transforming him into a vampire condemned to eternal suffering. Angie then commanded the entire town to hunt Colin down, lock him in a coffin, and bury him deep underground. Two centuries later, workers accidentally dug up the coffin, mistaking it for a treasure chest. As they excitedly smashed the chains, Colin suddenly leapt out. Vampire hungry for two centuries, finally had his feast. Collins found Angie seeking revenge, but discovered she was now the town's richest businesswoman and still obsessed with him. Angie used her charm to seduce him, hoping for reconciliation. Collins succumbed to the temptation. The warmth didn't even last for the length of a Cigarette he immediately regretted it and tried to pull away. Angie wore her most glamorous dress to a ball, only to see Collins gently kissing the reincarnation of his former fiance. Heartbroken, Angie cast another spell, sealing Collins away again. Before closing the coffin, she left a piece of her clothing, wanting him to remember her even in his prison. She never imagined a child would later accidentally open the coffin.

But the sniper sitting opposite instantly understood what she was trying to do. Smiling from afar, he thought, it's impossible to see anything from that distance. Using a mirror, he fired again. The mirror shattered into pieces, but Ji Young didn't panic. Staying calm, she attached another mirror and this time raised the broom about 1.5 meters higher. The sniper suspected nothing and pulled the trigger again. But now he had walked right into Geong's trap. By observing the direction of both bullets and using her knowledge of physics, Geong estimated that the sniper was roughly 1,000 meters away and shooting from left to right. She immediately realized that the the upper part of the refrigerator was a blind spot for the sniper. That's when an idea struck her. She climbed onto the fridge and started shifting her position to avoid the next shot. But the sniper grew suspicious of her movements and ordered the driver to move the car forward. The moving curtains caught his eye. He fired again. The bullet didn't hit Jeong, but she fell and got injured. Tasting blood, she started crying, falling backward toward her handgun lying a short distance away. Without wasting time, she flipped the sofa to use it as cover. As soon as the sofa turned over, a sniper rifle hidden underneath, placed there by her uncle, came into view. The defense Had now turned into an attack. Ji Young grabbed the rifle, disengaged the safety, and aimed straight at the sniper. Meanwhile, the sniper was reloading his gun, unaware that the tables had turned. The moment he saw Ji Young aiming him with the rifle, he froze in shock. At that very instant, Gion pulled the trigger. For part 2, like and subscribe and visit my channel!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sink! I've got a white girlfriend, but she almost killed me. We'd only been dating for four months when she said she wanted me to meet her parents. At first they seemed super welcoming, polite, friendly. But pretty soon I started noticing weird shit. They had two black housekeepers. The woman smiled like something straight out of a horror movie. The guy stone cold stared at me like I owed him money. I told my girl I wanted to leave. Right then and there. A bunch of guests started showing up. Apparently it was some annual private party. Everyone who showed up was white and rich. Like, insanely rich. The whole vibe was off. I was the only black person there. They were weirdly hyped to meet me, kept complimenting how strong I looked, how handsome. Something felt off. I pulled out my camera, figured I'd take some pics to chill myself out. Then I saw another black guy. Finally, a familiar face. I rushed over, said, hey, but he looked vacant. His eyes were empty, his body stiff. We barely got a few words in before this old white woman walked up all over him like they were dating. I tried giving him a classic fist bump. He shook my hand instead. I froze. This dude looked black, but everything else about him felt white. I headed back inside, confused as hell. Tried to plug in my phone. Cord was yanked out. That freaky maid popped up without a sound.

His parents were also encouraging him, explaining how to fly. The man raised his arms but could not fly. The man took the advice, took two steps back, and rushed forward with excitement. However, he ultimately failed to turn into Superman. Seeing his failure, he turned and left angrily. On the way, he met a few boys who laughed at him when they saw his costume. The man shouted, I am the real Superman! The boys laughed and said, then fly and show us! The boy held up two fingers and his body actually rose slightly. Seeing this, the children ran away in a panic. At that moment, his parents happened to arrive and were overjoyed to see their son flying. The man was stunned this was actually happening. A moment later, he held up his fingers again and immediately soared into the sky. But he had not yet mastered the correct way to fly. As he flew higher and higher, he accidentally startled a flock of birds and then quickly plunged into the sea. When he surfaced, he asked a passerby in Mallorca. The man realized he was far from home and immediately took off again. Soon, the man fell into another strange place. The person thought he was an alien. The boy quickly asked him for directions and the person pointed the way for him. The boy took off again. His fear had now disappeared. And he enjoyed soaring through the clouds. However, when he landed, several fake Batman and Spider Man suddenly appeared. He started beating the man without a word, thinking he was just a normal person. But the boy punched and the fake hero was thrown far away. Seeing this, the fake Spider Man pulled out a sword. The boy took the opportunity to take off and successfully returned home.

The infected can only tearfully beg for mercy, as if something more terrifying than death lurks within. Yet for the safety of the majority, the crowd still forces them inside with cold resolve. As the heavy stone door slowly closes. No one survives the night inside until the next day, when the gates open once more. Then the swiftest runners would enter, while beyond the high walls lay an endless labyrinth. These runners were the camp's sole hope. Only through the maze maps they charted could the others find a way out. But today felt strangely off. Usually the runners emerged before sunset, yet today their figures remained absent. Some began to speculate. Perhaps they had been slain by the labyrinth's monsters. Each gust of wind whipping through the passage signalled the stone gate's imminent closure. Just as despair threatened to overwhelm them, Mike suddenly pointed toward the labyrinth's steps. There, runner minus staggered toward the exit, carrying the wounded captain on his back. Minus was utterly exhausted, and the gate was closing fast. Mike scrambled through the closing gap. Though he squeezed in, minus couldn't fathom this reckless act. Realizing Mike was new here, minus explained the danger. The captain had been attacked by lurking monsters and was showing signs of infection. Night was falling, and the beasts would soon emerge in full force. Nino wanted to find Cover first. But Mike insisted on hiding the captain. Suddenly, Mike spotted a hanging vine. They could use it to suspend the captain in midair and save his life. Just then, a bone chilling scraping sound echoed. A massive monster appeared. Driven by pure survival instinct.

Mike wondered if the neighbor had returned home. But when he rushed out to check, he found no sign the tape had been removed. If no one was home, where was the noise coming from? As this pattern repeated day after day, Mike gradually sensed something was terribly wrong. Whenever he opened his window, a bloody stench would waft in, making him wretch uncontrollably each time he smelled it. Even stranger, several stray cats always gathered near the neighbor's door, as if awaiting some special feeding. Driven by suspicion, Mike began monitoring his neighbor. Two weeks passed without a single sighting. But just that day, upon returning home from school, he suddenly saw light in his room. Thinking someone had broken in, he rushed upstairs. He searched every corner of the apartment, yet found nothing suspicious. Knowing he couldn't have been mistaken. So he turned off the lights to create the illusion of absence. He waited silently in the darkness. When midnight struck, the sound of chopping meat echoed as punctually as ever. Yet here there was no movement. Just as Mike was about to give up, several stray cats flashed across the window. So disgusted by their unsanitary habit of Defecating anywhere, Mike initially planned to get rid of them, but then an idea struck him. He collected samples in plastic bags and rushed them to a friend for testing that very night. The results, however, left him deeply disappointed. The feline experiment showed no abnormalities whatsoever. Yet Mike refused to lower his guard. Days of torment

The first trapped person was safely rescued onto the boat, and teammates returned to assist the second trapped person. He glanced back to see one final unconscious victim over here. He called for backup from his teammates before rushing to rescue the person. His teammates stripped off his clothes and dove into the water, but the bow railing had been burned through and fallen into the water. The water temperature near him was rising rapidly. Fuel on the sea surface had also pulled together. Again his teammate yanked the steering wheel Yale, using the spray to disperse nearby fuel.

Next, he used the pen tip he'd secretly hidden while signing his prison admission papers to pick the lock on his handcuffs. He then pushed open the window, locked the handcuffs onto it, and used the chain to connect the window to the main door. Finally, he returned to the desk, grabbed a water cup, and hurled it at the door. The reinforcements outside sensed something was wrong and drew their guns. The captain tried to open the door, but couldn't budge. His teammates fetched an iron bar and worked together to pry the door open. The female officer opened her eyes and reacted swiftly. She tried to stop her teammates from opening the door, but it was too late. He stepped forward and covered her mouth. The door swung open, the window shattered. The captain rose, entered the interrogation room, and checked the window. Then he turned, leading the others downstairs to pursue the spy. Leaving only one officer to untie the female officer, the guard closed the police station's main door. They reached the first floor, but found no trace of the suspect. He leapt from the window sill and kicked the lone officer unconscious. Then he grabbed his daughter's birthday cake and fled. Downstairs. Teammates noticed an odd Mark on the captain's neck. The captain surmised it was A drop of blood dripped by the suspect when he leaned out the window. They turned to rush upstairs, but he had already hidden around the corner. The captain rushed back to the interrogation room, where only the female officer remained. He mobilized the entire station, searching every corner of the building. They opened every vehicle trunk, but the suspect was nowhere to be found. The captain issued a full scale search order, deploying everyone inside the station. Yet they still couldn't locate the suspect. The captain stopped the car. The female officer realized only the trunk of the captain's official vehicle had not been searched. She signaled to the captain, who slowly reached for his holstered pistol. In that instant, as a tram approached, the suspect leapt out of the car. Using the tram as cover, he blocked the pursuing officers. He had completely evaded capture.

This guy actually crushed a dragon egg. At first, he didn't care at all. But when he tried to retract his foot, he suddenly heard a dragon's roar from behind. Seeing this, he was terrified. But to my shock, the dragon didn't harm him. Instead, the Silverwing dragon simply toyed with him. This man was named IRF, a rather ungraceful drunkard. No one expected that he actually had Targaryen blood. The Silverwing dragon, highly sensitive, sensed that bloodline and stopped bothering him. It took a few steps back, lowering its proud head. Seeing this, wolf was both surprised and delighted. He never expected that a man like him, who had achieved nothing, could one day become a dragon rider. Excited, he rushed out of the dragon's lair and flew recklessly over King's Landing. By now, the soldiers and citizens below were terrified, thinking the Queen Ranera had sent someone to attack. Seeing this, the king's representative, Amon, immediately mounted his horse and left the palace. He quickly found Vgorghar, thinking that this dragon rider must pay a price. But Wolff realized something was wrong and immediately changed course, flying away from King's Landing. However, Vorghar kept relentlessly pursuing him. In the end, they reached Dragonstone as the largest living dragon.

Unlike Hans, who was reserved, Jack was outspoken and the troublemaker of the school. At that time, Taiwan had just lifted martial law, but the school still retained many of the disciplinary measures from that period, including searches of students personal belongings, and corporal punishment. One day, Jack boldly followed a campus monitor who was carrying a stick on his rounds. After the monitor left, Hans felt uneasy, but Jack just laughed it off, not caring at all. That evening, Hans's roommate took him out to meet a girl. Despite the girl's advances, Hans felt uncomfortable and resistant. At this point, Hans hadn't yet realized that he was different from others. The next day in vocal class, the priest told the students to treat their instruments like lovers. When some classmates joked about not understanding what love was, the priest explained that love is when I'm looking at you and you're looking at me. Hans couldn't help but glance at Jack, only to find Jack was looking right back at him. Flustered, Hans quickly looked away, his heart racing as a strange feeling stirred within him. When Hans returned to the dorm that night, he found Jack being punished. It turned out that Jack had been caught sneaking in a late night snack. Later, while Jack was taking a shower, Hans brought him some ointment. Just then, someone came into the room and the two quickly hid together. It was Hans roommate who was bullying a younger student. The student was being violently stripped of his pants, and one of the bullies even pulled out a lighter. Jack wanted to intervene, but Hans stopped him. The commotion drew attention and to protect Jack, Hans stepped out into the open. His roommate pressured him to join the bullying. As Hans hesitated, holding a stick, Jack appeared and stopped.
