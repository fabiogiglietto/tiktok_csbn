So you understand the danger you're in. I had no choice. Our son. It wasn't a donor match for Leah. This is the only way that I can save her. We're well aware of the risks, but we discussed this at length, and we are. We're willing to take the risk. I realize that this is difficult to hear, but the safest choice in cases like this is to take the load off of your system and terminate the pregnancy. My daughter can't make it without getting a marrow transplant in the next year. If I lose this pregnancy, it'll be too late. Three weeks. Doctor Rose, this is all we need. Can you help us do that? Yes. Okay.

Suddenly, the water flow began to slow down. When it opened its eyes, the water had even disappeared. The rabbit ran upstream in confusion and saw a man building a dam on the river. The rabbit went forward to reason with him, but the man wanted to make money from this. He even pulled out a weapon to make the rabbit demolish the dam. The rabbit came up with a plan and claimed the dam had quality issues. The man was very confident in his construction skills and told the rabbit to try it. So the man confidently brought over a stone. There was only a commotion. The dam collapsed and water came gushing out. The rabbit breathed a sigh of relief, but a few seconds later, the water stopped again. It turned out the man had built an even sturdier dam. Suddenly, a shark in the water swam toward the man. He panicked, but thought this was the rabbit's trick, so he quickly grabbed his weapon. At this moment, this was no longer just a battle over water, because it really was a shark. The man was terrified and quickly retreated back onto the dam. At this time, the rabbit seized the opportunity to row a boat and quickly rushed toward the dam, drilling a hole in it. The man fell into the water just like that. This time, the man repaired the dam with even larger stones to prevent it from Being damaged. He even stood on the dam to patrol. Sure enough, there was movement in the water again. Then he cast a net to catch the thing, and it turned out to be a bomb. Before he could react, an even bigger bomb destroyed the dam. Finally, the man built a steel dam. He thought the rabbit was out of options, but there was no water in the dam at all. It turned out the rabbit had also built a dam upstream.

How can I explain this? Last weekend we went to that camping together with my boyfriend's family. His mom, 49, his dad, 53. My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. I'm pretty comfortable being myself around his parents, especially since this isn't the first trip we've taken together. His dad has always been touchy, flirty, and attentive towards me. When he hugs from behind, he scares me off and gropes my melons. I never say anything. I just let him do him. Anyways, back to the story. Usually I dress comfy when I travel. I wore a stretchy skirt and a white tee. We stopped after three hours at a calm gas station. I hop out to breathe some fresh air after sitting in a warm car without air conditioning. My nips are cutting through my shirt. I walk in the gas station trying to find a bottle of water to cool myself down. My boyfriend goes to the bathroom. His dad comes up while I'm looking at drinks and says my melons are blinding. I just laugh and look back at the freezer. My boyfriend and his mom are still using the bathroom while me and his dad walk out to the car. We hop in and he asks may I stare at your nipples? I feel a bit awkward, but I just nod and he starts groping and rubbing my cherries. He starts telling me about how hot I am. We see my boyfriend and his mom walking out, so we act normal again. No lie, I couldn't erase the thought about what he did. When we arrived at the camping, we set our tent and chilled that night. My boyfriend slumped immediately and I couldn't sleep. The only thing I could think about was his dad. I got out of the tent and whispered to the other tent where mom and dad slept that I needed some assistance to find the bathroom. My boyfriend's dad rapidly went out his tent and walked with me to the bathroom. He stripped to his underwear with a giant cucumber. He immediately walks closer, grabs me and starts touching my peach and melons. He takes off my shirt and underwear and puts me on my knees. I immediately started.

No nut November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that but within weeks the a jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him so when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed and there's no paper on his desk. It was like he was asserting dominance or something making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me, not a glance, full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death then I noticed his chair he's turned it toward me and the angle when he finishes it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes maybe less his face was getting red. I tried I had to reach for the phone in my pocket to text someone to help but the teacher, Mr Evans notices instantly. Phone on my desk. Now Mr Evans has a radar for phones. I swear you know the rules. Walk up and put it on his desk. He locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes. That same smirk from when he'd make his stupid the jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's a signed seating only. Go back to your seat, sir. I just need to, you need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. Look at Jack. His smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathy and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to buried in her textbook in like 0.2 seconds. Not before I catch her looking at me with this expression of disgust. That kills me. I had no chance with her anymore. 30 seconds left. Jack is still staring, still going, face getting redder. I grab paper and write the fastest note of my life to the teacher. My handwriting looks like a drunk Spider. But whatever. Jack is doing inappropriate things aimed at me. Please help now. I fold it and speed walk it to Evans's desk, reads it. His eyes scan it once, twice. For a second, I think he understand what's going on. But then he scrunches it up and wraps it into a ball, throws it in the trash. Back to your seat now, sir. Please. Back to your seat. Jack is watching me walk back, still smirking, still going. He's not even trying to hide it anymore because he knows Evans won't do anything. The whole situation is about to get so much worse. And Evans is just sitting there grading papers. Lucy is passing notes. Now other kids are starting to notice. The whole room knows what's happening except the one adult who's supposed to stop it. I turn my chair sideways. Jack adjust his angle like he's got some kind of targeting system. Mr Evans shouted again, face your chair forward. Last warning. He's about to. One more word and it's Saturday detention. Lucia stands up. Mr Evans, everyone eyes on your own work. Jack's breathing got faster. His face went from red to purple. His whole body tensing up. And I could see the exact moment he was about to lose it. Time slowed down. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.

I was going to town on a massive pimple in the locker room mirror when I heard Olivia's panicked whisper behind me, please tell me you have a pad. I just started and I'm wearing white shorts. The absolute horror in her voice made my stomach drop because I knew exactly what nightmare was about to unfold. Our P E teacher, Mister Harding, was obsessed with timing bathroom breaks on his Apple Watch, enforcing his brutal five minute limit and making a spectacle out of anyone who dared go over. The man fed off humiliating students and had made it his personal mission to crush any excuses. So Olivia was shaking because she knew she was next. She nervously raised her hand during burpies and whispered her bathroom request. But when she hadn't returned after 20 minutes, Mr Harding literally stopped the entire class and announced at full volume, Olivia has been gone for 20 minutes, which is completely unacceptable and disrespectful to everyone's time. He popped out his chest using his tough coach voice. When Olivia returned with tears forming, looking mortified, she quietly explained she was dealing with her period. That's when this man really showed his whole ass if he launched into this condescending lecture about how he has three sisters and none of them ever needed that much time, that periods were absolutely no excuse for disrupting my class and that girls today Just use it as an excuse to be lazy and get attention. He smirked like he just won some sick picture and announced she'd need to make a class for missing half of it over nothing. Olivia's face crumbled as everyone stared. And I felt pure rage bubbling up. At lunch. I was literally vibrating with anger as I slammed my tray down at our usual table where Ava, Riley and Chloe were already deep and heated conversation. Did you see what he did to Olivia? Ava practically hissed. And Riley was scrolling through her group chat where girls from his other classes were already sharing their own hearting horror stories. This man literally thinks having sisters makes him the period police, Chloe said, her voice shaking with rage. We sat there for a moment just processing the absolute audacity of what had happened. That's when Chloe got this dangerous sparkle in her eye and said, you know what, though, if he wants to play the sibling expert game, we can absolutely destroy him at his own logic. That lunch period turned into a war council. We got.

I was home asleep all night. He's holding a tablet, shows me a photo. My silver Honda Accord, my license plate 7K J P, 4 9 2, dented front bumper. We. I have three witnesses who saw your vehicle leave the scene. What are you talking about? I say don't play dumb. Another officer is behind him now. A cyclist is in the hospital, broken leg, broken ribs, internal bleeding. Your car hit him at? Eleven seventeen PM on Riverside Drive. I was home. I went to bed at 10:30. He looks past me into my apartment. Is anyone here who can confirm that? No, I live alone. Where are your car keys? Grab them from the hook by the door. Hold them up. My hands are shaking. Right here where they always are. We need to see your car. We walk to the parking lot. My car is in its usual spot. The front bumper is dented, paint scratched. There's blood on the metal. My stomach drops. I didn't do this. The damage matches the cyclist's injuries. We're impounding the vehicle. Can someone please explain how my car hit someone when I was asleep? That's what we're trying to figure out. They put my car on a flatbed truck, take photos, bag evidence. My neighbors are watching from their balconies. I call my sister. My voice won't stop. Shaking. The police think I hit someone with my car last night. Did you? No, I was home then. How did your car get damaged? I don't know. She goes quiet. Maybe you should get a lawyer. The police call me back at two forty seven PM we need you to come to the station. At the station, they show me security footage from a Chevron station. My car pulls up at ten forty seven PM someone gets out. Can't see their face. They're wearing a black c hoodie. They pump gas, get back in, drive away. That's not me. I say it's your car, your license plate. Look at the person. That's not my build. I'm 6 2. That person is maybe 5 6. The detective zooms in. The person is shorter than me. Different body shape, smaller frame. You could have had someone else drive. I was home alone. Check my phone location. Check my apartment building cameras. They check everything. My phone stayed at my apartment all night. Building cameras show me coming home at six fourteen PM, never leaving. So someone else had your keys? The detective says my keys were on the hook. I checked this morning. Does anyone have a spare? Then it hits me. Just my ex girlfriend from when we were dating. She was supposed to give it back. What's her name? Ashley Brennan. They call her in that evening, bring me to an observation room. Let me watch through the one Way glass. Ashley sits at the metal table, looks calm.

My friend Katie threw me a birthday party a few months ago and invited like 15 people to her apartment. It was actually pretty fun and I got some nice gifts. At the end of the night, Katie handed me this gift bag and was smiling really big. I found the perfect bikini for you, she said. It's super cute. You're gonna love it. I pulled it out and it was this bright blue two piece that actually did look really nice. The tags were already ripped off, but I figured she just wanted me to be able to wear it right away. I banged her and she kept saying how excited she was for me to wear it and that I should text her pictures when I did. I thought it was weird how pushy she was being about it, but whatever. Two weeks later, my roommate Ashley wanted to go to our community pool because it was like 90 degrees outside. I decided to wear the bikini Katie got me since I hadn't used it yet. We got to the pool, put our stuff down and I jumped in the water. Maybe 10 seconds later, Ashley's eyes went huge and she was like, girl, get over here right now. I swam over confused and she whispered, your bikini is completely see through when it gets wet, like I can see everything. I looked down and she was right. The material turned basically invisible in the water. I was so embarrassed and had to wrap myself in a towel and leave when I got home, I was so mad at Katie. She definitely knew this would happen. It was a prank and I was the joke. I didn't say anything to her about it, though. I just put the bikini away and tried to forget it about it. Then last weekend, Katie texted me asking if I wanted to come over. She said her boyfriend Ryan and a couple other friends were hanging out and they were gonna use her hot tub. That's when I got an idea. I texted back, yeah, sounds fun, and went over that night. There were like 5 of us at first, just talking and drinking in her backyard eventually.

So I stopped babysitting her kids for free. This happened last October during her youngest daughter's 30th birthday dinner. I've been watching her three grandkids, ages 2, 4, and 6, every Tuesday and Thursday for 18 months. Free childcare while their parents worked. I'd pick them up from daycare, feed them dinner, help with homework, manage bath time, and keep them until 9 p m. When their parents finally showed up. I never asked for money. My husband and I don't have kids yet, and his mother kept saying how this was perfect practice for when we started our family, how lucky I was to get this experience, how it would make me a better mother someday. But that night at dinner, I mentioned my husband and I were thinking about starting fertility treatments. We've been trying for three years with no success. His sister immediately jumped in. Oh, but who'll watch the kids on Tuesdays and Thursdays? We'll figure something out, I said. That's when my mother in law leaned across the table. You're too selfish to be a mother if you can't even help family when they need you. The table went silent. My husband's jaw dropped. I very calmly set down my fork, pulled out my phone, and started calculating. 18 months, two days a week, seven hours each day. That's 1,008 hours of childcare at Chicago's average rate of $18 per hour for three Kids. $18,144. I wrote the number on a napkin and slid it across to her. That's what I've saved your daughter. And I did it because I love this family. But I'm done now. You can't just abandon them. She sputtered. Watch me. I left that night and blocked everyone except my husband on my phone. He spent three days at his mother's house trying to smooth things over. When he came home, I asked him a simple question. Did you defend me? His silence told me everything. The next Tuesday came at 3:15 p m. My sister in law called.

The money's gone, I said simply. All of it. The room went silent. My father's face turned purple. What did you do? I pulled out a folder thick with printed statements and loan documents. I transferred everything into a restricted account. The same type my college fund should have been. You can't do that! My uncle sputtered. That's our money! Actually, I said, flipping through the papers, a lot of it is my money. The money you borrowed and never repaid with interest. You owe me $73,000. I watched them realize I've been keeping score. Every dollar they'd taken, every promise they'd broken, every vacation they'd enjoyed while I worked overnight shifts to afford textbooks. This is family, my father said quietly. We don't keep tabs. You're right, I agreed. We don't. But I'm not family anymore. I quit. I placed my key card on the table. My youngest cousin, Ivy, who'd always been kind to me, looked stricken. What about my student loans? For a moment, I wavered. Then I remembered being 17, calling the university to beg for an extension while my aunt posted photos from Paris. Figure it out, I said. Like I did, I walked toward the door. My father called after me. You'll regret this. You're throwing away your family over money. I turned back. No, dad. You threw away your daughter for money. I'm just the one who finally noticed. I left them scrambling to figure out which accounts I'd Locked. What they didn't know yet was that I'd also filed a report with a forensic accountant friend who take a very close look at how family trust funds have been systematically drained for years. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Text after text. Threats, please. Promises that this time would be different. I blocked every number. That evening, I got a call from an unknown number. Against my better judgment, I answered. It was my grandmother's lawyer. We need to talk, he said. About your grandmother's will. There's something your father never told you. I couldn't fit what happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

Then my aunt called asking why her car declined at the resort. What do you mean it declined? She snapped. Fix it now! I was at my desk three months into my new job as the family accountant position my father created for me after I graduated with my finance degree. I'll look into it, I said calmly. Here's what they didn't know. For the past eight years, I'd watched my extended family take lavish vacations while my immediate family scraped by. Every Christmas, every summer, they'd return with stories while we stayed home. My parents never complained, just smiled and said, we couldn't afford it this year. When I was 16, I found out why my grandparents had set up trust funds for all the grandchildren. $50,000 each for college. Mine was empty. Dad had borrowed it to bail out my uncle's failed restaurant, then my aunt's mortgage, then my other uncle's gambling debts. Each time they promised to pay him back. They never did. My college fund became everyone else's safety net. I worked two jobs through university, lived in a basement apartment with black mold, ate ramen for months. Meanwhile, my cousins partied on spring break and drove new cars their parents bought with money that should have been locked away. When I graduated, dad offered me the accountant position. Keep it in the family, he said. What he meant was I understood how to stay quiet while They kept taking. For three months, I studied every account, every transaction. Every loan that was never repaid. I documented everything. Then I did something they never expected from quiet, obedient me. I froze every account I had access to. My aunt's call was just the beginning. Within an hour, my uncle called about his mortgage payment bouncing. Then my cousin about her credit card. Then another aunt about her car payment. One by one, they all called. Furious and confused. My phone buzzed with a text from dad office. Now when I arrived, the entire family was waiting. 12 of them, all shouting over each other. My aunt waved her phone

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And yes, he's rich, like really rich. We met at the Starbucks where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbor needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm 5, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valley gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it. And not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. Did I mention having my own money? She laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work emergency leaving Me at the bar where his car colleagues don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says. Worth every penny at that age? Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. And the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open and he's on speaker phone negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the papers. Spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting, I overheard something. And I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

The winner's prize was 120 million. Here, a bottle of water cost 15. A sandwich cost 40. Everyone said I was doomed. They didn't know that I was a sophisticated dirt poor. The game was right up my alley. I would be the only player walking out of hell. Together with 99 other players, I transmogrified into a game world. A system's electronic voice sounded, welcome to the dirt poor game. Initial fun $50. Objective survive in the game for seven days. The winner receives a 120 million prize. Overspending death or leaving the game zone will be considered elimination, resulting in a 120 million debt. The voice paused, tinged with slinness. Now, any cowards want to quit? Quit? Are you kidding me? A young guy with bleached blonde hair scoffed, seven days I could survive just drinking water. A chubby kid nearby in a cheap T-shirt wiped his sweat. Yeah, yeah. 50 bucks for bagels and peanut butter. Stretching it should be enough. Fortune favors the bold. Only an idiot would quit. The crowd buzzed with blind excitement. Finally, not one of the 100 players quit. The system announced, game rules activated. Players cannot quit. 100 players deployed. Welcome to Airport Odyssey. May you survive. Well, there was a flash of white light, and I found myself in an airport. The airport was massive, stretching as far as one could see. People streamed past. I couldn't tell. If a person was a player or an NPC. I checked the interface. My game account held a quiet 50 dollar initial funds. There were 3 stats hunger, thirst, energy. All were currently full. I saw a convenience store across the way and walked over to check prices. As I reached the fridge, a tearful cry exploded. Holy shit! It was the chubby kid from before, staring horrified at the store's cooler. A bottle of water is $15! Highway robbery! I walked over, my eyes scanning the shelves, my heart sinking to the pit of my stomach. 50 for a cupcake, 40 for a sandwich. Bagels 10 for each. Even the cheapest pack of Graham crackers was 18. And just over seven dollars a day for us. Not even enough to pay for half a bottle of water. The kid looked at me, despair written all over his face. Player 66 sis, we're screwed! Fifty bucks are only enough for three bottles of water a week! We'll die! I sighed. The system isn't doing charity. I knew it wouldn't be that simple. Other players crowded the store, also showing shock and panic. The kid pulled me aside. Miss, I'm player 44. Buddy, let's team up. It'll be good to have company in the game. If anyone messes with you, I can handle them. He did a quick set of martial arts moves, fairly smooth, but not wanting to team up with anyone until I understood the game rules, politely declined. I left the convenience store alone. My priority was finding water. Free water. Outside the restroom, I found a water fountain. There were two discarded plastic water bottles nearby. I washed them clean and filled them both. Water problem solved. Cost zero dollars. Next up, finding sources for energy. I spotted a Starbucks. On the condiment stand, packets of white sugar, creamer cups, and brown sugar sat neatly arranged. Sugar is a crucial energy source. I would use sugar packets in emergencies to prevent low blood sugar. I walked over expressionlessly, my movements smooth and natural, like grabbing something at home. A dozen sugar packets and a few creamers instantly slid into my pockets. The whole process took less than two seconds. Then I walked calmly out of Starbucks. Reaching a deserted corner, I ripped open two sugar packets and dumped them straight into my mouth. Intense sweetness exploded, bringing a temporary sense of satisfaction. Sugar acquired cost zero dollars. The airport's air conditioning blasted like an ice box. Maybe the system made it this cold on purpose. Older temperatures burn energy faster. My thin clothes couldn't block the chill. I could only warm up by moving. Luckily, I found a discarded airline blanket in a trash can. However, hunger pangs grew stronger as time passed by. Eight PM, I wandered to a bakery. Behind the glass counter, unsold bread gave off a tempting aroma. My stomach let out a loud growl. My sharp, dirt poor instincts told me the Bread should be discounted now. A loaf of bread, originally 30, was now 15. It wasn't enough. Closer to closing time, discounts would be deeper, maybe even free. I should wait. Every dollar saved was a chance to survive. I sat on a chair opposite the bakery, half closing my eyes to rest. Suddenly, someone anonymously broadcast on the game's public channel head to the bakery in Terminal L3, Zone A bread here is half price! Half price bread zone A. Hurry! Don't shove! It's mine! Players rushed in from all directions. There were 20 or 30 people charging towards the bakery. Amid the chaos, I saw people waving cash, others grabbing bread straight from the shelves. Staff panicked, shouting line up! Line up! But it was useless with in minutes, all the discounted bread, including the loaf I was eyeing, was swept clean. Those who got some looked relieved. Those who didn't pounded their chests in despair. Curses, complaints, and desperate sighs filled the air around me. And me. My hunger stat had already dropped by 70%. I took a deep breath, suppressing the stomach cramps. My gaze shifted from the chaotic crowd to the giant flight information screens high above the airport. Red flight statuses scrolled constantly. Time to show my true skills.

Our teacher asked everybody for their homework that morning, but when Kira didn't have it, we all watched her panic for an excuse. Uh, I was at the hospital, she said, completely unconfident. Our teacher didn't believe her. Hospital? Why were you there? Kira goes chemotherapy. Our teacher's eyes went wide, and she didn't know what to say. Chemo therapy? Sorry, I had no idea you had cancer. That's when I saw it. The flash of panic in Kira's eyes that told me she had no idea what chemo actually was. Yeah, I have brain cancer. The classroom erupted in gasps and whispers, and I watched as she completely loved all the attention. Her Instagram quickly became a cancer journey blog with daily updates about her battle. And the next day, she showed up to class wearing a headscarf. The worst part was watching her boyfriend, who genuinely loved her, start a gofundme that raised $8,000 in two weeks. I was already in a bad mood, and she started talking about how she was preparing for hair loss. I had to go up to our teacher before class and tell her my dad got in a car crash last night. I was really upset and finally asked for an extension on our assignment. But she looked at me and said, did he die? I was confused. No, he's fine. But he could have. Then she actually says, sorry, I can't make exceptions. You've had Two weeks to work on this and should have been more proactive. But then Kira walked up behind me. I couldn't finish my essay. The chemo yesterday was just so hard. Without even hesitating, our teacher rushed over and hugged her. Oh, sweetie, take as long as you need. Your health comes first. In fact, don't even worry about it if you can't do it at all. I couldn't believe it, but that night, when I walked into the party at my crush's house and instantly saw Kira sitting in the corner with everyone comforting her, she was dabbing at fake tears while talking about how the radiation makes everything taste like metal. I sighed, knowing this was gonna go on the entire night. Some days I just want to give up, she whispered, and I watched her boyfriend pull her closer, his eyes red with real tears. However, as Kira stood up to go to the bath bathroom, she accidentally tripped over someone's foot. She stumbled forward before falling completely face first onto the hardwood floor, spilling her drink. The room exploded with panic. Oh, my god, is she okay? Then Kira took advantage. She quickly started holding her head, pretending to be in pain but saying, it's okay, I'm not hurt. But she was literally holding her head. Everyone was crawling around her trying to help her up. Poor balance is just a side effect from my therapy. The doctor said it's normal. People were crying. Act. Actually, Crying as they helped her up, her boyfriend was frantically googling brain cancer symptoms on his phone, thinking she was actually dying. That's when I knew I had to step in. Oh, my god. I actually know how to treat this. Can I help you? I rushed forward, actually being trained in first aid, Kira was loving the attention. Yeah, of course I was in. My cousin had the same thing happened during her treatment. Kira, you probably need an ambulance. This could be serious. Her eyes went wide, and this time it was genuine. No, no, I'm fine, really. But her boyfriend said

It started when I crashed at her place after a party. I was drunk, half passed out on her couch when she threw a blanket over me and said, you're mine tonight. I thought she was joking. The next morning I woke up with a heart on and her hand wrapped around it. She didn't say a word, just stroked me slow while smirking. I didn't stop her. She got on top of me, pulled her shirt off and rode me like she owned me. No questions, no warm up. I came inside her like I had no choice. Later that day, I was brushing my teeth when she stepped into the bathroom, pulled my boxers down and took me in her mouth like it was a routine. She didn't even close the door. That night, I was on her bed scrolling through my phone and she climbed on all fours beside me, slid my shorts down and used me again. No warning, just wet, tight and rough. She told me to shut up and let her finish and I did. I've never felt more used or wanted or addicted. Follow Reddit man for more. I creamed in my friend's bikini and she wore it. Last week, me and my friends went out for our friends cottage and while they all went out for a swim, I found one of the girls bags laying in the middle of the room. With her bikinis and clothes in it. I took one of her bikini bottoms and wrapped it around my data cream into it. When I was ready to finish, I finished inside them and rubbed it into the crotch and put them back. Fast forward, later on that day, everyone decided to go for another swim and she had changed into the bikini. I came in, follow Reddit man for more.

You can't live with us anymore. When I packed up and told them I'd stop paying the bills, my dad, at first I thought I misheard. My mom gave this nervous laugh like maybe he was joking. But he just sat there staring at me, waiting for my reaction. The room went silent. My sister Lily froze, her fork halfway to her mouth. She looked at me with wide eyes like she couldn't believe what she just heard. I swallowed the piece the ham I was chewing and put my fork down. What? You heard me? He said, you're no longer welcome here. You need to move out. I just sat there trying to process. I'm 23, have a steady job, could have moved out years ago, but I stayed because they needed me. I paid the electric Bill, the internet, groceries most weeks, things they couldn't afford because my dad had been unemployed for years. My mom only worked part time. I wasn't a burden. I was the reason the lights were still on in that house. And now out of nowhere, I was being kicked out like some useless freloader. Mom finally spoke up. Maybe we should talk about this later. But dad interrupted. No, Ed, this is my house. I make the rules. And I say, he's done here. Lily put down her fork. She was only 16 and I could tell she was scared. She stared at our Parents like she didn't even recognize them. If they could throw me out so easily, what did that mean for her? I took a deep breath. I wasn't going to argue or beg. If they wanted me out, fine. But they weren't ready for what that really meant. I leaned back in my chair. Alright, I said. My dad sat up straighter like he'd won some imaginary battle. My mom still looked uncomfortable, but she didn't say anything. Maybe she was in shock or maybe she just didn't care as much as I thought. I stood up, grabbed my plate and carried it to the sink. I didn't want to give them the reaction they wanted. Instead, I looked at Lily, who was still sitting there tense and confused. I gave her a small nod. She was the only one at that table I still cared about. Dad took a sip of his drink like nothing had happened. Mom went back to picking at her mashed potatoes. Lily kept looking at me like she wanted to say something, but she didn't. I didn't stay to finish dinner, just walked out. I went straight to my room, closed the door and started packing. I wasn't going to waste time trying to understand why they were doing this. If they wanted me gone, I was gone. But that also meant they'd lose everything I've been paying for and I wasn't going to warn them. I packed in silence, but I could hear Them talking downstairs. My mom's voice was low and scared. My dad's was firm, like he was trying to convince her of something. I caught bits and pee. He's old enough. We can handle it. He should have moved out years ago. An hour later, there was a knock on my door. I opened it and Lily slipped inside, quickly shutting the door behind her. Her eyes were red and puffy. She been crying. Are you really leaving? She whispered. Yeah. I said, I don't have much choice. Can I come with you? That broke my heart. You're 16, they'd call the cops. But the second you turn 18, my door's open. She hugged me tight. I hate them for this. Don't, I said. Just remember who was here for you. I left that night, didn't say goodbye to them, just grabbed my stuff and drove to a friend's place. Three days later, my phone exploded. Mom.

Corrí rápidamente hacia el balcón. Vi que mi hermano había sido secuestrado. De inmediato salté desde lo alto del edificio de 500m. Cuando caí al suelo, los secuestradores ya se habían ido en su coche, pero no iba a rendirme. Crucé por los callejones persiguiéndolos como un loco. Finalmente encontré su coche. Los secuestradores me miraron sorprendidos. ¿Cómo era posible que alguien pudiera correr más rápido que su coche? Inmediatamente giraron hacia un callejón, rompí una ventana y los detuve. Luego me lancé hacia su coche como un toro. Los secuestradores intentaron retroceder. Salté al coche y comencé a romper las ventanas. Era vidrio a prueba de balas, pero me trepé al lado del coche. Finalmente logré abrir una rendija. Los secuestradores dispararon. Me atropelló un coche que venía en dirección contraria, dejándome inconsciente cuando los secuestradores se preparaban para escapar en un helicóptero. Agarré un cable de acero y lo lancé hacia el helicóptero. Me aferré fuertemente y con mi fuerza traté de evitar que despegara. Luego amarré el cable a un muelle. Los secuestradores sacaron armas. Me escondí rápidamente para evitar sus disparos. Luego tomé una barra de acero para contraatacar. Ah, no, no, pero en ese momento el helicóptero logró soltarse. Inmediatamente me agarré del cable y fue arrastrado sobre el mar. Después de 400m me golpeó una boya. Solo pude mirar ¡Impotente! ¡Cómo se llevaban a mi hermano! Afortunadamente, mi amigo rastreó la base de los secuestradores. Usando mi agilidad, me infiltré sigilosamente en la base y con un dardo envenenado acerté en la garganta del guardia. Luego seguí a los guardias como un fantasma. Cuando el a los guardias disparé accidentalmente. Esto llamó su atención. El líder de los secuestradores inmediatamente ordenó a sus hombres que me mataran, pero no eran rivales para mí. Eliminé a los guardias y me lancé hacia el líder. Cuando le pregunté por mi hermano, noté que un cohete venía hacia nosotros. La explosión provocó un deslizamiento de tierra. Usé mi cuerpo para protegerlo. Él estaba muy agradecido y me dijo que el hombre rinoceronte había secuestrado a mi hermano, pero no había terminado de hablar cuando nos sepultó completamente. Después, los secuestradores sacaron mi cuerpo y se preparaban para enviar las fotos al jefe. De repente, aparecí detrás de ellos y le di una patada a una de sus piernas. Mientras tanto, mi hermano era llevado ante el hombre rinoceronte. Una vez que sacó el tubo, su cuerpo se volvió tan duro como una piedra para derrotarme. El hombre rinoceronte trajo un ayudante llamado David. Cualquiera que lo mirara directamente comenzaba a ver ilusiones cuando jugaba con el gran gato, no me di cuenta de que el peligro se acercaba

Hidden in the closet, a pair of eyes witnessed every moment of her life, silently observing and responding. It was as if an unspoken bond had formed between them. The man behind those eyes was Jack. He had lived in her closet for 20 long years. Every day, as the couple left for work, Jack took control of the house. He knew the routine by heart, raiding the refrigerator for breakfast, cleaning, doing the chores, all the things that the husband would later assume his wife had done. Despite her memory loss for two decades, no one had ever suspected anything unusual. And Jack slowly began to think of himself as part of their family. He spent his days hidden away in the closet, contemplating the woman's life and thoughts. Wasn't long before Jack developed deep feelings for her. One day, driven by these emotions, he ventured out of the closet, ran his fingers over her clothes and lay on her bed, breathing in the scent she had left behind. In that moment, Jack knew he had fallen for her. But things would soon take a darker turn. One night, while hiding in the closet, Jack saw Anna's husband bring his mistress home. He listened in silence, unable to do anything but watch the woman he loved endure this betrayal. Unable to bear it any longer, Jack concocted a bold plan. He cut a plastic bottle. In half, filled it with meat and placed it under a tree in the yard. Then he captured dozens of bees, pouring them into a trash can. The next time Anna's husband opened it, bees swarmed out in a deadly fury. Within moments, the man was stung to death. Jack watched quietly, his heart cold but satisfied. With the husband gone, Jack stepped out of the shadows for good. As the days passed, he could no longer resist his feeling. One night, he climbed into Anna's bed, slowly wrapping his arms around her as she slept peacefully. Anna, though unaware of the full extent of his presence, seemed to accept him silently, as if she had known all along Jack had.

On the day I was born, her husband saw my dark skin, collapsed from a heart attack, and left her a generous inheritance. She burned through that fortune in no time. So she formed a twisted plan. Bleach my body, marry me into money, and return to the life of luxury she craved. But before her transformation project was finished, my so called rich suitor saw me. He sneered at my dark skin, spitting out insults without hesitation. He had no clue that I was the woman he was meant to marry. After seeing his true nature, I told my mother I wanted the engagement canceled. But she cared nothing for my feelings. All she saw was profit. She secretly bleached my entire body anyway. What she never realized was that my wealthy fiance was as fake as she was. I overheard his phone call. He wasn't rich at all, just a scammer targeting privileged families. I refused to be another victim, so I let my skin return to its true shade and in front of everyone, exposed that counterfeit air for what he was.

It was time to reclaim who I really was. If she wanted A pale, lifeless daughter so badly, I grant her wish. I left her there like a bleached statue for all to see. She always claimed everything she did was for me. Now it's my turn to take

I revived almost instantly, but my husband witnessed everything and rage convinced him I had betrayed him. In fury, he smashed our photo frame. Yet it didn't take long for him to come up with a darker. Ever since we've been together, barely bothered to water me at all. Just as I soaked the precious moisture, he suddenly yanked me out by the root, threw me into a wheelbarrow and left me trembling. When the handsome neighbor returned with a bag of fertilizer, he found I had already vanished. All I could do was stare through the glass inside, pressing myself against the window, calling out to him helplessly, but he couldn't hear me at all. To keep me from seeing the neighbor again, my husband boarded up the window, locking me alone in the dark. I felt utterly hopeless and slowly began to wilt. Once more, thin beam of light slip beneath the door. But as I tried to reach for it, I collapsed weakly onto the floor. When my husband walked in and saw me failing, his face showed nothing but disgust. With the last of my strength, I reached toward the neighbor working just outside. Just as he was about to notice me, my husband slammed the door shut. I thought that was the end. But then someone knocked. A man wearing a helmet stood at the door holding a small, vibrant green plant. Its lively glow immediately caught my husband's eye. As for me, nearly withered to nothing, he grabbed me without hesitation and tossed me into the trash pile. Growing weaker and weaker, I watched him turn and walk back inside without a glance. Just when I thought it was truly over, a figure approached. To my shock, it was the handsome neighbor. He was the man in the helmet, and his eyes were full of compassion. He gently lifted me up, and to my delight, the plant he had given my husband turned out to be a man eating flower. Then, as though heaven felt mercy, soft, nourishing rain began to fall. Not only did I regain my delicate beauty, but my roots transformed into a pair of slender legs. In the end, it proved one thing, the magic of love and rain can work wonders together.

He decided to use a piece of coral to shave the hair off her leg and then pop all the swollen bumps. Oh, my god. The popping sound was strangely satisfying. By now, her breakouts had turned a deep red and the woman cried out in pain. The man knew he had to act immediately. After only a brief hesitation, he remembered something. He recalled a video he'd seen about clamshell. Oh, my god. It turned out that shell was a magical tool, and the popping sound was incredibly gratifying. When he finished the procedure, he was shocked to find the wounds had reacted. They were even more inflamed. At that critical moment, a pile of seaweed floated toward them in the water.

After just a few steps, her feet swelled up like balloons, but the man showed no signs of stopping till he accidentally kicked the top of her foot. Unable to bear it any longer, the wife shoved him away, pulled off the crystal shoe, and let out a long sigh of relief.

On top of that, electricity would occasionally spark from his fingers, though Cody dismissed it as his imagination.

But the numbers her team had spent days calculating didn't match what was in that report. And that mismatch was the reason the Redstone rocket launch had failed. Determined, she climbed the ladder. Using the data in the file, she began recalculating the rockets trajectory from scratch. The formulas were complex, but she was close to solving them. Right then she felt the urge to use the restroom. But every bathroom in the building was for white staff only. She had to walk 1,800 meters, over a mile to reach the one designated for black employees. While she was gone, her calculations caught the attention of her co workers. They couldn't believe what they were seeing. The correct trajectory was written right there on the board. Whose work is that? Catherine Gobel, Sir. Catherine rushed back to the office only to be met with suspicion. The director was already waiting. He thought she might be a spy. After all, the essential data had been blacked out, there was no way she could have solved the equations. Under pressure, Catherine explained, she had simply used the light to see what was hidden underneath. The director held up the document himself. Sure enough, the light revealed the concealed words. His attitude changed instantly. He ordered the staff. To stop blacking out the documents. And for the first time, Catherine was granted access to the classified materials.

One day, while mopping the floor, he glanced at a math problem on the blackboard. He had no idea it was one of the most difficult, advanced, furry equations in the world. And yet he solved it effortlessly. Equations like this are so complex that only a few people in the world can solve them. Some of them are Nobel Prize winners. So when the professor who posted the problem saw the correct solution, he rushed over and asked, this is correct? Who did this? Jack? Wasn't me. The mission? No way. None of the top students in the class claimed credit. That's when the professor realized MIT had just uncovered a new genius. But no one could have guessed that this genius was a quiet janitor. The professor had made a promise. Anyone who solved the equation by the end of the semester would receive top academic credit and their name would be etched into MIT history. Damon, glory, all in one. But it only took a day. Students from across campus came to see who had solved the problem. Yet the mysterious genius never showed up. So the professor issued a new challenge. He and a colleague designed another problem. This one had taken them over two years to solve. They wrote it on the blackboard in the hallway, hoping the genius would see it. That night while cleaning, will saw the new equation and once again, he started solving it. But this time, the professor caught him in the act. At first, he thought will was just scribbling nonsense on the board. He stepped in, angry and ready to stop him. Will saw the professor and quickly ran off. The professor chased him around the corner, but will had vanished. When he turned back to the board, the professor saw something that left him speechless. The correct answer, will had done it again. It was nothing short of a miracle.

The lady of the house thought she was poised and well mannered and offered her the job on the spot, with a surprisingly high salary of $500 a month. But the job wasn't going to be easy. Louisa was hired to take care of their son, will, who had been paralyzed for years. You pit. I'm probably scared, will. Sarcasm hit her immediately. And in that moment, Louisa realized this job was nothing like she had imagined. But she had no choice. Her entire family was counting on her. Her father had lost his job. Mother was a stay at home mom with no income. Her sister was still in college and couldn't work. Louisa was the only one holding everything together. So the next day, she showed up for work. That's when the doctor told her, aside from giving will his meds on time, she didn't need to do anything else. But Louisa didn't feel right about that. With a paycheck that big, she felt she should be doing more. After hyping herself up, she finally worked up the courage to Talk to will. She suggested going out for a walk, but will shut her down right away. He didn't want to go anywhere. He just wanted to sit. Louisa was caught off guard. She struggled to find words.

No one could have predicted what happened next. After Kelly drove away, the surveillance officer reported the incident to his superiors. Things grew even stranger when the arriving inspector found the yogurt box Kelly had thrown into the trash.

Everything was ready. Soon enough, two clumsy burglars arrived at his house. Their car immediately slid on the ice and crashed into a street lamp. But the thieves didn't give up. Disguising themselves as Santa Claus, they prepared to sneak inside. However, not going well. But the pair persisted, starting to run in place on the ice. Just then, the boy flashed his headlights, terrifying them into raising their hands and surrender. When the light went off, they continued forward. This repeated operation went on about 100 times. Finally, one man reached the door and saw a stack of cookies and a glass of milk with a note saying for Santa. The man thought, this must be for me. He picked up a cookie and started eating.

His pupils were also locked by the projector, so no matter how he moved, the image in front of him didn't change. The agents then turned on a sound emitter, creating fake dripping sounds.

It wasn't until the colleague came for a shift change that the guard Noticed something unusual with an extra person the projector couldn't accurately lock on, causing the corridor image to jump around. As more people gathered, the image jumped more and more. They rushed to check and realized they had been fooled by a piece of paper.

He then took off his military uniform, removed his fake beard, and put on a jacket, pretending to be a tourist.

Thinking there would be no more accidents, he had the boss start the machine and continue working. Little did he know another drop of blood had already dripped into a bottle and was being carried by the running machine into the next process. Soon, the blood and beverage mixture filled the glass bottle and was packaged and shipped to the United States. An old man unfortunately bought this beverage and died on the spot after drinking just one small sip. After testing, the military discovered gamma radiation in the beverage bottle. This excited the general tremendously. Immediately dispatched special Forces to rush to Brazil. Based on the production address on the beverage bottle, they quickly found banners lodging.

The sudden bright light left the man no time to react and he was instantly decapitated by the wire. The reason the assassin did this was to rob a locator device worth tens of millions on the victim. The locator contained the location of tons of drugs. To pass security checks smoothly during transport, conning drug dealer actually hid this shipment in a septic truck. Following the instructions on the locator, the assassin quickly found the location of the septic truck. But what he didn't expect was that besides their group, other people were also targeting this shipment. Just after entering the United States, police car followed them. The police inside demanded they stop for inspection. Since they had just passed police inspection at the border station, the assassin determined that these two were definitely fake police.

Fake Police who couldn't react in time. One was shot dead on the spot while the other pulled out an Uzi and engaged in a gunfight with the two assassin. Due to the weapon gap, both were soon killed by this fake policeman. Just like that fake policeman, Jimmy successfully seized this shipment. The intense gunfight had shot a hole in the septic truck, so Jimmy had to cut a tree branch to temporarily block the small hole. But to safely deliver the goods to his boss, he still had to repair the truck properly. Fortunately, there was a repair shop nearby that specialized in gray business. The employees there were very professional. Seeing blood stains on the car, they never asked questions but skillfully cleaned it off. And their repair skills were also first rate. They first filled the bullet holes with molten iron blocks, then sprayed sulfuric acid oxidation to make it the same color as the surrounding. At this time, another group of people wanting to rob the goods appeared. This time they directly blocked Jimmy's boss.

And this was years ago, and I'm a huge Jlo fan. And she said, Mommy, is Jlo going to heaven? Just let me tell y'all, I was in a bad place, okay? I was in a bad place, and I think I gone up a size in my pants. And she asked me about J Love. She goes, is she going to heaven? And I said, I don't know. I don't know. I think she needs to mature spiritually, and, um, she's going through a lot of men right now. I said it. I remember saying it, and it was wrong, and I'm sorry, and I should have never said it. One reason I shouldn't have said. My husband is a very type A anal retentive overachiever. So during this whole pandemic, he had to make an office in our home. And he would come out every morning and give me this huge list of things that he thought I should be doing. Hard things. Hard things. Things like paint the hallway, something like that. And I said, excuse me, but I stay in my gown until the third hour of the today show. My little daddy, all of my life, has been scared to death something would happen to me or my sister. And he would say, don't you dare get on a motorcycle. That was one of the things, and it would Just scare me to death. I was like, I'm not going to. Well, my husband buys one and says, because we're 30 minutes from the Smoky Mountains, let's go ride in the mountains. And I thought, oh, my Lord, if I get on this thing, he's gonna pull off into the bushes and make me do something horrible. And I can't be scared. My husband, there's two things on this earth that make him happy. A clean house and sex. Oh, lucky me. I like a clean house, too, but I'm too fun to clean. I want somebody else to do it, you know? So to make my husband happy, I got to where I would just pour bleach in certain parts of the house. And so when he came home, he'd smell it and think that I have been cleaning. It worked for a little while, and then he called on to me and he said, if you'll have sex with me twice a week, I'll get you a mate. No. And then, uh. And my babies were little. I just had my third baby. She was in a little baby seat on the floor. My middle one was a little over two. And then my boy was probably 5. And my middle one was running around, and she had a pacifier. And she looked at the baby, said, does the baby need the pacifier? And put the. Put it in her mouth. And then went over to my Boy and said, do you need to blow your nose? And he went, so she got Kleenex, and he did it. And then she was just as busy and throwing that in the trash can. And work like a doll. And then it pans over to me, and I'm over in a bad looking pair of pajamas going, ہا ہا ہا but when I knew that I was gonna get to marry Chuck Morgan, I thought, oh, my gosh, he is so smart. He can do anything. He's gonna take care of everything. He's gonna work like a mule, and I'm just gonna have a ball. I'm just gonna. Well, we married, and I had my first baby by him. And it dawned on me one day, I thought, he's smart at work, not at home. But I want y'all to know that with those first two, I was on top of my game. I really was. I was open in the classroom, and I was bringing muffins, and I was all up in there. And then at night, I would be doing flash cards, and I'd be drilling. Those first two, you're gonna make 100 on the spelling test. And I mean it. Oh, and they were scared to death. That third baby, I remember asking one of her teachers, can she read?

And he had been in a gospel quartet in high school. And this little kid, his mom and daddy raised cattle. So this child knew all about cattle. Barry College put this child in charge of hundreds of heads of cattle. You boys that are my age, do y'all remember that poster everybody had in their, their bedroom? All the boys had it in their dorm room. And it was that poster, a fair faucet in that red bathing suit. Yes, with her nipple. Beautiful. I go to visit my boy in his room. I've done every diet in the world. My mama and my sister and I took dexatrim when I was 17 years old. I'm the youngest. You could buy it everywhere. Do you remember dexatrim? Yeah, it was speed. We took speed as a family. We would take the Dexter trim and our heads would itch. I can't even think about going on one of these trips until I get through Christmas. And I don't mean to sound like everything falls on me, but everything falls on me. I love my family, but they don't do anything to help me. I do all the decorating, the cooking, the cleaning, the wrapping, the shopping, the do all that. Last year on December the 24th, my husband said to me, can I help you do anything? And I said, I'm gonna beat you. To death. And I can't think about this trip cause I gotta get ready for Christmas and I get so torn up that I wanna take to the bed. I wanna take to the bed, for example, questions about the solar system. And finally one day I said, baby, I didn't pay attention in school. Is there anything you'd like to know about young and the rest of us? This is my take on snow skin. I had to get all those little children dressed with all those layers and then I had to put ski boots on. Little children, they go, no, mommy, no, don't put those ski boots on me. We were skiing. This baby child, she starts taking all of her clothes off. I go, what are you doing? And she said, my butthole itches. I remember praying to the Lord and saying, what did I do that was so bad that this is my vacation? Now, I don't know what it is about my husband in a hotel room, but he gets in a hotel room, gets a glazed look over his eyes and I feel like I'm doing this. And I knew what that meant. I'm gonna have to do unspeakable things. My middle child is my oldest daughter, and you may have seen a video about me talking about how hateful she was when she was a teenager. Thank you. Well, I'm not taking that back. We were scared to death of her. If You've got a teenage girl and you're going through that let me give you this hope they're gonna come out of that now it's gonna take a long time, but they're gonna come out of that and then they come back around and end up your very best friend I know girls yummy okay, she takes care of me just like I'm her baby now she calls and checks on me calls me three or four times a day mom, did you get where you're going? Are you in Des Moines? Are you alright? I've got Invisalign and I and I don't have my trays in right now because if I had a man I would spit all over y'all right here so I take those out but I am so crazy that I'm gonna turn 57 on Monday thank y'all thank y'all but I've got brain fog from menopause and I can't even think of what I'm saying and I've gone around telling people I've got Instagram and I go, yeah, you do y'all are so precious to me. I wish I could go out there and straddle every one of y'all what I need to do is go home with y'all and put in a load of wash and so at the end of the routine after the two and a half minutes the finale everybody hunkers down on the stage puts their forehead on the stage and my baby is the finale she pops up and has a Little child's foot in her hand and holds that child's foot. I would put it all the way up, but my dress is tight in the back. But anyway, she holds this little child up over her head. Are y'all listening to me? I mean, it was a big deal. Husband is here and, but he's in the hotel room. I don't let him come and watch me. I know it makes me nervous and I'll tell you why. Socially, when we are out and about with our friends, I'm out there dazzling, you know, in a social situation, trying to spin a yarn in the middle of a bunch of people telling a big tale. And he's a detail person. He's an anal retentive type, a detail person. He'll say, Leanne, it was not Wednesday, it was Tuesday. It was not 2:00, it was 3:00. And I'm like, be quiet.

I am coordinated and I'm athletic. I really am. I can bust a move. I'm not good at math. I can't do math, but I can bust a move. But If I had to go to a club this is how I would dance now if I had to go to a club haha, cause I don't wanna jiggle and I could see a man going, what's that? There was never alcohol in our house until my sister is a little bit older than me and she was gonna marry late in life and she was gonna marry this Humpty dumpty country club man I had to explain to women in North Dakota what that was hooped to do you know country club cause I'm from a town of 500 people farming people we didn't know what we never seen anybody play tennis I've seen somebody on the on TV and I think oh, that's the queen and her people so we didn't know anything about a country club so she's gonna marry this country club lady and you know some country club people like to drink so to get her married off we all started drinking my little mom and daddy never drink okay, are there any teachers in here? Okay, we didn't hear them clap big cause they raise their hand I don't know how y'all do it God did not call me to do it if I was a teacher I'd be running out this highway with my bra on that side of my clothes my teachers for my children were wonderful and help me so much and they like me and I love them and they invited Me on every field trip they did. I got to go on every field trip with three children. And y'all know why they invited me? Because I'm fun and I'm not a butthole. So if you're not getting invited on the field trips, are there any teachers in here? Thank y'all. Lord, I could not do it. God did not call me to do it, honey. He didn't. I'd be running out the streets of Atlanta with my bra on outside of my pants. I thought about, there was a little child that came to our school in 6th grade and he was in, been homeschooled in elementary. And my boy came out in the pickup line and, and I met this kid that's been homeschooled. He goes, mom, no offense, but she could have never homeschooled us. We would have laid up in bed and eaten Cheetos and watch young and the restless. And I said, you're right, you're right. Your daddy could have done it. Your daddy would have, um, done really well with that.

No trace of red was ever allowed within its border. Not even a single crimson flower could remain. It had to be plucked at once or Death Hollow. Because a blood hungry creature lurked beyond the outskirt. Red was the one color it could not tolerate. And the moment it spotted that shade, it slaughtered everything in view. The villagers were forbidden to cross the gate as well. One step beyond the boundary and the beast would tear them apart. But Eddie didn't believe the old legend. He not only walked out of the village, he gathered an entire bouquet of red flowers in the forest. That very night, something uns unsettling occurred. A night watchman spotted a creature draped in red storming board the village. He yanked the alarm bell and at the sound the villagers sprinted hurriedly back to their home. They hid inside the cellars they had prepared in advance. Fear on their faces reveal just how terrifying the beast. Just then, Eddie's girlfriend stood waiting at the door, panic as the creature nearly lunged to devour her. Eddie rushed in at the last second and pulled her inside. He slammed the door shut and dragged her toward the cellar to hide. But by the next morning, a strange symbol appeared on Eddie's door, a sign that the creature's vengeance are from over. To calm the monster, villagers immediately offered sacrifice, hoping to earn its forgiveness. And sure enough, the Creature never returned. That night, the village slipped back into a brief moment of calm.

Forming such an abomination demanded a rare seed of vitality, so the witch summoned a bowl of thick smoke and drifted toward Philo, exhaling a puff of rancid mist, and Philo's mind fogged over in an instant as the wrinkled, which morphed into the image of a beautiful young Maiden. By the time Philo snapped out of the trance, his clothes, especially his pants, were left in complete disarray, and the witch had already taken the seed she sought. But the creature's formation still required time to brew, leaving Philo no choice but to accept his fate in silent. But not long after he departed, the witch laboring over the creature suddenly felt a violent surge of dark energy, prompting her to hastily mix a potion and swallow it. At that very moment, the monster materialized behind. I know exactly what you are! It growled. When Filo rushed over after hearing the news, the witch's body had already been ripped apart. But as he examined the slashes on her remain, the supposedly lifeless sorceress suddenly drew breath again, revealing that the potion she drank earlier was crafted to preserve the final spark of life. She told Filo that a wave of darkness was coming, and that the puppeteer behind the demon was none other than the prime minister's wife, Vera! She had once been a formidable enchant, but love curdled into hatred, and that bitterness drove her to craft demons through forbidden magic. Now Vera had spiraled into full madness, having slaughtered her own husband, the prime minister, and even removing his liver, an atrocity witnessed by the farsighted seer.

During every yard break, he would drift close to the guards, stealing quiet glances at the keys hanging from their belts. Back inside his cell, he'd recreate each curve and notch from memory with almost obsessive accuracy. If even a single stroke looked wrong, he calmly erased it and began again, chasing flawless precision. But that wasn't the end of his routine. At exactly 3:00am, he'd strike a match and study the keyhole on his cell door under the faint glow. Then he carefully tore off a thin scrap of paper and pressed it against the lock. Within moments, he captured the outline of the keyhole and traced it cleanly with his pencil. When that was done, he rolled another slip of paper, slid it into the keyhole, and pressed downward with gentle pencil pressure. Nearly 20,000 attempts later, he finally mapped out the lock's internal depth. Yet even with that breakthrough, he couldn't celebrate, because the hardest puzzle to Key's material remained unknown.

With no evidence, the guard had to let Mike go. No one realized that this tiny oversight would later stain the prison's reputation forever.

Mike began by drilling a hole straight into the ceiling, then poured raw eggs into a bucket, tossed and shredded newspaper, added a splash of water, and mixed it thoroughly. Finally, he stirred in a heavy dose of lime and kneaded it together. Before long, a giant lump of paste took shape, its color nearly identical to the ceiling above. Mike pressed the mixture into a neat square, using it to seal the ceiling hole flawlessly. For extra insurance, he hid it behind a poster of a glamorous woman. In truth, that opening was where they stashed the hurt for the moment. But right then the guards launched a sudden inspection. Their partners downstairs had wanted to sneak up to warn them, but wary of the sharp eyed officers, all they could do was strum a guitar to draw attention away. Of course, the trick failed and the guards marched upstairs. Hearing the commotion, the men inside hurriedly wrapped the chipped wall fragments in a rug, swept the scattered dust off the floor, and even brushed the powder from their clothes, leaving nothing suspicious behind. But the guards weren't easy to fool. The more casual the inmates acted, the more the officers grew suspicious. They launched a full sweep of the room, checking every corner and crack, even ripping down the posters one by one. Just as one guard Reached for the poster hiding the patched ceiling. His superior called him away. Finding no evidence of wrongdoing, the guards had no choice but to leave. Mike and his crew had slipped by barely. Yet the ceiling wasn't their true exit. The real escape point hid in the corner of the wall where they planned to carve out a tunnel. The extra hole in the ceiling existed solely to store the excavated soil in the space above. To break free, they needed to dig a tunnel nearly 200 feet long.

They spun around and sprinted for their lives. Strangely, the giant didn't move at first. He waited, letting them run a short distance before lifting his legs and charging after them. In just two enormous steps, he overtook them. One brutal swing sent a soldier tumbling into unconsciousness. Giant crouched down, sniffed the air again, then grabbed the fallen man with one massive hand and lifted him effortlessly. At that moment, another comrade drew his sword and charged straight at the monster. The giant, just rising to his full height, didn't see the attack until the blade drove into his heel. Roaring in pain, he kicked out violently, sending The soldier flying several meters through the air before slamming into a rock. Knocked out cold, the giant then yanked the sword from his heel with both hands.

Grabbing her tweezers, the manicurist's eyes gleamed with excitement. She carefully lifted the long nail, but it disintegrated instantly into dust. It turned out the girl was actually an elderly woman, her nails long rotted from age. The manicurist pressed a button. The woman thought she was safe, but instead she tumbled into a hidden cellar. Next, she removed the second girl's long nails. The girl was terrified, tears streaming down her face, afraid her nails wouldn't pass inspection. Yet the manicurist was quite satisfied, placing the nails into a grinder, turning them into fine powder. Traces of red polish were mixed in. Using a strainer, she sifted repeatedly, expertly separating the polish from the nail dust. The girl's chin trembled as she watched nervously. The manicurist lit an alcohol burner, poured the powder into a small pot to heat, then added borax, using secondary extraction, successfully isolating rare earth elements. Shaking with excitement, she looked as if she were constructing a missile. But in reality, she drew the nail liquid into a syringe and injected it into a nail mold. Then she used a hair dryer to dry and set the form, and soon the nail shone with a brilliant luster. She picked one up and struck it with a hammer and.

I looked at the unfamiliar face, thinking he must be new and didn't recognize me, so I politely explained. Just put it on your boss's tab. She knows about it. The mail manager gave me a dismissive glance. Sir, this is a three Michelin star restaurant. We never allow tabs. He finished speaking, then handed me a printed Bill. I glanced down at it. A single meal, half a million dollars. Glow up cutlery maintenance fee $30,000 exclusive air purification fee $50,000 VIP emotional appeasement service fee $100,000 and a bunch of other ridiculous charges. I had no idea my sister ran such a rip off joint. I let out a sarcastic laugh. I'm Adrian Hayes, Miss Hayes's brother. If there's an issue, she can come home and talk to me. But he wouldn't back down. If you can't afford it, just say so. Don't try to piggyback on Miss Hayes's name. I've seen plenty of pretty boys trying to sponge off women. I texted my assistant. Astros, tell my sister, either fire this guy or I'm pulling all my investments. Sir, stop wasting everyone's time. Just pay. His tone was smug and cutting, as if he'd already labeled me a scoundrel trying to climb the ladder on a woman's coat tails. Several curious glances were already turning my way. I frowned, not wanting to Waste time on such a ridiculous matter? I pulled out my phone and dialed my sister's number directly, but all I got was a cold, busy signal. I tried again. Same result. It's a weekday. What's that girl up to? I put down my phone and looked straight at the aggressive man, repeating each word clearly. I'll say it again. My name is Adrian Hayes, and I am the biological brother of your boss, Serena Hayes. Her phone isn't answering right now. You can check her card. My photo and information are linked to it. I thought this was the most direct and effective way to solve the problem. But when the male manager heard my name, instead of verifying it, he burst into a loud, exaggerated and grating laugh. He laughed so hard he almost doubled over, drawing even more attention. Then he suddenly leaned in close, lowering his voice to a whisper only we could hear. Still pretending. I've seen your face in Serena's photo album a thousand times. You're that persistent creep who always tries to interfere with our lives. And now you have the nerve to show up at her restaurant and put your tab on her. Who do you think you are? I froze for a second, then glanced at his name tag. Brendan Miller. An overwhelming sense of exasperation washed over me. Serena's boyfriend. The one she'd been so secretive about. The one she wouldn't even let me see a single photo of it. Turned out to be this foolish, venomous man right in front of me. How could her taste be this bad? It dawned on me then. Today's half million dollar exorbitant Bill wasn't a misunderstanding at all. It was a premeditated humiliation. Before I could even speak, he completely lost his patience. If this gentleman insists on dining and dashing, we'll have to restrain him until the police arrive. He waved his hand and two burly security guards who had been standing nearby immediately stepped forward. They were two well trained, strong men, two fists against four hands. My resistance was quickly subdued and my arms were twisted tightly behind my back. I struggled violently, but couldn't break free from their professional hold. They ignored my furious gaze and the frightened looks of the other guests, roughly dragging me towards the back kitchen. Then I was violently shoved into the storeroom in the back, reeking of disinfectant and stale, greasy slop. The door slammed shut, cutting off all light and sound from outside in the dark. The male manager said nothing. He simply raised his leather clad foot and kicked me hard in the stomach. The excruciating pain made me grunt instantly, my stomach churning. That's for spending my woman's money! That's for meddling in her business! He yelled, his voice twisted by jealousy and rage. He looked down at me, then ordered the two burly men beat him! Teach him a lesson! The two security guards were clearly his cronies. They didn't hesitate, a relentless flurry of punches and kicks raining down on me. I gritted my teeth, swallowing every cry of pain. My bones felt like they were being crushed. Inch by inch, my internal organs dislodged. His taunts continued. Who do you think you are, huh? Just a good for nothing leeching off his sister? I told you, I'm her brother. If you don't believe me, ask Serena. Call her now. I'll talk to her. I struggled to explain, but the man in front of me just ignored it. It wasn't until I started feeling dizzy that he raised a hand, signaling them to stop. He nudged my shoulder with the tip of his leather shoe, looking at me triumphantly. You better settle the Bill today and cough up another half million. That's the consequence of you interfering in my relationship with Serena and spending her money. I'm not afraid of trouble. Serena will handle any fallout for me. I was curled in a ball of pain, weakly trying to argue. That's my own money, I told you. If you don't believe me, go ask her. His face changed. He kicked me, and the two security guards immediately understood, their punches and kicks raining down on me again. I knew he wouldn't listen to anything I said. If this continued, I could be seriously hurt. After I coughed up a mouthful of blood, I used my last ounce of strength to grope for my phone on the floor. Stop! I'll pay. He seemed satisfied with my submission, signaling the two security guards to stop, squatted down and patted my swollen cheek. See? Wouldn't it have been easier to just do that from the start? You chose the hard way. Two million, not a cent less. I lay sprawled on the cold floor, gasping for breath, my lungs burning. I ignored him and dialed my friend Leo Rodriguez's number. The phone was answered quickly. Leo, bring two million to my sister's restaurant. I need it now. Leo, on the other end, paused, then said something was wrong. Adrian, what's wrong, man? Your voice sounds. Don't ask, just hurry. I cut him off and hung up. Brendan's eyes instantly lit up at the mention of two million. A greedy glint flashed in them. He probably thought I was beaten into submission, offering more money to beg for mercy. The triumph on his face was now impossible to hide. Smart move. Leo's speed was astonishing. Soon the storeroom door was violently shoved open from the outside. Leo, accompanied by two bodyguards, strode in quickly. He was shocked to see the blood on my mouth, my disheveled clothes, and my pathetic posture propped up on the floor. He rushed over to help me up. I shook my head, subtly signalling him to stay silent, then took the bank card he handed me with the PIN attached and tossed it to the man. The man took the card and didn't bother me further. Waving his hand, if that's a fake card, I have countless ways to find you. Get lost! Enduring the excruciating pain throughout my body, I limped out of that sickening place, leaning on Leo's arm. When we reached the entrance, I thanked Leo. Thanks, Buddy. I'll get this sorted and pay you back quickly. He looked at me worriedly. Don't worry about the money. It's nothing. But what happened to you, I sneered. My sister found herself a fine boyfriend. I guess I have a score to settle with her. I pulled out my phone and found the number for the restaurant's assistant general manager, Mr. Peterson. Mr. Peterson was the restaurant's actual manager, someone I had personally recruited, and he was quite loyal to me. The call connected. I wasted no words, my voice devoid of emotion. You have 10 minutes to fire a manager named Brendan Miller. Otherwise Hayes Enterprises will withdraw all investment from the restaurant. Every last cent. Mr. Peterson, on the other end, was scared shitless the moment he heard my voice. He must have heard the weakness and the unusual edge in my voice as he agreed in quick, terrified succession. Not even daring to ask why, I hung up the phone and without a moment's pause, told Leo to take me straight to the police station. With the clearest, calmest logic, I recounted everything that had just happened to the officer who assisted me. After giving a detailed statement at the police station, I went to the hospital for an injury assessment. I held that thin report in my hand, and the fury of betrayal, as if fueled by hot oil, burned hotter and fiercer within me. I needed an explanation. I needed Serena Hayes to give me an explanation herself. My assistant found out Serena was at her villa. My driver and bodyguards arrived, and we headed straight for Serena's place. That villa was also a gift for me. However, when I arrived, I was greeted by blaring heavy metal music and the raucous sounds of men and women echoing through the doors and windows. She was throwing a party. No wonder she hadn't answered my calls. The villa's main door was ajar, and on a strange impulse, I didn't push it open immediately. Soon I heard a familiar male voice. It was Brendan Miller. He was pouring out his story to everyone, painting himself as a poor, helpless victim bullied by an arrogant third party, EMI, who then had the audacity to turn the tables and accuse him. I just asked him to pay the Bill, and he threw $2 million in my face, then found people to get me fired. Serena, he's gone too far. He doesn't respect you at all. He just wants to humiliate me. He just wants us to break up. Inside, Serena's circle of friends, mostly hangers on and troublemakers, echoed his outrage. Serena, in turn, was loudly comforting Brendan in her arms, her voice full of Tenderness and indulgence. Brendan, don't worry, I won't let you suffer this injustice. Then, as if to prove her resolve, she promised everyone confidently, when I get my hands on my brother, I'll make him beg for your forgiveness on his knees. Inside, those spoiled brats were still backing Brendan, shouting about how they would make me pay. Serena, just say the word and we'll go drag that bastard out right now! Yeah, let him know who truly owns this place! I couldn't listen anymore. I raised a hand and my bodyguard kicked open the villa's front door. The booming music screeched to a halt, the noisy laughter instantly vanishing. Dozens of stunned eyes all at once turn towards the doorway. No need to drag me out, I'm right here.
