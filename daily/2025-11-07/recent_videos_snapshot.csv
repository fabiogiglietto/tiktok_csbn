And so I'm posting this video in regards to a video that's circulating about me following some lady. And I'm here to say that's not true. I wasn't following the lady. I was looking for a lamp. So let's get into it, right? I decided to go to target because I needed two things, well, actually three things. So I wanted some homecoming clothes, right? That's one thing. Second thing is a lamp, of course, within the homecoming clothes, I'm wearing a shirt, pants, whatever, and the lamp. I want to close because, of course, it's homecoming.

Code off my leg, then I swapped it with the Q R code at the store. When the clerk finished packing my items and asked me to pay, I deliberately pulled out my wallet and pretended I did not have enough cash. So the clerk immediately directed me to pay by scanning with my phone. At that moment, she did not know she had walked into the trap I set. After I completed the payment, I picked up the items and left right away. But the clerk stopped me because the clerk saw the system had not received the $2,000 I paid. I hurriedly showed a picture proving my payment succeeded, but I did not expect the clerk to say I had to wait until the money arrived before leaving. I was afraid my scheme had been exposed, so I grabbed the clothes and tried to run, but the clerk physically stopped me. I slipped and fell to the floor while running. Unfortunately, the owner came over at that moment. I immediately put on a pitiful act. Then I showed the owner the payment record. The owner thought that after he scolded the clerk, I would leave, but he did not expect me to demand that he fire her to stop me from causing more trouble. The owner reluctantly fired the clerk. Only then was I satisfied and picked up the bag and left. I did not expect the owner to have already locked the Door, I froze on the spot. I did not expect that when I walked into the store, they recognized me as someone involved in multiple shop scams. So they secretly switch the QR codes. Then the owner took out his phone and transferred all the money I had scammed away. Seeing my plan exposed, I was furious. But I was still a fraudster at that moment, so I could only put on sunglasses and walk away with the items.

It turns out she did this just to cheer up the hurt boy. Ever since the nanny came to his home, her kindness has made the boy, who lost his mother, feel that long missing warmth. He often lingers nearby, watching the busy figure of the nanny, but he never noticed his father was also secretly watching her and slowly falling in love with her. The next day, his father suddenly announces he's going to marry the nanny. Angry, the boy shouts angrily to provoke his father, but his father just takes the nanny's hand firmly in front of him, unshaken. On the Eve of the wedding, the nanny calls the boy into her room. She plays hide and seek with him, letting him briefly feel his mother's tenderness again. But the next day, she still marries his father. The heartbroken boy holds back his tears, wishes her well, and then leaves the city alone.

That shut her up and I left. She called me later when I got home, saying she just felt bad for them. She understood why I wasn't close to them, but still. She said I should see how many times they ask why I hate them and why I can't have fun with them, too. She just asked me to think about it.

My ex wife Helen had an affair with my brother Jason. It wasn't just that I found out the kid I was raising for nearly three years wasn't mine, but Jason's.

And whatever kids he brings into this world, I won't ever consider them my family. Skip to now. His eldest is fifteen. I don't interact with him or his other siblings. Jason had three other kids.

I told her that wasn't my problem. Plus, in the real world, they won't get everything, and they'll see other people get stuff they can't, and they'll just have to suck it up. She said I was punishing them for what Helen and Jason did. I'm not. We went back and forth, mainly her asking me if I was willing to punish innocent people. I said again I wasn't. Just because I wasn't spending money on them doesn't mean I am. I got annoyed and told her if she was so worried about them, I could just stop supporting her and give that money to them. That shut her up and I left. She called me later when I got home, saying she just felt bad for them. She understood why I wasn't close to them, but still. She said I should see how many times they ask why I hate them and why I can't have fun with them, too. She just asked me to think about it. Not spending money on them, but at least giving them a relationship. I don't get it. I don't owe them anything. They have two other uncles and two more aunts, so it's not like they're deprived of that. Why should I force myself to spend money and time on people that were made out of An affair behind me. I know they're not just that, but that's all they are to me. Especially the one I raised for three years. Plus the fact that they just came out about the affair when Jason felt like being a dad, not because it was hurting me. What if he never felt like that? And I raised another man's kids for more than I did? And now what? They expect me to put my feelings aside again for them? I did in the divorce, when my parents and my other brothers and sister took their side just because she was pregnant. I only had my sister, the one here on my side and actually checked up on me when I was at my lowest. I know she means well, but at this point, I'm kind of done with them. That's why I'm here. My mind is a mess. I feel like a mess, and I just need outside opinions. Ah.

I was the only one who actually cooked in our four person house. Every Sunday, I spent hours preparing healthy meals for the week. My three roommates survived on delivery apps and whatever they could steal from my containers. It was just missing Tupperware. Jeff would shrug after eating my chicken and rice, sorry, I was drunk and hungry, became his favourite excuse. Soon, entire rows of meals would vanish overnight. My grocery budget evaporated into their stomachs. They still complained about being too broke for groceries. Bieber was the worst offender by far. I spent three hours one Sunday making lasagna for the week. He ate the entire tray while I was at work. When I confronted him, he just laughed in my face. Maybe if you weren't obsessed with containers, you'd find someone to cook for besides yourself. Bieber's girlfriend, Taylor, basically moved in without paying rent. She didn't just eat my food like the others. She photographed my meals for her Instagram before destroying them. Her captions claim she made everything herself. She promoted her meal prep journey while eating my entire week's food in two days. My containers would disappear into her car for weeks, return stained, warped and sometimes mouldy. I tried the polite approach. One evening I asked if they could reimburse me for groceries. Taylor rolled her eyes dramatically at my request. It's just food. You're Being really weird about this. Never. Immediately took her side without hesitation. Yeah, stop being so territorial. Sharing is caring, right? Our house meeting was my final attempt at reason. I spend $80 weekly on groceries. You guys eat most of it. Can we please work out a system? Jeff jumped in with his prepared complaints. Your meal prep takes up the entire fridge. Maybe stop hoarding space with containers. Then we'd have room for our own food. Bieber grinned and added his support. Exactly. Stop filling the fridge with your stuff. Problem solved. They actually high fived each other. I stood there processing their audacity. Something shifted inside me at that moment. I smiled sweetly. You know what, you're absolutely right. Malicious compliance became my new favourite recipe. I stopped using containers immediately. Just as requested. Every night I cooked elaborate aromatic meals instead. The house filled with smells of garlic, herbs and sizzling meat. I made exactly one portion and ate it immediately. Nothing went in the fridge ever. The kitchen.

My new meal prep strategy was even better. Huge batches of amazing food filled the kitchen with tempting aromas. Rosemary, lamb, Thai curry and fresh bread tortured their senses. Everything went straight into my new lockbox. I kept it all in my bedroom. The fridge remained completely empty of my food. They had all the space they demanded. The psychological warfare intensified over the following days. I timed my cooking for when they were hungriest. Sunday football meant buffalo wings and loaded potato skins. Stommy's growled audibly over the game. I ate slowly, savoring every single bite. Game night with their friends became my masterpiece performance. I cooked an entire feast for hours. Wings, nachos and spinach, artichoke dip filled the air with incredible smell. They finally broke and asked for some. I reminded them sweetly about their request. You said I was hoarding the fridge. Everything's in my room now. You have all that space you wanted. Their friends stared in complete disbelief. The situation required an awkward explanation. You told your roommate not to share food, one friend asked. Judgment in his voice was obvious. Another friend shook his head slowly. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Two weeks of empty fridges broke their resolve. The intoxicating smells had tortured them enough. Bieber groaned in defeat one morning. Okay, okay, we get it. Can we work out a food budget? We'll pay you To meal prep for everyone. I pulled out my laptop with fake enthusiasm. Actually, I found the perfect solution. This meal delivery service has an amazing deal. Everyone just needs to sign up for the group discount. Taylor grabbed the tablet without reading anything. Whatever. Where do I click? She tapped through multiple screens carelessly. Her credit card information went in without question. She complained about how many steps there were. She never read a single word. She just committed to a 52 week subscription. The price was $300 per week. The cancellation fee was absolutely massive. The group discount page had actually been commitment terms. I started packing that same night. My studio apartment was already lined up. I could meal prep there in peace. My note on the empty fridge was cheerfully worded, Congratulations, Taylor. You're now enrolled in premium meal delivery, 300 per week for professional food. First charge hits tomorrow. My phone exploded with calls and texts as I drove away.

And Kristen, is this person known to you? Yes. Okay. Spouse. Ex spouse. The second one. How long until you get here? We're looking at about 8 minutes. Uh, say peppers if there's somewhere safe you can get to. No, definitely no peppers. It's a pizza, not a damn salad. Uh, listen, I might just have to cancel this order. My boyfriend's getting kind of mad. So, okay, listen, Christian, I will have officers at your door in under two minutes. Okay? I really need you to try and stay on with me. Okay?

Well, so much detail and I need the drama. Um, one of my good girlfriends, not, uh, an ex, but just, uh, you know, a platonic girlfriend, you know, she, well, first of all, Laura was really in her phone throughout this entire house party. You know, when you can tell someone's really into their phone, like they're really on their phone. Yeah, that was her, which is like the whole night when you're meeting people. Yeah, exactly. Is that the reason though, is Like she could have been nervous, right? No, it's because of what she was doing on her phone.

I printed everything, organized it by date. Her messages to him were sweet, flirty, nothing like how she talked to me. One text made my blood run cold. He's nice but dull. A placeholder. My life started late. Placeholder. That night around midnight, Jennifer fell asleep watching some podcast. I went back to my office and pulled out a small wooden box I'd made myself, originally meant to hold flinks. I filled it with a flash drive containing every screenshot, every email, every G P s coordinate. I added a printed map with her affair location circled in red. One blurry photo of her and him. Her special necklace visible, the one she only wore for important occasions. Then I wrote a note by hand. Three days to pack, then I file or we pretend none of this happened. Your choice. I placed the box on her pillow and went to bed. When she found it the next morning, she didn't scream. She just stared for an hour. Finally, she opened it and I watched her face in the hallway mirror. She read the note over and over, hands shaking, phone buzzed. She didn't even look at it. She didn't sleep that night or the next, or the next. Day. One, she brought me roses, made soup from scratch, wore lingerie, tried everything. I just said you should rest. Day 2, she wanted to talk, suggested couples therapy of vacation. Then she called her lawyer and I heard her Scream through the bathroom door. You never mentioned a fidelity clause. Turns out our prenup had one with proof. Everything changes. Day 3, she got quiet, really quiet. Just walked around touching things like she was saying goodbye. That evening, I came home to find her suitcases packed. She asked me one question, do you hate me? I said, no, I just finally love myself enough not to be quiet anymore. She left that night. I locked the door, turned off my phone and slept better than I had in years. Sometimes the quietest revenge is just refusing to be a placeholder anymore.

I nodded. Later that night, I left a box on her side of the bed. When she opened it, she started crying and didn't sleep for three days. So this happened last month, and I'm still processing everything. I'm 52. Been married to my wife Jennifer for 18 years. I'm a machinist. I run precision equipment and manage a team. I'm not rich, but I've always provided, fixed things, covered her mistakes, paid off her maxed out credit cards more times than I can count. Last Tuesday, I was folding laundry in the basement. Jennifer walked in, tossed her blouse in the dryer, and just laughed. Dry, cold laugh. Then she said it. You're lucky I even let you touch me. Like I was some gross stranger who won a contest or something. She just hummed and walked away like it was nothing. But something inside me clicked. Not anger. Something quieter. Colder. I folded the rest of the clothes and went to my office. See, I'd noticed things for months. Her phone always buzzing, her giggling at texts like she was a teenager again. Client dinners that never showed up on our joint credit card. Tuesday evening training retreats that seemed frequent. Six months ago, I'd synced her phone to our family iPad. She thought it was just for Netflix. It wasn't. I opened my laptop and started going through everything. Emails from her realtor friend mentioning fun, Weekends at the Birchstone Hotel on dates that matched her supposed work retreats. Rental car receipts with a second driver listed. Not me. Then the texts. My stomach dropped. One message stood out. Can't wait to see you outside the sheets for once. Lowell. The guy responded with a shirtless mirror pic. Recognize the bathroom? The birchstone again. That hotel always smelled like cheap lavender. The guy? A contractor we hired last summer to fix our deck. I gave him beer. He thanked me, shook my hand. I kept digging. Her car's GPS tracking. Three separate Tuesday visits to a downtown condo. She always told me she hated down

When I was 10, my older sister Megan went missing on a random Thursday in October. She was 14. Walked to school like any other day, but never came home. Mom called all her friends. Dad drove around the neighborhood until 3:00am. By Friday morning, police cars were parked outside our house. For the first week, our kitchen stayed busy. Neighbors brought casseroles. My aunt made sandwiches. Officers drank coffee and asked the same questions over and over. Did Megan seem upset? Was she meeting anyone? Did she have money? Mom answered while dad paced around our living room, checking his phone every 30 seconds. But after two weeks, the casseroles stopped coming. The police visits got shorter. Mom stopped cooking altogether. She'd sit at the kitchen table, staring at me. In school schedule that was still stuck to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a pizza slice. Dad would come home from work and heat up whatever he could find. Usually nothing. One night, I got hungry around nine PM. Mom was on the couch watching the news. Dad was in his office making more phone calls to people who had no answers. I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge. There wasn't much. Some expired milk, a half empty jar of pickles, and one slice of cold pizza from three days ago when dad ordered food and nobody ate it. I grabbed the pizza and a warm Coke from The counter. Instead of eating in the kitchen, I walked upstairs to Megan's room. The door was still open. Her bed was unmade from the morning she left. Her backpack was gone, but her favorite purple hoodie wasn't hanging on her chair like it usually was. That's when I first noticed it was missing. I sat cross legged on her carpet, looking around her room. Her posters of some boy band I didn't know were still taped to the wall. Her desk still had homework. She never turned in. Her shoes were lined up by her closet. Everything looked normal, except she wasn't there. I took a bite of the cold pizza. It tasted like cardboard. The cheese was rubbery and the sauce was too sweet. But I ate it slowly anyway, pretending Megan was just downstairs watching TV or in the bathroom brushing her teeth. I kept waiting to hear her footsteps in the hallway or her voice calling for mom. The pizza took me twenty minutes to finish. Each bite was harder than the last. Coke was flat and too warm. But I drank it because sitting in her room doing nothing felt worse. I kept looking at her bed, imagining her lying there complaining about homework or asking me to get out of her room like she always did. When I finished eating, I just sat there for another hour. Mom never came looking for me. Dad never called my name. House was completely quiet except for The sound of cars driving past our street. Normal cars with normal families going normal places. I wondered if Megan was in one of those cars trying to get home. After that night, I couldn't eat pizza anymore. Even the smell made my stomach hurt. When kids at school had pizza parties, I'd make excuses. When dad suggested ordering pizza for dinner, I'd ask for something else. Mom and dad never asked why. They had their own things they couldn't do anymore. Three months later, the police told us they were scaling back the search. They said they'd keep Megan's case open, but they had to focus on other things. Mom cried for two days straight. Dad punched a hole in the garage wall. I went back to Megan's room and sat in the same spot where I ate that pizza. Her purple hoodie never turned up. Not in her school locker, not at any of her friends houses, not anywhere the police looked. Mom kept asking everyone about it. Like finding the hoodie would bring Megan back. But nobody had seen it. We moved to a different house six months later. Mom said she couldn't live in a place with so many memories. Dad said we needed a fresh start. I never told them that the real

My husband Trevor nodded. It makes sense, Babe. Steven needs it more. I took a sip of wine, set down my glass carefully. Interesting. Since when do you own my house? The fork Richard was holding clatter to his plate. What? My house? The one I bought three years before I met Trevor. The one that's solely in my name. Richard's face went red. Don't be ridiculous. You're married. What's yours is ours. No, what's mine is mine. We never put Trevor's name on the deed. Trevor's mother Linda chimed in. That's just a technicality. Marital property only applies to assets acquired during marriage. I bought the house before we met. It's separate property. Silence. I pulled out my phone, opened a document. This is the deed. See only my name. Purchased February 2019. We got married June 2022. Trevor grabbed my phone, stared at the screen. You never told me it wasn't in both our Names you never asked. You assumed. Richard stood up. This is unacceptable. Steven has two kids. He needs that house. Then Steven should buy his own house. He can't afford it. Not my problem. Linda gasped. How can you be so selfish? Selfish? You just tried to give away my house without asking me even. Finally spoke up. I didn't know about this dad. I thought, thought what? I looked at him. That I just hand over a 450,000 dollar house because your father demanded it? Trevor's voice.

I'll take very good care of her tonight. He walked away. Sophia followed. Everyone saw it. Nobody said anything. I stood there holding that dollar while my marriage walked out the door. I didn't explode. I didn't make a scene. I drove home calm as ice. By two a m, I changed every lock in the house. By. By 4:00am, I contacted a lawyer. By 6:00am, I'd moved all her stuff to the garage. By 8:00am, I'd called her boss at the tech company's corporate office. Turns out Brendan wasn't the CEO. He was a regional manager. And his actual boss? A guy named Tom Richards, who happened to be my client. He'd ordered a 7,500 dollar custom smoker from me three months ago. We'd become friends. One phone call. That's all it took. Around noon, Sophia came home to find her key didn't work. She started banging on the door, screaming. I opened it, handed her the garage clicker and said, your stuff's in there. The locks are changed. My lawyer will contact you. Her face went white. Jake, we can fix this. That's when her phone rang. Brendan on speak. You didn't tell me your husband was Tom Richards's personal friend. He screamed. I just got fired. They're investigating me for inappropriate workplace relationships. My wife found out. You cost me everything. Sophia looked at me, finally understanding. I didn't throw the dollar back. At Brendan instead. I framed it in my workshop with a plaque underneath. Respect the man with grease on his hands. He probably signed your paycheck. That photo went viral. Six months later, my business is booming. Turns out being the BQ Guy who handled his divorce with dignity is great marketing. I started a new product line called the Loyalty Series. Sophia works at a small agency now. Drives a 15 year old Honda, lives in a one bedroom apartment. Brendan? Last I heard, he's selling used cars in Florida. And me? I'm teaching my kids that character matters more than cash. And that revenge is best served low and slow. Just like good BBQ.

He texted her non stop that entire evening, saying, I can't believe you chose him over me. The next day, I was in chemistry with Dana, and we just turned in our project. We were talking about what grade we thought we'd get when I saw Dana's face go pale. She was looking behind me. I turned around, and there was Patrick holding these giant Scissors. I was wearing bring my hair in a low ponytail. I've been growing it out for three years, ever since I had to shave my head in eighth grade after an accident. It took forever to grow back, and I was so proud. It was down to the middle of my back. Patrick walked up, grabbed my ponytail, yanked it hard, and I heard this loud snip sound. I reached back and felt where my hair used to be. It gone. Cut off at shoulder length. I whipped around, and there was Patrick holding my severed ponytail in one hand and the Scissors in the other with this satisfied smirk. Dana screamed. Whole class went silent. I lost it. Grabbed the Scissors from his hand and shoved him as hard as I could. He crashed into a desk. Our teacher started yelling. Security came and dragged Patrick out. He got suspended for a week. Three days later, there was a knock on our door. My mom answered and called me downstairs. Patrick's father was standing there in an expense suit. Next To a woman with a briefcase. He said his son told him everything about how I violently assaulted Patrick unprovoked, and caused him emotional trauma. The woman was their lawyer, and they were suing me for assault and battery. My mom asked if he was serious. He showed us medical bills, for therapy sessions, for the trauma I allegedly caused. My mom said, your son cut off my daughter's hair with Scissors. That's assault. Patrick's dad said, actually, that's destruction of property. And claimed I've been bullying Patrick for months. I pulled out my phone and showed the security footage from school. It clearly showed Patrick sneaking up behind me with Scissors, cutting my hair, then me defending myself. Patrick's dad's face went pale. The lawyer whispered something to him. He stammered and said, we'll be in touch. They left. We never heard from them again. Patrick got expelled. Dana broke up with him the day after. I cut my hair into a Bob, and honestly, it looked better than before.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. But I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything, cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. I noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

Where are you? It's 8:30. I responded three hours later. Would working class. Since when? Since I had free time. Thursday. She called during the class. I sent it to voicemail. Called her back at ten PM from my truck. What's going on with you? She asked. Nothing. Just respect in your boundaries. My boundaries? You said you decide when we spend time together, so I'm waiting for you to decide. Silence on the other end, then. I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it? More silence. She hung up. Friday night, I went out with co workers for happy hour. Turned into dinner, turned into bar hopping until midnight. Got home to find every light in the house on and Cassidy sitting on the couch in the dark living room, staring at the wall. Where were you? Her voice cracked out. You didn't text me. I stopped halfway to the bedroom, turned around slowly. You told me to stop bothering you, so I stopped bothering you. You wanted to decide when we spend time together. I'm still waiting for you to decide. Her face went pale. I didn't mean. You meant exactly what you said. And I'm giving you exactly what you asked for. She started crying. I went to bed. Saturday morning, I woke up to 17 missed calls and 43 text messages, all from her. All variations of we need to talk and where are you? I was at the gym. That's When she showed up at my office Monday morning. I work in an open floor plan, 30 desks, all visible to each other. She walked in at 10:00am, mascara running down her face, and made a scene in front of my entire team. You've been ignoring me for two weeks. My boss stood up from his desk. And you need to. We're married. He can't just stop talking to me. I stayed seated, kept my voice calm. You said you decide when we spend time together. I'm still waiting for you to decide. That's not what I meant. Then what did you mean? She couldn't answer. Just stood there crying while my coworkers stared. My boss had to walk her out. HR called me in an hour later. I explained everything, showed them the text where she said, stop bothering me. They said they understood, but asked me to work from home for the rest of the week. That's when I realized she never wanted space. She wanted me to chase her while she ignored me. She wanted the comfort of knowing I'd always be there, always asking, always trying, while she got to decide if I was worth her time. I'm filing for divorce next week.

I crossed my arms. So now I'm successful? Mom snapped. Don't be a brat. We're your family. I let that hang, then smiled. Let me tell you about family. Family doesn't mock you when you're struggling. Family doesn't treat you like a joke. Family doesn't show up only when they need something, dad muttered. Logan, please. You made your choices, I said, gesturing to my empire. And I made mine. I'm not giving you a cent. But I wasn't done. While they drowned in debt, I'd been expanding, buying property, including their house. Mom's face went white when I showed her the email. No. You mean the house you said wasn't my home anymore? She grabbed my arm. Please, Logan, we'll do Anything, I pulled away. Now you understand what it feels like. I pulled out a contract I'd already prepared. I'll let you live in it, but I own it. And you'll pay me rent every single month. Dad's hands shook. How much? I named my price. High enough they'd feel it every month. Mom's face twisted. You're charging us to live in our own home? No, I grinned. I'm charging you to live in my home. Silence. With trembling hands, they signed. They spent their lives treating me like nothing. Now I owned their home, their future. I owned them. And as I walked back into my business, I smiled. They thought I'd be nothing now I owned everything.

At least you'll always have a place to sleep under the stars, dad chuckled. Maybe open a lemonade stand or something. I stared at them. This wasn't even disguised kindness. This, it was straight garbage. A memory flashed me at 16, holding my first paycheck from the auto shop. So proud, dad didn't even look up. You're going to smell like oil for the rest of your life.

So this is what you've done? I didn't look at her. You gave me trash. I made it work. This isn't a real business, she sniffed. It's just a phase. I laughed.

And when the kid offered me some of his stale candy, I took it. We sat there eating old chocolate bars in silence. When the parents finally came home, they walked in calling for me, and I had to yell that I was in the attic. They came upstairs, saw me sitting there covered in dust next to their kids, surrounded by candy wrappers, completely lost it, laughing. They put the chair back. I climbed down with whatever dignity I had left and they handed me an extra 20 as an apology. I told them straight up I was never babysitting again. And they said they completely understood. But, and a week later, I saw them at the grocery store and the mom came over to apologize again. She said the twins felt bad. And I said, no, they absolutely don't. She laughed and admitted I was right, that they thought it was the greatest prank ever. Then she asked if I'd babysit again for triple the rate. My bank account made the decision before my brain could stop it, and I agreed. The next weekend, I showed up with my own ladder. Feeling pretty confident, I told the kids I knew all their tricks now and they weren't getting me twice. They just looked at each other and smiled, which should have been a massive red flag. Everything went fine for the first hour. Both kids even went to the bathroom. One at a time without incident. And I started to relax. That's when I heard the front door open and close. I ran to check and both kids had just vanished. After searching inside, I heard laughing from the backyard and found them both sitting in their treehouse eating more candy. They'd apparently hidden out there earlier. I told them to come down immediately and they both said no in perfect unison. So I sat down in the grass and just waited them out. 15 minutes later, they got bored and climbed down on their own. When the mom came home early, she paid me triple like she'd promised and said she didn't blame me for quitting. I told her these kids were professional level pranksters. She said, yeah, they get it from their dad. And right then he walked in from the garage wearing a vampire costume matching the twins. He'd been hiding out there filming everything the entire time.

Don't act so high and mighty because you help my daughter with homework sometimes or build stupid plastic figurines together. No matter how many bed time stories you read her, you are not and will never be her father. We've been sleeping in separate rooms since then. It's been three days. Last night I went up to my stepdaughter's room to apologize for all the shouting. She was lying in bed, still reading her new books. Is this my fault? She asked quietly. No, I said immediately. Never. Your mom is just insecure because we get along so well. But this is not and will never be your fault. I hope she believes me. I've been thinking a lot about everything. About the last 10 years. About what my wife said. About how I'll always be second place to a ghost. And yesterday I made a decision. I called a lawyer. Three months have passed since That night, I left. Packed my things and moved into an apartment across town. My stepdaughter keeps calling me, confused and upset. She doesn't understand why I had to go. And honestly, that breaks my heart more than anything my wife said. But I couldn't stay. I deserved more than being treated like a placeholder. Like my bond with this kid I raised didn't matter. My wife's been calling, too, begging me to come back. But it's not because she loves me or sees me as her partner. Her voicemails make that clear. Nobody's taking care of her. She says she needs you here. Not I need you, not I miss you. Just. She needs you. The divorce papers are filed. My lawyer says it should be finalized in a few months. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice. Then I remember what my wife said. That she traded me in a heartbeat for a dead man. And I know I did.

So I am taking this relationship to the grave. I've been with my wife for 10 years, married for six. Her late husband died when their daughter was just a year old. That daughter's 13 now and I've known her since she was 3. Here's the thing about my marriage. I've always known I'm not first in my wife's eyes. She goes to his grave every single day after work, every day, rain, snow, doesn't matter. Then every weekend, she takes their daughter there for an hour so she can spend and time with her dad. I never made a big deal about it. I'm not the kind of guy who needs constant attention anyway. I work from home as an online tutor. So when Covid hit and schools went remote, my stepdaughter was home with me all day while her mom kept going to the office. That's when we really bonded. We built Gundam models together, stayed up late discussing Percy Jackson theories, and I'd help her with homework at the kitchen table. She got into hockey, then baseball, then quit both to focus on dance. She's incredible at it, too. So advanced for her age that she landed the lead role as the princess in her studio's Nutcracker production last December. Her mom never came to a single game, not one recital, too. Busy visiting a cemetery, I guess. Yesterday was my stepdaughter's birthday. I've been searching online for weeks and finally found this special edition box set of the Heroes of Olympus, the second series in the Percy Jackson universe. It's been out of print for years, but I tracked one down. When she opened it, she literally screamed, jumped up, hugged me so tight I could barely breathe and said, thank you so much, dad. I didn't correct her, just smiled because honestly, I've raised this kid for almost 7 years. I make her breakfast, help with her math homework, listen to her talk about drama with her dance friends, drive her to practice four times a week. If that doesn't make me her dad, I don't know what does. Her mother drilled it into her head when she was little that she could only call me by my first name or mommy's friend, never dad, never anything close. My stepdaughter ran upstairs to start reading her new books and that's when my wife turned on me. You're not her dad, she hissed. How could you ever be her dad? How dare.

I was driving out of my gated community when this lady jumped off the curb right in front of my car. She was screaming and waving her arms like she was directing airplane traffic. I slammed my brakes and coffee went everywhere. She rushed to my window, demanding to know if I lived there. Her face was red and spit flew as she yelled about watching me drive through her neighborhood. Her husband jogged over, looking mortified in his cargo shorts and polo shirt. Karen, please, he said, grabbing her elbow. This is our neighbor from the blue house. She shook him off and demanded my driver's license like she was neighborhood security. Her pom pom slippers made her authority act even more ridiculous. Instead of getting mad, I just started laughing. You know what? Come over for drinks this afternoon. Let's get to know each other better as neighbors. The husband's jaw dropped. That's. That's very kind of you. Karen kept sputtering about documentation while her husband dragged her away apologizing. I drove home sticky with coffee, but oddly amused by the whole thing. Four hours later, I walked to their house carrying red and white wine. Mitchell answered, looking shocked. I actually came behind him! Karen shrieked. Absolutely not! From their living room. Mitchell's face went crimson as he stood in the doorway doing that awkward shuffle. I'm so sorry. She's. She's not feeling social. But maybe I could stop by your Place in an hour. I shrugged and walked home. Sure enough, an hour later, Mitchell knocked, carrying a six pack. We sat on my porch and he practically collapsed into a chair. I'm really sorry about this morning. Karen's been getting worse lately. She watches the neighborhood Facebook page like it's her job. We cracked open beers and talked. Mitchell was a software engineer who worked from home and seemed desperate for normal conversation. We discovered we both loved craft beer and hated the HOA rules. After his third beer, he admitted Karen had called the police on three other neighbors this month alone. I keep telling her she's going to get us sued, but she think she's protecting property values, he said miserably. We ordered pizza and moved inside to watch the game. Mitchell relaxed for the first time all day. He kept thanking me for being understanding and not filing a complaint about the morning incident. You know what's crazy? Mitchell said during halftime. In 23 years of marriage, this is the first time I've just hung out with a friend without asking permission. We were laughing about the HOA's latest ridiculous rule about grass height when Mitchell's phone started buzzing. He ignored it. Then it rang and rang and rang. Maybe you should answer, I suggested. Mitchell shook his head. She's probably calling to demand I come home. For once, I'm going to enjoy my evening. His phone finally stopped. We high fived and opened another beer. The third quarter had just started when I noticed something odd. A car had driven past my house three times, then another. They we're moving slowly, like they were looking for addresses. Hey, Mitchell, does Karen know my exact house number? No. Why? That's when we heard the sirens. Not just one or two, but what sounded like every cop car in the county. The noise got louder and louder until red and blue lights were flashing through every window. I peeked through the blinds, and my blood went cold. Multiple police cars had surrounded my house. Officers were taking positions behind their vehicles with weapons drawn. More cars kept arriving. I could see officers moving through my backyard. They had the whole property surrounded. Oh, my God! Mitchell whispered, looking through another window. What did she tell them? In my driveway, I could see Karen talking animatedly to what looked like a police captain. She was gesturing wildly at my house, and I could see her mouth forming words that looked like dangerous and hostage. Even from here, her pom pom slippers looked ridiculous against the severity of what was happening. A megaphone crackled to life. This is the police. We. We have the house completely surrounded. We know you're in there. Mitchell and I looked at each other in terror. Whatever Karen had told them, it was clearly more than just my husband is watching football. The tactical positions the officers were taking suggested they thought something serious. Was happening inside. Should I go out there? Mitchell asked, his face pale. Wait, I said. Let me think. If she told. Tell them you're in danger and you walk out, fine. They'll know she lied. But if they think I'm dangerous. The megaphone crackled again. You have 30 seconds to respond before we escalate. Release the hostage immediately. Hostage? She told them Mitchell was a hostage. My hands started shaking as I realized how bad this could get. At one wrong move, and this could end with me dead on my own living room floor. Mitchell reached for the door handle, but I grabbed his arm. Outside, I could hear more sirens approaching. Whatever happened next would happen fast. Through the window, I saw an officer with S W A T. Gear arriving on scene. The megaphone counted down. 20 seconds. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe. Mitchell looked at me with panic in his eyes as we both realized Karen might have finally gone too far. 10 seconds. Full story link below.

What's it like? My family lived by one rule. You pay what you owe, no matter the cost. So when I was 19 and found out my father had borrowed 200,000 from the Kozlov family, I knew our lives were over. My father sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while my mother paced and chain smoked. The deadline was three days away, and we had nothing. Then Boris Kozlov himself showed up at our door with his son Nikolai. Boris looked at me the way you'd examine a car before buying it. He turned to my father and said, your debt disappears tonight if she marries my son. My father didn't even look at me before agreeing. My mother just lit another cigarette and stared at the wall. The wedding happened in Boris's basement. No dress, no flowers. Just papers to sign and men with guns watching. Nikolai was 28 and had dead eyes. After the ceremony, he leaned close and whispered, your currency. Nothing more. Remember that? The abuse started that first night. He showed me a room in his house with no windows and a lock on the outside. He said that's where I'd live if I caused problems. He monitored my phone calls and read my texts. If I took too long at the grocery store, he'd show up and drag me out by my arm. He'd remind me what his family did to people who betrayed them. How they Made examples of entire bloodlines. He installed cameras in every room except the bathroom. When I showered, he'd bang on the door after exactly 10 minutes. He picked my clothes each morning and inspected me before we left the house. If my makeup wasn't right, he'd wipe it off roughly and reapply it himself. He weighed me every week and controlled my portions at meals. Every week we had dinner at Boris's house. I had to sit silent while they discussed their business like I wasn't there. Drug shipments, territory disputes, names of people who wouldn't be problems anymore. Nikolai would rest his hand on my knee under the table, squeezing harder if I showed any reaction. His mother would smile at me and say things like, such a good girl, knows her place. My parents called once a month to make sure I was being good. They never asked if I was happy or safe. Just reminded me that my father's life depended on my cooperation. My younger sister wasn't allowed to talk to me because they didn't want her getting ideas. The breaking point came when Nikolai brought home another woman. He made me serve them dinner while they laughed and touched each other. When I dropped a plate, he backhanded me in front of her. She laughed and said, is this the debt payment? She's not even pretty. That night, while they were in our bedroom, I sat in the kitchen and realised I'd rather die trying. To escape than live another day as property, I started planning carefully. I saved grocery money in tiny amounts and hid cash and tampon boxes. I memorised bus schedule and studied maps. During my allowed library time, I smiled more, acted docile, made Nikolai believe I was finally broken. It took six months to save enough for a bus ticket to another state. I practiced walking with different postures in the bathroom mirror and studied accents on YouTube videos during my supervised internet time. You belong to us, I had said once. There's nowhere we won't find you. The night I ran, I left during his poker game, when he'd be distracted for hours. I took nothing but the cash and clothes I could layer. I've been putting sleeping pills in his vodka for weeks. Tiny amounts, so he'd be groggy but not suspicious. At the bus station, I threw away my phone and bought a ticket with shaking hands. For 48 hours, I didn't sleep, certain every stop would bring men with guns. I which buses three times and doubled back twice to confuse anyone following. In a truck stop bathroom, I cut my hair with stolen Scissors and dyed it black with a box kit. I traded my coat with a homeless woman and bought men's clothes from a thrift store. By the time I reached my destination, I looked nothing like the girl who'd fled. I ended up in a small mountain town where I got a Job washing dishes under a fake name. For two years, I jumped at every car door slam and every Russian accent. I moved constantly, never made friends, worked jobs that paid cash. I Learned to spot surveillance, bury my roots, and keep emergency bags packed. One day,

I was babysitting my neighbour's twin boys on Halloween night. And looking back, I should have known better. These kids were eight years old, both dressed as vampires, and they had this look in their eyes that screamed trouble. Their parents said they'd be home by 11, handed me 20 bucks for pizza and left me alone with what I can only describe as chaos in tiny costumes. The first hour went surprisingly smooth. We ordered pizza, settled in to watch some Halloween movie, and I actually started thinking this was going to be the easiest money I'd ever made. Then about 20 minutes into the movie, one of the twins said he needed to use the back bathroom. I said sure and went back to watching. Five minutes passed, then 10, and I started getting this uneasy feeling. I called out asking if everything was okay, but got complete silence back. I got up and checked the bathroom, which was totally empty, started going room to room calling his name. And the whole time the other twin was just sitting on the couch with this creepy little smile on his face. I asked him where his brother went and he gave me the most casual shrug I'd ever seen and said he didn't know. I was about two minutes away from calling the police when I heard this faint giggling sound coming from somewhere above me. I Looked up at the ceiling and noticed the attic access panel in the hallway was hanging wide open. That little nightmare was out there laughing at me. I dragged a chair over, climbed up and poked my head through to find him sitting cross legged in the corner eating candy from this huge box. Apparently their parents had stashed last year's Halloween candy up there and forgotten about it. I told him to get down here right now and he looked me dead in the eye and said no. So I made the absolutely brilliant decision to climb all the way up into that attic to drag him down myself. The exact second I got both feet onto the attic floor, I heard his twin brother downstairs drag the chair away from under the opening. Then came the laughing. I was stuck in a dusty attic with an 8 year old eating year old candy while his brother had successfully trapped us both up there. I tried yelling for him to bring the chair back, but he just kept wiggling and running around. The kid next to me looked over and said completely casual, we're trapped now. After about 20 minutes of calling their parents non stop, they finally picked up. I explained that I was literally stuck in their attic and instead of concern, they burst out laughing. They said they were at a restaurant in the next town and would be home in 30 minutes. So I accept.

Lisa scrolled through my Venmo history with her mouth pressed into a thin line. Honey, I think he has been pocketing your money. She printed out the payment history and handed it to me. You need to document everything and probably call the police. I asked Lisa if she could meet me at the apartment that evening when Jason got home from work. I'm not sure if she said yes because she wanted her money or if she just wanted to see what was about to go down. But either way, she showed up. Jason walked through the door and stopped dead when he saw both of us sitting at the kitchen table with printed documents spread out between us. What's going on? He asked, dropping his backpack. Lisa didn't waste any time. You haven't paid rent in three months even though your roommate gave you the money for all of it. I've encouraged him to police report for theft. Jason's face went white. There's been a banking error. My account got flagged. Lisa held up her hand. I don't want to hear any excuses. I already contacted an attorney, Lisa said. I'm evicting you effective immediately. You have 72 hours to leave the property. Jason stared at all of the papers on the table like they might disappear if he looked hard enough. This isn't what it looks like, he said. Then what is it? I asked. He opened his mouth. But nothing came out. Lisa stood up and looked directly at me. You're not responsible for his theft and I'll make sure your credit won't be affected. I'm removing his name from the list today. You can stay if you want or I'll release you from the lease with no penalty. Jason finally found his voice. Come on, we're friends. You're really going to ruin my life over this. I looked at him sitting there next to the gaming console he bought with my rent money. Friends don't steal from each other. Jason opened his mouth to defend himself, but I kept going. I'm filing a police report tonight and I'm sending everything to your parents so they know exactly what you did with their money. Two days later, Jason was gone. His room completely empty, except for the gaming console box in the corner that he apparently couldn't take with him. He had to move into his parents basement.

You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humor, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed. Actually laughed. Said, my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious, but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online, and I gave birth to my son, Tommy, over Christmas break with Jingle Bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse, and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon. Smart, kind. Didn't blink when I told him I had a ten year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold, and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love. Right then, two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to. Because, honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago, and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight A student. Star pitcher for his high school, and I mean, star college. Scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

Don't get me wrong, I love the man. But I've been noticing some weird ass behavior lately. So it's Monday morning. I wake up late as fuck, already annoyed because school exists, right? I'm rushing to get my shit together. I somehow located both my goddamn missing socks and I step out of my room only to hear some high pitched voice coming from my dad's office. Naturally, being a curious idiot, I go check. Worst decision of my life. My dad is on all fours barking at my mother dressed in a fucking maid outfit with cat ears. I'm talking full on submissive mode. My mom is standing over him like a goddamn dominatrix holding a whip, a fucking whip. And then as if I'm the one in the wrong, their eyes go wide and my mom has the audacity to yell, get out and close the damn door, lady, you just permanently damaged your first born. I wish I never took my first breath as a Newborn because then maybe I wouldn't have had to witness whatever the fuck that was. I'm not okay. I need bleach for my eyes and therapy for my soul. Anyways, guys, kale out.

We had this kid in our school named Derek who barely spoke a word, quiet, hoodie up every day, sat alone at lunch, never raised his hand. If you didn't have a class with him, you probably wouldn't even know he existed. But those of us who shared a schedule knew the guy was scary smart, especially at math. He was the kind of kid whose homework got passed around before tests. More than once. A teacher used his assignments as the grading key. Still, he stayed invisible, never bragged, never joined any clubs, never even looked up from his desk unless called on. Then came AP calculus. Our teacher, Mister Hoffman, was infamous. He'd randomly call on students during lectures and mock anyone who didn't have the answer immediately. Not light teasing either, full on public humiliation. He once made a guy cry during a pop quiz review. It was a cold Tuesday morning when it happened. Mister Hoffman was in rare form, tearing through problems on the board, peppering the class with questions like he was trying to thin the herd. Then he turned and called on Derek. Derek, he said, tapping the chalk on the blackboard, let's see you solve this one. He wrote out this monster equation, long, dense, intimidating, just to look at. Everyone turned in their seats. You could feel the room lock into silence. Derek didn't flinch. He stood up, walked slowly to the Board and just stared at it. No twitch, no awkward fidgeting, just calm. Then he reached for the chalk, but instead of solving it, he erased the equation completely and wrote something different. A new equation, same topic, but cleaner, tighter, like it had been debugged by a machine. Then quietly he said, the original problem can't be solved. The equation doesn't make sense in this context. Mister Hoffman froze. Derek turned slightly. You're asking for a real solution, but the function only crosses the axis in imaginary space. It's undefined.

I have a suggestion, he said. Buy the house outright. Put it in your name. Let them live there, but set clear terms. They repay $250,000 in five years or the house stays yours. Three days later, I returned with Daniel and a contract. I will buy this house. You can live here as tenants. To regain ownership, you must repay $250,000 within five years. Emily, I turned to her. You get nothing. Silence. My mother burst into tears. Emily shrieked, are you insane? Making mom and dad pay to live in their own home? I stood up, grabbing the contract. Alright, then forget it. Wait. My father's voice was urgent. They accepted. Two weeks later, the house was legally mine. Then Emily struck back. She posted on Facebook with an old photo of Noah and me. Heartbreaking to have a sister with no shame, a single mother abandoned by her husband, now exploiting our parents for profit. She forced them to sign over the house and kicked me out. She's always been a leech. Hundreds of comments flooded in from people who knew nothing about the truth. But Emily had made a fatal mistake. She dragged my son into this. I called Daniel immediately. Send a legal notice. I want her out of my house in two days. That afternoon, we arrived at the house. Daniel held up documents. Emily Thompson, under property ownership terms, you no longer have the right to reside here. You have 48 hours to vacate. Emily laughed. You're serious? Do I look like I'm joking? She spat. You and your little bastard are just leeches. A pathetic woman abandoned by her husband, pretending to be strong, but still just a miserable failure. Smack. I slapped her across the face. The sound echoed through the room. You can insult me all you want, Emily, but if you ever drag my son into this again, I promise it won't just be a slap. My parents stood frozen silent. Daniel placed the eviction notice in front of her. Sign this or expect a court summons. Emily turned to our parents. Mom, dad, you can't let her do this. They lowered their heads silent. He grabbed the pen, signed with such force it nearly tore the paper and stormed out. You'll pay for this, I shrugged. Try me. The door slammed shut. Full story on the channel linked below.

My wife, Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said. And I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked? Because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping? We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered. Room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. Whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said, let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. Put on this red dress. I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Hands shook when she took them. Paul never. She started, then stopped at dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly, for months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand before. What? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name and she turned it face down. Immediately, I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did, the hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down out of nowhere. Paul Was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused.

She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party. I made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she was. Paul forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie Cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That one night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop. I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together. We talked. I told her. Talked. He's going through a lot. Paul's been distant for months. I watched Stephanie's face change when she realized her best friend was falling for me while she was throwing away our marriage for physical intimacy. The next morning, Stephanie was shaking. We're stopping this immediately. I showed her my phone with all these screenshots Cassie had sent me. Four months of text messages between Stephanie and Paul, including ones from before she ever mentioned swapping. Cassie's known the whole time. I told her she wanted to see if you'd confess. Stephanie's face went completely white. She's filing for divorce. I am, too.

Did you burn your barn down? Yep, the man responded. Why did you do it? It was old and rotten with termites. It was going to fall down, not safe to be kept standing. The man replied, hmm. Have you always burned down old farm buildings? The lawyer asked, yep, I'm a farmer and my daddy was a farmer and he did the same thing before me. The lawyer then asked, are you aware that you need a permit to burn debris in this county? The man replied, my family been doing it like that on this farm. We never had no permit. My farm is located in an active agriculture zone and is exempt from needing a permit to burn down debris. It was at this moment I turned to look at the prosecution's face and their lawyer was damn near going pale. This was already enough to get the man off the hook, but he wasn't done. His lawyer continued, if all of that is true, why, why didn't you tell any of this to the police? The man then cleared his throat. They didn't ask me anything until after they put handcuffs on me and took me to the police station. They told me anything I said would be used against me and said I had the right to remain silent. And then some old idiot lawyer guy came in and said I was going To prison for insurance fraud. I remember I heard people say don't talk to anyone but your lawyer, and so I didn't. The lawyer then asked, do you file an insurance claim? What for? The man responded, the barn wasn't worth anything in that state and I moved all the stuff out beforehand. The prosecution's lawyer had now buried his face in his hands, but still, the man wasn't done. His lawyer asked him, you could have avoided all of this if you had just said that. But you told me you actually wanted your day in court. Why did you want that? Well, because the man said, they came on my land, arrested me without telling me what for, told me later it was for arson and insurance fraud, and put that in the newspapers. All my friends, relatives and neighbors know about this. They made me look dishonest. I want to make sure everyone knows the real facts and knows I'm not a dishonest man. I figured this was a better way of doing that than just getting them to drop it. Defense rests. The case ended up being dropped within the next 20 minutes.

When I showed them the text my fiance sent about my trashy acrylics. I was getting my nails done for my engagement photos the next day. Nothing too crazy, just some almond shaped acrylics with a simple pink and white design. The nail tech, Anna, was putting on the final coat when my phone buzzed. It was a text from my fiance, Kevin. Can you please get normal nails? Those long fake ones look so trashy. My mom's gonna be in the photos and she already thinks you're not classy enough for our family. Just keep it simple so you don't embarrass me. I stared at my phone for like 10 seconds. The whole salon was buzzing with chatter and music, but I felt like everything just stopped. Anna noticed me freeze up and asked if everything was okay. I didn't know what to say, so I just showed her the text. She read it and her face went from confused to angry real quick. Then she did something I wasn't expecting. She turned to the other nail techs and said loudly, hey girls, look at this. Within seconds, I had like six women huddled around my chair, all reading Kevin's message over each other's shoulders. The salon went dead silent. Even the music seemed quieter. One of the older ladies getting a pedicure leaned over and asked what was wrong. Anna just held up my phone and read the text out. Loud to the entire salon. Can you please get normal nails? Those long fake ones look so trashy. I've never heard a room full of women get so mad so fast. This lady named Carmen, who is getting her eyebrows done, started going off about how no man should ever talk to his woman like that. The girl next to me was like, honey, those nails are gorgeous. There's nothing trashy about them. Even the receptionist came over from the front desk. But then Anna did something that changed everything. He looked at me and said, you know what? We're gonna make these nails even better. Before I could say anything, she started adding tiny diamonds to each nail. Then she called over her coworker, Maria, who started painting these intricate little roses on my ring finger. The whole salon turned into like a mission. Carmen offered to pay for the extra designs. The pedicure lady started giving me advice about red flag.

I couldn't move, couldn't speak. Two years later, I bought the company my brother worked for and fired him myself. I woke up from spinal surgery unable to feel anything below my chest. The doctor said I'd walk again in six months. My girlfriend Maya, promised she'd be there every step of the way. She lasted three weeks. Take three. I'm lying in our bed when I hear them. My brother Devon's voice, then hers, laughing. The bedroom door was cracked open just enough. I couldn't yell, couldn't move. Couldn't even reach my phone on the nightstand. Had to lie there and listen to them in our kitchen. He's asleep, Maya whispered. We're fine. Devon laughed, even if he wasn't. What's he gonna do, chase us? They both laughed at that. My own brother. I tried to make a sound. Anything. But my throat was still raw from the breathing tube. Nothing came out except a weak rasp that neither of them I heard. That's when I realized how truly helpless I was. They didn't even try to hide it. After that first time, he'd come over to help with my physical therapy three times a week. While she made dinner, I'd watch them kiss in the kitchen. Reflection from my hospital bed set up in the living room. Devon would adjust my pillows, check my IV fluids, then wink at Maya when he thought I Wasn't looking. Sometimes he'd sit on the edge of my bed and talk about his new promotion at the tech startup he worked for. How he was finally making six figures. How he'd always been the successful one in the family. You understand, right, bro? He'd. Hey, patting my shoulder, Maya needs someone who can actually take care of her. I'd blink once for yes, twice for no. Our system. I blink twice every single time. He just smile. You'll understand eventually. The day I could finally move my fingers, I didn't tell anyone I practiced in secret when they thought I was sleeping. Two weeks later, I could grip things. A month after that, I took my first steps, holding onto the bed frame at 3 a m.

My friends waved at me from across the room and mouth we told you, just give up. But I couldn't. That afternoon, I tried joining him on the track during pe, thinking we could maybe jog and chat together. But the moment he saw me coming, he just sprinted away like I was chasing him down with a machete. For the next few days, it went on like that between us. But here's the thing, the more I annoyed him, the more I started noticing small changes. How on the fourth day of me walking home behind him, he slowed down just enough that I could actually keep up. And when I sat across from him at lunch, he stayed and ate with his headphones in while I rambled about my day. Two weeks in, he finally cracked. When I tripped and fell onto the track, he stopped and bent down to carry me to the side of the grass and asked, what do you want from me? I felt my heart race hearing his voice. I just want to be friends with you, I said simply. He stared at me before letting out a sad laugh. You're crazy, maybe, I shrugged, but you're stuck with me now. Then something crazy happened after that. Whenever I'd walk over to him, he pulled down his headphones and actually chat with me. And slowly I started seeing glimpses of the old Ian The one who'd make sarcastic comments that'd make me laugh so hard I'd snort. The one who'd hold the door open with, without thinking about it. The one whose smile melted everyone in the room. He even started changing at school, talking to others without that edge in his voice. And I felt proud thinking I actually managed to pull him from the dark place like he once did for me. But then he saw it. We were hanging out at the bookstore when Ian reached into my bag for a pen and froze. His jaw tightened as he slowly pulled out the notebook. Why do you have this? He asked quietly. My mouth went dry. I was going to give it back, but he stood up abruptly, the chair scraping loud against the floor. You read it, didn't you? That's why you've been doing all this. I thought you cared, but this was all just some pity party to you. I do care. I stood up, too. My voice louder than I meant it to be. It's started with a notebook, but that's not why I stayed. I took a deep breath. I stayed because I fell in love with you. The words hung in the air between us. His eyes widened, anger melting. He sank back into the chair, the notebook still in his hands. This isn't my notebook. And what he said next made everything click into place. The reason why he became closed off and honestly, It broke my heart more than his answer to my confession.

I was born completely deaf and got my first cochlear implant when I turned 16. My parents had been pushing for it since I was little, but I kept refusing because I was perfectly happy in my silent world. The day they activated my implant was like stepping into an alien universe. Suddenly everything had sound, and I mean everything. The audiologist warned me it would be overwhelming, but nothing could have prepared me for the chaos. The first shot came when I walked to the bathroom after my appointment. I sat down to pee and heard this loud rushing water sound. I jumped up thinking something was broken. My mom had to explain through tears of laughter that peeing makes noise. For 16 years, I thought it was completely silent. But that was just the beginning of my sound discoveries. Walking became this weird symphony. Every footstep made noise on different surfaces, carpet with soft thumps, hardwood with sharp clicks. And don't get me started, on gravel. I spent 20 minutes just walking back and forth on our driveway, amazed that each step sounded like tiny explosions. Eating was absolutely disgusting. I had no idea chewing was so loud and gross. That first dinner, I kept asking my family if they could hear my mouth making all these wet, crunching sounds. They said yes, but you just Learned to ignore it. How do hearing people eat without being grossed out constantly? My cat Oliver became this whole different creature. Apparently, he'd been meowing at me for years and I never knew. The first time I heard him, I thought there was a baby crying somewhere. He also purrs, which sounds like a tiny motor running. Plus, his footsteps on hardwood sound like little tap dancers. The biggest shock came during my first night sleeping with the implant. I kept hearing this rhythmic thumping sound that scared me. I woke up my parents thinking someone was in the house. Dad checked everywhere before realising I was hearing my own heartbeat through the pillow. Nobody told me hearts make noise. School became a nightmare of new sounds. Pencils scratching on paper sounded like nails on chalkboards. Kids clicking pens drove me absolutely crazy. The worst was when people cracked their knuckles. I literally screamed the first time my friend Jake did it, thinking he broke something. But the most embarrassing discovery happened during lunch. I was eating an apple when this girl named Tessa sitting nearby started laughing. I asked what was funny and she said I was eating really loudly. Apparently biting and chewing apples sounds like someone stomping on bubble wrap. I've been crunching away completely unaware that everyone could hear me. The weirdest thing was learning that some of my habits were actually really annoying. I used to tap my fingers on desks when I was thinking. Turns out that Makes noise and had been driving my teachers crazy for years. They just never said anything because they knew I couldn't hear it.

When I found out my classmate plan to take his own life, I decided to help him in the way everyone warned me not to. Ian used to be the guy everyone wanted to hang out with, the type to help freshman with algebra, then turn around and throw spirals with the seniors. The type to sit with the quiet kids because he never wanted anyone to be alone. He never cared that no one asked how he was doing. He just focused on making others happy. But last year, he changed abruptly. He stopped smiling, started getting into fights over nothing. So like everyone else, I kept my distance until he left his notebook in Class 1 Thursday afternoon. I was about to hand it over to the teacher when it fell open. The moment my eyes read what was on the page, it was too late. The handwriting was messy and desperate and the small wrinkled spots were clearly tear stains. It was the words that made my hands shake uncontrollably. I can't do this anymore. Everything hurts too much. I'm so sorry. I felt my breath stuck in my throat. There were pages and pages talking about giving up, about how it'd be easier if everything just stopped. And I wasn't sure what to do. So I went to my friends for Help. My best friend Rica closed the notebook shut and shook her head at me. Look, I know this is bad, but please don't get involved with him. He literally got suspended last semester when he fought one of his old friends and you're practically a stranger to him, she advised. But Ian helped me once. Remember three years ago when I had a panic attack during my presentation? He sat down with me in the hallway and stayed with me until I was done crying. I insist. Ricca let out a sigh while my other friend Maddie forced to smile. We know you'll do it anyway. Just promise you'll walk away if things go south. Okay? I immediately found Ian after school walking toward the parking lot with his hood up and headphones. I chased after him, basically jogging just to keep up. Hey, wait up, let's walk home together. He glanced down at me, but when I grinned at him, he gave an annoyed look and walked faster towards his house. I chased after him anyway, rambling about the weather and homework and literally anything that came to mind. When he turned on his street, I stopped and waved and yelled, see you tomorrow as loud as I could, but he never responded. The next day at lunch, I sat down across from him with my tray and smiled. He stared at me for exactly three seconds before.

They didn't come to my middle school graduation, didn't come to my high school graduation. My aunt was there for everything, cheering louder than any parent in that auditorium. When I left for college at 18, my parents didn't help with tuition, didn't help me move into my dorm. I don't think they even knew which university I attended. My aunt covered everything. Last year, Grandpa got sick, really sick. He kept asking to see his sons. My dad and uncles, aunt called them repeatedly, begging them to visit. None of them came. My aunt moved into his farmhouse to take care of him in his final months. I drove out every weekend to help. When Grandpa died, my dad and uncle suddenly appeared at the funeral, then at the lawyer's office for the will reading. Grandpa left everything to my aunt, his 150 acre farm, the farmhouse and $1 million in cash. The rest went to charity. My dad's face went white. Three weeks later, my aunt called me over. She handed me a check for the full million, said Grandpa would have wanted me to have it, that I'd spent more time with him than any of his actual sons. She told me to start the business I'd always dreamed about. I cried, not because of the money, but because someone actually cared about my dreams. Word got out fast. Within days, my phone started blowing up. Dad suddenly remembered my number. Hey, buddy, how's School. We should catch up. Mom left voicemails about how much she missed me, how proud she was of me going to college. Yesterday, dad showed up at my dorm. I have no idea how he got my address. Probably called my aunt. He stood there smiling, saying how proud he was that I was graduating this year. Asked why I never visited his house anymore. I asked him when he last called me. He went quiet, then laughed it off. You're still mad about the divorce? Come on. That was years ago. We both love you. Your mom misses you. Let me drive you home for dinner. I told him the only family I have is my aunt, that he abandoned me 9 years ago and I wasn't stupid enough have to fall for this. I know why you're here. That million brought you back, right? He put his hands up, said he had no ulterior motives, just wanted to apologize and have me back in his life. Mentioned he heard my graduation was coming up, wanted to make sure he got an invitation this time. That same night, mom left another voicemail, said she and dad couldn't afford college themselves, so they always dreamed I'd go. She's so excited I'm graduating, wants to be there for my big day. They think I'm stupid. They think 9 years of silence can be erased with a few phone calls and fake tears. My graduation is in two weeks. I'm not Inviting either of them.

After her family voted me out, I just nodded. The next morning, their own lawyer called her, his voice shaking. The vote, it didn't remove him. It just triggered Article 11, section B. God help us all. So this happened last week, and I'm still processing everything. I'm 54. Built my tech company from nothing. Literally started in my garage with a broken laptop and a dream. Fast forward 28 years, and we're worth $180 million. Along the way, I married Sarah, 32. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but she seemed genuine back then. The board meeting started normal enough. Sarah, her brother Kyle, my C F O, and six other executives, most of them Sarah's relatives I'd hired over the years. The kind of people who smile at Thanksgiving, check their inheritance behind your back. Sarah stood up first. We've called this vote because leadership needs fresh direction. Her voice was cold. Kyle nodded like a bobblehead. The others wouldn't even look at me. Then came the vote. One by one, hands went up. My own wife voted against me. Seven to one. I was out. Sarah leaned across the table, her new diamond bracelet catching the light. You're not man enough to fight for the company you built, she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, like she'd practiced it. The room went dead silent. Kyle smirked. Jerry from accounting, the guy Whose student loans I'd paid off. Just stared at his coffee. You know what I did? I nodded once, and I stood up, straighten my jacket, and walked out. No yelling, no drama. Just the sound of my shoes on the floor. Sarah looked confused. She wanted to fight. She wanted me to beg. Instead, she got silence. I walked straight to my office, the one they hadn't touched yet. Behind a fake panel I'd installed 28 years ago was a brown leather binder. Inside was the original company charter, the one from before Sarah got her first

Asked them to show up at noon with decorations and cake. Told them to keep it secret that she thought I was out of town. They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy. Said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever. Even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9 a m. With my suitcase, just like I said I would. Waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway. Already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and park three streets over, right where I could see our driveway. Waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:47 a m, a silver BM W pulled up. Didn't recognize the car, but I recognized his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work, the one she'd been texting I miss you, too. At 2 a m, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door. Watched her answer in that same silk robe. Watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:00am, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery. White frosting with pink Flowers that said, happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried A bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready. Told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh. Holding that cake with both. With hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the cake. 32 candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped A cake.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different. Not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protected after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really? The breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it, and there it was. A cheap prepaid phone, still logged into everything. Messages, photos, tell reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront immediately. I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait. Document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played The Perfect Husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an air tight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me. Said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October. Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do, and she got this strange look on her face. Said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home. Maybe order takeout and watch movies. Didn't want to be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. He loves her birthday. Last year, she had a party with 40 people. That morning, I found champagne hidden in the garage. The expensive kind. $200 a bottle. Two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper, tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too. The fancy ones from that boutique store downtown. She always dragged me to. Something in me snapped. But not in an angry way. In a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding. Told them all the same story. I wanted to throw her a surprise.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning, she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she'd just mumble, it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit. Just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favourite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before. Not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14. Lisa, girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser. Dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea. My mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore. They were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed. Always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day, I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different. Scared. Desperate, almost. I know. I know. I'll be there. Her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just. Just. Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird, winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped into defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

I worked at a rage room for three years, seen all kinds of people, angry, ex wives, screaming teenagers, guys who just got fired. But this one guy, he was different. Walks in Tuesday morning around nine, regular jeans, a hoodie, beat up sneakers, maybe early 30s, looked completely normal. Face was just blank, like someone unplugged him from the world. I need your biggest room, he says. How long? I asked. All day if you let me. I explain we do four hour blocks maximum. Eight hours is our limit. He books two sessions back to back, doesn't even ask the price, just slides his credit card across the counter. Then he pulls out a thick stack of, he pays the whole thing in cash instead. He says, I wanna make sure this happens. What are you bringing to destroy, I ask. Killing out the waiver? Nothing, he says. I'll use whatever you have. So I take him to our storage area in the back. We've got tons of donated stuff people drop off. Old furniture, broken TVs, boxes of dishes, electronics, random junk from estate sales, basically whatever people want gone. He starts walking through it slowly touching things, picking stuff up, setting it back down, runs his fingers over an old dining chair, opens drawers in a beat up dresser, holds up a coffee mug, reads the bottom and puts it down. He does this for Maybe 30 minutes. I'm watching him the whole time thinking this guy's either gonna have the best session ever or he's gonna just stand there. Finally he stops in front of this bright yellow plastic toy box, one of those ones with cartoon characters all over it, pulls it out, carries it to the room, doesn't say a word, closes the door behind him. I go to the security room to watch the camera feed. He sits on the floor cross legged, opens the toy box, starts pulling out toys one by one. A stuffed brown bear with a missing eye, three or four toy cars, those wooden building blocks with letters on them, plastic action figures, a dump truck with one wheel missing. He lines every single one up in front of him in this perfect straight row like he's arranging them for a family photo. Then he picks up the bear and just stares at it. I check the time stamp. Ten minutes go by, he's still holding it. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, he hasn't moved at all, just sitting there looking at this beat up stuff bear. Finally he stands up, places the bear back in the toy box so carefully like he's putting a baby down to sleep, closes the lid gently. Everything else, though, he destroys it all. Picks up a toy car, smashes it with a hammer into dust, grabs the action figures, rips them apart, throws pieces against the wall, takes the wooden Blocks, throws them one by one as hard as he can. The sound is constant, just bang, crash, bang, crash, over and over. He's using hammers, bats, sometimes just his bare hands, grinding plastic into the concrete floor. By the time lunch rolls around, his shirt is soaked through with sweat. But he doesn't stop, doesn't even slow down. Goes back to our storage, grabs these old photo albums. We keep them as filler items from estate sales nobody wants. He carries like six of them back to the room, sits down again, opens the first one, looks at every single picture. Random strangers, weddings, birthdays, kids graduating, people who are probably dead now. He studies each one for maybe five seconds and tears it out, rips it to shreds.

He does this for all six albums. Hundreds and hundreds of photos turned into confetti covering the floor like snow. Then he gets up, grabs more stuff from storage, old laptop computer, smashes it. Trophy from some kids soccer team, bends it in half. Picture frames, glass everywhere. He works for the full eight hours, never stops, never sits down except to look at photos. The noise doesn't stop for more than a few seconds at a time. By the end, the room looks like a tornado hit it. Toys scattered everywhere, shattered glass and paper covering every surface. Pieces of plastic and metal ground into powder. But that bear still sitting perfect and untouched in the yellow toy box like nothing happened around it. When his time is up, he comes out. His hands are bleeding through the gloves, knuckles split open, shirt completely soaked. You okay, I ask. He nods, starts walking toward the exit, gets to the door, stops, turns around. My son died six months ago, he says. Car accident. He was 4 years old. I don't know what to say. Just stand there. Everyone keeps telling me I need to move on. He continue. Get rid of his things, donate his toys, stop living in the past. They say I'm not healing, they say I need closure. He looks back at the destroyed room. I can destroy 1,000 toys, he says, but I can't touch his. I can rip apart 100 teddy bears, but not the one he slept with every night. He walks back to the room, picks up the yellow toy box with the bear are still inside, holds it against his chest. Can I buy this from you, he asks. I tell him it's free. Take it. He looks at me for the first time, really looks at me. Thank you, he says. Leaves carrying that toy box like it's made of glass. Walking real slow like he's afraid he'll drop it. I watched him through the front window, put it in his passenger seat, buckle it in like a person, then drive away. Never saw him again. But I kept that exact spot empty in our storage. After that day, whenever we got toy donations, I'd put them somewhere else just in case he came back. He never did.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for 5 years. I'm an engineer making 70 eight K. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 K. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe, Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything. Fifty fifty. Rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible. Red flag. But I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day, I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You abilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow. Okay. Very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money. Always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our Finances. For five years, we never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2. Hey, babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3. My half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detail failed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week four. Can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone just out of curiosity. Meanwhile, I'm actually thriving without her impulse purchases draining our joint account. I'm in.

I've been hosting every single holiday for my husband Nathan's family for five years straight. We're talking 14 people showing up at my house expecting miracles, while his mom, Linda, parks herself in my kitchen watching me cook like she's Gordon Ramsay. Last month when I was preparing a family dinner, she followed me around the kitchen saying things like, that's not how my mother made gravy, but I guess your mother never taught you anything. Then she turned to Nathan's sister Amy and whispered loud enough for me to hear, I don't know why he married someone who can't even cook a proper meal. When we sat down to eat, Linda took one tiny bite of my perfectly roasted chicken into her napkin and announced to the whole table, this is completely dry. I feel bad for my son having to eat like this every night. Nathan just kept shoveling food in his face. Linda kept going, pushing her plate away. My mother would roll over in her grave seeing this pathetic attempt at a family dinner. That's when I set down my wine glass, smiled my sweetest smile and said, you know what, Linda, you're absolutely right. Why don't you show us how it's and make Thanksgiving This year? Everyone froze with their forks in the air. Nathan actually looked up from his plate for the first time. What Linda's face went from smug to panic, but she covered it with this weird laugh. I suppose I could show you all how it's actually supposed to be done. She spent the rest of dinner going on about her mother's secret stuffing recipe and how she'd make everything from scratch. The week before Thanksgiving, Linda called me asking, how many pounds do you think the Turkey should be? Oh, Linda, I wouldn't know since I never Learned to cook properly, remember? She called again asking, what temperature do you cook it at? Gosh, Linda, I just guess since I don't actually know how to cook. The night before Thanksgiving, she called pan making because she just remembered the Turkey needs to defrost. How long does that take? I said, someone with your expertise would know that and hung up. Thanksgiving morning, I rolled up to Linda's at 9 sharp with Starbucks. Linda answered the door already crying and still in her bathrobe. The 20 pound Turkey was sitting in her sink like a frozen bowling ball. It won't defrost, she screamed.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. It's my little video hobby. Had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling. On her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by Longer Pot Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. Dad never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text or Something I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird, quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I, I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope they've been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years.

It feels like a dream come true. I was just thinking about buying something for our unborn baby and already his bald head was piled high with dollar bills. But his attention had already been stolen by the woman next door. He licked his thumb, smoothed out the cash on his head and tried to catch her eye. When she saw all that money, her face lit up instantly. I never thought he could be so heartless. The moment I reached for an apple, he shoved me away, yelling that the house was his and everything in it belonged to him. He screamed at me to get out and threw a half eaten apple right in my face. Afraid I'd touch the apple tree again, he tore it right out of the ground and carried it off in front of me. But he didn't notice. One half eaten apple was left on the ground. I quietly picked it up and hid it. The next day he redecorated the whole house in Goldy gold, filling it with tacky statues, the picture of a newly rich show off. The woman next door saw it all and clung to him, praising his charm and good looks. She wanted money, he wanted beauty. A perfect match, I suppose. Then the smell of grilled chicken drifted into their little romantic moment. It was me barbecuing right nearby. He stormed Over and demanded to know what I was doing, but I wasn't having any of it. He doesn't get to tell me what to do anymore. He acted all high and mighty, bragging that he had enough money to buy the whole town, and told me to get lost. But the very next day he built a huge iron wall right along the edge of the yard.

Soon the flood pushed open his door, filled his burrow and rose higher, carrying him all the way to the surface. Outside, everything had become a vast ocean. The mouse was swept away, losing all sense of direction until he managed to grab onto a branch and save himself. Not long after, he found a rabbit struggling in the current and pulled it up onto a floating log. Just then, the mouse spotted a bird's nest drifting on the water. Without a second thought, he dove in, lifted the nest and began swimming while holding it above his head so the baby birds wouldn't drown. But he himself kept sinking deeper, he decided to climb inside the nest and use a piece of wood as an oar, turning it into a little boat. Together, they drifted across the flooded field until they reached a half submerged house. Inside, he found a table leaning in the corner and placed the nest with the chicks safely on top. To his surprise, there was a basket of eggs on the table. He took an electric hot pot, cracked the eggs inside, lit a match and used a candle to cook them. Soon the food was ready. With a spoon, he fed the baby birds one by one. The smell attracted a black cat. Terrified, the mouse grabbed the chicks and leaped onto a small Stool. As the cat pounced, the stool slipped away like a tiny raft carrying them safely out of the house. Along the way, they found a dog trapped on a rooftop. Kind hearted, the mouse helped free the chain and rescued him. They decided to stay together. The mouse climbed onto the roof of the dog's kennel and soon the current brought a table full of food their way. The dog jumped onto it and shared everything with his rescuer. Their makeshift home drifted toward a large tree that still stood strong wrong where they could finally rest. That night, the mouse slept cuddled with the baby birds inside the dog shelter. The next morning when he woke, the floodwaters had receded. People in the city were already carrying out rescue operations, lowering humans and animals from rooftops with cranes. The mouse took the opportunity to go into the city. In a store, he saw a baby stroller. Delighted, he climbed in, took the stroller food and baby bottles to care for the chicks. But when he returned, he discovered they had disappeared. He looked around and saw a fox running off with a baby bird in its mouth. The mouse jumped onto the fox's back, hold its ears until it released the bird. The furious fox began chasing him. The mouse ran but the road ended at a cliff. Quickly he grabbed onto a route while the fox tumbled over the edge. He had saved the little one he Placed it in the stroller and fed it milk from the bottle. As time passed, the chick grew, developed feathers and turned out to be an eaglet. The mouse took care of everything, even changing its diapers. Each day, the eaglet ate more and grew bigger. Soon, the mouse needed a ladder just to reach its mouth to feed it. Through their time together, the eaglet came to see the mouse as family.

But the next second, something happened that no one could have imagined. The ice cream in her hand really turned into chicken nuggets. And even the bowl of ice cream on the table changed into leftover chicken pieces from the fridge. This was just the beginning. The girl was still wondering what was going on when suddenly her phone rang. It was her best friend Lena Call. She was telling her that she ran into her ex boyfriend on the way. But Ella wasn't interested in her love story at all. So she said, I can't talk right now. But the very next second, her voice actually stopped. No matter how hard she tried, not a single word came out. Then she remembered the ice cream scene. She quickly texted Lena saying, I can't talk. And at that very moment, her voice came back. To check the truth, she sent another message saying, I'm wearing a blue T-shirt. And when she looked down, her T-shirt really turned blue. Now Ella got super excited. She texted, I'm eating pizza for dinner. And right then, the fried chicken on the table turned into pizza. Next, her eyes went to her test paper, and she wrote, I got full marks in my test. And the paper with an F grade instantly changed into an A+. Just then, her phone Rang again asked, why are you sending me these weird messages, Ella? Dejo, you won't believe it. I'm so happy right now. It's like a genie granted my wish. But the moment she said that, something strange started happening.

As soon as the horn blew, the girl playing the fox, Laura, sped off on her cycle. Five seconds later, all the cyclists started chasing her. The hunt had begun. If Laura could stay free until the paint ran out, she would win £600. This time, Laura was the fox. He had always been fast since childhood and loved the thrill of being chased. To confuse the crowd, Laura jumped onto a moving truck. The cyclists followed the paint trail and reached the spot, but suddenly the trail disappeared. Everyone split up to search for her in different directions. A few minutes later, Laura climbed down from the truck, but one of the hunters spotted her from the front. She rode as fast as she could, but the cyclist behind her was closing in quickly. At the last second, Laura made a sharp turn near a bench, and the cyclist lost control, crashing into the grass. Now Laura was alone. She took a deep breath and started riding calmly down the road. Then she noticed a man walking ahead who looked just like her lost father. From behind her, speed slowed as she moved closer, but when she saw his face, he was a stranger. And right then, the door of a parked car in front of her suddenly opened. Laura barely dodged it, but she didn't see the police car. Coming from the side, boom, she crashed straight into it. Not only did she lose the 600 pound prize, but now Laura herself was sitting in the back of a police car.

He hit the brakes and stopped the jet. The squadron leader was shocked because the runway was clear and there was no wall at all. He thought maybe the pilot was just exhausted and imagining things, so he called a military doctor and ordered him to be sent to the hospital to find the truth. Another skilled pilot asked for permission to try a test flight. But as soon as he tried to take off, he too saw the same wall and used the emergency brakes. After landing, he told the squadron leader that there really was a wall. For safety, the leader decided to cancel the mission. But then a third pilot stepped up and insisted on testing it himself. The same thing happened again. He saw the wall and slammed the brakes in fear. The squadron leader got very angry and canceled the test flight plan. He called the best pilot for a serious talk. Even though no accident had happened yet, the leader knew that if the pilots lost confidence, disaster could strike anytime. The pilot agreed the matter was serious, but argued that it was just an illusion because there was nothing on the runway. He thought maybe the whole team was imagining it due to exhaustion. Still, the leader wanted to solve this mystery because it was about the safety of every pilot. They all went into the flight simulation Room! The leader tested many scenarios on the computer, but found nothing unusual. The pilot explained that the wall only appeared during real flights, never in simulations. He insisted on testing at the actual airfield. At once, they went there. The pilot quickly got into the cockpit. The leader worried he might be too tired and cause an accident. But the pilot was determined. He started the fighter jet, and before takeoff, he looked toward the clouds. This time, the test flight was a success. Success! No wall appeared. The team was relieved and happy. Finally, in a meeting, the pilot revealed the truth. There was never a real wall on the runway. What actually happened was that the light and shadows kept changing because of the clouds in the sky. When the pilots were fully focused, those shifting shadows created an illusion on the runway, making it look like a giant wall had suddenly appeared.

Then his partner, Jimmy, faked an asthma attack in front of the prison guard. This way he could not only easily make an impression of the keys on the guard, but also get sent to the infirmary for treatment and make contact with the doctor. Seeing the doctor's damaged car window, Jimmy mentioned he used to be an auto mechanic. To thank the doctor for the asthma medication, he offered to fix the car for free. The doctor happily agreed. Once he got access to the car, Jimmy appeared to be repairing the windshield, but was actually secretly modifying the trunk, preparing for his upcoming escape. On the day of the escape, his partner played an important role again. Since he was a good cook, he often helped out in the kitchen. Using ingredients from the kitchen, he grew a type of hallucinogenic mushroom. Then he ground these mushrooms into powder and secretly put it into the prisoner's food. After constantly stirring, the powder completely blended with the food. The prison guards and prisoners couldn't tell anything was wrong at all. Before long, the drug took effect. Prisoners who ate the food all started hallucinating. The hallucinations made them extremely excited. Some even started dancing wildly. A large number of guards rushed over to maintain order to avoid suspicion. His partner also Pretended to be excited from food poisoning, then cut his palm with a knife. Meanwhile, Jimmy once again faked an asthma attack and was sent to the infirmary. This way, the two could successfully meet up in the infirmary. Since the prisoner's behavior was getting increasingly strange, the prison guards urgently needed help from the infirmary. After receiving the notice, the doctors quickly grabbed their medical kits and rushed to the cafeteria. Now, only Jimmy and his partner were left in the entire infirmary. Jimmy quickly pulled out the nail he had prepared in advance and unlocked both of their handcuffs. Then he found a bottle of liquid nitrogen by the hospital bed and used it to rapidly lower the temperature of the sensor lock, causing it to malfunction and automatically open the ward door. Next, they came to the back door of the infirmary and inserted their homemade key into the lock. But this key was made of soap. If they used too much force, it would break. If they didn't use enough force, they couldn't open the door. Just as the two didn't know what to do, they heard a prison guard's voice from the infirmary. To buy Jimmy more time to pick the lock, his partner decided not to escape. He planned to sacrifice himself and run out to hold off that lustful female guard.

He thought he would fry them in oil, make a tasty snack and sell it. But after frying, the taste turned out bitter and terrible. He kept trying different methods, but every time the result was the same bad taste. Tired and ready to give up, he noticed one seaweed packet lying on the ground. He thought, let's try one last time. This time, when he cooked that sea, the taste was totally different. Slightly sweet and delicious. He realized steam had built up inside the packet because of moisture. Then he remembered this packet got soaked in the rain last night. The extra salt had drained out and that's what made it taste better. So he followed the same process and made new seaweed chips. He packed them nicely and went to give samples to a food company manager. But without even tasting, the manager said, sorry, not interested. Disappointed, he left the box full of seaweed packets there. A little later, a staff member saw the box, took a chip and tried it. The taste was so good, he shared it with others. When the manager was about to leave for home, she saw the last packet on the table. She tasted it and was shocked. The next morning, she called the boy and said, we need 100,000 packets.

His wife's two fingers were crossed in a way that looked like a silent apology to god. This sign meant their marriage wasn't real. The next day, Truman didn't ask his wife directly. Instead, he went close to her, acting normal, trying to find out what she was hiding for all these years. But his wife seemed to already know what Truman was planning. He quickly made an excuse, saying she had an urgent surgery to do. Normally, she wasn't this busy, but today she was acting very different. Seeing this, Truman's doubts became stronger. As his wife was about to leave, Truman casually said, I'll cross my fingers for you. She stopped, looked back, forced a smile, and rushed out. Truman quietly followed her to the hospital, but a nurse stopped him at the entrance. He pretended to leave, but quickly turned and followed the nurse. On the way, a crowd of patients in wheelchairs blocked his path. Truman smartly changed his route. In the corridor, he bumped into a nurse pushing a trolley. He said, let me help you. After crossing all obstacles, Truman finally reached the operating room. But what he saw looked like bad acting. Just as the surgeon was about to begin, the patient who was supposed to be unconscious suddenly sat up. Truman realized this whole setup was fake. His wife wasn't really a doctor. But he had no idea. The lie was this Big. It wasn't just his wife who was. Truman noticed that everything around him was repeating in a pattern. To test this, he started doing strange things. He stopped in the middle of the road to tie his shoe, then sat down and carefully watched the world around him. He finally believed everyone and everything was on a loop. He looked for a break in the pattern and spotted a strange man in the crowd. The man, wearing a cap, was watching Truman closely. But when Truman noticed him, he quickly disappeared. Truman tried to follow, but a bus suddenly stopped in front of him. At that moment, he remembered the next vehicle would be green. He turned with confident and tried to stop the green car. That moment made him believe even more that something was wrong. He suddenly ran into a company building where no one recognized him. People panicked seeing it. When the elevator doors opened, Truman saw it wasn't a lift, but the backstage of a TV set. A security guard told him it was under construction, pushed him out. But this excuse only raised more doubt. After all these strange events, Truman realized he had only seen a glimpse of the truth. In reality, he was living on a giant set. An island called Tao Yun was filled with 6,000 hidden cameras that were broadcasting Truman's life non stop. Two billion people watched his birth and 190 countries saw him learning to walk the ocean. Was fake. The sky was fake. And even the people on the island were fake. They had lived, worked and grown with Truman for 30 years. He lived under the eyes of cameras. Even his wife had given up her youth just to play his wife. The audience was tired of fake expressions and overacting. So a director created The Truman Show, the world's most famous reality show.

On Thanksgiving, I ate Turkey in the garage sitting on a paint bucket while my cousins asked where I was and Robert told them I was feeling sick. Christmas dinner, same thing, except it was freezing and I could hear them opening presents while I ate alone next to the car. My 16th birthday, they had cake in the dining room and Robert said I could join if I promised not to move. But when my shoulder twitched once, he pointed to the garage and said, you know the rules. Last week, my mom's sister came to visit from out of state for the first time in years. She asked where I was during dinner and Robert said I preferred to eat alone because I was self conscious about my condition. My aunt found me in the garage with my plate on a cardboard box and goes, what the hell are you doing out here? I told her everything. Three years of eating alone, being told I was disgusting, being banned from family meals because of something I can't control. She stormed back into the house and started screaming at Robert in front of his kids, his mother who was visiting, and our neighbors who'd come over. You make a child with tourettes eat in the garage? What kind of monster are you? Robert tried to say it was for everyone's comfort and my aunt Goes everyone's comfort. A 16 year old eating alone in a cold garage is comfortable. His mother asked if it was true and when Robert tried to explain his reasoning, she slapped him, actually slapped her own son across the face and said, I raised you better than this. My mom finally grew a spine and said she'd been trying to keep the peace, but she was done. Told Robert either I eat with the family starting immediately or she's filing for divorce and telling everyone in town exactly why. Kids started crying saying they didn't know I was in the garage. They thought I just didn't like them. The younger one goes, dad said she was contagious. Is Tourette's contagious? My aunt said, no, sweetie, but apparently being an asshole is because your dad caught it from somewhere. Neighbors left immediately and I heard them talking outside about how they always thought something was off about Robert. His mother made him apologize, but I said I didn't want his fake apology. I wanted 3 years of eating with my family back. She made him set my place at the table right next to hers and said if he had a problem with my tics, he could be the one eating in the garage. Now Robert has to eat dinner watching me tic as much as I want while his own mother makes sure he doesn't say a word about it.

My stepfather Robert banned me from eating with the family for three years because my tics were disgusting. And yesterday he finally got exposed for the piece of shit he is. I have Tourette's and my tics are mostly motor ones, like shoulder shrugging and head jerking. Nothing crazy. But Robert acted like I was contagious. When he married my mom, I was thirteen, and the first thing he said about my tics was, can't you just stop doing that? It's annoying. My mom explained it's neurological and I can't control it, and he rolled his eyes saying I was probably faking for attention. Started with him making comments during dinner about how my tics were making him lose his appetite. Then he said my shoulder movements were distracting his kids from eating properly. These kids, by the way, are perfect little angels who can do no wrong, even when they're throwing food at each other. But my medical condition is the real problem. Apparently one night my head jerked and I knocked over my water glass and Robert lost it. I was doing it on purpose, and from now on I had to eat after everyone else was done. My mom tried to argue, but he said it was his house, his rules, and if She didn't like it. We could leave. She didn't leave, obviously. She just let him treat me like I had the plague. For three years, I ate alone in the kitchen while listening to them laugh and talk in the dining room. His kids would walk by and make faces at me, saying I was the weird garage kid. Because eventually Robert moved my eating spot to the garage, saying the kitchen was too close and he could still hear my chair moving from my tips. The garage, where we keep the lawn mower and old paint cans. That's where I ate every meal while they had family dinners 20 feet away. My mom would bring me a plate after everyone was done and sit with me for five minutes.

Everyone nodded sympathetically. I sat there silently fork scraping my plate while they took turns lecturing me about compassion and responsibility. That's when I decided enough was enough. I went home and created a presentation. Every single transaction documented, dates, amounts, her stated reasons and screenshots of what she was actually doing with the money. The emergency rent that funded a weekend in Vegas, the car repair that became designer purgers, the utility Bill that turned into a spa day. I even included her text messages. You're loaded. Just send it. I'll get you back. And my personal favourite, stop being such a tight ass. It's just money. I added a timeline showing the pattern, how she'd wait exactly 3 weeks between requests, how the amounts gradually increased, how she'd love bomb me with sweet messages right before asking for cash. The manipulation was mathematical, calculated, deliberate. The following Sunday, we had our monthly family gathering. After dinner, I connected my laptop to their TV. Monica was mid sentence talking about some new financial struggle when I interrupted. Before anyone sends her money, I think you should see something. I hit play. The spreadsheet appeared first, that massive 47,000 dollar total in red. Gasp echoed around the room. Then came the side by side comparisons. Her emergency my transfer, her Instagram post celebrating. One after another after another. My parents went pale. My aunt's jaw dropped. Monica started shouting, you're Twisting everything. That's not fair. This is harassment. I let the presentation finish. The final slide showed her recent text where she called me a selfish prick for refusing the transmission money, right next to her Facebook post from that same day showing her new 800 dollar handbag. Dad looked at Monica. You told us he never helped you. Mom's face crumbled with realization. My aunt actually apologized to me. Monica stormed out screaming about betrayal and how I ruined her life. She's blocked me on everything. My parents have started asking her for receipts before helping her financially. Last week, I got a text from my cousin, thank you. She was doing the same thing to me.

So I exposed her. I've been my sister Monica's a t m for 15 years. It started small when we were teenagers. Can you spot me $20 for gas? I'll pay you back Friday. Friday never came. But I let it slide because that's what siblings do, right? By our 20s, it escalated. $200 for car repairs, $500 for rent when her roommate bailed, $1,000 for emergency dental work that turned out to be cosmetic veneers. Every time I hesitated, she'd explode. You're my brother. You're supposed to look out for me. What kind of person are you? The guilt worked perfectly and she knew it. Last year, Monica called at eleven PM crying her utilities were getting shut off. She had twin toddlers and couldn't let them freeze. I transferred $600 immediately. Two days later, I saw her Instagram story. She was at a spa resort with her friends, champagne glasses clinking, caption reading, self care Sunday because I deserve it. Something snapped. I've been tracking every loan in a spreadsheet since 2,019, mostly to see when she'd pay me back. Spoiler, she never did. The total was $47,000. $47,000 over 15 years. I made decent money as an engineer, but that was a down payment on a house. That was my future. I'd handed over one guilt trip at a time. I decided to stop the next time she called asking for $2,000. To fix her transmission. I said, no, the explosion was nuclear. He screamed so loud I had to hold the phone away from my ear. You selfish bastard. I've been there for you your whole life. Mom was right about you. You've always been cold. When I wouldn't budge, she hung up and immediately called our parents. Within an hour, I had five missed calls and a group text. Mom wrote, your sister is in crisis and you're playing games with money you don't even need. Dad added, we raised you better than this. Disappointing. My aunt chimed in. She's your sister, not a stranger off the street. The next family dinner was unbearable. Monica played the victim perfectly, dabbing her eyes while explaining.

I froze with a box cereal still in my hand. What? No, these are my daughters, I said, trying to keep my voice calm. She yanked me closer and screamed louder. Mia, Olivia, it's mommy. Tell this man to let you go. My blood went cold because she just said my daughter's names, the exact names. Mia was staring at this woman with huge confused eyes and Olivia started crying. I tried to pull away, but the woman's other hand grabbed my cart, blocking me from moving. I don't know who you are, but you need to let go of me right now, I said. And my voice came out shakier than I wanted. Other shoppers were closing in now and I heard someone say they were calling the police. And older man in a baseball cap stepped between me and the woman telling her to calm down. But she shoved past him like he wasn't even there. Look at them, she screamed, pointing at my daughters with a shaking finger. That's my Mia with the blonde hair and the birthmark on her left ankle. That's my Olivia with the brown curls in the scar above her right eyebrow from when she fell off the changing table. My stomach dropped because Mia did have a birthmark on her left ankle and Olivia did have a tiny scar above her eyebrow that my wife Vanessa always said came from bumping into the crib when she was learning to stand. How did this stranger know these things? Security is coming, the teenage employee announced from somewhere behind me. But the woman didn't seem to care. She was crying now, mascara running down her face in black streaks. I reported them missing three years ago, she said, and her voice broke. Police said they probably drowned in the lake, but I never believed it. I knew someone took them. I knew it. She reached toward Mia, who shrunk back in the shopping cart and started crying, too. I put myself between them, my hands up like I was trying to calm a wild animal. Listen, there's been a mistake, I said. My wife gave birth to both of these girls. I was there. I have birth certificates and hospital records and everything. The woman laughed, but it sounded more like choking your wife, she repeated. The way she said it made my skin crawl like when you lick a battery. Where is your wife right now? I hesitated because Vanessa was at home and sent me shopping. She's at home, I said, and immediately regretted how defensive I sounded at home, the woman repeated. She was nodding like I just confirmed something terrible. And I bet she's the one who told you their names were Mia and Olivia, I bet she's the one who knows all about their birthmarks and scars. Security arrived, then two. Guys in black polo shirts who looked barely older than the teenage employee. They positioned themselves on either side of the woman and asked what was happening. She whirled on them immediately. This man kidnapped my daughters three years ago, and I want them back right now. One of the security guards looked at me with this expression.

Sir, are these your children? He asked. Yes, these are my daughters, I said, pulling out my phone. I can show you pictures, documents, whatever you need. But the woman cut me off. They'll have fake documents. That's what kidnappers do. They create whole new identities. The security guard held up his hand. Ma'am, the police are on their way. Let's just wait for them to sort this out. But the woman wasn't listening anymore. She was staring at Olivia with this look of pure anguish. She doesn't even recognize me, she whispered. You made her forget her own mother. Mia was crying harder now, calling for me. And I wanted to just grab both girls and run, but I knew that would make me look guilty. So I stood there with my heart pounding while shoppers formed a wider circle around us, everyone recording on their phones. The police arrived within five minutes, two officers who immediately took control of the situation. They separated me from the woman, putting her with one officer near the produce section and me with another near the registers. The officer with me asked for my ID and I handed it over with shaking hands. Can you tell me what happened here, he asked. And I explained about reaching for cereal and this woman grabbing me. I told him she somehow knew my daughter's names and details about their bodies that seemed impossible for a stranger to Know and these are your biological daughters, he asked. Yes, I said. Then caught myself. Well, my wife gave birth to them. I adopted them legally when we got married four years ago. The officer's pen paused. So they're not biologically yours? The way he asked made it sound like an accusation. No, but I'm their legal father. I have all the paperwork at home. The officer nodded slowly and walked over to confer with his partner. I watched them talk to the woman who was gesturing wildly and cry. Fine. After a few minutes, they came back together. Sir, this woman claims these children match the description of her daughters who went missing three years ago from a lakehouse in northern Michigan, the first officer said. She says they disappeared during a family vacation and were never found. My mouth went dry. That's impossible. My wife had Olivia 4 years ago and Mia 6 years ago. I was there for both births. But even as I said it, doubt crept in because I actually wasn't there for the births as I had both girls before we met. She'd been a single mom when we started dating 5 years ago and I'd fallen in love with her and the girls as a package. I'd never questioned their origin because why would I? Can you prove you were there for the births, the second officer asked, and that's when things got out of control. Full story is linked below or on My channel.

She posted videos of us at sleepovers without permission. One day, Olivia's mom called and said Olivia couldn't be my friend anymore. She said my mom was being inappropriate and wouldn't stop filming even after being asked multiple times. I cried for weeks. My mom didn't care at all. She just said she would find me new friends for the channel. The worst part was we had zero privacy ever. My mom filmed us in the bathtub when we were younger. She tried to delete those videos later, but people had already downloaded them. They're still online somewhere and I can't do anything about it. When I got my period at 12, I begged her not to tell anyone. She made a whole video about it the same day. She showed the pads I used. She talked about my cramps. She read my text messages to my friends on camera. I wanted to die. Last year, something happened that finally made them stop. My little sister almost got kidnapped. She was walking home from school and this guy, I came up to her. He knew her full name. He knew where we lived. He knew what school she went to. He knew everything about her because my parents posted everything online. My sister didn't think he was a stranger because he knew so much about our family. She almost got in his car. A teacher saw and stopped it. Just in time, the police came to our house. I told my parents they were putting us in danger. My mom had a complete breakdown. She deleted the channel. But the damage was already done. My sister had panic attacks for months. She still can't walk anywhere alone. And my relationship with my mom is basically dead. I barely talk to her now. She keeps trying to apologize, but it doesn't fix anything.

My parents started filming everything when I was seven. At first I thought it was cool. We had a channel with over 500,000 people watching us. I got more toys than any other kid at school. I got to stay home from school sometimes to film special videos. Other kids would recognise me at the grocery store and ask for pictures. For a while, I actually loved it. But then I started noticing things. My mom only hugged me when the camera was recording. My dad only asked about my day when he was holding the camera. If I wanted a new toy, I had to perform for it first. Do a funny dance, pretend to be surprised, act excited, even when I wasn't. The cameras were everywhere in our house. Kitchen, living room, even our bedrooms. My mom would wake me up every single morning with a camera in my face, saying good morning to the viewers. She filmed us eating breakfast, getting ready for school, doing homework, everything. When I was 10, I realized the only place I could change clothes without worrying about cameras was the bathroom with the lights completely off. My younger sister did the same thing. We would sit in the dark bathroom just to have one private moment. And then we weren't sure if there were cameras hidden in there too. Around that time, my mental health started getting really bad. I couldn't sleep. I was anxious all the time. I wanted to talk to my mom about it, but I knew if I did, she would just film it and put it online. One time I tried anyway. I told her I was having bad thoughts and didn't want to go to school. She grabbed her phone and started recording me crying. She said the viewers would want to send me support. I never told her anything personal again. My mom also wanted to homeschool us. So she could film during the day instead of just mornings and nights. My dad talked her out of it, thank god. But school wasn't safe either. My best friend since kindergarten was a girl named Olivia. We did everything together, but my mom kept filming her without asking her parents

Cindy stops mid rant. What? You're Cindy from state? We had bio together senior year. You sat three rows behind me. I look at Amy. She never told me she knew Cindy. Amy continues, I remember you because you were always doodling hearts with your boyfriend's name in your notebook. Brandon, right? You even had his name tattooed on your wrist during spring semester. The color drains from Cindy's face. She instinctively pulls her left hand behind her back. I find my voice. Cindy, show me your wrist. That's none of your business. This is about our son. Show me your wrist. The kid suddenly pipes up, his little voice shaking. Mommy, why won't you show him Daddy Brandon's name like you showed me? Everything stops. Cindy grabs the kid's hand and starts backing away down our driveway. He doesn't understand. He's confused. But Amy's not having it. She's livid. Now you're trying to commit fraud. That's illegal. We're calling the cops. I pull out my phone and actually start dialing. That's when Cindy completely breaks down. She drops to her knees on our driveway, still holding the kid's hand and starts sobbing. The kid's crying too. Now. Confused and scared air through tears, she admits everything. Brandon got her pregnant about six months after we broke up. He took off the second she told him. She's been struggling as a single mom, barely making rent. Last month she lost her job. She saw my LinkedIn profile. A few weeks ago. I'm a software engineer now, making good money. She saw I was married, had a nice house. She thought if she showed up and played it right, made a scene, I might just pay her to go away rather than deal with the drama. She figured I wouldn't remember the exact timeline or that I'd be too scared to push back. She never expected Amy to recognize her, never expected the Brandon tattoo to come up. Amy called the police while Cindy was confessing. They showed up about 10 minutes later. Cindy's being charged with attempted fraud and extortion. CPS took the kid temporarily until they can find family members to take. The cops told us this apparently isn't even the first time she's tried this. She's hit up two other ex boyfriends in the past year with similar stories. I feel terrible for that kid. None of this is his fault. But I'm also just angry. Angry that she tried to blow up my life. Angry that she traumatized her own son. Angry that 7 years later she's still causing chaos. Amy's been incredible through all of this. I'm so grateful she was there and recognized Cindy. I don't know what would have happened if I've been alone.

Fast forward 16 years. I'm 32, work in it six figures, own a house, married to Melody. Dad's retired and happy. We talk multiple times a week. Then Anna calls out of nowhere. Mom and Angelo need to go into assisted living, $4,000 a month. Their pension covers half. We're thinking the four of us kids could each chip in $500. Four kids. I said, I'm not Angelo's kid. Come on, Parker, he's getting old. Mom stressed out of her mind trying to coordinate all this. Angelo made it clear when I was 16 that I wasn't family. I was a tenant. So I left. That was 16 years ago. You're still holding on to that? Yep. And by his own logic, he should have saved better responsibility and all that. Bryce called next in guilt trip, different person. Then mom crying, begging, then Angelo himself. I'm asking you man to man. Angelo said, we're not men to each other. We're nothing. I'm sorry. Alright? Is that what you want to hear? And there it was. The apology I've been waiting for since I was sixteen. Only it came 16 years too late. Only because he needed something from me. Your apology means nothing because it's not real. You're not sorry you did it. You're sorry it's biting you now. If you actually sorry, you would have reached out years ago when you didn't need anything. Your mother is going to suffer because Of your pride. My mother is going to suffer because of choices she made 16 years ago. The calls kept coming. Anna tried visiting my house. Bryce called melody directly to convince her to convince me I could afford the $500 wouldn't even register in our budget. Melody and I are comfortable. Every time I started to feel guilty, I remembered being 16, working until closing, stressed about money while his kids lived in comfort. I remembered my mom sitting silent at that dinner table, choosing him over me. They had 16 years to make this right, 16 years to apologize, to rebuild. They didn't. Not once. Last I heard, they sold the house, moved somewhere cheaper. Anna and Bryce stopped paying after realizing I wasn't budging. And me living my best life with people who actually treat me like family. Angelo wanted to teach me responsibility. He did. I just Learned who actually deserves it.

So I moved in with my dad. Years later, my stepdad wants me to help with his retirement home bills because they wouldn't. I was working weekends at a grocery store, trying to save for college. Angelo, my stepdad, called a family meeting. His kids, Anna and Bryce, sat there smirking. They got $50 and $40 weekly allowances just for existing. I worked 15 hours a week making minimum wage. Time to start paying rent. Angelo announced $300 a month. I actually laughed, thought it was a joke, but he was dead serious. Real world, son. Time to learn responsibility. My mom just sat there silent. That's when I knew she'd already agreed to it. Does Anna pay rent? I asked. Different situation. She doesn't have a job. She gets free money every week. That's an allowance, not income. The logic was insane. His kids got paid to exist. I had to pay to exist. I did the math that night. 300 dollars out of my 450 dollar monthly paycheck. I'd have nothing left for gas, my phone Bill, food, college, savings. Nothing. I'd be working just to live in a house where two other kids got paid to breathe. Meanwhile, Anna was planning her Sweet 16 party with money she didn't earn. So I called my dad. He lived 45 minutes away. We split when I was 10, but stayed close. When I told him about the rent, he went quiet. $300 from a 16 year old? Is he insane? Then pack your stuff, kid. You're coming home. Took me 2 weeks to move everything out quietly. Didn't make a scene. Just left a note on my bed. Moved in with dad. Thanks for the life lesson, Angelo. Mom called the next morning, absolutely freaking out. Angelo got on the phone, too. Running away proves my point about responsibility. I'm proving I don't have to put up with garbage. Make Anna pay rent. If it's such a great lesson, I hung up. Life at Dad's was completely different. No rent, just real responsibilities. Cooking three nights a week, actual chores we did together. Conversations about budgeting that didn't involve taking my money. He matched my car savings dollar for dollar. Taught me to change oil, fix brakes, rebuild engines. We'd spend weekends in the garage talking about life while working on my rusted Honda Civic. He showed up at my graduation crying. Said he was proud of how I turned out. Mom sent a card with $50 in it.

My therapist fell asleep during our session. Full on snoring with his mouth wide open while I was talking about my divorce. I sat there frozen for two minutes watching him sleep before I grabbed my stuff and left. I found him on some discount directory. Forty bucks a session. Took my insurance. Evening appointments. His office was in a strip mall between a nail salon and a vape shop, blasting Bob Marley. Waiting room had three chairs, one with duct tape and people magazines from 2019. First session seemed fine. Asked standard questions about my childhood and marriage. Took notes on a yellow pad. Second session he was chugging Red Bull and checking his phone every few minutes. Third session he walked in 18 minutes late, wearing the same wrinkled shirt from last week with a coffee stain on it. But I kept coming because starting over and explaining everything again felt exhausting. Session four changed everything. I was describing walking in on my ex, spent with my younger sister in our bed. Really painful stuff. Going through the cheap, scratchy tissues on his desk. I looked up and his eyes were shut. Figured maybe he was concentrating. Then I heard a derattling snore. Head leaning back, mouth hanging open, completely out. I said his name. Nothing. That it? Louder. Still nothing. I sat there 90 seconds staring, mascara streaking down my face, watching my therapist sleep during my breakdown. Part of me Wanted to throw the tissue box at him. Instead I stood up, grabbed my purse and walked out. His secretary was in the lobby with AirPods and scrolling TikTok. Didn't even look up. Drove home squeezing the wheel so tight my hands hurt. Started writing the angry Google review in my head. Thought about reporting him to the licensing board. Got home and there was a voicemail time stamped six minutes after I left. He was crying on it. Actually sobbing like a child. His nine year old daughter was in the ICU at Children's Hospital with bacterial meningitis. Been awake at her bedside fifty two straight hours watching her hooked up to breathing machines and IV drips. Dragged himself to work because he had six clients scheduled and his family desperately needed the copay money. His wife had quit her job to stay at the hospital full time. They were barely scraping by. Didn't even realize I left. Just woke up to an empty room. The voicemail was four full minutes long. He apologized eleven times, already refunded my copay. Gave me three other therapist names he respected. Voice kept cracking every few words. I listened three times in my car. Kept picturing him waking up to nobody there. His daughter fighting for her life two miles away. Still beating himself up over disappointing a patient he barely knew. His daughter pulled through after nine days. I know because I sent flowers to the pediatric ICU car.

All you have to do is stop hitting yourself. Why won't you stop hitting yourself? His eyes started twitching and his jaw clenched. I can see him trying so hard not to react, but I just kept slapping him with his own hand until finally he grabbed my wrist and shot up screaming, I will end you. Everyone at the funeral absolutely lost their minds when my dead brother sat up in his coffin and started trying to strangle me. My grandma threw her purse at him and screamed zombie before running straight into a wall and knocking herself out cold. My uncle started recording but dropped his phone in the holy water while backing away and yelling, the power of Christ compels you. Everyone else stampeded toward the exits, knocking over flower arrangements and stepping on each other like it was Black Friday at Walmart. In the 2, Nate was climbing out of the casket yelling. I can explain. My mom tried to fake faint for sympathy, but nobody caught her. So she just kind of laid there on the floor pretending to be unconscious while obviously peeking through one eye. Nate chased me around the funeral home screaming about how I ruined everything while the funeral director just stood there in complete shock. The funeral director called the cops, the insurance company and probably his therapist. It turns out my mom was in on the whole thing and they were going to split the life insurance money and move to another country. They're both getting charged with fraud and I'm getting uninvited from Christmas for the next decade. But watching my brother rise from the dead just to try to murder me was honestly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.

I'm just so moved by your strength. This is such a big step, and I'm honored to be part of your journey. I mumbled thanks while staring at a purple dress covered in ruffles. I heard her moving around behind me, opening drawers and getting things ready. She took a deep breath. Okay, let's get started. Then I felt something cold and vibrating press against the top of my head. I looked up from my phone at the mirror and watched a huge stripe of bare scalp of here where my hair used to be. I screamed and dropped my phone. What are you doing? She jumped back with electric clippers buzzing in her hand. I'm shaving your head like you asked. I grabbed my head where I could feel cold air on my scalp. I wanted bangs. Just bangs. Her face went completely white. You're not Rebecca, the woman doing the cancer fundraiser. We both started yelling. The receptionist ran over, freaking out. Apparently, Rebecca had canceled her appointment last minute to shave her head for charity. And nobody. He told the hairdresser, we have the same first name. The hairdresser kept saying, oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! While I stared at my reflection in horror. There was a massive bald stripe right down the center of my head. The hairdresser started hyperventilating. We can't leave it like this. We have to finish or you'll look insane. I sat there sobbing while she shaved the rest of my head. Six years of growth gone in 10 minutes. The manager came out offering to comp everything and giving me free products I didn't want. The hairdresser was crying harder than I was. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I thought you knew all those things I said. I have a huge work presentation in two days where I'm trying to get promoted to senior director. My sister's wedding is next weekend, and I'm the maid of honour. Every single photo is going to be me with a completely bald head. The manager offered me a free wig from their supply closet, but it looked like something from a dollar store. I drove home crying so hard, I had to pull over twice. When I got to my apartment, my boyfriend opened the door and his face went completely white. Oh, my god, what happened? Are you sick? I explained the whole nightmare through sobs. He pulled out his phone and looked up the salon, then the hairdresser's name. He found her Instagram, and his face changed. He turn the phone toward me, and there she was in dozens of photos with my ex boyfriend. The ex boyfriend who told me he'd make me regret leaving him. My boyfriend looked at me. Do you think this was actually an accident? I wiped my tears and got back in my car with my boyfriend, ready to drive to that Salon full story on channel linked below.

I walked into this fancy new salon downtown for a simple haircut. I've been growing my hair for six years, and it was down to my waist, but I wanted a trim and maybe some bangs. I sat down in the chair, and the hairdresser walked over. She looked at my hair with this intense, emotional expression and put her hand over her heart. Wow, you are so brave for doing this. I laughed awkwardly because that seemed like a weird thing to say about bangs. She asked if I was ready for a big change, and I said yes, assuming we were talking about the same thing. She got tears in her eyes. Actual tears. I just want you to know that you're an inspiration. I had no idea what to say to that, so I just smiled and pulled out my phone to check my messages. She kept talking while she moved around behind me. You're going to feel so free after this. No light. It's really a beautiful thing you're doing. I nodded along while scrolling through Instagram, thinking this woman was really passionate about bangs. My sister had texted me three times about her wedding next week, asking if I picked up my bridesmaid dress yet. I started typing a response. The hairdresser touched my shoulder gently. I think what you're doing is so powerful. It takes real courage. I looked up and smiled lightly, wondering why she was being so dramatic about a haircut. Thanks. I appreciate that. My phone buzzed again. My boss wanted to know if I'd finished the presentation for our meeting on Thursday. I opened my email and started scrolling through the slides I needed to review. The hairdresser kept making small talk while she ran her fingers through my hair. Do you have a good support system? Family and friends who are there for you? I glanced up briefly. Oh, yeah, my family is great. She nodded like I'd said something profound. That's so important, you're going to need people around you. I had no idea what she meant by that, but I was distracted by another text from my sister. She'd sent seven bridesmaid dress options, and they were all hideous. I started scrolling through them, trying to figure out how to tell her I hated all of them without

My brother Nate told us he was dying of cancer six months ago. He shaved his head, lost weight, and my mom was bawling her eyes out for weeks. My dad started drinking again and everyone started treating Nate like he had paper skin and glass bones. He kept saying he only had 3 months to live and started this whole bucket list thing where we all had to spend quality time I'm with him before he died, which mostly involved us taking him to dinner and paying for his meals. I started getting these weird feelings that something was off, but everyone said I was just in denial about losing my brother. I, I saw that Nate ordered camping gear on Amazon when he was supposed to be bedridden. But my mom said he probably ordered it before he got sick and forgot to cancel. One time I even saw him at the gym after he told everyone he was too weak to get out of bed. When he saw me, he tried to hide behind a treadmill, even though he's 6 foot 2. When that didn't work, he tried to tell me he was there for physical therapy, but he was lifting weights and drinking a protein shake. I tried to tell my family, but they said that sometimes sick people get random bursts of energy and I shouldn't judge how he spends his final days. My mom Was also crying all the time, but I swear sometimes it seemed fake. When I mentioned it to my aunt, she said grief makes people act strange and I needed therapy. My cousin told me I was being cruel and that I would regret doubting everyone when Nate was actually gone. Everyone kept telling me I was losing it and maybe they were right. Nate died last week and at the funeral, everyone was sobbing while I sat there convinced it was all fake. They had him in an open casket and everyone was talking about how much they loved him while I sat there studying his face for signs of.

I started writing them all down in my phone with time stamps and everything. Then yesterday we're at his friend's birthday party and I'm telling a story about my coworker. I said she was about 30 years old. And Jake immediately goes, actually she's 32. I looked her up on LinkedIn in front of everyone. His friend Tom goes, dude, why do you know her exact age? That's weird. And Jake starts arguing with Tom about how it's not weird to be accurate. I saw my opening and said, you know what, Jake, you're absolutely right about everything. You're right that I'm too emotional. You're right that I don't understand movies. You're right that I can't count birds correctly. You're right that I don't know when I'm hungry. And you're especially right when you said last week that we're not compatible. He stops mid argument with Tom and goes, wait, what? I never said that. I pulled out my phone and read from my notes. Tuesday, 8:47 p. M, you said we're not compatible because I don't appreciate intellectual discourse. Wednesday, two fifteen PM, you said we're not compatible because I'm too sensitive. Thursday, six thirty PM, you said we're not compatible because I don't challenge you mentally. Should I keep going? The whole party was silent and Jake starts doing what he always does, arguing that those comments were taken out of context and He didn't mean it like that. I said, oh, so now you want to argue about your own words. Cool. Let me read the other 70 corrections you made this week. No. 1, Monday morning, you said my coffee order was wrong and I should get Americano instead. No. 2, Monday afternoon, you explain that my favorite color isn't actually purple, it's lavender. Number three, he tries to interrupt, saying this is ridiculous and embarrassing. I said, what's embarrassing is dating someone who thinks his girlfriend is wrong about literally everything, including her own favorite color. You know what you're right about, though? We're not compatible. I'm breaking up with you. He immediately starts arguing that I can't break up with him at his friend's party and that's not how relationships work and we need to discuss this. I said, oh, now you wanna discuss something instead of just telling me I'm wrong. Too late. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll find someone else to correct, maybe someone who doesn't know what color they like or when they're hungry or how many birds they saw. Good luck with that. Tom actually started clapping and goes, finally, someone shut him up. He does this to everyone. Jake tried to follow me out, still arguing about why I was overreacting and making a mistake. I said, you're right. It was a mistake dating. You see, I can admit when I'm wrong, can you?

Each square had a memory attached. Took me four months, but I also bought a cheap seventy dollar bracelet from the mall. Gave her the quilt first, and she does her usual oh, that's sweet, honey, and sets it on the floor by her chair. Then I give her the bracelet in a fancy box and suddenly she's excited, showing everyone, going on about how I finally understood what she wanted. I said, mom, the quilt took me four months. The bracelet took me four minutes. Which one do you think has more thought? She goes red and says, well, it's not about time, it's about the gesture. I said, then where are all my gestures from the past 10 years? Everyone at the party gets quiet, and Jason tries to change the subject, but I'm not done. The scrapbook is under tax papers, the blanket is in the garage, the painting is behind garbage in the guest room. The cookbook is in the basement. But Jason's vase you hate is on the mantle. Emma's purse you never use is displayed on a shelf. Every expensive thing they buy gets showcased, while everything I make gets hidden. My aunt goes, is this true? And starts walking around the house, finding my gifts in closets and corners and forgotten spaces. Pulls out the portrait from the guest room and goes, you painted this? This is beautiful. Why is it hidden? My mom starts making excuses about not having the right space or waiting for the perfect spot, but my grandmother cuts her off. You display that hideous vase, but hide a hand painted portrait of our family home? What's wrong with you? My cousin finds a ceramic dish I made in a pottery class being used to hold screws in the garage, while Emma's store bought China is in the display cabinet. Mom starts crying, saying we're ganging up on her, but grandmother goes, you're crying because you got caught, not because you feel bad. I said, keep the bracelet, mom. It's more your style anyway. Everything else I'm taking back, since you clearly don't want them. Spent the rest of the party collecting every single handmade gift from their hiding spots. Grandmother helped me pack everything and said, next time just get her a gift card, since that's all she values anyway.

So I tested it out on her birthday. Every holiday, every birthday, every Mother's Day, I put actual thought into my gifts. I made her a scrapbook that took three months to collect photos and write memories. Knitted her a blanket with her favorite colors that I spent weeks perfecting. Painted a portrait of her childhood home from an old photo she loved. Meanwhile, my brother Jason buys whatever expensive crap the salesperson suggests, and my sister Emma just transfers money with a generic card. But guess what's displayed in the living room? Jason's five hundred dollar vase that doesn't match anything. Emma's designer purse mom never uses because it's too heavy. The expensive jewelry she doesn't wear because it's not her style. My stuff shoved in the hallway closet with winter coats and old umbrellas. Found the scrapbook under a pile of tax documents. Blanket was in the garage, still in the gift bag I gave it in. The painting was literally facing the wall in the guest room behind a broken lamp. When I asked her about it, she'd say she was keeping them safe or saving them for special occasions or didn't want them to get damaged. But Jason's ugly abstract art he bought drunk at an auction is hanging in the entryway where everyone sees it. Emma's overpriced candles that smell like chemicals are on every surface. Their gifts were apparently damage proof. My Handmade stuff needed Protection by being hidden away. Last Christmas, I watched her open my gift, which was a cookbook I made with all her mother's recipes that I spent months collecting from relatives. She goes, oh, how nice, and immediately puts it aside. Opens Jason's gift, which is an expensive kitchen gadget she'll never use, and goes, oh, my goodness, this is incredible, Jason, you're so thoughtful. Takes 50 photos, post about her amazing son, gets teary eyed about how blessed she is. My cookbook went straight to the basement. That night, I checked. Her birthday was yesterday, and I decided to test something.

He walked to the refrigerator and pulled out the steak he'd brought home for himself last night. Watch this, he said, taking a huge bite in front of me.

He left me everything but the real inheritance was a truth that changed everything. My dad married Victoria when I was 16. She was 28, he was 52. Everyone whispered gold digger. But dad was happy. For the first time since mom died, I wanted him to be happy, so I kept quiet about the bad feeling in my gut. Victoria had this way of being sweet when dad was around and cold when he wasn't. She'd make comments. Father so generous, too generous. Sometimes her smile never reached her eyes. By the time I turned 18 and left for college, she'd basically taken over his life. New friends, new hobbies, new everything. Dad was a successful commercial real estate developer, not billionaire rich, but comfortable. Over the next eight years, I watched from a distance as Victoria slowly isolated him. Family gatherings became rare. Phone calls got shorter. When I visit, she'd hover, checking her watch, making dad feel guilty for taking too much time away from their plans. Last November, Dad collapsed at dinner. Heart attack. He survived but barely. The doctor said his heart was severely damaged. As I sat in that hospital room watching him sleep, Victoria appeared in the doorway. We need to talk about his care and his finances, not how is he doing or I'm so scared, just business. That's when I started paying attention. Over the next three months, I noticed Things. Victoria handling all his medications personally. Her keeping detailed notes about his daily routine. Her asking pointed questions about life insurance policies when she thought I wasn't listening. Coldness in her eyes when she looked at him. Then dad asked to see me alone. He looked thinner, older, exhausted. I need you to know something, he whispered. I've been keeping records. Victoria doesn't know, but I've been documenting everything. He handed me a flash drive hidden in a book. If something happens to me, you'll need this. Promise me you'll look at it. Two weeks later, dad died in his sleep, sudden cardiac arrest. Victoria was devastated at the funeral, or at least she performed devastate.

She had lost her arm since childhood. The little girl, God's daughter, heard Mary's innermost thoughts. And that night she helped Mary retrieve her left arm. Finally, Mary became complete again.

Just then, the neighbor opened her door. She's not home. Hi, Peter. Is there something I can help you with? Can you watch him till his mom gets here? He'd be happy too. Come on, Peter. Come on. Watching Pete leave made him feel torn inside. He decided to take one last look at the boy, but what he saw left him shocked. The neighbor was asking Pete to take off his clothes. He's filthy. He needs a bath. Let's go, Pete. Mr's anger terrified the woman and she quickly ran back into her room. She ever do stuff to you before? She makes me sit in the bathtub with my clothes on. She ever touch you? Seeing the boy's hurt expression broke Mister's heart. But there was barely any food left at home. He had no choice but to steal from stores. Just To feed Pete One day when Mister returned home, he saw the welfare officers rounding up stray kids everywhere. Stop boy. Goddamn. Oh man. Pete was caught and Mister was soon discovered as well. No officer let go. One more right there. The boy panicked and ran back home. He smashed everything in sight to vent his rage to save Pete. He felt it was time to take action. You got a job for me? What you talking about man? What you? You shrunk out. They will find your mom. She's dead. At that moment, the man didn't know what to say. You don't have to pay me. It's gonna work for free. I just want my friend at a Riverview. Even though Mister begged the man repeatedly, he still failed. I just want my friend back. Teach you a lesson that you're gonna steal it from me. We found the goddamn kid, son of a bitch. The police showed up just in time to save his life, but he still couldn't escape being sent to a welfare home where he finally reunited with Pete. Not while we're here understand. So what's up? Nothing. Who did that to your eye? I don't know their names.

They spent $100 million to create me. I fought for 40 years and was about to retire. Then one day, my commander decided to end me. The reason was simple. They had made a newer, stronger generation of soldiers. We, the old ones, became disposable. They covered up the truth. They wrote our deaths off as accidents, then dumped us into a space junk ship like trash. When I woke up, everything around me was metal and wreckage. Piles of broken machines and old steel surrounded me. Two of my brothers, gone without a breath. Before I could react, the floor started to tilt. The ship was dumping the trash. I grabbed the edge with all my strength. My arms tore, my fingers went white. But my strength ran out. I slipped and fell. Fell with the junk down to a dark, red planet. I ignored the pain in my body, crawled out from the wreckage, watched the ship's door slowly close. For the first time in my life, I felt anger. That feeling wasn't supposed to exist in me. My life was built only for obedience and killing. To win the interstellar war, the military launched something called Project Adam. They took babies with perfect genes from ordinary families. Kids like me, five years old. We were forced to watch beasts fight. They wanted survival to be in our bones. At 12, they threw us into hellish training. Anyone who fell Behind was immediately removed. Death became a warning for the rest. We had no names, no families. Only numbers carved into our faces. That was our identity. We didn't need feelings. We were taught one rule. Obey. Even if the target was innocent. That training turned us into pure weapons. Because of it, we became unbeatable. For decades, we fought across countless worlds, from earth to the edge of space. Always in the front line, never afraid, never backing down. Every impossible mission we completed. But honor and medals were never ours. We fought in the shadows. Each victory left only another scar on our skin. That was our metal. My name is Todd, captain of the soldier unit. They called me the king of soldiers. Then one day, an uninvited officer arrived at our base. He brought a new breed of genetic soldiers. Younger, faster, stronger. Perfect products of science. Our captain refused to accept it. He said experience still mattered. So they set up a test. Result was brutal. The new soldiers crushed us in a 50 kilometer run. They started 20 minutes late and still reached the finish line before me, not even out of breath. The captain still didn't believe it. He ordered a fight in the air platform. Officer Mark gave me two old soldiers to help. He said it would make things fair. But even three of us together stood no chance. That soldier moved like lightning. He wore me down, then kicked me. Off the Chain Bridge, then took down my brothers one by one. And that was just the beginning.

I was used to getting pushed around. My name is Jess. I'm the only boy in the family. My older sisters never cared about me. Even sneaking a snack got me yelled at. We were poor. I only had one pair of sneakers. They were torn up, but I still wore them everyday. One day after school, they were just gone. Turns out mom threw them away. She was scared people would think she was a bad parent. To make up for it, she gave me a pair of my sister's old pink shoe. I have no choice, but I had to find a way. So I grabbed the black marker and covered all the. Trying to hide what? Embarrassed, but someone always found a reason to mess with me. Sweet sneak sessions. You wear your sister's hand me down underwear, too. He asked you a question. Twinkle toes. I thought maybe this was just how life would always be. Then one day a girl showed up and changed everything. Her name was Anna. In gym class, boys started a race. I joined right away. Running was one of the few things I was good at, but Anna joined, too. The boys laughed at her for it. I didn't care. I knew I could win. As the race started, some guys blocked me on purpose, but I caught up fast. Soon I was neck and neck. Then I pulled ahead. Two strides in front, I Couldn't stop smiling. Finally, I beat the ones who always bullied me. Hearing everyone cheer, I felt like I belonged. But then Anna caught up. She ran even faster than me. I pushed myself trying to catch her, but she hit the finish line first. After the race, my legs gave up. I dropped to the ground. I shook my head at my sister. I told her I didn't win. And I walked up like nothing happened. Hey, Jess, right? But I felt humiliated. I didn't say a word. Jess left. After school. My sister and I got on the bus home. I didn't expect Anna to get off at our stop, too. I asked if she was following me. She said she lived here. Fate is weird like that. We kept bumping into each other over and over, seeing me avoid her. She offered me her favourite candy. She even caught a sketchbook. Someone threw it. This time I didn't stop her from sitting with me to look at it. Things started to change between us. After school, she sat in the back of the bus. She didn't know that C was for the school bullies. To protect her, I pulled her over to sit beside me. From then on, we were inseparable. We ran together, chasing places we dreamed of through breezy woods and spring, through glowing golden fields until we reached our secret spot. It was our own little world. That day was my birthday. She gave Me, a wooden box with a set of art pens inside. She remembered I love to draw. She remembered my birth. I couldn't help asking the question I kept inside, it must have cost a fortune. What's the matter what it costs? I don't know. Well, I can take it back and get a cheaper one if you want. Thanks a lot. Every day after we went to our castle, until one day it rained like crazy. Worried our parents would be mad, we ran home in the storm. Even in the rain, we kept talking like we couldn't stop. She asked if we'd hang out tomorrow. I told her I had something to do. We said goodbye and rushed to our houses. I didn't go in right away. I just stood there watching her. I didn't know what love was, but I knew I liked her. The next day after a museum trip, I couldn't wait to tell her everything I saw. I had new plans for our castle. I got home full of excitement, but mom ran up and hug me crying. I had no idea what was going on. My sister said they thought I was dead. I stood there. Lost your friend. Leslie is dead.

Last night, a sexy blond woman walked out of a nightclub and strangely disappeared when passing by a van. Detective Cara, who was in charge of the case, thought the parking lot was too visible and no one would possibly choose this place to attack. But Morgan gave her a lesson. The broken street lamp by the road provided darkness for the culprit and the fallen high heel heel on the ground proved that the victim must have been attacked first. Maybe she fought back with her backpack to escape, which caused the things in her backpack to fall out. And the perfume bottle shards left on the ground confirmed this. The incident happened on a Friday night. There must have been someone in the guard booth, but for some reason she couldn't call for help successfully. The two heel prints left at the scene showed that the woman was finally taken by the attacker. Then Morgan noticed that the original two heel prints eventually turned into one. This meant the woman lost her shoe during the struggle. Finally, under a car, Morgan indeed found a high heeled shoe. But the disappearance of the woman, Maya, wasn't an ordinary case. The real target of the culprit was actually Morgan. Early in the morning, Morgan received a misdelivered email, seeing the address was in the next block. Morgan kindly offered to deliver it in person unexpectedly. When she arrived at the destination, Morgan was shocked because this was the home of Maya, the missing woman. She didn't think this was a coincidence because the U. S. Postal system is extremely strict. Miss delivering an address is quite rare. Morgan believed this case must have been deliberately set up by the game maker from the previous season. After all that person seemed to have been staying around. Morgan seeing her partner so excited, Cara reminded Morgan to calm down. They couldn't handle the case based on guesses alone for now. Besides, Maya's child was anxiously looking for his mother. Where's mommy? To find Maya's location as soon as possible. The police first focused their attention on her husband because through investigation Maya had applied for a weapons permit a few months ago just to protect herself from her husband. The police quickly searched Maya's home, didn't find the gun she had bought and Morgan also noticed something wrong. Although there were many luxury shopping bags in the closet, the items inside were gone. If they had been stolen, the house didn't look rummaged through at all. Soon with Morgan's extraordinary sharpness, she pushed the case forward again. A second hand electronic organ made Morgan certain of one thing, Maya's things hadn't been stolen by anyone. Then she said she would take Cara to a place. This was a pawnshop. Morgan was a regular customer here. She greeted the Owner familiarly and exchanged small talk. While talking, she showed Maya's photo to the owner and asked if the woman had come to pawn any luxury items unexpectedly. The man didn't admit it. Morgan had to mention the second hand electronic organ in Maya's house. After all, the act of tearing off labels but not cleaning them properly was very familiar to Morgan who often came to the shop seeing he couldn't hide it anymore. The man had to admit that Maya had been there, but I can't be handing over $1,000 of goods to you. It's hard enough to keep the lights on as it is these days. Uh, the LAPD will put it on their tab. There is no tab on it. The LAPD will reimburse you from the city slash fund. Not a thing. Frenchy, why don't you just turn over the items? Otherwise I'm gonna have to fast track a warrant for a more invasive search of this place and who knows what kind of illicit goods we'll find in here. Cara's words finally made the shop owner give in. After taking out the items, he also told Morgan and Cara that Maya had come with a man at that time and the surveillance camera had captured their argument. Then in the shortest time, Maya's husband Derek was brought to the police station. the man acted as if he had just found out about his wife's incident and even broke down emotionally for a while. But Cara didn't believe his act, so she deliberately played the video of their argument at the pawnshop entrance. The man immediately became nervous and explained that he shouldn't have followed his wife. After all, seeing her constantly receiving luxury items from others, any man would get angry. But he firmly denied hurting Maya. Maya is my whole world, love of my life. And I miss my son. I, I, I, I've made mistakes, yes, but I, I would never, you have to find her. Since there was no substantial evidence that Maya's husband had hurt her, Morgan and the others shifted their focus to another person. Gib was a friend who had gone to the nightclub with Maya. They quickly got some clues from her. It turned out that Maya and her husband had been fighting a custody battle, so she had been in a low mood for a long time. But during the conversation, the woman mentioned someone that was Maya's boss, Jason, who seemed to care about her a lot. After all, the nightclub ticket was given to her by that man. Upon hearing this, Morgan quickly pulled up Jason's information. After a few minutes of organizing, she soon connected Jason to the game maker from the previous season. Again, Morgan told the result to her colleagues at the police station. So Jason and the game maker are one in the same? No, no. It's a trap, guys. I just went into the war room. It took Me like five minutes to get all this stuff off the internet. He's trying to get us to focus over here so he can keep slithering around over there. It's just too easy. This is what I think the game maker is trying to frame Jason to be a part of whatever game this is he's currently playing. This statement made her colleagues minds race. Why would that game maker go to such great lengths to frame someone else? After all, Jason and that person didn't seem to have any connection. There were too many unanswered questions. For now, the police chief had no choice but to advise everyone to follow the rules. Morgan felt a little helpless about this. Then she could only go to Jason's party to investigate with Cara first. Jason warmly welcomed them on the surface, but when they talked privately, Jason acted very cunningly regarding Maya's disappearance case. He claimed he knew nothing about it and Maya was just his subordinate. As for letting Maya use his credit card frequently, it was just because he couldn't say no to single mothers. During this time, Morgan noticed that Jason liked collecting Japanese short swords and there were even several neatly placed on the wall. But she also noticed a problem soon. Let's see, Minamoto, Tira, Toto, Ashikaga, Oda, Tokugawa. Except one's missing, the takedah. It's not there. Morgan's clever move shocked Jason, so the man became more alert. He politely asked Morgan and the others to Leave. But this action made Morgan believe the man must be hiding the truth. You're waiting on me to leave so you can poke around Jason's den without a warrant, aren't you? Yeah. However, when Morgan secretly searched Jason's study, a strange and familiar figure outside the window immediately drew her out. At this time, Cara also found a bracelet in the swimming pool, which was exactly the one belonging to Maya, the missing woman on Morgan's side. After chasing for a while, when that familiar face stood right in front of her, Morgan quickly called for Cara. And in that short gap, the man quickly disappeared from Morgan's sight. When Cara held the man at gunpoint to stop him, the man who took off his mask turned out to be Jason. Since they had obtained the bracelet Maya was wearing when she disappeared, Cara arrested Jason. As soon as they arrived at the police station, Maya's husband, Derek, angrily stepped forward to question Jason, asking where his wife Maya was. Finally, after a long period of questioning, the police still didn't get the location of Maya's disappearance. Morgan thought maybe Jason really didn't know where Maya was. She still insisted that all this must be related to that game maker. After all, she had seen that person at the masquerade party. Her colleagues still doubted if Morgan had missed seen, which made the woman with an I Q of 160 angry. Are you, are you really suggesting that I. Don't remember his face. That man is a danger to my children, okay? I'm never gonna be able to forget his face long after we're done with this, long after we get him and we put him away and you guys move on to another case. He's gonna live up here cemented inside of my brain along with all of the other things I got to look out for to make sure my kids are okay. Okay, I've got something. A salvage yard in Sun Valley just reported Maya's car. When everyone arrived at the abandoned parking lot in Sun Valley, Maya's car was indeed parked there. But when they opened the trunk, there was only Maya's clothes and a Japanese short sword inside. Realizing they had been tricked, Morgan suddenly thought of a strange point. That was when Jason was arrested and taken to the police station. Why was Derek already waiting there in advance? Usually the Major Crimes Unit wouldn't notify family members during an ongoing case, so someone must be up to something behind this. Morgan tried to sort out all the clues. She realized that when she received the misdelivered letter, everyone had already fallen into the trap. Since that game maker was so skillful, it must be easy for him to steal Jason's credit card. He deliberately gave those luxury items to Maya. After framing Jason, he threw Maya's bracelet into the swimming pool, then secretly took that Japanese short sword. And his purpose in doing this? Wasn't just to frame Jason because Maya had registered to buy a weapon earlier, but that gun had never been found. That meant the person wanted Derek to think Maya had bought a gun. Did you know that Maya recently purchased a firearm? What? The game maker knew Derek would want revenge, so he placed a gun in Maya's house after we searched it. It's possible Maya was just faking. She could still be alive. I hope so. But if she's not part of the game anymore, he doesn't need her. Look, we did everything we were supposed to do, right? We played the game. We played it his way. None of the other victims died. Maybe he's not a murderer. Not if he got someone else to do it for him. So it's Jason. He wants dead. We gotta find Derek. When Cara arrived at Derek's house, it was already too late. Derek had already gone to Jason's house. And at the police station here, an even more shocking scene unfolded. Apparently, you're looking for me.

I carefully planned my revenge. I made him hit me. Not only did I get everything back, but I also sent him to jail. But two years later, he came back stronger than ever. He married his mistress and had a child with the help of his father in law, the mayor. His business was booming. The first thing he did when he came back, he hosted a grand party inviting all the high society to reclaim his lost pride. He shamelessly sent me an invitation. It seemed like everything was aimed at me. But what happened next shocked me. He looked at me with deep affection, telling me he wanted to fix our relationship and that he thought about me every single day for the past two years. It made me sick. I went home and shut the door. I didn't know what his real intentions were. On the night of his party, I went out to dinner with a colleague, but suddenly I received a text message. It was a photo of my son with my ex husband at the party. That was his real plan. He wanted to take our son.
