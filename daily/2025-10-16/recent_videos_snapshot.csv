So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That it's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. Keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yeah. he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died. But I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy waste of space better not miss his shift tomorrow or we'll all be homeless. My mom grabbed the phone. Next, he has to give us $800 by tomorrow or I'm selling everything he owns. The doctor's voice got ice cold. Your child's organs are failing from working to support you. Stop making excuses for that pathetic failure because he can't handle it.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass, my bass actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me, look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for like two months. Two months. I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist who still can't play an F chord cleanly actually says it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs. But okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us, support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes, how she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money, the cables, the stands, hell even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains. I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising, that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs, mine, well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me, this is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately, are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow in my dad's garage with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for and zero energy to through Mr Danner's 45 minute rant about fractions. So I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped onto the couch and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet. But around 10:00, I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first. Figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall and it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I tried. I Really tried, but I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now. He said, every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending, pretending to be fine, pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone, just starting over, somewhere quiet, somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will, but I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He Didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost, he felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers and didn't move for the rest of the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach, he asked. Fine, I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I was waiting in line at Starbucks when this kid, maybe 13, ordered a drink so complicated the barista had to write it down. Venti iced skinny hazelnut macchiato, sugar free syrup, extra shot, light ice, no whip, with exactly 2.5 pumps vanilla. One pump caramel coffee at 140 degrees in a venti cup with extra foam below the rim. The barista made it the it took one sip and exploded. This is wrong. It's 142 degrees. I said 140! Are you stupid? His mom stood there nodding. Jaden has a very refined palate. You need to remake it. The barista apologized and started over. Meanwhile, the line grew longer. An elderly man behind me sighed. The kid heard him. Do you have a problem, old man? Maybe go to McDonald's if you can't wait for quality. His mother actually laughed. Aiden, be nice. Not everyone understands coffee like you do. The second drink came out. Kid took a sip and spat it onto the counter. Now it's too cold. And this is three pumps vanilla. Can nobody here count? The manager came over, apologizing profusely. We'll make it again, no charge. No charge! We're not paying for any of this! The mom snapped. This is harassment! While waiting for drink No. 3, the kid knocked over the tip jar accidentally. Coins scattered everywhere. He watched the barista pick them up and smirked. Maybe if You made drinks correctly, you deserve tips. A woman in line called out, that's incredibly rude. The kid's mom world around. Excuse me, don't parent my child. Someone should. The woman muttered. The kid heard and started fake crying. Mom, she's bullying me! I'm just trying to get my drink. His mother immediately pulled out her phone. I'm recording this. This. This woman is harassing my minor child! The manager panicked, offered everyone free drinks to calm things down. The kid instantly stopped crying. I want a free drink card too, for my emotional distress. They gave him one. A twenty five dollar gift card for acting like a monster. The third drink came out. He tasted it, considered, and poured it on the floor. Still wrong. You know what? I'll make it myself since everyone here is incompetent. He tried to walk behind the counter. The manager blocked him. You can't come back here. My dad owns three Starbucks franchises. Yes, I can. His mom nodded. Let him fix your mistakes. The manager, exhausted, said they'd comp the drink, but he couldn't go behind the counter. The kid grabbed a display mug and threw it against the wall. Then make it right. Ceramic shards everywhere. A baby in the corner started crying from the noise. His mother's response, now look what you made him do. He has anger issues when people don't listen. The manager called security. The mom went ballistic. You're calling security on a child? I want Every employee here fired. While she ranted, the kid walked over to the condiment bar and started opening every single milk carton, sugar packet, and napkin dispenser, dumping them on the floor. Oops! He said after each one. So clumsy today. An off duty cop in line finally stepped forward.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

No, of course you can't. But you should tell us anyway. Yeah. Is it like a physical thing or a personality thing? No, it's, it's physical. Okay. So what is it? Uh, okay. Here's the thing about Kara. Is Kara, again, great personality, really wonderful. Um, she has, you know, she's got a little bit too much back for me.

The current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She pissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do, question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like, what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards and Lily's Quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it, Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying. Every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true or is it just a missus Wilson truth?

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I'd gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. But I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally. But honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything, how she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it, how she hummed the same tune when she was happy, how her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73, that she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them, that she got cranky If she didn't eat something by 11:00am but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense. When I thought about explaining it, like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for 3 years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. Panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing. But she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting on The

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she'd just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? I asked my dad about it. He just chuckled and said Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day, I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the garage. Like he owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room, where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fen in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my fourteen year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he did. Your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room, slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar, disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I'd missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys, taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I Woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult. Note said they knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over, trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. Like I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. An innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they'd stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for days. Without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, the note, and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mr Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. I fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped three blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane. Just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mr Bax was staring at something in his side mirror. And when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family now. I was really freaking out because, but drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr Bax, what's going on? My voice Came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and 5th. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mr Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Ace from the back yelled, Yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice. Mr Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before he could answer, sir, the black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mister Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet, he announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something about the Whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally rang and it was my mom, but she sounded weird, really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus. We're running late because she cut me off. Listen to me very carefully. Do not come home today. Go to Aunt Pip's house instead. I'll pick you up there later. In the background, I could hear men's voices talking, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Mom, what's wrong? Why can't I come home? The line went quiet for a few seconds. Then she whispered, just trust me, baby, don't come to the house. Paul ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in panic. Mr Bax was watching me in the rearview mirror. What did she say? I told him about going to my aunt's house instead. And his face got this grim expression. The black car was still following us and now there was a second one behind it. Change of plans, kid. We're going straight to the police station. He made a sharp turn away from.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making these low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bishar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bishar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. Three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom doors trying to figure out what all the screaming was. About teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Girl, when I tell you, I almost fainted when the school called me. I ain't even playing. So it's a regular Thursday. I'm in the middle of target looking for a throw pillow that matches absolutely nothing. And my phone rings. Caller ID says Lincoln Elementary. My stomach drop. I thought, oh, god, did she fall off the monkey bars again? Did she hit someone? Or worse, did she say something? Think she heard me say? So I answer all fake sweet, like, hi, this is her mom. And the lady on the other end says, ma'am, we need you to come in immediately. Your daughter had an incident. Now listen, my daughter Layla is cute, like real cute. Big eyes, big hair, big attitude. She's eight, but she's also part gremlin when she's hungry or bored. So I throw the pillows back, leave the car and speed down to that school like it's the Indie 500. I walk in, heart pounding, and the secretary just points at the principal's office like, yeah, she's in there. I open the door and baby Layla sitting there with her arms crossed like a little mob boss. Principal looking nervous. There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself. Calm like she's In court, the principal sighs and says she hit him with a lunch tray. I blinked. I'm sorry. She what? Now the teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie and boom, metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing because I know where she got that line, me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. He goes, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do care? Like it's a fairy tale. That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is 9/10 of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim here. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you. I stocked up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, he can't be violent, even if you're right. There's rules. She goes, Exactly. Rule No. 1, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe. Probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

Yeah, bro. I just had the worst couple days of my life. What? Why? What happened? You know that new diet I've been on, right? Uh, yeah, I heard that eating fiber helps you lose weight. So I got five boxes of those Fiber one bars. That's all I've been eating. Nothing else, just fiber bars. I couldn't. The day after that I did the same thing. I ate six more boxes of fiber bars, only I didn't that day either. I was getting very worried. I take at least one on a normal day, but I could feel the fat burning off my body from all the fiber. I didn't. The day after that either. I didn't. The fourth day I didn't. Fifth day I didn't. The sixth day, but then I was drinking my morning coffee and I started hearing the loudest rumble I've ever heard. I thought it was an earthquake or volcano exploding, but no, it was my stomach. I rushed to the toilet. The moment my ass hits the toilet, the loudest and most funkiest fart comes out of my. Took 8 seconds for the fart to finish. My mom rushed to the bathroom door. She thought something happened to me. Then it stops. A brick starts to come out and it's so solid that I feel like I'm giving birth to Megamind out of my ass. I hung on to the shower curtain and I prayed. I ripped the Whole shower curtain out of the wall. Then the brick finally came out. At speeds faster than a F1 racing car, the entire bathroom was soaking in toilet water. That's just the start. A fart that could do more damage than a nuclear missile starts a barrage of bullets from me. After an hour, it seemed to be over. I'm crying at this point and I can barely breathe. I wipe my butt crystal clean. What the actual.

I accidentally said you too when the Starbucks barista said enjoy your coffee. But instead of cringing and walking away like a normal person, she looked genuinely confused and said, wait, what did you say? My brain completely short circited. I panicked and blurted out, I said, I'll bring you coffee too sometime. She lit up with this huge smile and said, oh my god, that's really sweet. What's your name? Now I'm committed to this insane promise. Came back the next Tuesday with a venti caramel macchiato. Her name tag said Emma. She was so genuinely happy. She teared up a little and gave me her number saying text me so I know this actually happened. I figured I'd send one polite text and let it naturally fade away. But Emma started texting me paragraphs about her terrible shift, her nightmare roommate Stephanie, who never cleaned dishes and left rotting food everywhere, how my random gesture of kindness completely made her weak and gave her hope that good people still exist. I felt genuinely bad for her situation. So I kept responding with supportive messages and stupid memes to cheer her up. Three weeks later, I'm bringing Emma coffee every Tuesday at exact like two forty seven PM during her break. She starts calling me her coffee angel and introducing me to her coworkers as the sweetest guy who randomly brings me coffee For absolutely no reason except pure kindness. The whole coffee shop thinks we're dating. Her manager keeps asking when I'm going to officially ask her out. I'm too deep to correct anyone now. Then her mom visited from Ohio for Emma's birthday weekend. Emma insisted I meet her, saying I was the thoughtful one who brightens her Tuesdays when everything else in life feels overwhelming. Her mom grabbed me in this bone crushing hug and whispered, you're exactly what Emma needs right now, sweetheart. She talks about you constantly. That's when I Learned Emma had been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for two years. Our Tuesday coffee ritual was literally the only consistent positive thing in her week that she could count on. She'd started scheduling her therapy appointments around our meetups because they gave her something concrete to look forward to during her darkest moments. By month 3, I'm invited.

I accidentally said you too when the Starbucks barista said enjoy your coffee. But instead of cringing and walking away like a normal person, she looked genuinely confused and said, wait, what did you say? My brain completely short circited. I panicked and blurted out, I said, I'll bring you coffee too sometime. She lit up with this huge smile and said, oh my god, that's really sweet. What's your name? Now I'm committed to this insane promise. Came back the next Tuesday with a venti caramel macchiato. Her name tag said Emma. She was so genuinely happy. She teared up a little and gave me her number saying text me so I know this actually happened. I figured I'd send one polite text and let it naturally fade away. But Emma started texting me paragraphs about her terrible shift, her nightmare roommate Stephanie, who never cleaned dishes and left rotting food everywhere, how my random gesture of kindness completely made her weak and gave her hope that good people still exist. I felt genuinely bad for her situation. So I kept responding with supportive messages and stupid memes to cheer her up. Three weeks later, I'm bringing Emma coffee every Tuesday at exact like two forty seven PM during her break. She starts calling me her coffee angel and introducing me to her coworkers as the sweetest guy who randomly brings me coffee For absolutely no reason except pure kindness. The whole coffee shop thinks we're dating. Her manager keeps asking when I'm going to officially ask her out. I'm too deep to correct anyone now. Then her mom visited from Ohio for Emma's birthday weekend. Emma insisted I meet her, saying I was the thoughtful one who brightens her Tuesdays when everything else in life feels overwhelming. Her mom grabbed me in this bone crushing hug and whispered, you're exactly what Emma needs right now, sweetheart. She talks about you constantly. That's when I Learned Emma had been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for two years. Our Tuesday coffee ritual was literally the only consistent positive thing in her week that she could count on. She'd started scheduling her therapy appointments around our meetups because they gave her something concrete to look forward to during her darkest moments. By month 3, I'm invited.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading life 3 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. She says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realise immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect! Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is. Men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realise she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom check your location while I'm at school. Dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realise she's literally sitting. They're refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3 mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see. Shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses the client. Client worth $2,000. Week two she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money. Which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM. Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough. But I've been to that clinic. They close at 6. That night, dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives, marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5, and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the medical plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am, and it's now six PM. I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot, looking at life. Three 60, zoomed in.

A few weeks ago, my best friend, Courtney, called me sobbing. I lost my baby Kate exactly 10 weeks ago. My stomach dropped. Courtney had miscarried four times now, all at precisely 10 weeks. I'm a nurse practitioner. That timing pattern doesn't occur naturally. I drove straight to her house where her husband, Joe answered looking exhausted. She's resting. This one hit her hard. I need to see her maybe tomorrow. Joe, I'm her best friend and I'm a nurse. Let me help. He reluctantly let me in. Courtney was in bed, pale. And when I hugged her, I noticed bruising on her inner arm, fresh needle marks, multiple injection sites. Courtney, these marks. She looked confused. I don't remember getting any shots. I just, I woke up with them after I blacked out last night. You blacked out? Joe interrupted us from the doorway. She faints sometimes, stress from the pregnancy. Three days later, Courtney was feeling better and we met for coffee. I've been thinking, she said. I never actually saw my regular OBGYN during any of my pregnancies. Joe always said he found better specialists. That seemed wrong. Doctor Holly, you've seen her for years. Joe said she was too busy. He'd take me to appointments, but I'd always feel so drowsy in the waiting room. He'd go in to talk to the doctor. While I rested in the car, I called Doctor Holly's office. That afternoon, pretending to be Courtney, checking on my records. I need to verify my appointment history for insurance. It's Roberts. Our records show you called to transfer your care elsewhere last year and the year before, always after positive pregnancy tests. That evening, Courtney texted me again. Found something weird. Joe keeps the detailed calendar in his phone. It has all my periods marked and there are red X's. Exactly 14 days after each period starts. Going back three years, 14 days after period starts is ovulation peak fertility. Courtney, does anything happen on the red X days? She thought about it. Around then is when Joe makes me tea. I guess he says it's good for sleep and fertility. I always take it because I'm usually tired and we want to start a family. I was so suspicious that the next day I came over the next day while Joe was at work. That's when Courtney showed me something else. I found this tiny safe in his closet, like the kind doctors use for medications, but it's locked. We tried every code we could think of, but nothing worked. Courtney think those nights he gives you the tea. What happens after she went pale? I always wake up feeling sore down there, Joe says. We tried for a baby, but I never remember it. My stomach turned. He was drugging her and assaulting her on her fertile days to get her pregnant. Oh, my god. Could the miscarriages Be him, she shot out. I thought back to my medical training. Courtney, does anything weird happen before each miscarriage? Any sort of pattern? She thought about it for a while. Now that I think about it, I get really sick days before. For each one, way more sick than usual. Her eyes went wide. Joe makes me soup, some special recipe he says helps with morning sickness. Every single time. Every time she yelled. He's insistent I eat it all. We went back to the safe. Courtney remembered something. His ex girlfriend's name was Marie. Her birthday was October 15th. The safe clicked open. Inside were vials of medications, two types, one labeled with a fertility drug code, the other.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table, Mom, Dad and my brother Landon. Harper's got that new job, dad was saying, making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time, mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer. They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance, Landon's business that needed start up capital, Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery, $57,000 over five years, all because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering they praise me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got In my car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them, miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amounts, documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything, bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for, receipts from Landon's failed ventures, five years of financial manipulation, all documented. The next day I walked into the.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed. Actually laughed. Said, my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious, but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online, and I gave birth to my son, Tommy, over Christmas break with Jingle Bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse, and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon. Smart, kind. Didn't blink when I told him I had a ten year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold, and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love. Right then, two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to. Because, honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago, and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight A student. Star pitcher for his high school, and I mean, star college. Scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling on Her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by longer pause Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Bella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning document energies. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

What did you learn? My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place. Setting in panic, her dad, Mr Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked. During that first dinner, when I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again, and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner and fixed his own car if they didn't like it. Tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious and clearly tired of his family's expectations while everyone else was Networking and name dropping, Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr Richardson called me, not Sarah, me directly. I need to speak with you, he said in that cold voice I'd grown to hate.

He'd gotten it sewn on over the weekend. The guy had never LED soldiers in combat, never made a life or death decision. But he had that piece of paper that said he took online quizzes about psychology and business management. During the promotion ceremony, the battalion commander gave a speech about the importance of professional development and lifelong learning. I stood in the back watching Marcus shake hands with officers while photographers took pictures. That night, I enrolled in three online classes. American history, college algebra, and some business course. I'd finish my associate's degree in six months, even if it meant staying up until midnight after 12 hour duty days. But here's what really bothered me. Two months later, our battalion got deployment orders to Syria. Marcus, the newly promoted sergeant first class, immediately went to the chaplain, claiming family hardship to avoid going. Meanwhile, I deployed for my fourth combat tour, leading the same soldiers I'd always LED, without the rank or pay that should have come with it. Six months into the deployment, 1st Sergeant Granger called me into his office. We were at a small base outside Raqqa. Jake, Marcus just got chaptered out for failing back to back PT tests. E7 slot open. Back up. I pushed your packet through as a battlefield promotion. You finished that degree? Yes, top. Turned in my final exam last week from the base internet cafe. Good. You're getting your stripes, but you're not getting them because of the degree. Then why? Because when mortar started hitting the space last month, Marcus's college education didn't mean anything. But your 12 years of experience kept 20 soldiers alive during that attack. That's worth more than any diploma. I made sergeant first class right there in Syria, in a combat zone. The way it should have happened in the first place. The degree was just a box I had to check. Marcus is working at a car dealership now. I'm still here, leading soldiers.

He'd gotten it sewn on over the weekend. The guy had never LED soldiers in combat, never made a life or death decision. But he had that piece of paper that said he took online quizzes about psychology and business management. During the promotion ceremony, the battalion commander gave a speech about the importance of professional development and lifelong learning. I stood in the back watching Marcus shake hands with officers while photographers took pictures. That night, I enrolled in three online classes, American history, college algebra and some business course. I'd finish my associate's degree in six months, even if it meant staying up until midnight after 12 hour duty days. But here's what really bothered me. Two months later, our battalion got deployment orders to Syria. Marcus, the newly promoted sergeant 1st class, immediately went to the chaplain claiming family hardship to avoid going. Meanwhile, I deployed for my fourth combat tour, leading the same soldiers I'd always LED without the rank or pay that should have come with it. Six months into the deployment, 1st sergeant Granger called me into his office. We were at a small base outside Rocca. Jake, Marcus just got chaptered out for failing back to back PT tests. The E7 slot open back up. I pushed your packet through as a battlefield promotion. You finished that degree? Yes. Top turned in my final exam last week from the base internet cafe. Good. You're getting your stripes, but you're not getting them because of the degree then why? Because when mortar started hitting the space last month, Marcus's college education didn't mean anything. your 12 years of experience kept 20 soldiers alive during that attack. That's worth more than any diploma I made sergeant first class right there in Syria in a combat zone, the way it should have happened in the first place. The degree was just a box I had to check. Marcus is working at a car dealership now. I'm still here leading soldiers, except now I finally have the rank that matches the job I've been doing all along.

Then at Thanksgiving dinner, he found out I had $30 million and had a complete meltdown in front of everyone. My aunt screamed and my dad. Just growing up, Nathan was the golden boy. New car at 16, vacations to Europe, private schools that cost more than a mortgage. Me, I was the boring cousin, the quiet one, the one working after school just to buy a beat up Honda. At family dinners, Nathan bragged while the adults nodded proudly and my aunt clinked her glass like her son and with some kind of prodigy. Meanwhile, when I got a B+ instead of an a, my parents said I wasn't applying myself. That's how it was. Nathan could fail a class and it was just a phase. But while they were laughing at me, I was grinding. I landed an internship at a finance firm, Learned everything, started investing, built a business. By the time I was out of college, I was sitting on something huge. I just didn't tell anyone. Why brag to people who already wrote you off? Fast forward to Thanksgiving this year, Nathan's at the head of the table bragging about some networking trip his parents paid for. Everyone's listening like he's the next Elon Musk. Then my aunt turns to me with her fake sweet voice and goes, Andy, you're still doing paperwork somewhere, right? The whole table chuckles. Nathan smirks something In me snapped. I set my glass down and said, yeah, paper is worth about 30 million. The room went dead silent. My aunt's hand froze halfway to her wine. My dad just stared like he didn't hear me right. Nathan's girlfriend literally pulled her arm off his shoulder. And Nathan, he laughed nervously. Yeah, right. Stop exaggerating. But I wasn't. That's when it flipped. Suddenly, they cared. My aunt leaned in, voice sharp. If that's true, Andy, family helps family. Nathan's been working so hard, you should give him a boost. Nathan perked up immediately. Yeah, bro, you don't even need all that. Help me out. I sat there swirling my drink, realizing they weren't proud of me. They didn't see me as family. They saw me as a bank account. After dinner, my phone blew up, my aunt texting me.

The caption said, the only one who deserves celebrating. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied, at least someone's worth baking for. I smiled, replied, enjoy it while you can. That same night, I made one transfer, sent two emails. 12 days later, my sister screamed when her landlord called and said your rents canceled. I was sitting at my desk eating leftovers when the notification came through a Facebook tag. I opened it expecting maybe a few birthday messages. Instead, 20 photos of an expensive backyard party, white tents, navy linens, catering trays, a neon sign that said Amanda Con 2025. And in the center, a custom cake with gold cursive to our star Amanda. The caption posted by my mom, the only one who deserves celebrating. Every photo showed smiling faces, my parents, Amanda holding champagne, Uncle Rick and Aunt Laura. Not a single mention of my birthday, which was that exact day. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied within two minutes, at least someone's worth baking for. Then I remembered the text from dad two weeks earlier. Hey, we need a little help, something special. Can you send $500? I didn't ask questions, just transferred it. Now I knew where it went. Shrimp platters, monogram napkins, that gold icing, the same Amanda who the night before had been drunk in our family group chat. Imagine being 28. And still figuring life out. At least one of us isn't a total disappointment. Then dropped a gift of someone slow clapping. Nobody said a word that night. After Jess fell asleep, I sat at my laptop, opened the banking app, the joint family account, the one from last year when dad got his hours cut. And mom said it would help us as the team, except the team was just me. Every paycheck I'd throw in a few hundred. They'd contribute maybe $15. Every other month, I transferred everything out clean, not a cent left. Then I sent two emails. First one to Amanda's landlord. I co signed her lease last year. When she couldn't figure out the paperwork. I'm withdrawing.

I can wear whatever I want before our family dinner. I said, absolutely. What she didn't expect was my response when we arrived. Her confidence disappeared when she realized Sienna was that girl. Fashion marketing, always dressed like she was being photographed. When we met, I loved it. She had confidence. But after a while, I realized she didn't just like attention, she needed it. She wore black to weddings, bikini top to a baby shower she once called a funeral aesthetic. Anytime I mentioned it, she'd roll her eyes. You're so controlling. So I stopped saying anything. Then my mom planned this fancy dinner for my sister Bethany, first doctor in the family. Normal restaurant, black tie vibe. I told Sienna, it's a big deal. Dress formal. She didn't even look up from her phone. I know how to dress myself. Sunday night, I'm in a suit. Sienna walks out in a metallic silver mini dress that looked like she was wrapped in tin foil and bad ideas. It barely covered anything. You look memorable, I said. She grinned. Exactly. Your family is going to die when they see me. She wasn't kidding. We walk in, crystal chandeliers, quiet music, people in gowns and tuxes and she looks like she's headed to a nightclub. The entire place went silent. My mom froze mid smile. Bethany just blinked. The waiter came over immediately. Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we have a dress code. Sienna Scoffed. This dress cost three grand. Yes, he said, but it's missing half of itself. The table was dead quiet. I said, they're just doing their job. She spun on me. Are you seriously taking their side? There are no sides. You said you knew how to dress yourself. That's when she lost it. This family is obsessed with appearances. Sorry, I'm not boring like the rest of you, Bethany said quietly. We just wanted to have dinner. Sienna turned on her. Of course you did, Golden Child. You could hear forks hit plates. I stood up. We're leaving, she glared. You can't make me. You're right. I'm going. You can find your own ride. No one said a word. She waited for someone to defend her. No one did. Then she grabbed.

Dinner went perfectly. After that, my phone buzzed non stop with texts from her. You abandoned me. Your family's toxic. You owe me an apology. I didn't answer. Next night she showed up with her friend Jade yelling that I set her up. I told her you wanted attention, you got it. She screamed, cried and left. Two weeks later, I got a call from my bank. Someone tried to buy $4,000 worth of designer clothes using my card. Shipping address, Jade's apartment. Sienna had saved my card info. I filed a police report and she emailed me at work with an invoice, said I owed her $50,000 for emotional labor. She actually c c'd my boss and my mom. My mom hit reply all thank you for the invoice. Attached is mine, $5,000 therapy after your behavior. $3,000 for the restaurant shawl you refused. $50 teaching my son to recognize red flags. Please pay promptly. But Sienna wasn't done. She showed up at my apartment building knocking on every door, telling people she was my fiance, that I stole her grandmother's ring, that she was pregnant. My 70 year old neighbor called me like, Tommy, there's a shiny woman screaming your name. Police came building banned her. Next morning my car was keyed. Security footage caught her in another metallic outfit. 3 a. M, full glam, scratching my hood. Police added vandalism to the fraud case. Got a restraining order at court. She Showed up in a gold pantsuit, told the judge I was an abuser because I didn't warn her the restaurant had a dress code. The judge blinked. You're saying he abused you by not telling you how to dress? She said, yes. He just sighed. That's not abuse. That's called consequences. Restraining order granted. Then everything collapsed for her at once. Broad charges, job gone, fired after her boss found out she was using company email to threaten me. A mutual friend sent me a screenshot of her latest Instagram post. The universe tests strong women. I'm rising above the hate, manifesting peace and success. Bethany texted me the same day. Mom wants to know if your restraining order includes Thanksgiving. She's ordering extra wine just in case the universe tries to manifest at dinner.

Sorry about how things went down. I delete needed it. Then another message. Email from Vanessa. Can you come in tomorrow, 10 a m? The team would like to meet you. I replied, yes.

They'd already checked my references, already talked to Abbot Manufacturing. We want you as regional director. Vanessa said. Double your dry field salary plus commission. When can you start? Immediately. They gave me an office with a window, a company card, team of three and something. Dry field never gave me a clear path forward. Build this division from the ground up, Vanessa explained. Your reputation is why we hired you. I started the following Monday. For two weeks, I Learned the systems and built a strategy. Then I made my move. I sent LinkedIn requests to my old dryfield colleagues. Most accepted within hours. Then I reached out to every client I'd ever Worked with, starting with Abbot Manufacturing. By Friday afternoon, I had three meetings scheduled, all with Dryfield's biggest. Lawrence called me. I let it go to voicemail. He called again. Then Tyler called. Monday morning, I walked into my first meeting. The procurement director from Abbott Manufacturing smiled when he saw me. Jared, good to see you. We were wondering when you'd reach out. By the end of the week, I'd signed two of Dryfield's top five clients to Ravi on contracts. Lawrence sent an email demanding I stop contacting his clients. I forwarded it to our legal team with one line. These are my relationships, not his. Three weeks after getting fired, I closed a deal worth $3 million. Vanessa promoted me to vice president. A month later, I got a call from a recruiter. Dryfield was looking for a new VP of Sales. Lawrence had been let go.

This shows you're not committed to our team, he said, demanding I clean out my desk immediately. I thanked him for the opportunity and left calmly. Monday would be fun. Lawrence Bennett leaned back in his custom leather chair, tan from his Miami business trip. Four years at Dryfield Robotics, four years watching Tyler Davis get promoted over me despite my numbers being double his. And Tyler took credit for the Westbrook deal I'd spent six months building. Then he got a company car. Meeting invites started missing my inbox, little comments in meetings. Are you sure that's the right approach? Last month, I closed Abbott Manufacturing, $2 million, our biggest contract of the year. I flew to Chicago three times on my own dime, worked every weekend, missed my cousin's wedding. When the contract came through, Lawrence took the, came out for drinks, everyone except me. I found out from Instagram. That's when I asked about my raise. Third time asking, the timing isn't right. Lawrence said, we're restructuring compensation. That night, I updated my resume for the first time in four years. A week later, Vanessa Mills reached out on LinkedIn, former dryfield client, now at Ravi. On publishing. Over coffee, she mentioned they needed someone to head their business development to vision, someone like me. I took one Vacation day for an interview. Someone saw me in the Ravyon lobby and told Tyler. Now, Lawrence sat across from me, waiting for me to beg. I understand, I said. His eyebrows twitched. Terminated effective immediately. Clean out your desk. I stood up and extended my hand. He hesitated before taking it. Thank you for the opportunity. The walk back was quiet. Everyone pretending to be busy, stealing glances. I pulled a cardboard box from the supply room, a coffee mug, some pens, a cactus I'd kept alive for three years, four years of my life, smaller than a microwave. April hovered nearby, watching me like I might steal a stapler. I brought in $2 million, they thought.

All her friends are calling me Coffee Guy and telling me detailed stories about how much happier Emma's been since I started dating her. I didn't have the heart to correct them when they're all so genuinely grateful. Her best friend, Sarah, pulled me aside and whispered, I don't know what magic you worked, but Emma's been like a completely different person. She actually laughs at our jokes now instead of just forcing smiles. The breaking point came when Emma finally got promoted to ship supervisor after months of anxiety about applying for the position. She wanted to celebrate at some fancy Italian restaurant downtown that she'd been saving up for. I honestly couldn't have done this without our Tuesday tradition, she said, tears streaming down her face. You've been my anchor when everything felt completely impossible. You showed me that I deserve good things happening to me randomly. I don't know how to properly thank you for saving my life. I realized I wasn't just bringing coffee anymore. I was accidentally someone's primary emotional support system and the foundation of their mental health recovery. Emma's therapist had apparently told her that having consistent, positive social interactions was absolutely crucial for her healing process. And somehow I'd become that irreplaceable person in her life. Now I'm four months deep into being someone's weekly lifeline because I couldn't handle 30 seconds of social awkwardness at a coffee Counter like a normal human being. Emma just texted me a three paragraph essay about how excited she is for me to meet her parents this weekend. They're flying in from Cincinnati specifically to meet the Coffee Angel who changed their daughter's life completely and helped her find herself again after losing hope. Her dad, Richard, apparently wants to take me golfing on Sunday morning to properly thank the young man who brought our Emma back to us when we thought we'd lost her forever. Her mom has been cooking my favorite meal all week, except Emma made up what my favorite food was because she was too embarrassed to admit she didn't actually know me that well. I'm completely trapped in being someone's accidental hero over a misheard you too that spiraled into becoming the most important person in a stranger's mental health journey and recovery process. The worst part, I actually look forward to Tuesdays now, too. And I think I'm falling for someone who's in love with a version of me that doesn't really exist.

I accidentally said you too when the Starbucks barista said enjoy your coffee, but instead of cringing and walking away like a normal person, she looked genuinely confused and said wait, what did you say? My brain completely short circuited. I panicked and blurted out I said I'll bring you coffee too sometime. She lit up with this huge smile and said oh my god, that's really sweet. What's your name? Now I'm committed to this insane promise. I came back the next Tuesday with a venti caramel macchiato. Her name tag said Emma. She was so genuinely happy she teared up a little and gave me her number saying text me so I know this actually happened. I figured I'd send one polite text and let it naturally fade away, but Emma started texting me paragraphs about her terrible shift, her nightmare roommate Stephanie who never cleaned dishes and left rotting food everywhere, how my random gesture of kindness completely made her weak and gave her hope that good people still exist. I felt genuinely bad for her situation, so I kept responding with supportive messages and stupid memes to cheer her up. Three weeks later, I'm bringing Emma coffee every Tuesday at exact like two forty seven PM during her break. She starts calling me her coffee angel and introducing me to her co workers as the sweetest guy who randomly brings Me? Coffee for absolutely no reason except pure kindness. The whole coffee shop thinks we're dating. Her manager keeps asking when I'm going to officially ask her out. I'm too deep to correct anyone now. Then her mom visited from Ohio for Emma's birthday weekend. Emma insisted I meet her, saying I was thoughtful, one who brightens her Tuesdays when everything else in life feels overwhelming. Her mom grabbed me in this bone crushing hug and whispered, you're exactly what Emma needs right now, sweetheart. She talks about you constantly. That's when I Learned Emma had been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for two years. Our Tuesday coffee ritual was literally the only consistent positive thing in her week that she could count on. She'd started scheduling her therapy appointments around our meetups because they gave her something concrete to look forward to during her darkest moments. By

Sure. I said, you got $32,000 for tuition. I'm building my brand, bro. Then build your way out of my driveway. Saturday morning, Marcus went full influencer meltdown, posted that I was an abusive narcissist, tagged half the family, captioned it, toxic father can't handle the truth. It blew up over 1,000 likes. But the comments, brutal. Bro said he wasn't his real dad and still wanted dad's money. Even my brother texted, want me to comment? I said, nah, let him cook. By Sunday, Marcus was officially expelled from Westfield Academy. He stomped into my room yelling, you ruined my life. Now I have to go to public school. Talk to Dante, I said. Maybe he can get you verified. That night, Veronica tried filing an emergency custody order to force me to keep paying. The judge literally laughed. Private school isn't a necessity, I said. Case dismissed. A few hours later, I found a note under my door. Dad, I messed up. Mom and Dante filled my head with lies. He's broke. She's miserable. I lost the only person who ever cared about me. I'm sorry. Didn't respond. Let him sit with that one. A few days later, he broke down for real. I just wanted to make her proud. She said, you were controlling, that you ruined her life. I laughed. She left because she wanted to sell protein powder on Instagram. That's her dream. Not exactly Nobel Prize material. Then Karma delivered the finale. Dante got arrested selling fake pre workout online. One of his clients ended up in the hospital. Cops found boxes of counterfeit supplements in his trunk. Veronica called me dreaming. This is your fault. If you hadn't been so petty, click blocked. Now Marcus goes to public school, says the kids are more real. Met a girl named Maya who called him entitled on day 1. She's right. I told him keep her. A week later, Veronica showed up again with her sister and Dante's mom begging me to forget. I told them he's learning the difference between love and convenience. That's a lesson worth every penny. Now Dante's in jail, Veronica's back on Tinder. Marcus is working part time, saving up for a used Honda. The car I sold paid off my mortgage. The college funds still sitting untouched. People say I went too far, but I didn't teach him a lesson. Life did. He said I wasn't his real dad. Now he knows what real consequences look like.

Mom's boyfriend is better. I said, okay. Then I stopped the private school payments and sold his car. 72 hours later, his mother was threatening legal action. I raised Marcus alone since he was 8. His mom, Veronica, ditched us for some gym bro named Dante, with a protein shake in one hand and a selfie stick in the other. She didn't want custody. She wanted freedom. So I gave it to her. For nine years, it was just me and Marcus, private school, summer camps, BMW for his 16th, all paid from overtime and sweat. I wasn't rich. I just loved my kid. Then out of nowhere, Veronica pops back in like a bad sequel. She's all designer bags and fake smile. And suddenly Marcus starts spending weekends at her place. Then one Sunday he comes home with Dante's Cologne on his hoodie and a new attitude. He looks me dead in the eye and says, you're not my real dad. Dante gets me better. He actually supports my dreams. Just stared at him. Your dreams of what? Being an influencer. Dante says I have natural charisma. I nodded once. Okay. The next morning I called his school, canceled tuition, listed his car online. By lunch, I had $30,000 sitting pretty in my account. By that afternoon, Marcus came running into the house red faced and crying. They said, I can't take my exams if you don't pay. Ask Your real father figure, I said, cracking a beer. The meltdown was instant. Veronica started blowing up my phone, 47 texts in a day. You can't abandon your son like this, Dante's cousin says. This is illegal. I texted back once, asked Dante to cover it. Next day she stormed into my job screaming in front of my boss that I was ruining Marcus's view. Security dragged her out while my boss just nodded and said, stand your ground, man. That night, Marcus tried the sympathy act, cooked dinner, cleaned his room, even apologized. I didn't mean it, dad. I was just mad. You're my real father, right? and this has nothing to do with your car and school disappearing. He froze. That's different. Get out of my face, Marcus. By Friday, the circus rolled up. Veronica, her sister and Dante's mom, Rosa, 65, dressed like she owned the Vatican start. It's preaching about family values in our family, she says. We don't abandon children. Then pay for his school. I said. Dante strolls in wearing a tank top in December and go.

We have comprehensive logs showing you accessed and copied 43 documents belonging to Michael Chen without authorization. That's not, we collaborate on everything. It's team based work. Then you won't mind explaining why you downloaded his Henderson campaign at 2:00am and presented it word for word as your original work. Derek started stuttering. Michael never said it was his. He shared it openly. Janet interrupted. Actually, Michael emails me his work directly for approval. Your name has never been on any of these projects until you stole them. This is a misunderstanding. Michael and I work together closely. Thomas looked up from his notes. Mister Chen, would you like to respond to that? I've been sitting quietly in the corner letting them present the evidence. Actually, Derek, we've never collaborated on a single project. You taking my work, claimed credit and now tried to get me fired to cover your tracks. Derek turned desperate. This is insane. Michael's just upset that I'm more successful. Ask anyone on the team who the real contributor is. That's when Thomas said something that made Derek's world collapse. Actually, we did ask someone. We asked Michael's brother. His brother. You know him as the company president, Robert Chen. Derek's mouth fell open. Expensive suit. Guy was my brother, Robert, who'd been taking notes on Derek's corporate theft case. You mean the Michael Chen I've been hearing about in family dinners for the past six months? Is the same Michael Chen whose work you've been stealing? Derek looked between us, finally seeing the family resemblance he'd missed when Michael mentioned his coworker was taking credit for his ideas. I suggested he document everything and let it play out. I wanted to see how far someone would go. Robert closed his notebook. Derek, you're terminated effective immediately. Security will escort you out. Wait, this isn't fair. I didn't know he was your brother. That's exactly the point. You thought you could steal from someone who couldn't fight back. After Derek was walked out, Robert turned to me. Why didn't you just tell me who was stealing your work? I wanted to handle it professionally, not through family connections. Well, you handled it perfectly. The documentation you provided will help us prevent this from happening to other employees. Janet smiled. Derek spent months trying to get rid of the wrong person. Turns out he was trying to eliminate his boss's brother while stealing from the company president's family.

What he didn't know was that our boss was my older brother. Started small, then escalated to claiming my entire project proposals as his original ideas. I documented everything instead of confronting him. Screenshots, time stamps, recorded sessions. I figured the truth would come out naturally. The breaking point came during our quarterly review meeting. Derek stood up with my entire marketing campaign, the one I'd spent three weeks developing for the Henderson account, and presented it as his breakthrough concept. I've been working nights and weekends on this, he told the room, really pushing myself to think outside the box for our biggest client. I sat there watching him describe my color schemes, my taglines, even my budget projections, word for word from the presentation I shared with him the week before, asking for feedback as a colleague. After the meeting, Derek cornered me in the break room. You seemed quiet in there, Michael. Everything okay? Just listening. I said, good, because honestly, I've been meaning to talk to you about stepping up your game. The team needs people who contribute original thinking, not just clock watchers. That's stung. Derek looked me up and down dismissively. Maybe consider whether this role is right for your skill set. The next day, Derek scheduled a meeting with our boss, requesting my transfer to a different department. He told Janet that I was holding Back team productivity. Janet listened to his concerns, then asked to speak with me privately. Michael, Derek says you're not contributing ideas and the team's frustrated with your participation. I nodded. What do you think? Janet smiled. I think Derek doesn't know who he's talking about. I've been watching this for months. Derek's been presenting your work as his own. You knew? I know because you emailed me your drafts before every project. I've seen your original files with time stamps. Derek's been accessing shared folders and copying your work. Why didn't you say anything? I wanted to see how far he'd take it. Janet opened her laptop. All file access is logged. Here's Derek downloading your Henderson campaign at 2:00am last Tuesday. He's accessed your files 43 times in two months. So what happens now? Now Derek gets to explain to HR why he's been committing intellectual property theft while trying to frame his victim for poor performance. The HR meeting was scheduled for Friday afternoon. Derek walked in confident, expecting to discuss my transfer to the filing department. Instead, he found Janet, the HR director, and someone he didn't recognize. A man in an expensive suit taking notes. Derek, this is Tom.

At 16, I worked after school for eight months and if $2,000 for a used car. My parents found my savings envelope hidden in my closet and took it. They use my money to pay for Brianna's driving lessons and insurance because she needed a car more than me since she had anxiety about taking the bus. When I begged for it back, they said, family helps family. I didn't get a single dollar back. Brianna got her license in a car while I took the bus for Two more years. Every single time Brianna came first, I stopped expecting anything different. Fast forward 10 years. I'm engaged to the most amazing guy, Logan. I didn't want Brianna in the wedding at all, but my parents called me, crying. If Brianna isn't the maid of honor, we're not coming. We'll tell the whole family you excluded your sister on purpose. I caved because I didn't want the drama. Biggest mistake of my life. During rehearsal, Brianna started her comments. White isn't really your color. You'd look better in cream or maybe blush. This song's too slow for the bridesmaids. It'll drag and bore people. Oh, and I've been thinking. I should walk down the aisle, too, right before you. It would look so elegant having both sisters make an entrance. People will love it. I shut her down hard. No changes. This is my wedding, not yours. She pouted, but I thought that was the end of it. Wedding day arrives. I'm in the bridal suite getting ready when my coordinator rushes in, panic. Your sister brought a white dress. Like, wedding white. She says it's cream, but it's white white. I told her to handle it and just keep Rihanna away from me until the ceremony. The ceremony starts. My bridesmaids walk down perfectly. Then suddenly, the music changes. Not my chosen song. I look up, confused, and Brianna standing at the back of the aisle in that white dress, holding a bouquet I definitely didn't give Her posing

Oh, it's exactly what it sounds like. I held up printed photos. Her and Bradley at the Marriott. Her mom's hand went to her mouth. You've been sleeping with your lawyer and plotting to sell my house. Proof, time stamps, audio, everything. Rebecca screamed. You hired someone to follow me? That's illegal. Recording a fraud scheme. Totally legal. Her sister Nicole muttered, Becca, what the hell? Rebecca snapped, shut up! Tom's loaded. He can afford it. That house is half mine anyway. Eight months, I said. You've lived there eight months, paid zero rent, contributed nothing. You don't own a brick. I pulled out an envelope. You've been served eviction notice. Got 30 days to get out. Your things are already packed. Dennis and Mike are loading the truck right now.

Venue vendors all notified an hour ago. And Bradley's wife? She got copies of everything. That shut her up. Her mom, Started crying. Guests gathered. Someone yelled, holy shit! As I walked out. By the time I got home, Rebecca's ring was on the dresser. The PI texted, Bradley's wife just called his office. He's finished. I poured a drink, opened my blinds, and watched the movers haul her boxes away. That's how I ended an engagement, exposed two frauds, and kept my house. All in one afternoon.

They've been meeting at hotels twice a week for four months. He sent photos, Marriott, his car, his apartment. Dates going back to before the prenup talk. Then the kicker. Bradley's deep in debt. Specializes in partition sales, forcing co owners to sell property. Their plan was simple. She gets on my deed, they force a sale, split the profit. My fiance and her side piece lawyer were trying to steal my house. Her bridal shower was in two weeks. 40 guests, mom hosting. I smiled for the first time in days. I played perfect.

The PI kept sending proof. Audio this time. Rebecca laughing in Bradley's car. He's sweet, but boring. Once we sell the house, we can finally be together for real. That was my green light. Bridal shower, day two PM. Packed backyard. Champagne and gold decorations everywhere. Rebecca and a tiara opening gifts. Mom answered the door. Tom, what are you doing here? It's bad luck.

I was sitting in the front row when Emily stood up during the eulogy. The. The chapel was packed, maybe 200 people. All of Dad's friends from the veterans lodge, his old coworkers from the postal service, neighbors from the block where he'd lived for 30 years. Dad trusted me with everything, she announced, her voice echoing off the walls. I was the only one who knew his wishes. I'll be handling the estate personally. My stomach dropped. I'm a paralegal at Michelin Associates downtown, and I've been helping dad update his will for the past six months. Every Saturday morning, we'd meet at the coffee shop near his house, order black coffee and a blueberry muffin, and we'd go through everything, line by line. Emily had no idea. She kept going, her voice getting louder and more confident. Dad and I talked every single day. He told me exactly how he wanted things handled. The house, the savings account, his veterans benefits. He wanted me to oversee all of it. I glanced at my mom sitting next to me. She looked confused, her tissues crumpled in her hands. They'd been divorced for 15 years, but she'd come anyway because dad, specifically Asked her to be there. That should have been Emily's first clue. Something was off. Some people, Emily continued, her eyes landing on me for just a second, only showed up when it was convenient. But I was there for dad when it mattered. My hands started shaking. I pulled out my phone and open the documents folder. Everything was backed up there. The will, the notes from our meetings, even the text messages where dad joked about Emily's upcoming surprise. Emily was really warming up now. Dad always said family was everything to him. That's why he trusted me to carry out his legacy. I know some of you might have questions about the arrangements, but rest assured, I'll be handling everything according to his exact wishes. Her husband, Richard

So my husband has this thing where he'll text me, like, four hours before people show up and be like, my brother and his wife are coming for dinner, or the guys are coming over to watch the game, and I'm supposed to just drop everything, clean the whole house, go buy food, and cook for, like, eight people every single time. The first few times it happened, I actually did it. I'd be running around like crazy, vacuuming, scrubbing the bathroom, throwing stuff in closets. And I'd speed to the grocery store, spend, like, a hundred bucks, come back, and cook while still in my work clothes. By the time people showed up, I looked like a mess. And he'd be all relaxed, like, hey, everyone, come in! Like he did something. One time, he invited his parents and didn't tell me until I was already at target buying stuff for myself. I had to abandon my cart and go buy ingredients for his mom's favorite pot roast recipe that takes three hours to make. I literally got home with two hours left. I didn't even eat that night because I was so stressed. But the worst one was when he told me his college buddies were coming over in four hours. Four hours? It was a Saturday, and I've been planning to deep clean my closet all day. I was in old Sweats with my hair in a messy bun, no bra, looking rough. He texted me at, like, 2 in the afternoon. Hey, babe, Jake, Kevin, and Brad are coming at six. Can you grab some steaks and make that potato salad they liked last time? I just sat there staring at my phone. That potato salad takes forever because you have to boil the potatoes, let them cool, dice everything super small. Plus, our house was a disaster. There were dishes in the sink from breakfast, laundry on the couch. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned in a week. I texted back, you're inviting people in four hours? And didn't ask me first. He goes, it's not a big deal. They're chill. Yeah, they're chill because they're not the ones doing anything. They just show up, eat free food, mess up the house, and leave.

The tension at work is insane now. People avoid me in the hallways. Nobody sits with me at lunch anymore. Even Beth, who gave me pizza that day, has been weird and distant.

And my wife and her family believed her instantly. My wife slapped me hard and her brothers beat me up and destroyed my life. I booked a one way ticket and vanished. Few years later, she finally tracked me down and banged on my door in desperation. I was in the kitchen, coffee, radio, quiet. Then the door opened and my wife Tessa came in with her sister Alina. Both look like someone died. I asked what happened. No one answered. Alina just said it, no hesitation. Adrian got me pregnant. Everything went blank. Like my brain just froze trying to understand if I heard her right. I laughed. Actually laughed because it sounded so ridiculous. Then crack. Tessa slapped me so hard, my mug shattered on the floor. I didn't even move. Her face was twisted, like she just discovered a crime scene. And before I could say a single word, her brothers stormed in. Like it was rehearsed. They grabbed me, dragged me out the front door and started throwing punches like I wasn't family. Like I was a stranger they've been waiting to destroy. Neighbors were filming. Someone shouted to stop. Nobody did. Tessa just stood there, watching. Not a here, not a single word. I left that night. Didn't pack much, didn't say goodbye. Wrote you didn't even ask? On the bathroom mirror and walked out of my life. By the next day, people from work were Texting me weird stuff. Then my boss emailed. I was being placed on leave. That's when I realized Alina's story had gone online. No names, but enough details. People connected. Dot, that's fast. Every comment was the same. Typical man. Hope she presses charges.

They turned on me. Everyone knows the truth now. I don't even have a place to stay. I stared at her for a long time. You didn't lose everything, I said. You gave it away. Just like you gave me away. She looked up at me, desperate. Do you hate me? I laughed. No. Hate takes energy. I stopped spending any on you a long time ago. She reached for my hand. I stepped back. She was sobbing, shaking, whispering, please. I don't know what to do. I opened the door. You live with it the same way I did. Rain pouring. Her standing there, small and broken. And me just watching. He whispered, I never stopped loving you. And I said, then you should have asked me before you destroyed me. Then I closed the door. A week later, the recording leaked online. You could hear Alina's voice clear as day. I told them he did it because I hated how perfect he was. He looked at me like I was nothing. So I made him nothing. Millions of views. Her job gone. Her brothers, their mom dragged across the internet for defending them. Tessa. She disappeared. But not before posting one story. Turns out truth hurts. Louder. Than lies. I didn't react, didn't post, didn't reply. But I still see her sometimes in my head. Standing in that rain, realizing she'd believed a lie over the man who loved her most. And honestly, that's the part that'll haunt her forever.

Lynette walked onto that massive stage, looking tiny in her formal dress. She sat at the grand piano and looked at me. I nodded back. Then she took a deep breath and started playing let it go from frozen. But she played it badly. Really badly. Wrong notes everywhere. Completely off rhythm. But she was smiling. For the first time in months, my daughter was smiling. She even started singing along quietly, forgetting hundreds of people were watching. The judges looked confused. The audience shifted uncomfortably as the terrible music assaulted their ears. Vince turned white, then red, then purple. And I swore I saw fumes coming out of his head. She finished with a flourish, stood up and actually took a bow. The scattered, confused applause was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. Vince exploded in the parking lot. You told her to do that? He was right. But I didn't care anymore. Three months of my time, my money. I lost $50,000 because of you. He grabbed Lynette's shoulders. You're done with piano? Done. I'm selling it tomorrow. That's when Lynette said something that changed everything. Good, she said, looking him straight in the eye. I hate piano now. You made me hate the thing I loved. Most, she pulled out her little notebook where she used to write songs. I wanted to compose music when I grew up, like the Disney movies. But now I can't even listen to piano without feeling sick. She threw the notebook in the trash. Thanks for ruining my dream, daddy. The silence that followed was deafening. Even Vince seemed stunned.

I begged him to let her have just one day off. The competition is in two weeks. He scream. You wanna throw away $50,000? As days passed, Lynette stopped smiling entirely. She'd sit at the piano like a robot, playing the same advanced piece over and over. Her little fingers could barely reach all the keys. One night, I found her trying to tape her fingers straight because they hurt too much to bend. Mommy, if I win, will daddy be happy? She asked. Will he let me stop? My heart shattered. I held her while she sobbed. It's okay, sweetheart. That's when Vince found us and yanked Lynette away from me. Stop filling her head with weakness. He has to practice. I knew this couldn't go on, and I knew I had to do something soon or risk losing my daughter. The day of the competition arrived. There were 500 kids from across the country, and Linette was the youngest in her division. When we were backstage, I comforted her because she kept throwing up from all the nerves. Vinsten care at all. It's just stage fright. She'll be fine. I cleaned her face and held Her close other parents stared as Vince paced, calculating the prize money out loud. That's when I finally made my decision. I knelt down to Linette's level and whispered in her ear, sweetheart, when you get on that stage, I want you to play whatever makes you happy.

This is our ticket, he kept saying, eyes glued to his laptop, showing past winners. I tried to reason with him. Vince, she. He's not ready for this level. He slammed his hand on the table in anger. She either wins or she quits piano forever. I'm not paying for a hobby. This is an investment. You see, Lynette loved piano. She play Disney songs after school, making up little dances as she went. But now Vince had her practicing six hours a day. No friends, no TV, no playing outside. Daddy, my fingers hurt, Lynette whispered during dinner once winners don't complain, Vince shot back.

Lynette would have to wake up at 5:00am to practice before school. Her teacher ended up quitting because Vince screamed at her for wasting time on basics. Then he hired someone he found online who claimed to train competition champions. This new teacher made Lynette play the same piece 50 times in a row. If she made one mistake, she'd start Over. Lynette's hands started shaking constantly. Her finger joints were constantly in pain.

This happened three weeks ago, and I still can't get the feeling of that cold water running down my back out of my mind. We were making dinner together. Just simple canned chili, nothing fancy. She asked me to chop some onions to add to it. I thought it was straightforward enough. I've chopped onions before. I'm not completely useless in the kitchen. I was standing at the counter, carefully cutting them up, trying to make sure they were decent sized. She walked by to check on the chili and suddenly stopped. Her whole mood shifted instantly. What are you doing? Those are way too coarse. They're supposed to be much smaller than that. I looked down at what I've done. They seemed fine to me. But I said, okay, I can fix it. She got more upset. No, you already ruined it. You put them in the pot already. The chili is messed up now. I tried explaining that they were just sitting on top. I could scoop them out easily with a spoon, cut them smaller and put them back in. No big deal. But she just pushed me out of the way and grabbed the knife from my hand. I let go immediately. My self esteem has been pretty much non existent for a while now. So I just back. I started saying that I did exactly what she asked me to do. And if she'd wanted them added at the end as a garnish instead of during cooking, she should have just told me that. I wish I could do something, anything, right for once. I walked to the bedroom feeling pathetic. I'm 28 years old, and apparently I can't even make canned chili correctly. I sat on the bed, trying to stay out of her way so she could fix whatever I'd supposedly destroyed. A few minutes later, she brought dinner in on a tray. I was ready to just drop the whole thing and move on. We both both ate quietly. She only finished about half of her food before taking it back to the kitchen. I apologized again, multiple times, trying to smooth things over. She didn't respond, just stared at me with this look. So I tried to explain my side, that maybe the communication could have been clear about exactly how she wanted those onions prepared and when to add them. That's when she cut me off. You're not listening to me. You keep interrupting. I genuinely didn't understand. I thought we were taking turns talking. I was desperately trying to stay calm.

Here we go. Number one, they should not allow topless sunbathing on the beach. It was very distracting for my husband, who just wanted to relax. On my holiday to India, I was disgusted to find that almost every restaurant served curry. I don't like spicy food. We went on holiday to Spain and had a problem with the taxi drivers as they were all Spanish. We booked an excursion to a water park, but no one told us we had to bring our own swimsuits and towels. We assumed it would be included in the price. The beach was too sandy. We had to clean everything. When we returned to our room, well, we found the sand was not like the sand in the brochure. Your sand show. The sand is white, but it was more yellow. It's lazy for the shopkeepers to close in the afternoon. I often needed to buy things during siesta time. This should be banned. No one told us there would be fish in the water. The children were scared. Although the brochure said there was a fully equipped kitchen, there was no egg slicer in the drawers. I think it should be explained in the brochure that the local convenience stores does not sell proper biscuits like custard creams and ginger nuts. The roads were uneven and bumpy, so we could not read the local guidebook during the bus. Ride to the resort. Because of this, we were unaware of many things that would have made our holiday more fun. It took us nine hours to fly home from Jamaica to England. It took the Americans only three hours to get home. This seems unfair. I compared the size of our one bedroom suite to our friends three bedroom and ours was significantly smaller. The brochure stated no hairdressers at the resort. We're trainee hairdressers. And we think they knew and made us wait longer for service. I don't even want to act out the next one, but I'm gonna read it. When we were in Spain, there were too many Spanish people there. The receptionist spoke Spanish, the food was Spanish. No one told us that there would be so many foreigners. Really? We had to line up outside to catch the boat. And there was no air conditioning. Come on! It is your duty as a tour operator to advise us on noisy and unruly guests before we travel. I was bitten by a mosquito. The brochure did not mention mosquitoes. Come on, people, really? Get ready for the last one, cause this one. My fiance and I requested twin beds when we booked, but instead we were placed in a room with a king bed. We now hold you responsible and want to be reimbursed for the fact that I became pregnant. This would not have happened if you had put us in the room that We booked. Are you kidding me

Well, there was one. What was the issue? An ED DOC had some concerns about your judgment. Look, Miss Scott, I think I know who that is, and I just want to say. No need to explain, April. Trauma surgeons can be a prickly bunch. So it was a trauma surgeon. Let's put that aside. I see that we've received all of your transcripts, so I think I have everything I need.

But the footprints on the floor. They made it clear this wasn't that simple. The coroner checked his body again. Still dead. But while everyone was freaking out, a glass of milk tipped over by itself. The cops froze. The captain swore the kid moved. The coroner checked again and saw his fingers were messed up, like he'd clawed his way out. Something felt seriously off. He told the captain to call the dad and bury the kid again immediately. At the same time, they found some weird footprints outside the house. Suddenly, the neighbor's kid climbed in through the window like it was just another day. Then the dead kid slowly turned his head and stared right at him. A scream came out of nowhere. The cops rushed in. Only found a backpack on the ground. That's when they knew they couldn't wait any longer. They had to take care of the body. They stuffed the kid in the fridge, even put a flower pot on top so he wouldn't get out. Not long after, the captain heard a creepy noise from the fridge and nearly jumped out of his skin.

But yesterday, they posted this picture to X, which was their team GPA. The team had a GPA average of 2.72, with 15 players having a perfect 4.0 and 51 players having a 3.5 or above. Now, at first look, you're like, 66 players with the GPA over 3.5. Like, that's good. But then that left us with some questions. If 66 players on the team have really good GPS, how did you get such a low average? Now, for what it's worth, a team GPS that is good is considered 2.3 or higher. So this 2.72, not too bad. Then people started to do some digging on this team. They found that the UMHB Crusader football team has 192 players. 192! There are 18 quarterbacks on this football team.

So this man right here is Shamar Stewart from Texas a M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. Number two.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets at 52.3% Of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys.

The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 250.

And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand.

And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him.

And I just know Saban's at his 20 million dollar mansion in Florida right now going, hey, told you so, should have listened to me. Cause this week, Tennessee's quarterback Nico I am Maliwa had a holdout because he wanted more nil money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico and he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by 4, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

And after the game on Sunday, this viral video was taken where Jack and his buddies are walking down the street saying they're looking for stragglers, basically just anyone wearing a commanders Jersey. And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy in which after the fact he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it. Like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. I got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm on a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you all you need to know. But it gets So much worse. He was once.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully, Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55%

Thought he would go to jail because a witness identified him. He was quickly arrested. The judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison, but when it was time to be imprisoned, no police came to take him away. He didn't try to escape because he knew he deserved it. He just waited nervously in his own home, expecting the police to appear at any moment. Several weeks have passed and the police have not come yet. He thought that the police might have revoked his criminal record, so in the following years he continued his life and completely forgot about it. He got married, started a construction company, and even took the initiative to help young people, avoiding them from repeating his mistakes. But 13 years later, the police suddenly came to his house and arrested him, which shocked him greatly. Originally, due to a technical issue, the police thought he was in prison for the past 13 years. When they were about to release him, they realized he wasn't there at all, so they immediately sent police to arrest him. When the police told him that he must now complete his 13 year prison sentence, he collapsed in court. The judge saw that Michael had completely changed his life and successfully reformed himself, so he released him and did not let him serve another sentence in prison.

When their father, Jamil Penn returned home, he smelled the smell of grilled meat and thought it was his wife cooking. When he walked into the kitchen, he realized that something terrible had happened. His two children are in the oven. By the time he rescued them, it was already too late. Jamil trembled and dialed 9 1 1 to report the incident. The police arrived at the scene and immediately arrested their mother, 24 year old Lamora Williams. Even more heartbreaking is that investigators are no longer able to identify two children. Lamora told the police that she doesn't know who killed her child. Then she blamed her cousin for the crime. And finally she said it was her sister who killed the children. She is uncertain and provided false information. Lemora is charged with two counts of murder. But in court, Lemora's sister claimed that Lemora had suffered from serious mental health problems since childhood. She even tried to end her own life. After psychological evaluation, it was confirmed that Lamora William has cognitive impairment. The final judge sentenced her to 5 years in prison. Do you think this is a fair judgment?

He was quickly arrested. The judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison. But when it was time to be imprisoned, no police came to take him away. He didn't try to escape because he knew he deserved it. He just waited nervously in his own home, expecting the police to appear at any moment. Several weeks have passed and the police have not come yet. He thought that the police might have revoked his criminal record. So in the following years, he continued his life and completely forgot about it. He got married, started a construction company and even took the initiative to help young people, avoiding them from repeating his mistakes. But 13 years later, the police suddenly came to his house and arrested him, which shocked him greatly. Originally, due to a technical issue, the police thought he was in prison for the past 13 years. When they were about to release him, they realized he wasn't there at all. So they immediately sent police to arrest him. When the police told him that he must now complete his 13 year prison sentence, he collapsed in court. The judge saw that Michael had completely changed his life and successfully reformed himself. So he released him and did not let him serve another sentence in prison.

Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

Police say that the man tricked the machines into giving him extra cash. Investigators say he and others apparently Learned a trick on social media that has cost Walmart stores nationwide millions of dollars before it got fixed. And it is fixed. But Nunan police say this guy got away with thousands of dollars from Walmart stores in Nunan, Petrie City and Fayetteville. And there's a vulnerability with the point of sale machines that he was able to exploit and get basically double his money. He would, uh, do a transaction that was canceled about halfway through and by the end of it, the point of sale machine would give him double his money back. And he would leave posted information how to trick the Walmart checkout machines into giving cash back on certain types of purchases. Police say in south metro Atlanta, this guy apparently was not the only one observed doing it.

But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem.

Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectora County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollen's and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

In March, Christopher Greggor, a father, brought his six year old son, Corey Mckilolo, to the gym for exercise. According to the surveillance footage, Corey was running wildly on the treadmill and was thrown off six times in a row, each time facing down. However, his father was watching from the side. Not only did he not stop his son, but he also forced him to keep running on it. Corey's mother said that after Corey got home, he kept reporting that he was not feeling well, but Gregor didn't care. A few days later, Corey had difficulty breathing and an epileptic seizure. The doctor took rescue measures, but ultimately failed to save Corey's life. Court documents stated that Corey's deceased was due to a blunt impact on the chest and abdomen, followed by a torn liver. It was determined that it was caused by a fall while running.

Alma is a bodybuilder and figured if she kept fighting, her attacker would get tired and give up. That was my, you know, thought the entire time. Cause the more fight you put in, I do believe they would get more tired cause they see that dang, this girl is fighting, you know, and you can see at the end of the video he was tired.

Campbell says there were roofing materials everywhere. They didn't just remove the shingles, they left the mess everywhere. Um, sides of the house, backyard debris, everything. When Campbell contacted the roofing company, they admitted they made a mistake and had the wrong house. She thought they would replace her roof, and she was shocked when they said no. Campbell called the police, her insurance company, and another roofing contractor, who put down an emergency wrap on her house to protect the roof until it can be completed. The company that took off her roof by mistake is Five Stars Roofing of Markham. We want to be responsible for what we did. We will do her roof for free. If she wants us to do it, we can schedule it.

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing, with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house. And many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totally in. Two hundred and forty five dollars twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars. Ninety one cents. Kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable. It's family friendly. Disney's always a hot topic and we're, we're all trying to pinch pennies. So that video was probably my therapy as I was going through the day. The kids were smiling, sometimes fighting in between the lines. Uh, my wife was having a grand old time. Meanwhile, mine was just swipe the card over and over and over. And it started with the tik get purchase and then it ran right into the parking and then it just was like a cash cow for the rest of the day. So I kind of had an idea that people would be able to relate to it. Uh, just maybe not so much.

So from Super Bowl 1 in 1967 all the way until the 90s, the NFL never spent more than $1,000 a year getting the field ready for the big game. And the whole process would only take about a week. But now the Super Bowl is a billion dollar event and over 100 million people are going to watch it. So that's why the NFL now spends nearly two years preparing the grass for each Super Bowl. And what's interesting is the grass being used this year may be an advantage for the Forty Niners. So for Super Bowl 57 last year in Scottsdale, Arizona, the grass was grown at a local farm for 18 months. Then a few weeks before the game, it was brought to the stadium where it would sit outside in the sun during the day and then rolled into the stadium at night to avoid the cold. The cost last year was $800,000. But if you remember, the field was actually terrible. Players on both teams were slipping everywhere. It was a disaster. They had to replace their cleats. So will it be better this year? Well, the grass from this Super Bowl is coming.

So this is Max McGee. And in 1967, he was a 34 year old backup wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers. He only had four receptions all year, and he planned on retiring after the season. So the night before Super Bowl won in Los Angeles between the Chiefs and Packers. Max wasn't worried about getting rest before the big game. He wanted to go party. So after the final eleven PM room check, he snuck out of the hotel and went out with two flight attendants he met. Max spent the entire night drinking. He didn't sleep, and when he finally returned to the hotel at 6:30 in the morning, he was greeted by their quarterback bark star in the lobby, who was already up getting ready for the game. Max thought he wasn't going to play that day, and in the pre game meeting, he actually told their star wide receiver Boyd Dowler that he better not get hurt because Max was way too hungover to play. However, of course, his worst nightmare came true. Dowler separated his shoulder on the first drive, and coach

I have two of the same letter. That's fine to say. Could I say my letter sounds like goo? No. Okay. How about if you were to spell it out? It would kind of look like a? No. Or if we were to look at the alphabet, it would be No. 8. No, you cannot say the sound shape or location of the letter. How about this?

So 10 years later, I abandoned them and got my revenge. I was 8 when my parents brought Steven home. He was 7, skinny, and had this way of crying that made adults panic. Within a month, I was invisible. Christmas that year, I got socks. Steven got a Nintendo 64. When I asked why, my mom said, he's been through so much. You're lucky you've always had us. I stopped asking after that. By the time I turned 13, the pattern was clear. Steven wanted pizza, we got pizza. I wanted Chinese. We already decided on pizza. My birthday parties got smaller every year until they stopped happening entirely. His got bigger. At 14, I made honor roll. Straight A's for the first time. I showed my parents the certificate, hands shaking with pride. My mom glanced at it, that's nice, sweetie, then turned to Steven, did you finish your homework? Steven was failing three classes. That same week, they bought him a four hundred dollar guitar because he said he might want to learn. It sat in the corner untouched for two years. When I asked for a twenty dollar calculator for math class, my dad said we couldn't afford it. I started stealing quarters from the couch to buy my own school supplies. The final straw came at 16. My parents planned a party at my favorite arcade. First time they've done anything for me in years. I Invited 12 friends. Spent weeks hyped. Three days before I overheard Steven on the phone. Yeah, just throw a fit the day before. They always cave. Then it'll be my part party, and he'll look like an idiot in front of his friends. He knew I was listening. He smiled at me. Day of, Steven threw his tantrum. Right on schedule. Said he wanted to go to the same arcade for his birthday next month. My parents caved. We'll celebrate you both today. Steven already cleared it with you, right? I hadn't even spoken to Steven that week. When I said no, my dad pulled me aside. Stop being selfish. He's fragile. You're not. They brought out one cake. Vanilla. Steven's favorite. I'm allergic to vanilla. I watched my friends eat my birthday cake while I sat in the corner with hives breaking out on my neck. Steven blew out the candles, made a wish, smiled at me. That night, I found out why they really adopted him. I wasn't supposed to see the letter, but it was sitting on my dad's desk.

And make sure everything is perfect this time, my husband added. I smiled and said, of course. But at 3:00am, I was at the airport instead. For five years, I've been the perfect daughter in law. I cooked elaborate holiday meals, hosted family gatherings and never complained when my husband, Hudson's mother, Vivian, turned every Celebration into a performance I was expected to orchestrate alone. This year, Vivian handed me a guest list three days before Thanksgiving, 32 people. She'd upgraded the menu, too. Three different stuffings, seven side dishes, four desserts, all from scratch. When I mentioned it seemed like a lot for one person, she waved her hand dismissively. Nonsense. You're perfectly capable. Besides, Hudson will help. Hudson's idea of help was carving the Turkey and opening wine bottles. Maybe an hour of work total while I handled 37 hours of preparation. The breaking point came when Vivian called at 3 a. M. The night before, worried I might not properly handle a guest's severe nut allergy. She'd forgotten to mention until then three of my prepared dishes contained nuts. I have to remake everything. Start cooking at 4 a. M, she instructed. Maybe 3:30 if you want everything perfect. But something had shifted inside me. I'd spent two days in preparation hell while Hudson played golf. I'd asked him for help and he told me I was so much better at cooking than He was. I'd mentioned feeling overwhelmed and he assured me I'd pull it off like always. That night, I sat at my kitchen table staring at the guest list, 32 names. Mine wasn't on it. I was cooking for 32 people and wasn't even considered a guest. That's when I noticed Hudson's cousin Ruby wasn't listed either. I called her and discovered Vivian had uninvited her after her divorce, saying she'd be more comfortable elsewhere since she was going through such a difficult time. Ruby had been family for eight years, but the moment she needed support instead of providing entertainment value, Vivian cut her loose. I saw my own future in that moment. One bad Thanksgiving away from being discarded myself. On impulse, I opened a travel website. The first result made my heart race. Last minute Thanksgiving getaway to Hawaii. Flight departs 4:15 a. M, exactly when I was supposed to start cooking. I booked it before I can change my mind. One ticket just for me. For the first time in five years, I was going somewhere Hudson hadn't approved of, somewhere Vivian hadn't vetted.

His domestic partner is also there. Everything is fine. And then suddenly a piece of jewelry went missing and they allegedly blamed the 16 year old. That is when the two of them tortured this girl for at least 4 days, ending her life with a billiard ball down her throat over jewelry. His name is Steven Grass. He is 35. And she is Michelle Brandis. She's 37. And most importantly, this is Miranda Corset. Miranda had been on a dating website. When she met Steve, they started talking and he invited her over to the house. Everything went fine that first day and she goes back home. She had been living with her grandmother because both of her parents have passed away and she also has an 11 month old baby. So the following day she decides to go back over to their home and she never came home. And unfortunately, because she has frequently just left and not came back, the grandma didn't report it because she assumed she just went off again, which is honestly so awful in itself. So she then goes back. She's at their home. That's when the jewelry goes missing. That's when they torture her. That's when they take her life. And then the two of them dismember her and throw her in a freaking trash can. Right now the police believe that her Body is in a landfill because of her history. This is not taken seriously. I don't understand how anyone could do this to anyone for literally any reason. As of now, they are charged and they are sitting in a jail cell. And I hope Miranda receives justice. And I am begging every teenager, learn from her mistake that she did not get the chance to learn from.

Curious about her appearance, they seemed threatening. So Luna quickly grabbed her keys and drove away. Luna was born with a unique condition. Her facial features were reversed. At Neil's restaurant, she discreetly used a tube and funnel system to eat her chicken soup. She longed for a normal life and wanted to date like anyone else. She even posted selfies online, but they were flagged for violations. Today was her first time going out without a mask. On her way home, the same men were waiting. But luckily, Luna reacted quickly and escape. Back home, she went straight upstairs to bed only to be scolded by her father for not wearing a mask. Her mother had died for the same reason, going out unprotected. Luna simply wanted a normal life. On her birthday, her father gave her a mask and forced it on her, happily taking photos while she felt heartbroken. The next day, she went out maskless again. This same men cornered her, but once again, she managed to escape. Exhausted, Luna collapsed on a bridge. That night, a man named Jack found her and was instantly captivated by her unique appearance. Jack was homeless and often misunderstood. So he shared her feelings of being different. When he was about to jump off the bridge himself, he ran into Luna instead and took her home. With Jack's love and support, Luna finally found the happy, normal life she had always dreamed of.

My wife Julia walked into our bedroom while I was booking dinner reservations for her birthday next month. She announced, I need you to understand my career comes before this marriage. I stopped typing and looked at her. We've been married for three years, and I'd work double shifts to pay bills while she was in business school. For our marriage? I asked. She rolled her eyes. My mentor, Bradley, says mixing personal life with business is weakness. Real success requires sacrifice, she told me. Bradley had been texting her during dinner lately. From now on, work is the priority. Not birthdays, not holidays, not your needs, he continued. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I already told Bradley you're holding me back, he says. That's typical. She added, wait. She told her mentor I was holding her back after everything I've done? So everything comes second to work? I asked. She nodded firmly. Everything. Bradley made millions by 35 because he never let emotions interfere. I thought about arguing, but decided on something else. That's what you want, I told her. Julia smiled and immediately started texting someone. She thought I'd cave? Nope. Her birthday came three weeks later. Usually I'd plan something special. This year, nothing. She came home to a regular Tuesday. Did you forget? She asked, looking confused. Birthdays are personal. Career comes first, remember? I replied. Her face dropped. But you always do something She said quietly. I shrugged. You said celebrations were distractions. He ordered takeout and ate alone while I watched TV. I heard her on the phone with someone later. No, he didn't do anything. Yeah, I'm alone. She was saying, good. Let her explain that to her friends. Her company's investor gala was next month. We leave at seven, she announced. I stayed on the couch. I'm not going, I told her. She froze. Everyone brings spouses. People will ask questions, he said. You said mixing personal with professional was weakness. I reminded her. She begged. Please, just this once, I asked. Bradley says emotions interfere with success, right? She left alone. My buddy Tom.

Connie was devastated. Bobby moved on and married Sandra D. This marriage was a little bit chaotic. Connie's record label was basically threatening to drop her. But her father, who was just a smitch, controlling, was determined to make her a star. He was like, listen, you need to remake the song who's sorry now? She was over it. She was like, uh, uh. But she did it. Dick Clark played it on American Bandstand and it was a hit. She became an overnight sensation. Even though she found success with her career, her personal life was a little bit messier. Connie was married four times, and none of these marriages stuck. When she was 27, she married a press agent named Dick Connellis. This marriage lasted about four months. Seven years later, she married Izzy Marion. He was a hairdresser. This marriage lasted 10 months. A couple of years later, she married husband No. 3, Joe Garzelli. Together they adopted a son named Joe junior. This was her longest marriage. It lasted five years. But during this marriage, in 1974, when she was 37 years old, she was appearing at a music festival. She returned to her motel. She was brutally assaulted. She was raped. There was a mattress thrown onto her. She almost suffocated.

Even now, 63 years after this single came out, pretty little baby Connie Francis is going viral. Connie was the first true pop star of the rock and roll era. She had 35 Top 40 hits in a decade. She sang in 15 languages. But behind her fame, Connie Francis went through a lot. She was born on December 12, 1937 in Newark, New Jersey. She's a Sagittarius. She was born Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero. Her family, Italian American. Her father George, mother Ida and little brother George junior were all very close. When she was 12 years old, she started singing professionally. She played the accordion guardian and her father would enter her in pageants and talent shows. The next year, she started going by Connie Francis because it was easier to pronounce. When she was just 16, she signed a record deal with MGM Records. Even though she was signed to a label early on, her songs weren't really hitting it. She was hired to be Tuesday Weld's singing voice in the movie Rock, Rock, Rock. Remember I just talked about her? She started working with up and coming singer Bobby Darren. They were both young, starting to get famous and they fell for each other hard. But when her pops found out, he was furious. And as the story goes, he started chasing Bobby around the house with a pew, pew.

Jesse was the kind of girl everyone wanted to be. Confident, loud, always in control of every situation. I was her quieter shadow, her responsible friend. She'd laugh and tell people, Lena is the practical one. She's not made for the spotlight like me. At first, I didn't mind. She was beautiful, charismatic, and I genuinely believed she'd make it big one day. We were opposites. She dreamed of fame. I dreamed of stability. But somewhere along the way, her compliments turned into condescension. Whenever I mentioned my goals, she'd laugh, you running a company, babe? You're too nice. You'd cry in your first meeting. She landed a marketing internship our senior year and bragged endlessly about her amazing network. When I got rejected from the same position, she hugged me and said, don't worry. Not everyone's meant for leadership. You'll find something. Say if. That night, I promised myself I'd prove her wrong. After graduation, I worked ridiculous hours at a small startup. Jesse, meanwhile, jumped from job to job, chasing glamorous titles, but never staying long enough to actually build skills. Post filtered coffee selfies with our Char's girl boss and DM me things like, I'm so jealous you're still in that tiny office. I could never do something so boring. While she was chasing aesthetics, I was building experience. Within five years, my tiny office startup grew, and so did I, I became regional operations director, managing three teams. The irony. Our company was now big enough to start hiring marketing managers. And that's how her resume landed on my desk. I stared at her name in disbelief. Jesse Collins.

Everyone knew Aiden would end up at Harvard or somewhere with Ivy on the walls. Straight A's since kindergarten. Spelling bee champion, science fair legend. He'd correct teachers respectfully when they made math mistakes and tutor seniors as a freshman. When other people were studying, Aiden was solving equations nobody understood. He made intelligence look effortless. He'd stay after school to help kids who failed tests, write study guides, even run mock exams for fun. Teachers adored him. Parents compared their kids to him. And honestly, most of us stopped trying to compete. He was untouchable. By junior year, he was already taking college level courses, interning at a tech lab downtown and leading the robotics team to nationals. Everyone joked that Aiden didn't bleed. He processed. Then came the big scholarship competition. National STEM scholars. One full ride to any university in the country, plus a fifty thousand dollar grant for your own research. Aiden was the favorite. His project was revolutionary. A low cost prosthetic handmade from recycled materials. He'd been building it for months, staying up in the lab till midnight, even missing his own birthday party. The final presentations were on a Friday. Aiden's was flawless. The judges were speechless. He was already smiling when Principal Davis took the stage to announce the winner. It wasn't him. They gave the award to Zoe Matthews, Aiden's lab partner. The same Zoe who had spent most of the project Scrolling through her phone while Aiden soldered circuits and wrote code, the same Zoe who'd asked him to handle the paperwork submission because she was bad with forms. Zoe walked up, accepted the award, thanked Aiden for the moral support, and

That night, he stayed late at school. By the next morning, all his files, project plans, code blueprints were deleted from the shared drive. When the robotics club met Monday, Aiden wasn't there. At first, everyone assumed he was just cooling off, but days turned into weeks. He stopped answering texts, stop showing up for competitions, quit tutoring, quit everything. Teachers were confused. You can't just throw your future away, they told him. Aiden would just shrug and say, maybe it wasn't mine to begin with. He started sitting in the back of classes, drawing quietly instead of taking notes. Grades slipped. The valedictorian spot he'd basically owned went to someone else. Zoe posted about her amazing journey as a young innovator, while Aiden deleted all his social media accounts. The guidance counselor tried reaching out. He told her he was fine, that he just didn't see the point anymore. No anger, no drama. Just silence. At graduation, he didn't walk across the stage. He'd finished early, but refused to attend. The principal mentioned him in the speech anyway. A brilliant mind, destined for great things. I saw him a year later at a small bookstore cafe, wearing a barista apron. He smiled when he saw me, but there was nothing behind it. Just tired eyes. No spark, no drive, no hunger to prove anything. The smartest Kid in school had stopped trying. And honestly, maybe that was the smartest decision he ever made.
