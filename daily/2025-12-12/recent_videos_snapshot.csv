Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totaling two hundred and forty five dollars, twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars, ninety one cents. Kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable, it's family friendly. Disney's always a hot topic, and we're, we're all trying to pinch pennies. So that video was probably my therapy as I was going through the day. The kids were smiling, sometimes fighting in between the lines. Uh, my wife was having a grand old time. Meanwhile, mine was just swipe the card over and over and over. And it started with the ticket purchase, and then it ran right into the parking, and then it just was like a cash cow for the rest of the day.

Alone, every single day. But when her husband decided to follow her, what he saw inside was so disturbing that he called the police immediately. Susan, a 24 year old woman, went to the ranch stable every day. Always alone, always at the same time. At first, her husband thought it was just stress. But over time, he began to notice something strange. She smiled for no reason, dressed up more than usual, and no longer allowed him into the stable. That's when he decided to install a hidden camera. And when he opened his computer to watch the footage, what he saw made his heart race. Susan wasn't alone. And the way she touched, the way she smiled, left him frozen. In the corner of the screen, something moved. And when he paused the video, he immediately called the police. What investigators found in the stable was so disturbing that the story made it to every news channel. Wanna know what was really going on? Follow me and comment horse for part two.

Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totaling two hundred and forty five dollars twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars. Ninety one cents. Kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable. It's family friendly. Disney's always a hot topic and we're, we're all trying to pinch pennies. So that video was probably my therapy as I was going through the day. The kids were smiling, sometimes fighting in between the lines. Uh, my wife was having a grand old time. Meanwhile, mine was just swipe the card over and over and over.

Now, in these recordings, you hear remarks about her looks and her personality. Listen carefully because few ever hear this, she said, painful secret recordings a patient says she made from the operating room. Ethel Easter says she hit a recorder in her hair extensions before going under the knife for a hernia operation. Easter says the hospital workers made disparaging comments about her body. I was appalled. I was distraught. I was violated thinking that I'm lying there naked after the surgery and they have me still uncovered talking over my body like this. And listen to this. Precious. Yes, this is precious over here saying hi to precious over there. It's racially profiling me. Yes. I was offended by it. Easter says she decided to secretly record her surgery after a tense meeting with the doctor. In a letter to Easter, the hospital, Harris Health Care, says it had.

So what's going on? Ivy is allergic to water. That's right. All water, hot or cold, causes Ivy to have a severe allergic reaction. So her parents, Brittany and Daniel Angerman, limit her outdoor play so she stays clean. But some things are impossible to control. She's allergic to her own tears. Ivy's baby sister, Grace, doesn't have the condition. I wanna play with my sister. I wanna be in the bathtub. I wanna splash, play, laugh. And no, she'll sit there on the sidelines, kind of doomed.

How did you stay out of the generational hate war? I think there's a better question to be asked here. Would you really want us to get involved? Because Gen X truly is the last of the F A F O. Generation. And before you ask us to F A, ask yourself, do you really wanna f o this generational hate war? We're not involved because we don't care. Do you really want us to care? Yeah. We didn't get participation trophies. So before we get on, understand there's gonna be a clear cut winner and loser. It will be a hands on activity. Gen X is the last of the feral and wild and free children. It's like Lord of the flies. We were all raised by each other. Think of it kinda like The Jungle Book. We're all just Mobley. And before either parties think that they could hang with Gen X and drink the Kool Aid, I need to remind you our Kool Aid was made with hose water. Our parents weren't out here gentle parenting, anything. They did not raise us to be their friend. Truthfully, they didn't really raise us at all. We came home when the street lights came on because home there was chores at home. There was work to be done at home and we understood that. We didn't wanna do that. For Gen X kids, home is not where the heart is. Home Is where they wanted you out by the time you were 18. You better have a job. I just don't think people understand Gen X truly doesn't have like a social group. Our social group was like The Breakfast Club. You just dealt with the people who lived on your street. Your friends were the people who lived in your area. That was your crew. You rode around on your little 10 speeds with them. Like little sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club. People who grew up as Gen X have more miles by the time they were 13 years old on their 10 speeds than you'll ever get off of some kind of spin class. Sidebar. I rode around in the old neighbourhood the other day. From where my house was to where the pool was, it is five and a half miles. We made that everyday? Twice a day. And the reason why Gen X is so quiet now is because we've seen the system fail multiple times. Right wing, left wing, it's the same bird. Oh, the government's failing its people. Yes, and if you are waiting for it to fix itself, then you're only failing yourself. We wanna be left alone. We don't wanna people with people unless there are people. Cause not every person is worth putting pants on for. We're all at the age now to where we are built for comfort, not speed. If I have to leave the house, there better be a Clear cut reason. We all have thick skin. Not everything offended us. We had the freaking Goonies. Not that our give a damn was all too terribly high to begin with, but somewhere between that time and now, it is officially broken. Ex has realised a long time ago that opinions are a lot like butts. Everybody has one. Doesn't mean I wanna hear it. We didn't go home and tell our parents about the adventures. We understood that snitches got stitches. We kept our mouth shut. So don't involve us in a situation that you don't want us to get involved in. Stayed out of it because we didn't care. If you give us a reason to care, you might have wished that we would have stayed out of it.",https://www.tiktok.com/@euodlta755262/video/7581078318825491767,2025-12-12 05:44:50.178743,2025-12-12,reused_from_yesterday

This past summer, Donna installed a tall privacy fence on her lot along Trotter's Walk in Newton County. Turned out to be too tall. Complaints came in. The county told her to cut it down to size. She did, but over the Thanksgiving weekend, she painted it. Dick Hopkins lives two doors down. The neon colors are making him see red, but it's only on one side of the fence. On Donna's side, it's a bluish gray to match the trim on her home. I don't know what her problem is, but she certainly doesn't have any respect for her the neighbors. Donna says over the last couple of years, she hasn't seen eye to eye with a neighbor on the other side of the fence. She believed a little more privacy was best for everybody, but she says the county incorrectly told her a six foot fence was fine.

When this film became wildly successful, talk of a sequel naturally arose, especially when Winston Groom wrote a sequel novel called Gump and company. However, at the time, Tom Hanks adamantly refused to work in any sequel, and making the sequel with another actor was not a consideration. After Hanks reconsidered his stance on sequels with Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, and Angels and demons, the original screenwriter, Eric Roth, attempted to adapt Gump and company in 2001. However, the 9 11 attacks changed the world to the extent that it made the film irrelevant. Despite several attempts to revive the project and the absence of a formal cancellation, the sequel has remained in development hell since and is unlikely to be made.

Zemeckis fought the studio hard to keep those scenes and Paramount executive Michelle Manning was even sent to the set to supervise filming and make sure the movie stayed within budget. Zemeckis eventually gave up part of his and Tom Hanks's salary to keep most of the scenes and eventually agreed to cut out forest running sequence. However, Zemekis then simply ignored the studio's wishes, even receiving support from Manning. The running scenes were shot in secrecy without the studio's knowledge, and Tom Hanks's younger brother, Jim Hanks, doubled for him in many of them. According to Jim, Tom had other doubles, but they couldn't do the run, referring to Forest's geeky stiff stride. That's a stupid Hank's thing. The studio eventually found out, but when they saw the raw footage, they relented.

In several interviews, Ermey himself has stated that he worked closely with Kubrick to help mold the script so that it was more believable, all while retaining certain dialogue crucial to Kubrick's vision. While filming the opening scene where he disciplines private cowboy, he yells at cowboy by crudely describing him as the type of guy who would a person in the and not even have the goddamned common courtesy to give him a reach around. Stanley Kubrick immediately yelled CUT! And went over to ermy and asked what the hell is a reach around? Ermy politely explained what it meant. Kubrick laughed and reshot the scene, telling ermy to keep the line. Two Vincent D'onofrio tore ligaments in his knee on the obstacle course due to the extra weight he put on.

This past summer, Donna installed a tall privacy fence on her lot along Trotter's Walk in Newton County. Turned out to be too tall. Complaints came in. The county told her to cut it down to size. She did, but over the Thanksgiving weekend, she painted it. Dick Hopkins lives two doors down. The neon colors are making him see red, but it's only on one side of the fence. On Donna's side, it's a bluish gray to match the trim on her home. I don't know what her problem is, but she certainly doesn't have any respect for her the neighbors. Donna says over the last couple of years, she hasn't seen eye to eye with a neighbor on the other side of the fence. She believed a little more privacy was best for everybody, but she says the county incorrectly told her a six foot fence was fine. As for the paint job, the county does not regulate the color of a residence fence. That paint is a 20 year warranty paint, so within 15 years, if it needs to be repainted, it'll be painted the same color.

Get that through your fucking skull! Just fucking die already! Enough! My name is Charlie. I'm an online teacher. But I never turn on my camera. I can't let anyone see me. Eight years ago, I walked out on my wife. I chased after what I thought was true love. But the person I loved died. After that, I lost everything. Hope, purpose, myself. That's how I became this. One day after class, I had a heart attack. Luckily, my caretaker, Liz, showed up in time. She told me I had congestive heart failure, and I refused to go to the hospital. Go to the hospital? You have congestive heart failure. If you don't go to the hospital, you'll be dead by the weekend. You will die. Then my daughter Ellie found out where I live. She came to my house just to mock me. I was just thinking maybe we could spend some time together. I'm not spending time with you. You're disgusting. We thought about it. Then she mentioned she was about to graduate, but her thesis kept failing. She needs my help. So she took my walker away, forcing me to stand on my own. Stand up and walk over to me. What? Come over here. Walk toward me. No, no, not this thing. Just stand up and walk over here. Really? I can't. Really. Shut up. Come over here. My 600 pound body trembled as I struggled to rise after that My daughter Ellie started coming over every day. At first, I thought maybe, just maybe, she was starting to think of this place as home again. So I told her I wanted to rebuild our family. You can just be angry at me, okay? You know what? You can't throw me away like I'm a piece of garbage and then suddenly just want to be my dad eight years later. Her face changed immediately. Out of guilt, I didn't argue. I just wanted to make things right. I humbled myself in front of her. Eventually, the tension eased. You're an amazing person, Ellie. I hope you know what an amazing person you are. I couldn't ask for a more incredible daughter. She even made me a sandwich. What I didn't know was that she'd slip sleeping pills into it. I passed out before I could even finish eating. Later, Liz came back, and Ellie's mother was with her. When they found me unconscious, her mom knew right away who was responsible. When I finally woke up, Ellie's mother had found a huge sum of money in Ellie's account. Entire life savings. I thought maybe giving Ellie that money would fix our relationship. But her mother just

The next second, her coworker lost a huge chunk of hair. The woman got more excited. As she kept pulling. She ripped the doll completely bald. The next second, her coworker's head went completely bald, too. The woman remembered how her coworker had bullied her. Furious, she grabbed a pair of tweezers. She ripped off the doll's toenails. The next second, her coworker screamed out loud. Then she twisted off the doll's limbs. Just like that, her coworker lost her life. The woman's name was Mina. One day, her best friend gave her a mysterious box. Mina opened the first compartment. Inside was a piece of candy. The packaging showed the game's rules. If you eat the first one, you must eat one candy every day. You keep going until you open the last compartment. If you quit halfway through, you die. Mina thought it was just a silly joke for kids. She popped the first candy right into her mouth. What she didn't know was she had just officially awakened the demon. The next day, Mina met a new boyfriend. After Mina fell asleep, the man slipped his hand into her pants. Nina immediately pushed him away. The scumbag dragged her out of the car, and he dumped her on the roadside. Furious, Mina cursed him to die. The very next second, the box at home seemed to hear her command. It automatically opened a compartment. Inside appeared a tiny car. Identical to the man's, even the license plate matched. A curious dog nearby bit down on it. At that moment, the man noticed cracks on his windshield. As the dog kept chewing. The scumbag ended up dead inside his car. The next day, Mina Learned about the man's death from her friend's call. It hit Mina that the box had supernatural powers. That night, she opened another compartment. Inside was a heart shaped candy. To test her theory, the next day, she dropped the candy into her crush's cup. After the man drank it, the next second, he walked over to her, passionately confessed his love to Mina. Just like that, they became a couple. After experiencing the box's magical power, Mina opened another compartment. This time, it contained a time candy. She swallowed it out of curiosity. Next second, she suddenly found four candy wrappers in her hand. And she realized four days had already passed. The next day, she went to work. She got fired by her boss for missing work. Heartbroken, Mina had just fallen asleep. At midnight, the box opened on its own. The demon summoned the little dog over. Inside was a bone shaped piece of candy. Dog swallowed it on the spot. Just then, the door swung open by itself. The dog ran outside. The next morning, she opened the door and found the dog standing there, blood all over. As Mina washed the blood off the dog, she found a pendant in its Mouth. It belonged to her boss. She immediately called her boss, but the phone was off. Mina remembered the broken toy car pieces in the trash. She pieced together all the candy wrappers in the incidents. Once again she was certain the box was behind. Every day she started feeling afraid of the box. Suddenly the box reminded her she hadn't

Walk away, Kyle, this doesn't concern you. There's no way I can do that. They knocked him out cold, then dragged the sack from the cement pit. Me hands fumbled at the chain, ripping it open. The child inside was still breathing alive. Relief hit me like a wave. But when I turned back for the killer, he was gone. The next day, I tracked him down. Arthur had no idea I'd been shadowing him from behind. I jabbed a syringe of veterinary tranquilizer into his neck, shoved him into the back of my van and drove toward the kill table I had already prepared. I checked the duffle he carried inside, stacks of cash. He was planning to disappear. I was about to leave when I saw a traffic cop circling my car earlier, chasing him. I clipped a side mirror. The owner called it in. I tried to pay him off, but he shoved a phone in my face, recording me. I snapped, smashed his phone. We're taking you in. So much for the call, mercy. And ended up hauled into the station. By the time I got out and rushed back to the lot, the van was open. Arthur was gone. That night, I was called to a murder scene. The victim had been bludgeoned with a hammer. The name in the report, Kyle Butler, the same alias I'd used in front of Arthur. The chill ran down. My spine, little girls with me. If Arthur found my home, my wife and kids would be next. I had to move first. I tracked down another man named Kyle Butler, knocked him out and waited in his house because Arthur would come, and he did. But Arthur was cautious, too cautious. He lingered at the door, sensing a trap, refusing to step inside. The moment I heard the knob turn, I lunged, only to realize he'd slipped away into the night.

Yeah, so you're referring to the Gabriella Miller Kids Research Act 2.0, which was passed by the house in 2023, but it's left completely blank by the Senate, which means it has not been passed. And the reason it's even 2.0 is because it was the second Bill. The first one was passed in 2014 by Republicans. I'm also gonna add that 300 Republicans voted yes last November and 100 Democrats voted against the Bill. I'm sure that news headline you read from also failed to mention that the National Institute of health has all their study sections paused right now. The study needs to show that it has the ability to reproduce and get those same results, that it's not just a coincidence that that happened to work. I promise Trump is not being heartless and is just cutting off childhood cancer research. He wants to reform the NIH and make it more efficient.

No matter how he swats it away, the fly clings relentlessly. With only 30 seconds left on the bomb's timer, the frustrated man abruptly drifts to a stop. For the next 15 seconds, he remains entangled with the fly. When the fly lands on the car, he adopts a confident, determined expression. He raised his shoe and smacked down hard. Boom! Sparks shot skyward. The assassin in the distance assumed the man was dead. But the next second, the man stood unscathed, confidently convinced of his own prowess. Yet the assassin refused to give up. The next morning, the assassin went straight for the kill, firing multiple shots at the man. He remained oblivious to the danger. Suddenly, a bullet struck the gas tank. Yet the man, engrossed in an argument with his wife, didn't notice anything amiss.

The school bully snatched it and threw it onto the frozen lake. I swallowed my pride and bent down to pick it up. The ice cracked beneath my feet. The water swallowed me whole. I fought with everything I had. The ice sealed off every way out. In that moment of pure terror, I unlocked my power. I teleported to the school library. Everyone stared at me in shock. I scrambled to my feet, shaking, kept my head down and ran home. My drunk father saw me soaking wet, not a single word of concern. He walked toward me angrily. The the moment he opened the door, I teleported to the library again. That's when it hit me. I have awakened superpowers. I started practicing in secret. At first, I couldn't control the distance, but soon enough, anywhere I could see, I can accurately teleport over there. Then one day, I was flipping through a magazine, staring at the Empire State Building. A memory surfaced of my mom taking me there as a kid. The next second I stood on the top of the Empire State Building, I realized that no matter where my heart longs to go, I could get there in an instant. At that moment, I felt that hope had arrived in my life. I have decided to leave this family. I arrived in New York, rented a cheap room, and reality hit. My savings were almost gone, too. Young to get a job, no options left. So I thought of the fastest way to make money. Pretended I needed the restroom. The guard walked me right past the vault. And those few seconds before the door closed, I burned every detail into my mind. That night. I closed my eyes the next second, I instantly teleported into the vault. I grabbed a few stacks of cash. Then I realized a problem. I need a bigger bag. So I went back and looked around, grabbed a bed sheet to use as a bag time and time again until my tiny room was covered in cash. I laid down on that sea of money. Never felt so alive. My real life was just beginning. Years later, with my power on my side, I was young and living in the most luxurious penthouse in Manhattan. Rare cars and watches filled the place. I even had a room stacked with cash from every country. I am becoming more and more skilled with my superpowers. I walked into the lobby holding an umbrella. The the doorman told me it wasn't going to rain. I just smiled. The next second, I was standing on top of Big Ben in London, umbrella in hand, taking in the view. I walked into a corner bar. I had a little encounter with a beautiful woman. Then I was gone. Back at the penthouse, I grabbed a random photo off the wall. One second I was surfing in the Pacific. The next, I was sitting on the Sphinx in Egypt, soaking up the sun with a cup of tea. I thought life would stay this perfect forever, until I came home that night and noticed right away someone had touched my stuff.

At this funeral, my wife and I stood among the crowd, our faces devoid of sorrow. To me, my mother's death felt almost like a release. And finding her naked, face down in a bathtub, I was 14 years old. Dad, he's working on offshore rigs in Louisiana. From childhood Onward, my relationship with my family remained distant. My father only knew how to bury himself in work. My mother drank every day. When I was 14, I dragged her out of the bathtub, but all I got in return was a beating and she kicked my nose through the back of my head. Then she got up and walked into the kitchen and made herself another fucking drink. I went, put everything I owned into a backpack, cause a backpack's all it took. Never been back in this town since. After that day, I never returned to the small town. Later, through my own effort, I became president of an oil company. Had I not heard of her death, I wouldn't have returned here today. The wounds left by my family of origin still haunt me to this day. Now that I'm a father myself, I understand more clearly. Not all parents of their children, at least mine, never loved me. I can tell you why. What killed her soul? And it don't really matter now, I guess. Only in his old age did my father begin to understand Regret, but no amount of memories could ever buy back a shred of closeness from him. After the funeral ended, I turned and walked away with my family. My father stood by the car. The sorrow in his heart was impossible to hide.

Okay, sorry, one second. What are you doing in here? Hide me. After David catches up with her, he asks Lisa if she has seen a little girl. Lisa can only lie and says she hasn't seen any girl. But her lie makes David suspicious. After Lisa leaves, David follows her closely. When they get to the restaurant, Lisa runs into the bathroom. Get out of here. I'm waiting for you. Lisa tells the girl to stay in the bathroom stall. Then she stuffs a lot of toilet paper into her suitcase. When she walks out of the bathroom and into the restaurant, David is sitting right across from her. He pulls out a gun and threatens her. Just then, the waiter arrives and hands her the menu. Maybe salads? No way. Do you remember me? Oh, oh, this is Sarah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. We started in the university together. Yes. The waiter asks Lisa to leave her contact information. The waiter understands Lisa's plan to buy some time. Lisa pushes the suitcase in front of David and tells him to search it. David finds there's no little girl inside. He quickly runs to the bathroom to look for her, but Lisa locks the door tight. Finally, the police arrive and arrest the man. The little girl's mother also shows up at the scene.

Every morning, four handmaidens attended to him as he rose from sleep. Fresh flower petals carpeted his every step and beautiful women bathed him in luxurious pools. He was the man of every woman's dreams and a hero to countless men, all because he was an ancient deity of Egypt dating back thousands of years. Golden blood poured through his veins and he could transform into any fearsome beast at will. These gods ruled over the weak mortals of earth with their divine powers and sacred weapons. Today was supposed to be the day he would become their new leader. But just as the king was about to place the crown upon his head, his uncle, the god of the desert, stormed in with an army of soldiers clad in crimson armor and launched a coup right before the eyes of the entire nation. Seth murdered his own brother with his bare hands. He then issued a chilling ultimatum to every god and citizen present, bow to his rule or be cast into slavery. Horus, the sky god, watched his father die before his very eyes. There was no way he would let this stand. He seized his weapon and charged at his uncle, unaware that this was exactly what set had planned all along. Horus, who had spent his days in idle comfort, was no match for the cunning and ruthless desert god. Seth used his shield to reflect blinding light into Horus. Eyes throwing off his aim. Despite his extraordinary power, Horus couldn't overcome his battle hardened uncle. Facing certain defeat, Horus transformed into his true divine form to fight back. Seth followed suit, assuming his own godly shape. Their epic battle sent the crowd into a panic. They clashed from the heavens down to the earth, toppling massive buildings in their wake. At a critical moment, soldiers once again blinded Horus's vision. Seth seized the opportunity and unleashed a relentless assault, eventually forcing Horus back into his human form. But set wasn't finished. To crush any hope of revenge, he gouged out his nephew's eyes with his own hands. Those radiant orbs were the source of Horus's power. Without them, he would be reduced to nothing more than an ordinary man. Just as Seth prepared to execute Horus on the spot, the goddess of love, Horus's fiance, fell to her knees and begged for mercy. She offered her eternal freedom in exchange for sparing his life. And so Horus was banished to a remote desert, condemned to guard the old king's tomb. Meanwhile, Seth claimed the throne he had so desperately coveted. But his vision for the kingdom was nothing like his predecessors. On his very first day as king, set launched massive construction projects funded by crushing taxes. He ordered the slaughter of anyone loyal to the former regime and enslaved most of the population, forcing them to work day and night building a tower to glorify his achievements. Worse Still, when mortals died, they were required to surrender all their worldly possessions to him. Those who had nothing couldn't even earn the chance to be reborn. Under this brutal tyranny lived a thief named Beck, who refused to accept his fate. His girlfriend told him that today was the king's victory parade, which meant set would be hauling all his plunder treasures into the royal vault. An audacious plan began to form in Beck's mind, one that seemed almost impossible. That night, as the king's golden transport rolled through the streets, Beck slipped into one of the cargo containers in the back. He was dumped into the treasury along with hundreds of tons of gold. But he wasn't there for riches. His target was the eye of Horus, gleaming at the center of the vault. Beck was a seasoned thief. He quickly realized this heist was far more dangerous than he'd imagined. When he casually kicked a gold bar forward, he discovered the floor was crawling with thousands of deadly scorpions. Still, this wouldn't stop him. With his girlfriend's help, he had already obtained the blueprints to the vault's elaborate trap system. He lit his torch, knowing that wherever a shadow fell, it would trigger the mechanisms holding the flame high above his head. To minimize his shadow, Beck advanced one careful step at a time. He made it through the first obstacle, only to find the second one was completely different from what the blueprints showed, clearly designed To deceive would be thieves. Before he could react, statue sprang to life and swung at him with deadly force. Thanks to his quick reflexes and agile body, he weaved through the gaps between the mechanisms and narrowly escaped. The eye of power lay just ahead, but the blueprints showed no solution for the third trap. With no other choice, Beck bet his life on one final gamble. The moment he stepped onto the trigger, the floor began to collapse beneath him. One wrong move and he would plummet into a bottomless abyss. Summoning every ounce of strength, he leaped forward just as the platform fell away and grabbed the eye of Horus. Facing the swarm of scorpions on his way out, Beck held the divine eye before him like a shield. The holy light radiating from it drove back the vile creatures. But set had been more cunning than Beck anticipated. He had hidden the two eyes of Horus in separate locations. When Beck returned to meet his girlfriend outside the palace, he found that his plan had been discovered. In desperation, he raised the eye of power and its brilliant light sent the surrounding soldiers stumbling to the ground. Beck grabbed his girlfriend and they fled by chariot. He thought their mission to save the fallen god was finally on track. Then in an instant, an official's arrow pierced his girlfriend's heart. Beck held the love of his life as she died in his arms, consumed by grief. He placed all his hope in Horus. Using the eye of power as a bargaining chip, he begged the god to bring his girlfriend back to life. But what Beck didn't know was that only a king had the authority to retrieve a soul from the underworld. And with only one eye, Horus possessed just half his former power. The only way to resurrect her was to help Horus kill set and reclaim the throne. In his current state, Horus was no match for set. The only thing he could do was use his divine status to summon Anubis, the guide of the dead, and ask him to lead his girlfriend's soul toward reincarnation.

The next second, the dazzling Light hits. They feel that their body is changing. The strength is skyrocketing. The whole body is wrapped in a solid armor. They are no longer ordinary people. They have become a super team.

Por eso me pusieron en un avión lleno de otros reclusos. A diferencia de los demás, mi rostro estaba completamente cubierto y llevaba pesadas cadenas. Todos los reclusos buscaban una manera de escapar y yo simplemente giré la cabeza. Un diente envuelto en alambre metálico cayó de mi boca. Usé ese alambre para forzar las esposas, preparándome para la explosión que estaba a punto de ocurrir. De repente, el motor del avión se incendió. El piloto se preparaba para un aterrizaje de emergencia. Decidí aprovechar el momento para liberarme. Los guardias se lanzaron para detenerme, pero no eran rivales para mí. Pronto los arrojé al suelo. A 600m sobre el suelo, hicimos un aterrizaje forzoso en un valle de Alaska. Los reclusos se amotinaron. Los guardias quedaron rodeados y en medio del caos, un hombre barbudo salió adelante. Poco después, el sheriff del pueblo recibió un informe de humo espeso. Se dirigió a investigar qué había pasado. El sheriff Frank se subió a un helicóptero y voló hacia el humo hasta el lugar donde cayó el avión. Frank inspeccionó el lugar del choque y vio a un oficial superviviente. Intentaron subir al oficial al helicóptero, pero los reclusos ya se habían lanzado. Tres policías no pudieron detenerlos. Tras unos disparos, los reclusos retrocedieron por un tiempo. Dos personas ayudaron a alejar al oficial herido, pero los reclusos volvieron a atacar, dejando a Frank luchando. Solo un recluso derribó a Frank al suelo y En ese mismo momento, otro oficial superviviente apareció a tiempo. Frank ayudó al alguacil a ponerse en pie y corrió hacia el helicóptero para evacuar. Cuando el helicóptero aterrizó, llegaron los policías estatales. Los heridos fueron cargados en los vehículos. Frank reunió a todos para planear las siguientes acciones. Él explicó que aproximadamente a dos millas de aquí, un avión se había estrellado, llevando a un gran número de criminales peligrosos. Alguien preguntó por qué afuera solo había reclusos. Frank respondió, son reclusos federales, así que para estas personas esta puede ser su única oportunidad de escape. Frank ordenó a su equipo avisar al hospital y activar los protocolos de emergencia. La esposa de Frank, que trabaja en el hospital, al recibir la noticia se preocupó mucho y me llamó de inmediato. Me recordó que antes de que llegaran los refuerzos me mantuviera a salvo, pero nosotros somos los refuerzos

Carl vio la oportunidad de beneficio, así que me llevó directamente al ring subterráneo y antes de subir al combate me arrancó el collar con sus propias manos. De regreso, carl contaba la gran suma de dinero que yo le había hecho ganar, mientras yo solo miraba distraído por la ventana. Carl me preguntó qué recompensa quería. Le dije que quería un piano.

The doctor told my father about my condition. I was born with albinism. My father followed the doctor into the room, took one look at me. And refused to accept me as his son. I could feel his emotions, and my crying grew louder. The doctor noticed the unusual brain activity readings. Far beyond normal human levels. In the end, my father abandoned me. Later, my grandfather took me in. For 18 years, he raised me in the basement. Until last night. My grandfather passed away from illness. Because I had no contact with anyone. He had asked the town psychologist, Jesse, to come. They knew I lived in the basement. But after so many years in isolation, they worried I might have become a monster. They carefully made their way down and found me curled in a corner. When I stepped out of the darkness, their eyes filled with shock. I have no hair and my eyes are pale pink. Jesse asked me if I understood what death was. I looked up, my eyes already filled with tears, and told her, Grandpa said everyone dies someday. Even him. Jesse noticed the books on the shelf. She picked one up and asked if I had read it. I told her to choose any page. Pick a page 216. And then I recited every word perfectly. You know the whole book? No more. Not just that book. I could recite every book in that room. She saw that my mind was far from ordinary. With Grandpa gone, there was no one to care for me. So they brought me out. It was the first time in 18 years I had left the basement. Yes. He took me to the shelter. She runs a place for children like me who have lost everyone.

But to the astronaut's horror, the helmet did not have time to generate. The hibernation capsule he was in was ejected out until Nick found that the original main spacecraft hit the planet, exploded, which LED to the launch of the spacecraft self Protection system. Nick turned his head and saw that many of the hibernating pods that had been ejected had been destroyed and only a few of the lucky ones like him flew to the unknown planet in front. But because the hibernating pods fell too fast and did not give Nick a helmet, Nick was quickly overwhelmed by the strong air pressure top. But when he was about to suffocate, the intelligent system of the hibernating pods began to work. With the successful installation of the mask, Nick was able to pick up a life. But before he had time to be happy. The high temperature generated by the rapid fall of the dormancy module to the surface has exceeded the original design of the maximum temperature. Looking at the dormancy module constantly exploded due to high temperature. Egg put down the heart and hung up. But at this time, the dormancy module entered the atmosphere of the planet. Due to the extreme cold of the planet, the high temperature of the capsule surface soon returned to normal. But unfortunately the cold also caused the capsule's Fuel system to fail and lose power and it crashed straight into the surface of the planet. But the capsule shell was strong enough and Nick was not hurt. When he woke up, he immediately opened the communication to contact the other survivors, but there was no response. Nick wanted to get up and look around, accidentally let the dormancy capsule fall into the crater next to it. Nick also fell back into the dormancy capsule.

But in spite of this, the suit is only 40% oxygen. Nick completely fell into despair.

This caused all the petrol to overflow from the tank. On the other hand, Tom, who was sitting inside the car, did not know anything about this. He picked up a lighter, but it turned out to be faulty, so he threw the lighter out in anger. As soon as the lighter fell on the petrol, the fire erupted and the person who fired the shot started burning in the fire him self. On the other hand, Tom had just reached a gas station, but the murderer followed him and came there. When Tom's attention was elsewhere, the murderer came from behind to make him unconscious. But due to the force of the wind, the intoxicating handkerchief went into his mouth and he himself became unconscious. As soon as the murderer became unconscious, Tom left from there. After some time, when the murderer regained consciousness, he started getting up, but then a tire burst due to the knife in his hand. Now, the army men were also surprised. Is this a man or a ghost? Neither does he die with a bullet, nor is he caught. But Tom had evidence of the scam against the general, so he had to be killed in such a way that everyone would think that it was just an accident. A murderer stuck a time bomb on his car. Just then a fly came and Started troubling Tom. The fly was coming again and again and was teasing him and distracting Tom. Tom got fed up and stopped the car. Now, only 10 seconds were left for the blast. Finally, the fly went and sat at one place. As soon as Tom hit it with his shoe to kill it, there was a loud explosion. A soldier standing far away said, let alone humans, even ghosts will not survive in this blast. But nothing happened to the murderer. He did not even get a scratch. He comfortably caught a taxi and reached his home. He told his neighbor, your car was blown up in a blast. But the army arrested him by filing a false case against him. He was tied to a chair and was told, now your game is over. On hearing this, Tom got very angry. He broke the ropes with all his might and jumped out of the window. Just then, a soldier got stuck in the flag rope and climbed up and started beating the general standing near the window. Another soldier aimed his gun at Tom, but Tom let go of the flag rope, due to which the soldier hanging above fell on the rest of the people. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Tom ran away from there and climbed the wall and got out in front of everyone outside. His family was waiting for him in the car. He quickly turns the car key, but his wife says But you are sitting in the passenger seat. Both of them quickly change their seats, and this time the car starts. When everyone reached home at night, they did not know that death was waiting for them. The father and the family started sneaking in, but two army men saw them. A soldier attacked with an arrow, but the arrow got stuck in a pillar. When the boy tried to take out the arrow, the entire pillar broke and fell on the soldiers, due to which they got buried straight into the ground.

John found a drunk woman lying on a park bench. Afraid she'd freeze to death, he carried her back to his place. When Lucy woke up, she was shocked to find her clothes had been changed. She thought John had done something to her, but John said she'd thrown up all over herself the night before. He had no choice but to help her change. Then John told Lucy her clothes were in the washing machine and left the house. After that, he went to a restaurant to drink with his friend Anna. Learning Anna's husband treated her badly, John asked confusedly why she didn't get a divorce, but Anna clearly didn't want to answer that question. But after just a few drinks, Anna got drunk and finally spilled the reason she'd always had a crush on John. John was stunned when he heard that. Anna went on to say she'd like John since she was 20, but back then John was in a relationship. However, John said Anna always said that when she was drunk. Anna thought John was totally clueless about romance, but John told her he'd never seen her as a woman. Anna looked confused, pointing out her boobs were clearly big, then unbuttoned her shirt and grabbed John's arm. John immediately pulled away, which hurt Anna's pride. She took another big sip.

The last group of customers was leaving, and the staff reminded her that the building was about to shut down, but she insisted on going inside. With no other choice, the staff turned away to ask their supervisor. Suddenly a man walked over, staring straight at her, and used a key to open the locked door. Martha smiled and thanked him for making an exception, but she failed to notice the stiffness of his expression. Inside the mall, various kinds of mannequins were displayed everywhere. Martha entered the elevator, and shortly after another man was looking up at her. She didn't think much of it. Perhaps he was waiting for someone. Soon Martha arrived at the store entrance. The man across the hall reminded her that the place was closed, but when she turned her head, the lights inside suddenly came on, revealing a shop full of cute plush toys. She walked around for a while when the shop assistant suddenly appeared behind her, startling her. She wanted to find a corn doll, which was very popular at that moment. The clerk glanced at the man across the way, and only after confirming that he had left did Martha feel puzzled. What was going on? The clerk said that their shop offered special purchasing privileges to special customers, then looked outside again as if waiting for something, and went to the back to get the item. Martha was Confused, why did she keep looking that way? Just as she was looking around at the toys, she was suddenly bitten by a toy spider. Hey, Marsha, can you hit the light button? Please forgive him. I'm always reminding him not to disturb strangers. Do I know you? The mother shook her head. But why did the boy know her name? The mother firmly insisted that she must have heard it wrong. But Martha was sure the child had called her by her name. The mother thought the boy was just speaking unclearly and that he meant to say ma'am. After explaining, the mother tried to pull her son away, but the boy asked Martha to take him with her. Martha was full of confusion. Before she could figure anything out, the mother hurriedly dragged the boy away. At that moment, the clerk brought the doll out. Martha wanted to know who those two were and why they had suddenly disappeared. The clerk did not answer that question and instead asked whether she would pay with cash or card. Martha nodded and chose cash, then held the doll and started talking to herself. The landlord's child would be very happy. She had moved in a month ago. Martha had no money to pay the first few months of rent, and she didn't even have a job yet. The landlord still gave her a place to stay and even provided a job lead. After hearing this, the clerk laughed eerily and Said that in that case, Martha must have really been enjoying herself last month. She thought they meant her new job and new friends, which did make her feel happy once again. The clerk turned to look outside. The man in black walked over with his hands in his pockets. Martha felt frightened. The clerk asked her if she knew what day it was tonight. Martha replied that it was Saturday and her good friend Jennifer's birthday. Yet today was clearly Wednesday. Why do you suppose it was so important that you come to the doll tonight? She didn't know what had gotten into her. She had been sitting quietly at home reading when suddenly she felt the urge to go to the mall. She simply had to buy the corn doll tonight. As for the reason, she couldn't explain it. The clerk said she knew because Martha's life hadn't always been like this. Martha didn't understand what that meant. The clerk claimed to know about her life over the past month. Where did she come from? Was she from New York? After thinking for a moment, Martha said she had forgotten. Then the clerk began a relentless interrogation. Martha had no ID, no driver's license, and no idea where she had gone to school or even who her parents were. She only remembered the apartment she lived in and her workplace. Yet all of that had only happened within the past month. Martha finally couldn't stand it anymore. What was All this supposed to mean. The clerk angrily stepped forward and demanded to know where she had been before last month. Forced back again and again, Martha suddenly ran out of the toy store. As she rushed to press the elevator button, the clerk followed calmly behind her. But when she entered the elevator and turned around, she discovered that the man was already inside, waiting for her. From his pocket protruded a strange, conjoined hand. Martha shrank back into the corner in terror. What kind of monster was this? Forgetting the corn doll, she rushed out of the elevator. She tried to pry open the inner door with all her strength, while the man slowly followed behind her. She tried to escape the mall along the way she had come in, only to find that the exit was sealed by another security gate. At that moment she saw the very man who had opened the door for her in the beginning. She was about to beg him for help when he was suddenly pushed to the ground. It was clearly a mannequin. At the same time, voices began echoing all around her. Marsha! Marsha! Marsha! Marsha! Marsha! Martha ran back and discovered that the mannequins all knew her, repeatedly calling out her name. As she frantically searched for an escape, a mannequin suddenly grabbed her. The man walked over and reminded her to think carefully and try to remember with her mind. Martha still had time to think after Finally breaking free, she ran into another room and locked herself inside. Soon, crashing noises came from outside the door. She stumbled backward in panic and accidentally knocked into a plastic basket. Inside were nothing but mannequin heads, two of which could actually speak. Constantly calling her name, Martha hurried down the corridor to escape. It was filled with all kinds of broken mannequins. When she once again reached the inner door, she found it couldn't be opened at all. It turned out the clerk had tampered with it from the outside. Martha begged to be allowed to go home. The clerk told her she was already home and didn't need to stay so tense. The man approached again from behind. Martha couldn't understand what was happening. She just wanted to go home. The man reminded her that this was home because they were all mannequins. Martha still refused to believe it. She grabbed an iron pan, smashed the glass, and broke out of the two of them. She tried to cry out for help elsewhere in the mall, but when she had been in the store, everyone around her had already left. Just then, her legs began to stiffen, and her right foot had already turned into a mannequin's leg. Faced with the steadily advancing clerk, Martha could only limp as she tried to run away. In front of her was an iron gate that could not be opened. Too much time had passed, and now her right hand, Also began to change. The man comforted her, telling her not to be afraid, that this was something they all had to go through. When both of her legs completely stiffened, she lay on the ground in pain, trying to crawl. The two of them welcomed Martha home, telling her she no longer needed to fight against her body. You had your turn to go out and experience the real world for a month. Now it's someone else's turn. It's only fair. He's right. At that moment, her left hand fully transformed as well. Finally, Martha remembered that she had originally been a mannequin, but she had no desire at all to turn back. Unfortunately, her body had no power to resist the change. By the next morning, the mall opened for business as usual, and all the mannequins had returned to their original appearances. They could never escape the chains of their fate. Even the time they had spent moving freely had merely been a brief vacation. Through this story, when you begin to doubt whether your life is real, you have already stepped into the Twilight Zone.

Then a lollipop was shoved into her mouth. As the speed picked up, she woke up in confusion and realized a ghost was messing with her. Instead of being scared, she was thrilled. She powered up instantly and actually climbed from the bed straight onto the ceiling. After pinning the ghost down, she even asked for another round. The ghost was so terrified it fled the room immediately. Meanwhile, Matt felt someone under his bed and bent down to take a look. But the moment he lowered his head, a clown ghost dragged him underneath. The clown had no idea he picked the wrong guy to mess with. Matt fought back right away, ready to go toe to toe with the clown. The clown ghost panicked and crawled out from under the bed, but Matt yanked him right back in. Across the hall. Things were getting weird in Jack's room, too. The plant he kept was secretly growing bigger and bigger. By the time he noticed, it was too late, the giant tree wrapped him up like a cigar. When the others rushed in after hearing the noise, Jack was already lit and smoking.

But after a woman answered a phone call, the place instantly turned into a scene of carnage. Excuse me. Hello? No, I'm sorry. There's no words. Hearing those words, Charlie's face changed instantly. He realized danger was about to strike. It's the call we've been waiting for. When Charlie suddenly pointed his gun at his girlfriend again, James was confused and demanded to know why. Charlie explained that rose was the code name for a terrorist operation. Both women had just received their orders. But no matter how much Charlie explained, James refused to believe his girlfriend was part of a terrorist group. So Charlie decided to prove it with evidence. Here. How much you want to bet she's got another dozen buried around here? Caroline explained that the apartment was rented by James, and James himself had investigated them before. Seeing James still couldn't recognize the truth, Charlie had one last way to prove Caroline was involved. Nothing. Your ring, man. That's how they've been tracking us. Come on, give it over. I'll prove it to you. Come on, I'll give you my gun. Give me the fucking ring! As James was about to check the ring, Caroline panicked. She begged him not to believe Charlie. Charlie brought the ring close to the speaker, and the bug inside immediately interfered with the sound. James was devastated by the truth. Why Caroline? While the two were dodging bullets, Caroline quickly escaped. Through the window, Charlie rushed to chase after her, but her accomplices were already waiting outside. He could only jot down the license plate and watch them drive away. Oh, here's one more. There you go. 17 microphones, five cameras, two in your bedroom. While they were discussing what the group's next move might be, Caroline suddenly called James. The team decided to start monitoring the call. Hello? Please don't bother tracing. I will be off in a minute. Caroline knew they would be listening, so after sincerely apologizing to James, she quickly hung up. Maybe they had truly loved each other once, but now they were just pawns of their own agencies. At that moment, their superior called, demanding to know why James hadn't gone to escort the visiting delegation from a neighboring country. They immediately realized Caroline's real target was the delegation. Something's wrong here. Doesn't make sense. If they wanted to hit the delegation, then why did they wire this apartment? Why they use me? James began frantically searching the house for clues. When he found a piece of fabric and a blueprint in the closet, he finally understood Caroline's plan. Meanwhile, Charlie had caught up with the car that rescued her and was about to fire a rocket at it when James suddenly called. I'm a little dizzy, Reese. I'm about to smoke your girlfriend's car. She is not inside that car. What? James urgently told him Caroline wasn't in that car. The real Caroline must Be at the delegation's conference. She was planning to assassinate the foreign dignitaries there to trigger a war. So Charlie decided to move in and check. Oh, fuck, you're right. She's out there. Shit. I'm on my way to the summit. Okay. The terrorists in the car were preparing to blow up, kill the neighboring country's delegation on the road. But with too many cars on the road, Charlie couldn't get a clear shot. They drove up onto an overpass to aim from above. The terrorists armed the bomb, and the bodyguards in the convoy finally noticed something was wrong. Get down now! Get down!

It didn't seem to care about the soldiers at all. With just a gentle flap of its wings, everyone was knocked off their feet. Then it grabbed an elderly man and flew him into the sky. The soldiers immediately launched an attack, but the monster spun around and shot out green lightning. The 100, 0, 0, 0 volt surge easily took down all the arrows, and then the monster vanished. When the old man woke up, he found himself floating in the air. He asked the monster who it was. The creature didn't answer. It simply pointed to the clothes on its body.

Now the old man finds himself in trouble, and this monster has come to repay his kindness.

Ich behaupte, die feuchtigkeitscreme würde seine schmerzen lindern, doch er wein ich, dass ich eigentlich chilipaste benutze, sobald ich die die chili paste auf seinen irken schmierepie brennt ist so stark, dass er es kaum aushält.

Er scammt ihn einfach mit seinem handy und ist sofort geschockt, denn das video zeigt nur meine hilferufe. Der arzt wird sofort misstrauisch gegen bei John und er will unbedingt wissen, was hier wirklich los ist. Ich sollte zu ihnen nach hause kommen. Was? Wieso? MH? Ich denke, das ist eine allergie und während wir noch auf die ergebnisse warten, inspiziere ich wohl besser ihr haus um zu sehen, was entfernt werden muss.

That way, he could use the excuse of helping her to get close. The girl noticed something strange. It was a sunny day, yet the man was carrying an umbrella. But before she could react, the man was already walking slowly toward her. The next moment, the girl lost consciousness. When she woke up, she found herself trapped. The girl tried to talk to the man to distract him while secretly working to untie her hands. Once her hands were free, she launched a desperate counter attack. During the struggle, the car lost control and crashed into a roadside tree. The girl took the chance to run into the forest, but the man wasn't about to let her escape that easily. He followed closely behind her. Even though his leg was injured, he didn't seem worried at all because while the girl was unconscious, he had injected her with a sedative. It wouldn't be long before her body stopped responding to her commands. The girl began to feel her hands go numb, and soon her legs started giving out, too. Still, she refused to give up. To escape from the man's pursuit, she crawled into a hollow tree to hide. Unfortunately, she had entered an ant nest. Countless ants swarmed over her, crawling densely across her face and neck. She forced herself to endure it because the man was still nearby. Once the man. Finally left, she couldn't help but make a small noise, which alerted him again. Realising the danger, the numb legged girl dragged herself toward the river. Even though jumping into the river was risky, she would rather face that than be caught by him. The man could only watch in fury as the girl floated away and disappeared from sight. The girl drifted along the river, the current ahead growing faster and rougher, but the drug was taking full effect. She couldn't control her body anymore. Fortunately, she managed to grab onto a fallen tree branch. Summoning the last of her strength, she pulled herself onto the shore. She lay there weak and gasping for breath. Before long, she collapsed completely. Though still conscious, her body no longer obeyed her. Luckily, she was found by an old man named John, who was cutting grass nearby. No matter how he called out to her, the girl didn't respond. When John turned her over, he found no visible injuries. Only her eyes were able to move. He didn't know what had happened to her, but soon realized they could communicate through blinking. John fetched a wheelbarrow, placed the girl inside and brought her back home. Just as he was about to call the police, there came a sudden knock at the door. The girl blinked frantically, signaling danger. John immediately understood the person outside wasn't friendly. When he opened the door, he saw the very same perverted man standing there. The man Suspected John had rescued the girl, so he lied, trying to trick John into handing her over. John didn't believe a word of it. He made up an excuse and shut the man outside. Just as John reached for the phone to call the police, the man suddenly forced the door open and came in. John grew angry, but the man pretended to be in pain, trying to gain sympathy. The man then went straight to check the wheelbarrow. When he saw the girl wasn't there, he turned around and calmly sat down on the sofa. He asked to borrow John's phone, claiming he lost his own in a car accident, and then began to cry. John hesitated, unsure whether to believe him. He wanted to know what had happened between them. The man told a story. He and his wife had gone on a trip to the countryside, but when they reached the forest, his wife suddenly had a mental breakdown and tried to grab the steering wheel. The car crashed into a tree and he blacked out. When he woke up, his wife was gone. He claimed that when his wife had these episodes, he couldn't move or speak, painting a picture that sounded perfectly reasonable. But what he didn't know was that the girl, his supposed wife, was lying right behind him, listening to every word. Hearing the man's story, John's doubts began to fade. Just as John was about to say the girl was there, the Man's phone suddenly rang. That moment John realized the man had been lying. The man tried to explain, saying he wasn't thinking clearly, but John no longer believed him. John told him to search outside in the woods instead. The man knew he'd been exposed, so he dropped the act and revealed his true violent nature. He threatened John, demanding to know where the girl was. John realised the man wouldn't let him live. Would have told you sooner. I just didn't know what the hell to do, where. I would like the two of you to leave now. I'll forget any of this ever happened. Tell me in the shed. I bet. John pretended to cooperate, trying to lure the man outside. The man grabbed John's phone and insisted they go together. When the man leaned closer, John suddenly struck him and rushed to make the emergency call. The man, enraged, attacked him and a fierce struggle broke out. Surprisingly, John held his own. The man failed to gain the upper hand. Then the man started taunting John, bringing up his family to distract him. In that moment, he seized a knife from the floor. The girl watched everything unfold. She wanted desperately to help, but her body remained limp and unresponsive. All she could do was watch helplessly as John lost consciousness. The man then carried gasoline from the shed and prepared to burn the house down. As the flames spread, panic filled the girl's eyes. More than Being caught, she feared dying silently in the fire. Summoning her last ounce of strength, she tugged at the curtains to draw attention. Fortunately, the man noticed the movement before leaving. He found the girl and dragged her out of the burning house. Before leaving, he forced her to look at the flames consuming the home. He told her coldly that all of this happened because she tried to run away. Though she had escaped the fire, the fear inside her only grew deeper. She didn't know where he was taking her or what awaited her next. But then something unexpected happened. The man received a phone call. On the other end was his daughter. During the conversation, he sounded like a loving father and a good husband, but in reality, he was a monster. There was one bit of good news, though. His family was on their way to the cabin. He tried to stop them from coming, but he failed. Now he had to clean up the mess fast. At a gas station stop, the man went inside to pay for the girl. This was her only chance. She looked around desperately trying to signal for help. A young boy noticed her, but he couldn't understand her pleading eyes. Then the boy's mother approached the window, scolding her son for bothering strangers. The man was watching everything from behind. Moments later, the mother LED her son away. The girl's only hope vanished. The man finished paying and quickly Drove away with her. But the mother had noticed something strange. Sensing something was wrong, she wrote down the license plate number and called the police. The man had no idea he'd already been exposed. He hid his crimes behind the mask of a good husband and loving father. But behind that perfect image was a heart blackened by evil. And no matter how flawless his disguise seemed, the truth would always find a way to surface.

But in the vast, sprawling swamp, she quickly lost her bearings. Meanwhile, Mark was already in pursuit. Spotting the boat floating in the water, he dove right in without hesitation. With his knowledge of the terrain, Mark rapidly closed the distance. Oh, yeah. The moment Lisa heard the psycho's voice, she panicked. By the time Mark caught up, Lisa had vanished from the boat. She'd slipped underwater to hide. After making it back to shore, Lisa stumbled through the woods until she stumbled upon an abandoned house. But Mark, tracking her footprints in the dirt, quickly zeroed in on her location. Racing against time before Mark could catch up, Lisa searched the house for weapons. Instead, she discovered a barrel of gasoline and two flare sticks. She hurried outside, hoisted the barrel onto a flagpole, then punctured a small hole to let the gas trickle down. After lighting the flare, the explosion instantly grabbed Mark's attention. Lisa then knocked him out cold with a stick. Just then, a car slowly pulled up. It was Annie, Lisa's friend. Together, they stuffed Mark into the trunk and drove him back to their place. Turns out this had been their plan all along. These two were even more twisted than Mark himself. Lisa had transformed from prey to predator. They bound Mark to a chair with wire. Lisa grabbed a bottle of Liquor and poured it directly onto his wounds. The searing pain jolted Mark awake. But what awaited him was far more brutal torture.

But after a long time, the old man showed no reaction. Seeing this, the warden ordered his men to dispose of the body. The guards wrapped him in a shroud, planning to carry him out after death. What they didn't know was that another prisoner in the tunnel had witnessed everything. As soon as the guards left, the man eagerly crawled out. Looking at the cellmate he had spent eight years with, now separated by life and death, he instantly broke down. Dying in this prison might as well have been his own fate. Glancing at the old man's body, a bold idea suddenly formed in his mind. He quickly tore open the shroud and dragged the old man's body into his own cell, placing him on the bed in a sleeping position. He cut off some of his own hair and attached it to the old man's head, making him resemble himself even more. Once everything was set, the man returned to the old man's cell, retrieved the treasure map hidden in the wall, and before the guards returned, sewed himself into the shroud. After that, everything depended on fate. Not long after the guards returned from dinner. Though the body felt a bit heavy as they lifted it, they didn't suspect anything. They opened the shroud and to be extra careful, tied an iron ball to the ankles. Before throwing the body into the sea, 1, 2. Thanks to the small knife the old man had made before his death, the man cut a slit and escaped from the shroud. He then removed the iron ball, letting it fall into the abyss, and, freed from his restraints, swam vigorously toward the light. After 14 years of wrongful imprisonment, the man finally escaped. But the danger wasn't over. He had to reach the shore before the guards noticed. Meanwhile, when the guards brought food, they sensed something was wrong. No matter how they called, the man didn't respond. Approaching the bed, they were horrified to see that the person lying there was the old man who had been thrown into the sea. The warden ordered his men to move the bed. To their shock, the stones in the wall moved easily like building blocks. Holding a torch, he looked inside and found a tunnel. But if you use those tools to set himself free from the body bag. But by then, it was too late. Drawing on unknown reserves of strength, the man swam to the shore in one breath, beginning his path of vengeance. To avoid attracting attention, he sneaked into a farmhouse and changed out of the humiliating prison uniform. But when he looked in the mirror, he barely recognized the stranger staring back. 14 years of imprisonment had not only tormented his spirit, but altered his face. Before leaving, he stole a pair of Scissors to Fix his appearance. A few days later, following blurry memories, he finally returned to his hometown, only to learn that his father had died years ago, buried in the church ahead. The news hit him like a thunderclap. The joy of returning home vanished instantly. He couldn't believe it. As he walked toward the grave, seeing his father's Tombstone, he realized that his family had suffered the most during his ordeal. The priest explained that his father had died of grief. The Tombstone beside it was his own, with the death date matching the year he was imprisoned. It was clear that the people who framed him never intended to let him out. After adjusting his emotions, the man went to his fiance's house, only to learn she had married shortly after his imprisonment and was now living in Paris. He left in a hurry, feeling suffocated. The promise that she would marry only him now seemed a cruel joke. Even more shocking, she had married the very man who had framed him for prison.

It guarded the only water source like a king. Whenever another dog tried to sneak close for a sip, it would bear its teeth and growl. The rest of the pack lowered their heads, too scared to push back. It was the lead dog and it ruled through fear until buck showed up. With one light jump, he landed on the frozen surface. Crack, a small hole split open. Cold water gushed up and the dogs rushed in, drinking eagerly. The huskies eyes darkened at once. To him, buck had just declared war. From that moment, he went out of his way to make Buck's life hell, yanking, tripping, mocking him every chance he got. But fate wasn't on his side that day. The woman went ahead to scout the trail. Without warning, the ice gave way beneath her and she plunged straight into the freezing lake. The young man ran forward, but the icy water stopped him cold. In a flash, buck bolted like lightning, diving head first into the lake. In the dark, frigid water, he found her and with every ounce of strength, he pushed her toward the surface. A few heavy blows and the ice finally split open. The woman was saved, but buck was swept away by the current. The driver hacked at the ice desperately, knife snapping, hands bleeding, tears mixing with blood. Just when all hope seemed lost, a stick pressed into his hand. He turned around. Buck sitting there calm and unharmed. The man burst out laughing, hugging buck tight like a child. And from the shadows, the huskies jealous eyes burned. That night, the woman rewarded buck with a big roasted drumstick. The husky stared cold, light flashing in his eyes. He had made up his mind. It was time to strike. Late that night, buck chased a rabbit into the woods. After a long run, he finally caught it, but chose to let it go. A second later, the husky lunged forward and killed it in one bite. Blood splattered across the snow, his challenge loud and clear. Buck's anger erupted. The two dogs faced each other, the wind howling through the mountains. The husky attacked first, fast and brutal. Buck stumbled back, losing ground fast. He'd never fought for real before and fear gripped him. Then he heard the pack barking behind him. In that instant, something in his eyes changed, his blood ignited and the wildness deep within him finally awoke. With a roar, buck turned and struck back, slamming the husky into the snow. One move decided it. The fight was over. The pack went wild, howling their new king's name. The husky tucked its tail and disappeared into the woods. The next morning, the driver couldn't find his lead dog. Buck stepped forward to volunteer. The man shook his head, thinking buck was too reckless. But with no other choice, he fastened the harness around Buck's neck. We're gonna be Two days late, he muttered. But the moment the sled started moving, it flew like the wind. Snow sprayed in every direction. The air roared around them, and buck LED the team full speed ahead. Arriving two days early, the driver shouted in joy, his voice echoing across the mountains. And that very shout triggered an avalanche. The mountain thundered, a wall of white crashing down. Run, he screamed. Buck didn't hesitate. He looked up once, saw the shadow of death racing toward them, then spun around, leading the team straight into an ice cave. A miracle they made it. When the snow finally settled, they hadn't just survived, they'd reached the finish line early. Under the golden sunset, buck watched people smiling as they received their letters. And in that moment, he understood a sled dog's purpose wasn't just to deliver mail, but to carry warmth from one heart to another. The next morning, the dogs set out again. The town cheered, the snow sparkling under the morning light. But this time, an old man ran up waving a letter. I wrote this all night, he said breathless. Buck stopped quietly, taking the letter in his mouth. You're a lucky one, the driver grinned. Buck's my boss. From that day on, the sled team was never late again. They always arrived early, buck leading the way, head high, proud and fearless. But good times never last. The world was changing. Telegrams replaced sled dogs. The wheel of fate kept Turning tears filled the driver's eyes as he sold them off. A few days later, they were bought by a gold prospector. The moment buck saw the man's whip, a bad feeling crept up his spine. The sled was frozen to the ground and the dogs, half starved, couldn't pull it free. The prospector didn't understand. He decided they were just lazy. Without a word, he raised his stick to strike, but an old man stepped in front of him. The stranger grabbed the handle and helped pry the sled loose himself. He guessed the man was heading for the fabled river of gold. He warned him that the weather was warming up. Traveling now was suicide. But the prospector wouldn't listen. He thought the old man was trying to hold him back on purpose. And sure enough, the days grew warmer, the snow softened beneath their feet, and every mile grew harder. Still, the man barked orders behind them, whipping and cursing. Then the yellow dog collapsed, dragging the whole team downhill. Buck dug in his paws, fighting with every ounce of strength to stop the slide. By sheer will, he held them steady. But the heartless man decided the dogs were lazy again and brought his whip down hard. Their cries echoed through the mountains, and buck could only grit his teeth, dragging forward, refusing to let a single teammate fall behind. When they finally reached the top of the hill, Buck's body was spent. Every muscle burned. His strength drained completely. The man looked at him like he was worthless. Without hesitation, he pulled out his gun.

And sure enough, in just two months, the baby gator shoots up to over 10 meters long. But the bigger it gets, the bigger its appetite grows. Even the big yellow cow she'd raised for over 10 years wasn't enough to satisfy it. But here's the real shocker. To keep the gator fed, the old woman actually pushed her own husband into the lake, then called the cops, pretending he slipped and fell in. What she didn't know was that the whole thing was already a trap. She'd carefully set up. The officers suited up in diving gear and jumped into the lake to look for him. But what puzzled the divers was, in such a huge lake, there wasn't a single fish in sight. Soon, one of them discovered a cave at the bottom, more than two meters wide. Curious, he swam inside to check it out. But the next second, disaster struck. When will dragged his partner back to the boat, he realised the man was already torn in half. For the safety of the nearby villagers, the police quickly called in a helicopter, using a cow tied to a rope as bait, hoping to lure the monster out.

As the centuries passed, the seals power gradually weakened. Under a blood red sunset, I finally broke free. By now, my former lover, Bard, had become a white haired old man, the last heir of his bloodline. Whenever the alarm bells rang, he'd ride out with his apprentice and a wagon full of demon hunting tools. People call him the Monster Hunter. One evening, Bard received a distress call from the villagers. He had no idea it was a trap I'd set specifically for him. The job was to exercise an evil spirit from a little girl. The girl, bound in iron chains, was thrashing violently. Bard filled a pouch with silver powder and hung it around her neck. Instantly, she went limp and collapsed, the spirit expelled from her body. When the red smoke gathered together, everyone realized the demon was me. I slowly approached Bard's apprentice and began to bewitch his mind. At the critical moment, Barde shouted, snapping out of it, the apprentice hurled his axe. I barely dodged the falling iron bell just as I tried to escape. Barde and his apprentice worked in perfect sync, first striking me with a specially crafted mercury sword as I transformed into a dragon, then throwing an iron net over me while I was weakened. I struggled and dragged them both out of the building. But Bard's apprentice refused to let go. The net steadily drained my power. Eventually, exhausted I, I converted to human form and they locked me in a silver cage. The instant the cage door closed, I wrapped my tail around the apprentice and pulled him inside with me. I threatened Bard if he didn't let me out, I drain every drop of his apprentice's blood. While Bard hesitated, I'd already plunged my tail into the apprentice's body to prevent his student from turning into a demon. Bard set the cage on fire. He thought I'd burn to death. Then came a sudden explosion. I transformed into a dragon and burst through the cage. I returned to my old lair in the crumbling ruins. A masked woman appeared. When she removed her mask, I saw it was my sister, her face horribly scarred. I tenderly touched my sister's cheek, and the next second, her scarred face was completely healed. And I raised my hand and swept it through the air. The broken ruins instantly transformed into a magnificent palace. I immediately began summoning my former followers back. The first to return was the mighty armored knight. He could merge with his warhorse and transform into a massive ancient beast. To demonstrate the power I once held, I instantly wiped out the soldiers standing before me.

Among the passengers was an arms dealer who noticed that the hijackers guns were loaded with blanks. Live bullets would risk damaging the plane or causing casualties, which could panic passengers and create uncontrollable chaos. Based on experience, most hijackers guns actually contain no live rounds. The arms dealer's observation gave Kevin the courage to act. He pulled out paper and pen from his sleeve, then pretended to feel airsick and went to the bathroom to vomit. But the female hijacker was unusually cautious, insisting that Kevin not flush the toilet. Once inside, Kevin quickly wrote a message on the paper, forced himself to dry heave, and then tossed the paper into the economy cabin, hoping passengers there could check for bullet casings. Earlier, one of the hijackers guns had accidentally discharged an economy. If passengers nearby couldn't find any casings, it would confirm the guns only contained blanks, and they could work together to resist the hijackers. Annie Picked up the paper and read the instructions. She started searching the area and after checking carefully, found no bullet holes or casings, confirming the hijackers guns were indeed empty. He turned on her reading light and Kevin, now confident, felt ready to end the crisis. But Sam thought Kevin was being naive. There was no way the hijackers only brought blanks, and attempting resistance without full certainty could endanger even more lives. At that moment, a flight attendant overheard their conversation. She quietly approached and revealed that a little girl had just found a bullet in the bathroom. If they could figure out what the bullet looked like, they could finally confirm whether the hijacker's guns were truly loaded with blanks.

But I subdued him with 20,000 volts of high voltage electricity. Just as we were preparing to kill the invisible man, we discovered that his skin was composed of carbon super oxygen material harder than diamond. With virtually no way to penetrate it, professional Assassin Frenchy crafted an armor piercing warhead. This bullet was made of the same material as the Invisible Man's skin, both covered with a layer of carbon supershadow material. He then loaded the bullet into an armor piercing rifle. Butcher was already eager to eliminate this evil superhero. However, unexpectedly, the bullet was deflected by the invisible man and ricocheted wildly around the room. Ha ha, you stupid fucking asshole. I'm invincible, you stupid motherfuckers. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Seeing this, the invisible man began mocking us frantically. The frustrated butcher directly shut the door. At this moment, Frenchy got inspiration from watching a turtle on TV. Although the invisible man's skin was as hard as diamond, his internal organs were as fragile as those of a normal person. If something were inserted into his throat, he might vomit. But there is now another solution. What did you do to me? He stuck a lump of plastic up your bum son s bomb. Oh, my god. At this moment, the invisible man revealed his true form. He felt the fear of death. To save his life, he Betrayed his teammate a train. But butcher wasn't satisfied with this answer. Ignoring the Invisible Man's pleas, he directly shut the door. Just as he was about to detonate the bomb, he discovered that homelander had already found this place using GPS tracking. Homelander was the strongest superhero, possessing not only laser eyes with X ray vision, but also super hearing. If we detonated the bomb, our position would be exposed. The most urgent task now was to lure homelander away. Frenchy called his girlfriend and had her set up bombs at a distance to attract Homelander's attention. To buy time for his girlfriend, Frenchy acted as bait in the car while butcher went to the trailer to install the detonator. But unexpectedly, homelander arrived faster than we had anticipated. Frenchy maintained his composure, disguising himself as Homelander's fan. However, Homelander still insisted on inspecting the trailer. Under his X ray vision, he found nothing unusual. Turned out butcher had hidden himself earlier. By this time, the bomb installation was complete. As butcher detonated the bomb, homelander immediately flew into the air. Hearing the commotion, the invisible man realized his teammate had come to rescue him. He used a cup to collect some orange juice and then poured it on the transformer. Without the high voltage electrical restriction, he easily broke open his cage. But just as he escaped, I discovered him. I held the detonator and told him to get back in the cage. However, a hint of timidity In my eyes was still caught by the invisible man. You kill me. They'll never stop looking for you. You'll be glancing over your shoulder your whole life till they find you, which they will look you let me go. You'll be the hero that shaved translucent. It's not too late. You can still go home back to your life. After saying this, the invisible man completely ignored my presence. At this moment, I remembered my girlfriend who had died tragically. Seeing the invisible man become invisible again and about to escape, I finally exploded with rage and pressed the detonator without hesitation.

He walked towards sunny, his eyes brimming with gratitude. It's just 10th. What are you smiling about? Yet sunny wasn't satisfied with 10th place. Their goal was the championship. Joshua celebrated joyfully with his teammates. Sonny approached Kate. Deal's deal. I finished, yeah, in last place. Sounds great when you say it. Kate's gaze towards Sonny had completely transformed. He wasn't a reckless gambler, but a seasoned cowboy who blazed trails. All previous doubts vanished in this race. When reporters questioned him again, sunny unhesitatingly made a wager with them. You're 10 pounds against my 10 grand. We play Simon. I win your 10, we don't. You win mine. Let's do this, man. Put your money where your mouth is. What the hell? I'll take that. Thank you. Hey, no more press. He disliked media interviews, even if it meant facing fines. Take it out of my paycheck. We don't pay you enough. The investor who looked at him with doubt during the race now began praising sunny. Immediately after the race ended, sunny entered the simulation training room. Through repeated experiments, he finally shaved another half second off his lap time watching sunny in the simulator pod. How long has he been in there? All day. Playing with different tire pressures, ride heights. Where is time? He found half a second. Give me the same setup as him. Joshua had the staff adjust his parameters for training as well. Sunny found Kate again, while she was still working, just as she was refining the car's aerodynamic model, she apologized for storming off after drinking last time, admitting she'd witnessed Sunny's true talent during this race. She also answered Sunny's question how she became the only female technical director in F1. She yearned to travel the world and hear the crowds cheers, so she discussed it with her husband, who swiftly became my ex husband. Good night. Back at the apartment, sunny called Rubin, do you know what time it is? Alright, tell me about the kid Monza circuit Italian Grand Prix. The team's atmosphere had warmed up thanks to Sunny's arrival. Pre race interview, the team manager was invited due to Sunny's recent performance. Seated beside him were the team principals of Ferrari and McLaren. When asked about Sunny's radical approach, both managers from the established powerhouses expressed their disdain.

The second I dropped into the driver's seat, a creepy countdown appeared on the dashboard. As a bomb disposal expert, I knew exactly what this meant. Someone might have planted a timed explosive in the car. I knew better than anyone what happens when that timer hits zero. I fought down my panic, signaled my husband outside to check the car. He thought I was joking until he saw the numbers ticking on the screen. His face instantly changed. He rushed to check under the car. Right then a red light started flashing in the glove box. I carefully used a card to test it. After confirming no wires were connected, I held my breath and slowly opened it. A circuit board was lying inside. I turned to my two kids in the back seat, told them not to move at all. My husband sent me a photo from under the car. One look at it, my whole body went cold. It was a TM sixty two anti tank mine. This thing could easily destroy a heavy tank. The circuit board in the glove box suddenly made sense. This was the mine's micro reaction control panel. Any change in the car's weight, our whole family would be gone. Time was running out fast. Call my colleague was shaking hands. He was also a bomb disposal specialist at the company gearing my situation. He arrived in less than 10 minutes. Only 20 minutes left on the countdown. My colleague pulled out professional equipment to check underneath. The moment he saw the mine, his face went white. If this mine exploded, there wouldn't even be ashes left. He wanted to call the fire department, but they need at least 20 minutes to arrive. There wasn't enough time. My colleague gritted his teeth and decided to do it himself. As he examined the mine carefully, he suddenly found our company's information marked on the shell. He immediately called the boss. The next second, a phone rang in the trunk. My son opened the rear panel. The boss's severed hand fell out. My mind went blank. This was a carefully planned assassination. My colleague called his assistant to bring more specialized equipment. After careful inspection, they found four wires connected to the mine. I believed cutting the blue wire on the panel would stop the countdown. But my colleague insisted the yellow wire was the mine circuit. The others were traps. He ignored my advice, deployed the bomb disposal robot, ready to cut the yellow wire. Everyone held their breath. The yellow wire was cut. The countdown kept going. Only one minute left. My colleague grabbed the pliers and crawled into the car, ready to cut the blue wire. I mentioned his hand.

Baby! Oh, sorry. That was a dog. That wasn't me. My name is Bailey, and I'm a dog. But I figured something out pretty early on. My whole purpose was for my boy, Ethan. I caught a new scent on Ethan when I'd never smelled before. It was a mix of nervous and happy sweat. I followed my nose. That's when I saw her. Her name was Hannah. So I ran right over, you know, to break the ice for my boy. He was a little shy. Sure enough, soon they both had that same sweaty, happy smell. From that day on, she was part of our pack. I liked her. She smelled like warm cookies. The three of us were inseparable after that. Ethan would drive us around in his truck. And in the car, they were always wrestling, licking each other. I never understood why Ethan was always searching for something in Hannah's mouth. There was never anything in there. But, hey, if they were happy, I was happy. I thought we'd be like that forever. But a fire changed everything. My boy was hurt. He got a new, not fun stick to carry around, and the smile was gone from his face. He shut himself away, and he shut the world out. Hannah came. She tried to pull him back out, but he pushed her away with the most hurtful words. We shouldn't be with each other anymore. It's not gonna work. I Could smell his heartbreak. And just as strong, the sad cookie scent of Hannah's. She pet my head one last time. And then she threw the football, the one we'd played with a thousand times, high into the air. The ball was gone, just like Hannah. Gone from our lives forever. Not long after, Ethan had to leave for some faraway college. He threw the ball for me one last time, then put me out of the truck and drove away. I ran like crazy, chasing after him. I didn't get it. Humans are just so complicated. They leave for no good reason at all. I left and I came back. Two smells always stayed with me. Always. The smell of Ethan and the smell of cookies. I ended up astray, but I followed a memory. A feeling that pulled me back to a golden field of wheat. Back to that old farm. And I found him. Time had stolen his youth, but it couldn't steal his scent. He was old and so lonely. I'd smelled that kind of loneliness on people before. And I knew he was still thinking about her. I had to help him. I snuck out and followed that cookie scent to a park. And there she was. Hannah was old.

These distinctive components effectively optimize airflow beneath the underbody, meaning the car will be significantly more stable. Following the incident at the previous race, both drivers from their team were penalized to the back of the grid. For sunny, this posed no issue, as he consistently qualified in that position. But they've docked us to the back of the grid cause they don't like the way we drive. Fine, fuck them. Cause if we can pick up a tenth of a second from you, and from you and you and me, if everyone in this room can make one critical contribution, that's a second every lap. And after 72 laps, that's the difference between last and first. During the meeting, he held complete command of the discussion. Plan C for combat. Thanks to the new power train components, Sunny's driving skills were fully unleashed. On the final lap. He charged into ninth place with sheer skill, securing valuable points for the team. By the Japanese Grand Prix, Sonny had fully adapted to the modified car. Another fearless attack from Hayes. And here's where the APEX GP found strength. Three tens gained every lap, and in the corners alone, without Joshua's constraints, Sonny could perform at his best. He gained 0.3 seconds per lap. This is APEX GP's best ever finish. It's a valiant seven. I love it. Crossing the finish line in seventh place at the Mexican Grand Prix he delivered another extraordinary performance, charging to fifth place, earning the team a total of 16 points in just three races. Countless F1 fans became Sonny's supporters. His banners and cheering signs held high. But only Sonny knew how utterly exhausted he was. Meanwhile, Joshua never received such treatment. His agent constantly stirred trouble around him. Joshua began suspecting sunny deliberately caused his crash, planting a seed of resentment. Belgian Grand Prix with sunny leading the charge, the number of racers surged significantly. The team's atmosphere became more united than ever before, all thanks to sunny. Witnessing this, Joshua's jealousy burned even brighter. Upon his official return to the team, sunny warmly welcomed him back. Good to have you back, JP. We missed you. When Joshua arrived at the starting grid, seeing the grandstands filled with fans holding Sonny's banners, the flames of envy within him were fully ignited.

I have strength far beyond ordinary people. My skin is incredibly tough. Nothing can hurt me. No physical attack can injure me. I used to be an ordinary man. I got these powers because I was framed and sent to prison. In prison, the warden oppressed me, but I refused to bow down to him. He held a grudge and tortured me every day. He beat me so badly that I couldn't move ladder. They took me for an experiment. During the experiment, the warden suddenly barge into the lab and turn the machine to the highest setting. He was trying to torture me even more. Nobody expected the experiment to go completely wrong. The machine exploded and the lab turned into chaos. The warden and the doctor died on the spot. I, however, miraculously survived. All my wounds healed and I could feel a powerful force surging inside me. I tried throwing punch after punch. I punched a massive hole in the thick prison wall. I escaped from that island prison. After I escaped, I went into hiding and worked at a barbershop, living a relatively peaceful life. One night, I walked past a restaurant and saw a few thugs bullying a Chinese couple demanding Protection money. Since they were my friends, I stepped in to stop them. But the thugs got even more arrogant. One, a bald guy, rushed at me and swung a punch. His fist hit my face but broke his Wrist instead and he screamed in pain. I grabbed him and threw him out the window. Once I took care of the thugs, I comforted my friends and left. The next day, three men walked into the barbershop. I could tell they weren't here for a haircut. Just last night, I taught some of their men a lesson and their boss was the man standing in front of me, Cobra, the local gang leader. Cobra had a beard and spoke with a threatening tone, warning me to stay out of things. After that, he straightened his clothes and tried to leave, but I stopped him and told him to pay the Bill. Cobra had never been treated like that and he looked shocked, but he still told his men to pay. His men threw the money on the floor and walked out. Later that night, a thug came in with a submachine gun and started spraying bullets inside the barbershop. I immediately shielded my friend's child with my body. Unfortunately, my friend was shot and fell to the ground. After the shooting, two more thugs barged in and grabbed my friend's wallet. On they left, I got up and luckily the kid was fine. It turned out we had both played dead to survive. Looking at my friend lying on the floor, I felt devastated. He wasn't just my friend. He was my only family. I was consumed with rage. I couldn't take it anymore. And I decided to take Revenge for my friend. That night, I went to the gang's base. I ripped off a car door and used it as a shield. When I reached the building, I punched through the thick metal door with one hit. I held the car door in front of me, blocking all the bullets as I charged inside. I knocked out all the thugs I came across. I found a secret room and realized it was Cobra's hidden vault. I opened a big bag and it was full of cash. I grabbed a bag of money and walked out without a care in the world. When Cobra found out I took the money, he was furious. I took the money to the Chinese couple's restaurant and paid the back rent I owed them. Just then, Cobra raised a rocket launcher and aimed it at us. By the time I noticed, it was too late.

As he got closer, he saw the heat from it had actually melted through the ice. Curious, he stupidly poked at the ice with his walking stick a few times. The ice started cracking and the hole kept getting bigger and bigger, but he still didn't realize how serious things were getting. By the time he tried to turn around, the ice collapsed instantly. He managed to grab onto the sled at the last second, which saved his life, but the resting Samoyeds suddenly found themselves being yanked forward by the force. When his teammates rushed over to grab the sled, it was so heavy that it took all of them, plus the pack of Samoyed dogs pulling together just to keep him from falling. The guy tried to climb out and reached for his backpack, but it slipped and fell, nearly taking him down with it. Luckily, he caught hold of the sled rope, but now he didn't dare make any more moves. The teammates above didn't dare pull harder either, because the sled rope was stretched tight, as a wire could snap at any moment. All they could do was have one person carefully crawl to the edge of the ice hole and lower down a backup rope. The guy grabbed it, and his teammates pulled together while he climbed up with everything he had. With everyone working together, the guy finally made it. Back up alive. Judging by the look on his face when he got to the top, he probably won't be taking a leak just anywhere ever again. After that close call, everyone started watching every single step they took. After days of tough terrain, the team finally reached the deepest point of Antarctica. Looking out at the endless ice stretching before them, everyone was thrilled beyond words because they had become the first people to set foot on this part of Antarctica.

It was so tight she could barely breathe. Today was supposed to be her wedding day, but a guard secretly slipped a dagger into her waistband. The princess was utterly confused by this, but she would soon understand why. As the wedding ceremony came to an end, the Prince swept her up in his arms. Just as Anna was lost in blissful happiness, the prince suddenly hurled her off the cliff. Fortunately, the valley below was thick with branches and foliage, which saved Anna from a deadly fall. Darkness and terror surrounded her. She screamed for help in rage and desperation, but her cries accidentally awakened a sleeping dragon at the bottom of the cliff. As roaring flames came rushing toward her, Anna ran for her life, barely managed to duck into a cave, only to get her ankle tangled in debris. With a second wave of flames approaching fast, she fought desperately to break free. Thankfully, she only suffered burns to her skin. To survive, she used the dagger to cut strips from her dress and bandaged her wounds. Then, carrying a flaming torch, she bravely ventured into the dark depths of the valley. Fortune seemed to smile upon her. Anna quickly found melting icicles. She tilted her head back and drank deeply, then slowly closed her eyes in exhaustion.

Las esposas y las hijas rezaban a Mike que Mike les diera más gracia, porque aquí Mike era su Dios. Era un gran honor recibir su gracia y ayuda. Vivían en la selva virgen. Las tareas diarias de las esposas eran tejer y cortar leña. Para cocinar, las hijas tenían que tender la ropa para que se secara. Mike era su religión. Por supuesto, él no tenía que hacer nada. Lo único que tenía que hacer era lavarles el cerebro, hacer que su esposa y sus hijas lo adoraran. Tal vez solo con mirarlo se sentirían honradas. Su nombre es Ana. Era la más bonita de las hijas de Mike. Su madre murió cuando ella nació. Echa mucho de menos a su madre porque desde que tiene memoria nunca había visto la cara de su madre. Ella encontró el coraje para ir a Michael y le preguntó en un susurro si le contaría la historia de su madre, pero Michael evitó responder. Un día, Ana fue enviada a llevar comida a la choza. En la choza vivían dos esposas de Matt. Las abandonaron cuando desobedecieron a Matt. Matt les dijo que estas dos mujeres eran impuras.

Anna vio lo asustado que estaba el hombre y efectivamente, al día siguiente Mike anunció que el mundo se iba a acabar. Estaban buscando un segundo hogar. Las esposas se entristecieron mucho al oírlo. Solo Ana tenía dudas. Los hombres se apresuraron a llevarla y así fue. Empezaron a buscar un nuevo hogar y por fin llegaron a un pequeño río donde se asentaron. El hombre metió a sus esposas en el río. Dijo que era para lavar su suciedad, pero al día siguiente las niñas encontraron que sus madres se habían ido. Bajaron al río, solo vieron a Michael y la ropa de sus esposas. Las chicas se preguntaron dónde habían ido sus madres. Él dijo a un lugar más santo y convirtió a las niñas en sus esposas, pero Ana ya no le creyó.

She immediately grasped the gravity of the situation and hurried to the elderly woman suffering from dementia. Sure enough, her pants were soaked in blood. They rushed the old lady to the hospital, but upon returning, the husband didn't share the results with his wife's friend. Instead, he calmly claimed it was a minor issue. After leaving the hospital, they didn't rush home. Instead, they went to a nearby zoo. It turned out his wife had loved elephants most in her youth, so he wanted to spend more time with her in the days ahead. A few days later, the old man used their wedding anniversary as an excuse to gather all their children back home. He intended to reveal his wife's condition and properly discuss their final arrangements with them. But it seemed no one paid him any mind. The eldest son was constantly busy with work. The second son was engrossed in mobile games. Not a single soul cared about their parents feelings. To lighten the mood, he pulled out clay figurines he'd molded for his grandson. But his daughter in law looked utterly disgusted, even spraying disinfectant wildly. The old man felt deeply hurt, and his friend witnessed it all. Just as he was about to scold these unfilial children, his wife stopped him. After all, this was someone else's family gathering.

The flight he was on was No. 1,015, and today's date was also October 15th. Even the flight's original departure time had been delayed from 9:30 to 10:15. That's way too many coincidences. Justin felt a vague sense of unease, but after looking around, he saw nothing unusual. So he asked the captain, the flight today? No. Very good. Justin finally relaxed and went to a seat. But before he could sit down, a strange man nodded at him. Justin politely nodded back. Then he noticed something in the seat pocket ahead, an MP three player, and it was playing a creepy story about flight 1, 0, 1, 5. Wasn't that this very flight? Curious, he put on the headphones. Story described exactly what was happening on the plane right now. It said the flight attendant was doing the safety demo and that it was raining heavily outside. Justin lifted the window shade to check. Sure enough, it was pouring outside. Then the man in the MP three said that in one hour, the plane would vanish from radar and never reappear. Justin thought it was kind of funny, but suddenly the plane jolted. Luckily, it was just.

Cuando la luz pasó a través de la página. De repente, vio palabras ocultas bajo el marcador negro. Era información clasificada, información que no se suponía que debía ver. Pero los números en los que su equipo trabajado durante días no coincidían con los del informe. Y esa discrepancia era la razón por la que el lanzamiento del cohete rextone había fracasado. Determinada, subió la escalera y, utilizando los datos del archivo, comenzó a recalcular la trayectoria del cohete desde cero. Las fórmulas eran complejas, pero estaba cerca de resolverlas. En ese momento, sintió la necesidad de ir al baño, pero todos los baños en el edificio eran solo para el personal blanco. Tuvo que caminar uno coma ocho, cero cero metros, más de una milla para llegar al único que estaba destinado para los empleados negros. Mientras ella estaba fuera, sus cálculos llamaron la atención de sus compañeros. No podían creer lo que estaban viendo. La trayectoria correcta estaba ahí, ¿en la pizarra de quién es este trabajo? Catherine goebel, señor. Catherine regresó rápidamente a la oficina, solo para ser recibida con desconfianza. El director ya estaba esperando. Pensaba que podría ser una espía. Después de todo, toda la información esencial había sido tachada. No había forma que ella pudiera haber resuelto las ecuaciones bajo presión. Catherine explicó que simplemente había usado la luz para ver lo que estaba oculto debajo. El director levantó el documento y Efectivamente, la luz reveló las palabras ocultas. Su actitud cambió de inmediato. Ordenó al personal que dejara de tachar los documentos y por primera vez, catherine recibió acceso a los materiales clasificados que necesitaba. Pero cuando el director entró a su oficina, ansioso por trabajar con ella, la encontró con su asiento vacío. Catherine estaba afuera, bajo la lluvia torrencial, dirigiéndose hacia el baño para personas de color. Empapada hasta los huesos, trató de secarse con toallas de papel, pero ni siquiera había papel higiénico en ese baño. Regresó a la oficina empapada y antes de que pudiera explicar, el director exigió, dónde has estado durante los últimos cuarenta minutos en el baño. Señor, el baño. No te creo. Había un baño justo al final del pasillo. ¿Por qué te tardaste cuarenta minutos? Entonces catherine le dijo, la verdad, no me dejan usar ese baño. Tengo que caminar por todo el campus. No puedo usar las bicicletas de la oficina. No puedo tocar la cafetera común. Ni siquiera me dejan usar faldas o tacones. Todo por el color de mi piel y trabajo como una mula día y noche viviendo de café de una cafetera que nadie quiere tocar. La sala cayó completamente en silencio. El director no dijo nada. Catherine, exhausta y al límite, empacó sus cosas y se marchó. Esta mujer que se atrevió a hablar, terminaría haciendo contribuciones revolucionarias para toda la industria aeroespacial. Catherine había mostrado signos de genialidad desde que era niña, mientras otros niños Aprendían aritmética básica. Ella ya resolvía problemas de geometría analítica. Su profesora, asombrada por su talento, instó a sus padres a enviarla a las mejores escuelas. No los defraudó. A los dieciocho años había terminado la universidad. Sus extraordinarias habilidades matemáticas le consiguieron un empleo en la nasa. Pensó que sería el comienzo de algo grandioso, pero la realidad la golpeó fuerte. La mayoría de sus compañeros no creían en ella. Le daban miradas frías, la desestimaban con condescendencia. Le asignaban trabajo sin explicaciones. Pero entre ellos había un director que vio su valor. No le importaba el color de su piel, él veía su brillantez. Le asignó no solo tareas regulares, sino que también le pidió que verificara los cálculos de otros ingenieros. Eso no le gustó nada. A hilton, el líder del equipo, no podía soportar que alguien desafiara su autoridad en matemáticas. Entonces tachó partes clave de los documentos con un marcador y luego le dejó una montaña de archivos en su escritorio. Aun así, katherine aceptó el desafío, pero cada vez que necesitaba ir al baño perdía un tiempo precioso. A pesar de todo, nunca dejó que su trabajo se retrasara. El estrés era implacable. El café se convirtió en su único consuelo, pero cuando intentaba usar la cafetera común, sentía que todos la observaban. Al día siguiente, un pequeño bote de café apareció en su escritorio, marcado con su nombre. Lo levantó en silencio. Estaba completamente vacío. No se quejó, creía que su talento hablaría Por sí mismo, antes de que pudiera terminar el primer montón de archivos, otro montón aterrizó en su escritorio. No fue hasta caída la noche que finalmente alcanzó a ponerse al día. Pero cuando entregó su trabajo al director, lo tiró a la basura sin siquiera mirarlo. No fue un insulto. Los datos ya estaban desactualizados. El director no solo exigía números, quería visión, previsión. Necesitaba respuestas antes de que los problemas surgieran. Sin eso, nunca despegarían. Para avanzar, emitió una orden dura, quedarse trabajando horas extras sin fin o empacar y marcharse. Todos eligieron quedarse. No tenían otra opción. Se concentraron, se esforzaron al límite y luego el director notó que catherine ya no estaba. Esperó cuarenta minutos antes de que ella regresara. Cuando le preguntó dónde había estado, catherine soltó todo, todo lo que había soportado, todo el trato injusto, todo el sufrimiento silencioso. Y aquí volvemos al momento en el que comenzamos. Catherine pensó que todo había terminado, que la despedirían. Pero en lugar de eso, el director arrancó la etiqueta de su bote de café, caminó hacia el baño y arrancó el letrero que decía coloreado. Y luego hizo un anuncio sorprendente, uno que no solo cambiaría la vida de catherine, sino que ayudaría a moldear el futuro de la exploración espacial humana. ¿Quieres saber qué pasó después? Sígueme para conocer el final de la historia

He felt as if he had seen a strange dream. Then he remembered that the class was about to start, so he immediately ran towards the class. But as soon as he reached inside, he saw no face in the class was familiar to him. The same time the teacher came in, he saw that the boy was standing wearing a very old uniform. The teacher thought that he had come to joke. He was about to call the security when the boy quickly ran out. As soon as he came out, his eyes fell on the electronic screen. The year 2,017 was written on the screen. He was stunned to see this because according to him, it should have been 2005. Then he remembered his home. He became worried about his younger brother and sister, so he ran home. But as soon as he opened the door, he was shocked. Some other family was living there. There were pictures of the new family hanging on the walls. Before he could understand anything, the owner of the new house caught him. The owner thought that he was a thief and threatened to call the police. The boy tried to explain a lot, but the owner was not ready to listen to him at all. Suddenly, in anger, the boy pushed him hard. The push was so strong that the owner fell several Meters away, the boy himself was surprised. How did he show so much strength? He was about to pick up the owner's belongings and pack them up when the owner hit him with a stick. The boy fell unconscious. When he opened his eyes, he was in the hospital. The doctors were treating him. A police officer was standing beside him and interrogating him. Boy told his name. My name is Jack. I was born on July 7th, 1987. The police officer was shocked to hear this. He said, if you were really born in 1987, then you should be 31 years old now. Are you joking with us? The police did not believe him. They were about to take him to the police station when his information appeared in the system. It was clearly written in the system. Jack died 12 years ago.

Don't come in here. She's my mom. She's hot. How can you, how can you do this? Get dressed. Coming downtown, both of you. Why? We didn't do anything wrong. It's pretty wrong to me. Get dressed. You're sleeping with a teenage boy. Jordan's a man. He's 17. It's not a crime. Oh, it ought to be. You're old enough to be his mother. Barely. When I was his age, I was pregnant with Becca. So you're reliving your lost childhood. Was that it? You don't get it. When was the last time a man your age asked you out? Oh, we're not talking about me. I'm not the one who's sleeping with a teenager. It's been a while since you had a date, hasn't it? The partner of yours is cute. I bet he likes me younger. My ex sure did. I wasted 10 good years on Wally before I found out he was stooping his secretary when he ran out on us. I was angry at first, but then I realized if he could have a younger woman, I could have a younger man. Your husband leaving you hardly justifies you sleeping with a high school student. Why are you so bitter? Did someone leave?

But this time, the body in front of him was different from what he had imagined. No matter how he tried, the woman's eyes wouldn't close. The man remained calm. Taking out a bottle of clear glue from a box, he gently applied it to her eyelids, finally managing to close her eyes. Then John took out a bottle of foundation, carefully applying makeup on the woman's face. Soon, her complexion looked much more natural. Finally, John took an old coin, placed it beside her, while quietly chanting an incantation. After completing all of this, John sat down to rest. However, before John could rest for long, the apprentice brought in another female corpse. Despite being tired, John decided to continue working. When he was about to lift the white cloth, the body suddenly sat up. John was startled. The next second, the white cloth fell away, and it turned out that it was a colleague playing a prank. Lena reminded him that it was time to attend a friend's funeral. However, at that moment, John didn't know that a female ghost had already set her sights on him. In the middle of the night, John awoke from his sleep, and upon opening his eyes, he discovered the female ghost lying beside him.

Cada vez que enviaba un vídeo a su hermana, no podía enviarse debido a la falta de señal cerca de las estaciones base, también se enfrentaba a un problema más grave. Sus suministros casi se habían agotado. Arriesgándolo todo, solo pudo buscar en las casas de sus vecinos, armado con su antigua pistola de pesca. Pero en todas partes que buscó, todo estaba casi vacío. Afortunadamente, entró en una casa y encontró a una anciana. La anciana también era una víctima. Sus hijos se habían ido y ella había sido abandonada aquí debido a problemas en las piernas. Pero esta mujer mayor no estaba completamente inactiva. Conocía muy bien la zona. Sabía cuáles casas tenían más suministros, así que, bajo su orientación, jeff dejó de buscar de manera ciega. Al entrar en una casa, encontró una motocicleta. Con la ventaja del transporte, podía ampliar su rango de búsqueda. Pronto descubrió una gran cantidad de suministros. Ahora los dos podían usarlos sin preocuparse. Desafortunadamente, esta vida no duró mucho. Rápidamente se quedaron sin suministros nuevamente, pero afortunadamente, la anciana tenía buenas noticias. Usó un walkie talkie para transmitir la emisión a jeff. Aparentemente, los sobrevivientes cercanos habían establecido un punto seguro y estaban llamando a todos para que se reunieran. Esto le dio a jeff esperanza una vez más. Sin embargo, cuando jeff y la anciana Planeaban salir al día siguiente, él de repente quedó en silencio. Al principio, jeff pensó que ella estaba preocupada de que la dejara atrás, así que le prometió que no la abandonaría. Pero la anciana parecía reacia a discutir el asunto. Cuando jeff llegó a su casa al día siguiente, planeaba llevársela con él, pero cuando subió al piso de arriba, solo encontró una carta. La anciana no quería ser carga para él y eligió terminar con su vida regañadientes. Jeff tuvo que partir solo, pero cuando llegó al punto seguro, descubrió que había caído. La noche anterior. El sonido de la motocicleta atrajo a una gran cantidad de infectados. Jeff fue rodeado inmediatamente. No tuvo más opción que acelerar el motor, intentando desesperadamente avanzar.

Incapaz de contener su confusión, se acercó a dick y le preguntó dónde estaban los sobrevivientes, pero dick le dijo nuevamente que no hiciera demasiadas preguntas o estaría en peligro. Fue entonces cuando jeff se dio cuenta de que algo no estaba bien con el carguero. Le dijo a dick que conocía un hospital con un helicóptero y esperaba que dick, como piloto del capitán, pudiera ir con él para que pudieran dirigirse juntos a la isla segura de su hermana.

Sin embargo, mientras buscaba las llaves, accidentalmente encontró a los sobrevivientes de la noche anterior. Jeff quiso llevárselos, pero tan pronto como desató la cuerda, uno de los sobrevivientes trató de escapar y se encontró Con un miembro de la tripulación que lo disparó de inmediato. Al ver esto, jeff levantó rápidamente las manos. Justo entonces, dick pasó por allí y al ver a jeff en peligro, saltó frente al miembro de la tripulación.

Before we could even jump, Federation anti aircraft fire opened up on us. I have no choice but to leave my team down through the garage. The fire couldn't hurt our mobile suits, but our transport wasn't so lucky. Rounds hammered us like rain as we dodged and accelerated our descent. If we were any later, Stein's battalion would be wiped out. At the critical moment, our Hornet fighters took out the AA guns, but they got shot down immediately after. Watch your back. Give me the next. Ah. Still, it bought us the time we needed to land. 2, 1, deploy. Deploy, deploy. Once we hit the right altitude, we deployed our landing gear. But the Federation wasn't going to let us touch down easy. Two a G L. One thousand five hundred fighters came out of nowhere, targeting our parachutes specifically. A free fall from this height would kill the pilots inside, no matter how tough the Zaku armor was. I immediately activated our weapon systems and worked with my team to take down both fighters. Finally, we had a clear path. We dropped like avenging angels from above Takus. Finally, with our support, the tide of battle turned instantly. Federation tanks were like toys in front of us. They crumbled with a single hit. And this is what you get for trying to frame a trap on us. One tank tried to ambush me from behind. I kept clear across the field. The Federation forces had to retreat. The counter attack was a success. With our support, Stein captured the enemy base. Reinforcements from the rear arrived shortly after, ready for the final push. That evening, everyone gathered around the campfire celebrating our victory, but I kept my eyes locked on the distant tree line. As captain of Red Wolf Squad, I had a sharp instinct for battlefield situations. Sure enough, the next second, a piercing alarm cut through the air. I knew immediately we were in trouble. When I came to after the explosion, the entire base was engulfed in flames. Another alarm sounded and a mobile suit I've never seen before emerged from the inferno. What the hell? Let's suckers now. Yes, sir. I immediately rallied my team and scrambled into combat. Even facing this surprise assault, I quickly formed a battle plan. Unit 4, Kyle would provide long range cover. Unit 3, Sean would flank and suppress. And I take Unit 2, Galfi head on against the Federation's new mobile suit. Let's get that mobile suit with pleasure, Alpha. How cute. Betty's finally got themselves a mobile. But before Galphy could finish speaking, a beam shot from the enemy instantly pierced through his neck. Just one shot and our Zaku built from ultra high tensile steel was instantly destroyed. Galphy, before I could even process it, another beam came flying. Sean immediately raised his rifle. And unloaded on the enemy net. Not only was this thing packing serious firepower, but it moved with incredible agility, too. I got the bastard. That's when our sniper Kyle locked onto its landing point. The moment that suit hit the ground, he fired. But when the smoke cleared, the white mobile suit stood completely intact. Then it launched into the air and in some impossible move, kicked Unit 4 to the ground. It ripped out the power lines from Kyle Zaki and finished him off with a single punch. Help. Furious, Sean charged in with his heat axe, but the enemy suddenly pulled out a beam saber and sliced him down to nothing. Push on. In an instant, I was the last one left. I immediately fired two high powered rounds, but after easily deflecting them, it charged at me with its shield raised. I was done for. At the last moment, two Zaku tanks came to my rescue, but the next second they became the Gundam's next targets. Seeing that conventional weapons had zero effect on this thing, I frantically searched the battlefield for something, anything that could work there but when the smoke cleared, that white neck still stood tall in the flames. For the first time in my career, I felt complete despair. How can that be? Then it suddenly accelerated and launched into the air. Before I could fire again, it brought its blade down and severed both of my legs as I watched its. Beam saber at night right in front of me. A strange fear washed over me. Was this really where my story ended?

The mosquito's speed seemed as slow as a snail to him. Later, sunny went out for a walk. He happened to see a robber 800 meters away holding a female police officer hostage. Realizing the hostage was in danger, sunny immediately picked up a bamboo pole and threw it casually. In an instant, everyone was shocked. Reporters rushed toward the man frantically. Because of this rescue incident, sunny appeared on TV, which also caught the attention of a weirdo. The weirdo found sunny with his men. He asked sunny about the secret behind his abilities, but sunny knew nothing about it. The weirdo thought sunny was holding back on purpose. A fight broke out between the two sides right away. Sunny fought back with all his strength, but was finally captured. But just as the weirdo took out a knife to threaten him, Sunny's face suddenly twisted into a fierce expression. His body started twitching and his whole body turned bright red. Filled with anger, he not only broke free from the enemy's grip, but also pulled a pile of Flying knives off the ground toward himself. Sunny threw the flying knives at the enemies. Everyone dropped to the ground quickly. The weirdo also threw a flying knife to meet his attack. The two flying knives collided in an instant, then both bounced off. The warehouse was in chaos. Flying knives were flying everywhere, smashing many pieces of equipment. Soon after, everything collapsed. Sunny also fell to the ground. When everyone woke up, they found that the weirdo had been killed by Sunny's flying knife.

What's happening? It's okay. It's a bad case of the flu going around. We were warned about it this morning at roll call. Nothing to panic about. Then why did you lock the door? Standard protocol. Was there anyone else in the house with you earlier today? No, my kids were with my ex. You got any cold medicine? I think so. Go take it. I'm not coughing up blood. I'm just telling you how the advice is to treat this if we came across it. Right now, my partner's radioing for an ambulance. Gonna be here any minute. Go. Everything alright out there, Chad? Uh, yeah, the C D C. Is on their way. Hey, you need to come out of there. It's not gonna happen. Gotta keep this contained, Kim. He's gonna be alright, boo. Keep your head in the game, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. Top of the 10. You wanna tell me what happened? Yeah, uh, the bus passenger mistakenly grabbed the wrong bag, and the virus must have been in it cause he coughed up blood on Tim. What? Whoa, what are they doing? We need to get them out of there. We will, but first we have to establish a proper quarantine. Did any blood get on you? Uh, no. I was out here. Tim immediately closed the door. Officer Bradford, this is Doctor Morgan from the C D C. Hey, DOC. How you doing? Fine. Mr. Langston's struggling a little. Can You describe his condition? Yeah, yeah. Started coughing blood about 20 minutes ago. Now he's got a pretty wicked nosebleed. Why aren't they coming in? Where's my ambulance? He'll be here any minute. Just stay put. Save your energy. Oh, where's the vaccine? Still in the air. Should land in the next hour or so. You can't make Kim wait in there. He might not be infected. Sorry. Quarantine rules exist for a reason. Officer Bradford, do you mind if I put you to work while you wait? You wanna know what's in the bag? Copy that. Uh, Chen, I'm gonna turn on my body cam. Can monitor it from out there. Okay. Please be careful. Alright, here we go. Wait, wait. What is that bottle? Looks like the delivery device. It's a misting fan. I think you're right. Looks like there's a gross medium inside the bottle. Add the virus to it, then spread it in a crowd. Droplets sent on people's faces. Infect them through their mouth and nose. It's as low tech as you can get. It's Doctor Morgan. I know how they're planning to disperse the virus.

Everyone was staring at him. We were in the hallmark section at target when I noticed people pulling their kids closer. A woman with a cart blocked the aisle, her phone already out filming. Is that him? Someone whispered loud enough for us to hear. Dad kept reading cards like nothing was happening, but his hand was shaking. I checked my phone thinking maybe I had something on my face. But when I looked up, every single person was staring at him, not me. That's when a man in a Patagonia vest walked straight up to us. His face read, you've got some nerve showing your face here, he said. Voice cold and steady. I stepped between them, confused. Excuse me. Do I know you, your father? He said, pointing past me. Check the registry. Section 3 offender. I had no idea what he meant. Dad just stared at the floor like he'd been expecting this. The man pulled up something on his phone and showed the crowd first. Not me. Their faces went from curious to just disgusted in seconds. Someone called security. A mom shoved her daughter behind her and said directly to my dad, stay away from my child, you monster. Another woman started crying, pulling out her own phone. That's the guy from Oakwood Avenue. My daughter goes to that elementary school. My stomach dropped. Dad lived on Oakwood So did my girlfriend Rebecca and her six year old daughter Mia. They just moved into the apartment complex there three months ago. That's when I finally grabbed the phone from Patagonia guys hand. It was a state registry website with dad's photo, his exact address and offence details from 2003. The words inappropriate contact, minor under 12 appeared multiple times, 20 year sentence released four years ago. Security arrived as dad finally spoke, his voice barely above a whisper. I served my time. I'm allowed to be here, not around kids. You're not. Patagonia guy shot back, my son's baseball team plays at the park two blocks from your place. I've seen you there. I felt my throat closing. Rebecca and I had taken Mia to that exact park last weekend. Dad said he was at a doctor's appointment. The store manager was asking us to leave while other customers recorded everything, dad walked toward the exit without looking.

I kept running, trying to ignore him. Weird gym guys were nothing new, and I wasn't about to be someone's gym pickup. Story, please, he said again. And his voice cracked in a way that made me glance over. I can't stop or I'll collapse. That's when I actually looked at him. His legs were shaking badly, not like normal tired shaking, violent tremors. Sweat was pouring down his face way more than a moderate jog would cause. His skin looked gray. What's wrong? I slowed my treadmill down. Diabetic, emergency glucose tabs. Front pocket of my bag I can't reach without stopping. My stomach dropped. I jumped off my machine and grabbed his black backpack from the floor behind his treadmill. My hands were shaking as I unzipped the front pocket. Inside were orange tablets and a small bottle, some receipts and a photo of a little girl, maybe 4 years old. I pulled out the bottle and opened it. How many? Three, four? His words were starting to slur. I dumped several into my palm and held them up to him. His hands were trembling so hard he could barely grab them. He shoved them in his mouth and chewed, still jogging, never stopping. You need to sit down, I said, looking around for help. No, he swallowed hard. Don't let Me? Stop running, please. That's insane. You're having a medical emergency. My ex is here. He jerked his head slightly to the right. If she sees me weak, she'll use it. Please, just stay here and act normal. I followed his gaze across the gym. A woman in expensive Lululemon was by the free weights, but she wasn't working out. She was standing completely still, phone in hand, pointed directly at us, recording. What the hell, custody battle, he said between breaths. His color was starting to come back slightly, but he was still struggling. She's documenting everything, waiting for me to mess up. I looked back at the woman. She wasn't even trying to hide it. Her phone was up, camera definitely on, and her, her eyes were locked on the sky like a hawk. That's legal. Apparently, everything's legal when you're fighting for your kid. His voice was getting stronger, but he was still forcing himself to keep running. The judge already thinks I'm unstable because I had a low blood sugar incident at a parent teacher conference three months ago. Couldn't answer questions properly.

The applause was deafening. At 9:30, I finally checked my phone in the limousine, 47 notifications lit up the screen. Forbes had posted the photo an hour earlier, me and the governor crystal trophy gleaming under the chandelier. Caption reading 28 year old CEO started her 150 million dollar company in her parents garage. Then came the family text. Mom, someone just showed me Forbes. Why didn't you tell us? Dad, I'm seeing photos of you at an award ceremony. I'm so confused, Belle, what people at my wedding are looking at their phones congratulating me on your award? What is going on? I didn't respond. Mom called the next morning crying. People at the wedding kept asking why you weren't there. A senator, CEOs, they'd all seen the Forbes post. Belle looked like she wanted to disappear. Belle called 5 times. Finally I answered. You ruined my wedding, she screamed. I attended an award ceremony. I said calmly. You made it clear you didn't want me at your wedding. Preston's mother saw the post. She thinks I lied to her about why you weren't there. That's your problem. You chose what mattered more, impressing his family or having your sister there. Now live with it. Six months later, Belle texted, can we meet? She looked exhausted. I owe you an apology. I was so caught up in impressing Preston's family. That I hurt the people who actually loved me. What changed? I asked his mother after the wedding, she criticized everything about me and Preston never defended me. I realized I treated you the same way. A year after the governor's award, my company sold for 400 million. Preston filed for divorce. His family's empire was crumbling. They needed a wife who could bring financial connections. Belle wasn't enough for them either. Last week, I saw her Instagram. She was wearing a Greenfield Hardware work shirt, helping a customer caption back to basics. Belle Learned what I already knew. You teach people how to treat you. I just decided what was important to me.

Then she asked me how she looked. I was speechless. And she took that as a compliment, leaning down to plant a kiss to my cheek that I barely felt. Then she was gone. I spent the rest of the evening getting the kids to bed and waiting for my wife to get home. As I sat on the couch and put on something on Netflix, I didn't see what was on the screen. Everything was a blur to me. I felt like I was on the outside looking in. None of this felt real. But then my wife stumbled through the front door, giggling loudly and obviously drunk. And on her arm was someone I never thought would betray me like this, my best friend, James. He spotted me and paled slightly before forcing a grin on his face. Hey, you're up, he said casually. I glared at him. What are you doing here, I demanded. He swallowed hard. I honestly thought you were going to be asleep, he said. Janie told me that you didn't care about this. I opened my mouth and closed it several times, unable to get a word out. Then something in me clicked and I realized what was going on. I glanced between them. There was no remorse on Janey's face, only a smirk, while James looked scared. How long, I asked quietly. James jerked in surprise. How long? What? He questioned. I glanced at Janey for a moment before returning my attention to James. How long have you been together? Behind my back, James laughed before his laughter died when Janey elbowed him hard in the side. He knows she spat. Don't try to deny it, James. Tell him the truth, that we fell in love. I couldn't look at her. If I did, I would lose it, so I kept my gaze trained on my best friend. James sighed. I'm sorry, man, he said quietly. She kept saying she was going to ask you for a divorce, wants to be with me. Something in me died when he said that. I felt cold inside. As I finally turned to Janie, seeing nothing but coldness in her eyes, I nodded slowly as calm suddenly washed over me. Fine, I said. You'll get your divorce, but this is my house with my name on it. You can leave out the front door. Janey stared at me with wide eyes. What about the kids, she demanded. I shrugged. The kids stay with me, I said, and I won't let you take them from me. Janey sneered at me as she turned and stormed toward the front door. She glanced back at me once. See you in court, she snarled. Then she was gone. And James was right behind her.

An officer Took my statement while Julie slept in my arms. She passed out the second the Siren stopped. Like her body finally let go. The officer told me what they knew. Barbara and Kevin divorced two years ago. Custody battle she won. He didn't accept it. Started stalking her. Showing up at her work, her apartment, Julie's daycare. Three restraining orders, three violations. Every time, he was out within days. Two months ago, he put Barbara in the hospital. Broken ribs, fractured eye socket. She took Julie and disappeared. Changed her name, moved four times. Tonight, he found her again. She saw a stranger working in his garage and made a choice. Leave Julie with someone who might protect her, then drive until he followed. The officer paused. She called 9 1 1 from a rest stop 40 miles away. She's okay. Already heading back, asking about her daughter. I looked down at Julie, still asleep, still holding my shirt. Can I take her to her mom? Three hours later, I carried Julie into a hospital room. Barbara saw us and couldn't speak. Just reached out with both arms. I place Julie next to her. The little girl woke up, saw her mother and said, Mommy. One word. But Barbara cried like it was a whole conversation. She looked at me through tears. Thank you. I just nodded. Didn't trust my voice.

He looked at me with those tired eyes. She said, you were different. She said you were the only person who was ever kind to her without wanting something back. He pulled a letter from his pocket. She wrote this for you, made me promise to deliver it in person. I unfolded the letter. The paper was creased in all directions like it had been read and refolded a dozen times. Her handwriting made my chest ache. Same loopy letters from the notes she passed me in homeroom. Dear Trevor, I know this isn't fair, showing up after 20 years with something this big, but I'm out of options and out of time. She told me about her life, the good parts and the bad, marrying young, having her son Luke, being happy for a while. Then how everything came crashing down when her husband, Richard died in a car accident. She spent 10 years doing everything alone, struggling to get by. Then it all got worse when the diagnosis came and the slow realization she wasn't going to win this fight settled. I've spent six months trying to find someone to take care of Luke when I'm gone. My family is gone. Richard's parents haven't spoken to me since the funeral. I called every Friend I ever had. Most didn't answer. The ones who did had reasons they couldn't help. I don't blame them. It's a lot to ask. I turn the page. You're the last option I have. I saved you for last on purpose, because if you say no, I don't know what I'm going to tell my son. The next part made me stop breathing. I know it's crazy to ask this. We were kids. It was 20 years ago. But you were good to me, Trevor, really good. And I need to believe that still means something. That boy who walked me home every night, even though it was out of his way, grew up to be a man who would help a kid with nowhere else to go. I put the letter down. Luke was staring at his shoes, waiting for the verdict. I looked up at him. How many people really said no? 16. She wasn't exaggerating. Sixteen people turned away a dying woman's son. I was No. 17, the only one left. I looked at him, at the suitcase with one wheel, at this kid who rode three buses to knock on a stranger's door. You hungry? He blinked. Yeah, I haven't eaten since this morning. I walked to the kitchen. Guest rooms down the hall. We'll figure out the rest tomorrow. He didn't move. You're letting me stay? I opened the fridge. Yeah, you can stay.

She pointed to the fume hood where an experiment was running. Something bubbling. No ventilation running. The ventilation is off. It's fine. I covered my nose and mouth with my shirt. Whatever was in that hood was getting into the air. Everyone was being poisoned and didn't know it. I grabbed a textbook and smashed the experiment. The beaker shattered. Roger, that was expensive.

The kid was watching me. You recognize her? It wasn't a question. Yeah, I knew her a long time ago. My mind was racing. The kid was 15. We dated 20 years ago. The math didn't work, but my heart was still pounding. He saw how hard I was thinking and shook his head. Relax. Not my dad. She was very clear about that. My dad died when I was 5. Relief hit me first, then confusion. Wait. Then why are you here? Why did she send you to me? He didn't answer. Just stood there holding that suitcase like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Can I come in? I took three buses to get here. I stepped aside. Didn't know what else to do. He sat on the edge of my couch, still gripping his suitcase. I sat across from him and waited. My mom's dying. He said it flat, like he'd said it too many times already. Cancer. She found out two years ago. She's been fighting, but it's not working anymore. Doctors say she has a few weeks left. I didn't know what to say. 20 years of silence and now this. Why didn't she reach out? I would have. I stopped. Would have what? I didn't even know she was sick. She didn't want to be a burden. That's what she always says. He finally let go of the suitcase, set it on the floor. When she knew she wasn't going to make it, she started calling people any

Then I arrived to find locks glued shut, super glue in every keyhole, $400 to fix, plus $500 cancellation fee. Security footage showed Bianca at 3 a. M. Then her biggest mistake. 5 with building management claiming illegal eviction. Forged a sublease showing she paid me $800 monthly. Building management called confused. I showed bank records. She'd never paid anything. Diane's eyes lit up. Forgery, fraud. We're going. Offense. We filed for a restraining order. Judge granted it immediately. 500 feet from studio, no contact except through lawyers. She created a website full of lies, registered it in her own name, easy to trace. Then fake one star reviews, racist photographer stole my deposit. Restraining order. Hearing arrived. Her lawyer argued business dispute. Diane destroyed every claim with bank records, texts where Bianca acknowledged it was my studio. Security footage forged sublease, fake website. Judge asked Bianca, did you create these documents and submit them as authentic? Long pause. I was documenting our verbal agreement. So you forged them. Restraining order extended one year. Pay my legal fees, $8,000. Two weeks later, my landlord called. Your subtenant contacted me. She wants the lease offered 6 months up front. Where did she get that money? She told wealthy clients she was expanding. Her agency needed investors for an established. Raised $30,000 from three people, showing them photos of my studio, promising equity in a business that didn't exist. When those investors googled the address and found my website, they called me. Three very angry investors. Criminal fraud. Bianca was arrested at her office in front of co workers. Fraud and violating restraining order. She a bail but her PR firm fired her. Yesterday, I arrived to find her standing outside exactly 500 feet away holding a sign. This business was built on lies and theft. I went inside and taped some into the glass door. The restraining order, fraud charges, arrest record and a Q R code linking to a website documenting everything. Court documents, security footage, her texts. The truth about Bianca Torres. Scan for court documents. People walking by started scanning, reading, looking at her with disgust. One person, her fashion client scanned, read, looked at Bianca and walked away. Pulling out her phone, Bianca's face went from smug to panicked. She grabbed her sign and ran to her car.

Tiara's mom called my mom at 4:00am. My mom recorded the whole thing. Her mom said, your son needs to accept responsibility. My mom asked for what? He's been deployed eight months. Tiara's mom replied, for abandoning tiara. She had needs. The baby needs support from its real father, Derek. But Evan makes more money. Military pays. Well, Derek's between jobs. Between jobs. This dude's been unemployed the whole time. Then came the legal threats. Some sketchy lawyer emailed my military account demanding monthly support payments.

And he started calling me that because I organized everything like a boss wife would. You're being paranoid. But it kept happening. She'd laugh at his messages during our movie nights, typing back furiously while I felt like an afterthought. Then came the social media posts. Photos captioned work wifey duties with my favorite collaborator. Her friends commented, you two are couple goals. And she never corrected them for context.

Jake's so spontaneous. We could use more of that energy. Or, why can't you be more fun? All you do is code and chill. Then I overheard her phone call with her sister. Alex is great, but Jake just gets me. Calling me wifey is our thing. It's harmless fun. Everything exploded one Friday. Evening. Emily was pacing the living room, expression smug, like she'd rehearsed this. We need to talk, Alex. This. Us. It's not working anymore. You're stable, sure, but I need more excitement. Jake and I have gotten close. Really close. My heart sank. Close how? Don't play dumb. The wifey thing. It's more than a joke now. We've been seeing each other for two months. He makes me feel alive. With you, it's just routine. Comfortable, but boring. I deserve someone who challenges me. The cruelty hit like a wave, dismissing everything I've done. So you're choosing him? She nodded, smirking. Yeah. And honestly, it's for the best. Find someone who's okay with your predictable vibe. Jake's taking me on a weekend trip next month. Spontaneous, you know, something you'd never do. I moved here for you, supported you through unemployment, paid for everything. And this is how you repay that? She waved dismissively. Don't make this about money. That's not love, that's obligation. Jake does.

You ever wonder why every time you mention me, it comes with an insult? I look around, y'all can't say my name without laughing. Mom goes, let's not do this tonight. I nod. Exactly. Let's not.

A production company wants me to design pieces for a high end wedding being filmed for a lifestyle channel. Vintage, romantic aesthetic, custom furniture, full credit. Guess the venue. Morgan's wedding. I say yes. I build two centerpiece tables, a vintage green velvet love seat and matching podiums. I pour weeks into it. Carve everything by hand, reupholster the love seat to perfection. No one knows. Not Morgan, not my mom, not a soul. Old day of the wedding, I show up early with the crew name tag On Marshall Blake. They set up my work all over the venue. Everyone's complimenting the vibe. Guests are taking selfies on the love seat. Planner asks for my card. Then Morgan walks in, sees the love seat, then the sign designed by Marshall Blake. Her smile disappears. She corners me. What is this? I blink. Furniture? You plan this? Didn't even know it was your wedding till the venue sent me the brief. But I accepted. Why wouldn't I? You're sabotaging me. I laugh. Nah, I'm finally getting credit. You should have said something. Oh, like how you warned me before dragging me in front of your boyfriend and calling me pathetic? She's quiet. I lean in. You wanted me invisible, but now everyone's posing on something you called trash. The wedding planner already booked me for two more events. A card, too. I walk away while her guests literally take group photos on my love seat. The episode airs two months later. My phone blows up. Clients, brands, interviews. That green velvet couch. Insta viral. Even got reposted by a celebrity design blogger. Morgan's wedding trended for my work. Mom tried to call, left a voicemail. We saw the episode. Would have been nice to be included. I deleted it. Morgan sent a housewarming invite. Trash. They wanted me quiet. Now I'm louder than ever without saying a word.

I started crying. Not the pretty movie crying. The ugly, snotty, can't breathe kind. Alex kept trying to hug me and explain, but I couldn't stand to let him touch me. He swore nothing physical had happened yet. Yet like that made it better. He said he was confused about his feelings and didn't know what to do. He said he loved me, but also had feelings for her. I asked him why he married me if he wasn't sure. He said he thought it would make the feeling things for Michelle go away. He thought once we were married, he'd stop thinking about her. That's when I completely lost it. I threw his phone across the room. It hit the wall and the screen cracked. Alex started yelling at me about breaking his stuff as if that was the problem here. I went into the bathroom and locked the door. I needed to think. We were stuck in Hawaii for three more days. I couldn't change our flights without paying a fortune we didn't have. But I also couldn't pretend everything was fine. I stayed in that bathroom for two hours. Alex kept knocking and apologizing through the door. He said he would cut contact with Michelle. He said he wanted to work on our marriage. But all I could think about was how he'd been texting another woman while I was walking down the aisle. When I finally came Out. I told him I was leaving. Not the resort, the marriage. Alex started crying and begging me to give him another chance. He said it was just cold feet and he'd made a huge mistake. But it wasn't just cold feet. He'd been emotionally cheating for months. Our entire engagement was a lie. While I was planning our future, he was planning his escape. I called my sister from the hotel lobby. She immediately offered to buy me a plane ticket home. Alex followed me downstairs and made a scene in front of everyone. He was crying and asking me not to give up on us. The hotel staff had to ask him to keep it down because he was disturbing other guests. That's when it really hit me. This was my life now. Public humiliation on what was supposed to be the happiest week of my life. I left that night, flew home in my vacation clothes with nothing but my purse and phone. Alex stayed for the rest of the trip alone. He texted me constantly, said sending pictures of the sunset and saying how beautiful it was. Like I cared. When he got home, he moved in with his parents. I filed for an annulment two weeks later. Apparently, Michelle decided she didn't want him after all once she found out what he'd done.

My world revolves around one person. My son, Milo. He's 7, with big, curious eyes and a smile that lights up everything. Since his mother left when he was 2, I've raised him alone, working as a logistics manager to give him everything he needs. That little boy is my entire world. But my family has always been a burden. My parents and younger sister Stacy have blatant favoritism for her. Stacy is 25, doesn't work and expect everything handed to her. For two years, I've been paying her fashion design tuition because my parents begged me. She's never shown gratitude. This year, I wanted Milo's seventh birthday to be special. I saved for months and spent $5,000 on the best party. Luxury hall, pool, playground, three tier superhero cake, Spider Man entertainer. Everything planned perfectly. Two days before, my boss called me in. Important meeting Saturday. You can't miss it. Saturday was Milo's birthday. I tried negotiating, but he was firm. Non negotiable. I called my parents. Take Milo to the venue, make sure everything's perfect. I'll arrive halfway through. Don't worry, son, we'll take care of it. Big mistake. The meeting was a disaster. I couldn't concentrate. Thinking about Milo, laughing, With his friends. When it ended, I rushed to the venue. As I approached, something stopped me. The music wasn't cheerful children's songs. It was electronic club music with deep bass that made the ground vibrate. I pushed open the door. The hall was decorated perfectly. Balloons, streamers, superhero tablecloths, Spider Man cake. But there were no children, no laughter. Instead, adults filled the space. Men in open shirts, women in tight dresses, all drinking cocktails and dancing. The pool had young people splashing and shouting. Then I saw her center stage in a shiny silver dress. With Stacy dancing, surrounded by her friends, recording videos. My parents stood beside the stage, smiling. I pushed through the crowd. What's going on? My mom looked at me. Smile, not wavering. We're celebrating Stacy's birthday. It's next week, but we decided to use the hall. Look how much fun she's having! Stacy's birthday in the hall I paid $5,000 for. For my son. My blood ran cold. What

So my older brother Matt, has these two German shepherds that are basically the size of small horses. When he moved in with us temporarily after his divorce, he brought both dogs, and our house turned into complete chaos. These dogs jump over everything, knock stuff down, and somehow always end up in rooms they're not supposed to be in. My mom has this expensive Persian rug in the living room that she got from her grandmother, and she was freaking out about the dogs ruining it. So we put up this baby gate to keep them in the kitchen area during the day. Simple solution, right? Wrong. Matt would come home from work, walk through the gate, and just leave it wide open. Every single time. The dogs would immediately sprint into the living room, jump on the couch, and leave muddy paw prints everywhere. My mom would yell at him, he'd apologize, promise to remember next time, and then do the exact same thing the next day. This went on for, like, three weeks. My mom was getting more stressed every day cleaning up after these giant dogs. She'd vacuum the rug twice a day and still find dog hair embedded in it. Matt kept saying he'd remember, but he'd walk in the door after work, focused on checking his phone or grabbing a beer, and just completely forget about closing the gate. One Day I was at Home Depot getting stuff for a project when I saw this motion sensor alarm in the security section. It was one of those cheap ones that goes off when someone walks past it. I got an idea. I set it up right next to the baby gate, positioned so it would trigger whenever someone walked through without closing it behind them. The alarm was loud enough to wake the dead. I'm talking like fire truck Siren loud. The first day I installed it, Matt came home around six PM like usual. I heard him walk through the gate and exactly 10 seconds later this ear piercing alarm started blaring. The dog started barking, my mom came running from upstairs thinking someone was breaking in, and Matt was standing there looking confused as hell. I explain.

Alex and I had been together for four years. We talked about marriage, kids, the whole thing. I thought I knew everything about him. He was the guy who remembered my coffee order, who picked me up from work when my car broke down, who made me laugh when I was stressed about finals. The wedding was perfect. My dress, the flowers, even the weather cooperated. Everyone kept saying we looked so happy together. And we were. At least I thought we were. We flew to Hawaii for our honeymoon, five days at this fancy resort in Maui. Alex had saved up for months to pay for it. He kept talking about how it was going to be the best week of our lives. The first day was amazing. We walked on the beach, went snorkeling, had dinner at this restaurant overlooking the ocean. Alex seemed a little distracted during dinner, but I figured he was just tired from traveling. On day 2, things got weird. I woke up and Alex was already dressed, sitting on the balcony making phone calls. When I, I asked who he was talking to, he said work stuff. But it was Sunday and we were on our honeymoon. Then he spent the entire day on his phone at the pool during lunch, even when we were supposed to be getting couples massages. The massage therapist kept having to ask him to put his phone away. That night, I Confronted him. I said this was supposed to be about us, about starting our marriage, right? He got defensive and said I was being clingy, clingy on our honeymoon. Day 3 was when I found out what was really going on. Alex left his phone charging in the bathroom while he went to get ice. A text popped up from someone named Michelle. Can't wait to see you when you get back. This week is going to drag on forever. My stomach dropped. I scrolled up and saw months of messages. They've been talking every single day, flirting, making plans. There were photos she'd sent him, photos I definitely shouldn't have seen. When Alex came back, I was sitting on the bed holding his phone, saw my face and immediately started making excuses. Michelle was just a friend from work. It wasn't what it looked like. He would never cheat on me. But then I kept reading. There were messages from the night before our wedding while I was home doing last minute preparations. He was texting her about how excited he was to see her again. He told her our honeymoon.

So when she handed me those divorce papers, thinking she was taking half of everything, she was actually claiming assets that were never hers. I pulled out my pen and signed right there at the table, page after page, the scratch of ink the only sound in that silent restaurant. Her expression shifted with every stroke. She'd expected, begging, fighting, a scene she could use against me. When I finished, I slid the papers back. Congratulations on passing the bar and on your divorce. That's it.

She moved in with roommates, working 80 hour weeks for barely more money than I've been making, staring down six figures of student debt she'd expected us to tackle together. Meanwhile, I bought a small house in San Francisco and met someone who actually chose me when she had options. For months, she tried everything to find me, different phone numbers, showing up at my workplace, hiring a private investigator. Stalking my family, I stayed silent. Finally, she tracked me down at Home Depot while I was loading lumber. She looked wrecked, dark circles, thinner, desperate. Please, she said. I made a mistake. The hours, the debt, it's too much. I gave up the best thing in my life. When you thought you'd be rich and successful, you tossed me aside. I said, now that you're broken, tired, suddenly I'm the best thing you ever had. What can I do to prove I've changed? Nothing. I'm not the guy you discarded. That guy is gone. So there's really no chance I'm engaged, I said to someone who chose me when she had options. Her face went pale. I climbed into my truck and drove off, leaving her standing in that parking lot with nothing.

She always said, once I pass the bar, everything will be different. We'll finally have our life together. During her final year, something shifted. She stopped saying our future and started saying my career. When I'd mention taking a vacation when she graduated, she'd barely look up. That's not a priority for me right now. My career is what matters. Bills would sit unopened on the counter. Dishes piled up because she needed every hour for bar prep. Anytime I mentioned our future together, she'd dismiss it with, we'll talk about that once I'm established. I told myself it was just stress, just the pressure of the biggest test of her life. I convinced myself that once she had her license, she'd go back to being the person I married. The night her bar results came out, she screamed when she saw she'd passed. Not we made it, just I passed. Still, I lifted her off the ground, told her I was proud because that's what you do when you believe you're a team. Her classmates organized a Celebration dinner at a trendy downtown restaurant. I Put on my best shirt, ready to celebrate alongside my new lawyer wife. The atmosphere was electric. Parents bragging, friends toasting, people clinking glasses. I sat there smiling, thinking this was finally our moment after eight years of sacrifice. Then during dessert, she slid a vanilla envelope across the table, divorce papers. I looked at her waiting for the joke. Her face was calm, cool, old, rehearsed. I already signed my part, she said. All you need to do is finish it. I don't need you anymore. She continued, I have my license. I have job offers. I have a future. You were helpful during school, but that chapter is over. Helpful. Eight years of my life reduced. Helpful. Around us, forks froze midair. Her classmates fell silent. Some looked uncomfortable, but none looked surprised. Here's what she didn't know. I've been preparing for this moment for months. When she started dismissing our future, I quietly moved my belongings to a storage unit. My record collection, my tools, my grandmother's China. I opened a separate bank.

I taught Rachel the code when she was 6 years old. We called it our special language and used it so she could signal me if she ever felt unsafe around adults or needed help without making a scene. Garden party meant danger. Visiting grandma meant help me. Baking bread meant I'm scared. We used it throughout her childhood, mostly for innocent things like getting her out of boring playdates or signalling when she wanted to leave somewhere. By the time she was in college, we'd stopped using it completely. When Rachel got married to Derek three years ago, I was thrilled. He seemed perfect, successful, charming, completely devoted to her. But six months after the wedding, I started getting strange texts from Rachel. Hey, mom. Derek and I have decided we need some space to work on our marriage. We're taking some time away from family and friends to focus on each other. Please don't worry about me or try to visit. This is what we both want. Something felt wrong immediately. Rachel and I talked every single day. She would never just cut me off like that. And the phrasing was weird. Rachel didn't talk like that. The text kept coming over the next few weeks. I know you're probably hurt, but this is really important for our relationship. Derek has been helping me see that I was too dependent on you and I need To grow up working through some things together. That made my blood boil because Rachel was the most independent person I knew. Then the messages started, including our old code. We've been going to lots of garden parties lately and meeting Derek's colleagues. Garden party meant danger. I read it again, my hands shaking. The next text said, I'm thinking about visiting grandma soon, maybe next month. Visiting grandma meant help me. I started going through every text she'd sent me. Derek's mother taught me how to bake bread and I've been practicing everyday. Baking bread meant I'm scared. My daughter was being held by her husband and she was using our childhood code to tell me. I tried calling her, but Derek answered her phone. Rachel's resting right now. She asked me to handle her calls because she's been overwhelmed. I'll tell her you reached out. I asked when I could see her and he said they needed more time. I kept texting Rachel, trying to subtly let her know I understood, but I wasn't sure my messages were getting through. Then at 4 in the morning, I got a text that made my heart stop. Mom, I'm doing so much better now. I went to a garden party yesterday, spent the morning visiting.

So I called the cops right in front of him. When I told them his secret, he started begging me to hang up. I'm a straight A student who works 20 hours a week at a grocery store. I pay for my own phone, clothes, car insurance, and I do most of the chores around the house. Laundry, cooking dinner three nights a week, yard work. I'm basically the most responsible person here. Life's perfect until my mom starts dating this guy lowly, about. About a year ago. When he moves in six months ago, everything changes. Loli doesn't have a job, but he always has cash. Just stays home all day doing nothing. My mom warns me months ago to never go in the basement because it's Loli's private workspace. I don't ask questions. I just stay out of his way. But staying out of his way isn't enough. Loli starts making these insane rules. What I can eat from the fridge, when I'm allowed to shower, who I can have over. Every time I complain to my mom, she just sighs and says, he's trying to be a father figure. Stop making this difficult. Then lowly starts demanding I do his chores on top of mine. His laundry, his dishes, washing his car. When I tell my mom it's not fair, she snaps at me, don't disrespect him in his own House. His house. This is my mom's house. Before he even shows up, I try standing up to him. Once, when I catch him going through my room, he gets right in my face and says, nothing in this house belongs to you. My mom walks in, hears the whole thing, and tells me to apologize to him. I should have known then that things won't get better. I should have just kept my head down. One evening, lowly walks into the living room where I'm doing homework. Hey, let me borrow $20. I look up from my calculus textbook. No, you never pay me back. His face changes. What did you just say to me? I get this sick feeling in my gut, but I hold my ground. I said, no. You've borrowed money from me, like, five times and never paid it back once. Lowly stands up slowly. When I ask you for something, you give it to me. Understand? He walks out. I think it's over. I go back to my homework, then head to my room. Two minutes later, my door flies open. Lowly standing there holding a baseball bat. Lowly, what are you. He swings. The monitor explodes in a shower of glass and plastic. I jump up, try to grab the bat, but he shoves me to the ground. You should give me money. Whenever I ask for it, he smashes the tower, the keyboard, the mouse. This is my house! I'd spent six Months saving for that PC. Built it myself. Over $2,000 in parts gone in seconds. My mom rushes in.

The Japanese team started discussing their concerns about the merger entirely in Japanese, apparently forgetting anyone from the company was even there, and I mentioned casually that their fears about IP theft were valid given what my girlfriend's boss had said earlier about aggressive expansion, and Mr. Yamaguchi went complete silent, staring at me. Your girlfriend's boss said what exactly? He asked in English loud enough for everyone to hear, and I translated the entire conversation I overheard in the bathroom, where her boss was bragging about how they lowballed the Japanese on the technology transfer. Once signatures were locked in, the entire table went silent and my girlfriend's face drained of colour as the lead German executive demanded to know if this was true, and the French team started packing up their briefcases, they don't do business with companies that negotiate in bad faith. My girlfriend tried to do damage control, saying I must have misunderstood, but Mister Yamaguchi asked her Point Blank if she thought he was stupid enough to fall for that when her boyfriend clearly speaks better Japanese than their own interpreters. Her boss came over to see what the commotion was about, and the German team started laying into him in English about trust and transparency, while my girlfriend kept shooting Me? These venomous looks like this was somehow my fault for understanding what people say when they assume nobody can understand them. Dinner ended with both international teams walking out and refusing to sign anything, while my girlfriend's boss turned to me and asked if I'd be interested in heading their new international relations division, since I just saved them from a lawsuit, even if the deal fell through. And my girlfriend actually laughed, saying I wasn't qualified just because I spoke a few languages. Sir Yamaguchi turned to her and said in perfect English that she was everything wrong with American business culture, and that my language skills were worth more than her MBA, at least I understood that communication isn't just about words, but about respect. And then he handed me his business card, saying his company needed a liaison they could trust if I was interested in relocating to Tokyo.

You're being petty. I laughed, actually laughed. Teddy Dad, she gave me a diet book for Christmas when I was 15. She told me I'd never find a husband if I didn't lose weight. She missed every single important moment of my life and celebrated all of his. Where was she when I graduated college, when I got my first job, when I bought my house? She, she's old and she's hurting. And I'm her granddaughter who she pretended didn't exist. Because I wasn't born with a penis, I don't owe her anything. He was quiet. Then his voice got hard. Fine, be selfish, but don't come crying to me when you regret this. He hung up. An hour later, my brother texted, really? You can't just be the bigger person? Dad's freaking out. I typed back, being the bigger person is for people who made small mistakes. Grandma spent two decades making a choice every single day. Now I'm making mine. She's family. No, she's dad's mom. She never treated me like family. I'm just returning the energy. He didn't respond. That night, dad called again. This time, my mom was on the line, too. Honey, mom said softly, I know she wasn't good to you. I know that. But she's elderly. And, mom, you cried because of how she treated me. You saw everything. Don't Ask me to help her now. She was quiet. Dad jumped in. Your mother and I raised you better than this. You raised me to have self respect. It's exactly what I'm doing. I haven't heard from him since. Grandma hasn't called either. My brother sent one more text saying I was breaking Dad's heart, but I didn't reply. Yesterday, my cousin, one of the other granddaughters grandma ignored, called me. She'd heard about the situation. Good for you, she said. I wish I had the spine to say no. When she asked me for help last year, that's when I realized this woman spent decades making girls feel worthless. And now she's shocked we won't drop everything to serve her. I'm sleeping just fine.

I passed the girl and a few of her friends in the hallway on my way to the bathroom. The girl looked directly at my chest, then looked at her friends, and they all started giggling. I just kept walking, but I was pissed. Then yesterday, the entire dorm got an email from our RA. It said she'd received some anonymous complaints about people not dressing appropriately in the hallways. Asked everyone to please make sure they're keeping things covered up. I knew exactly who submitted that complaint. This girl had literally gone to the RA and complained about me not wearing a bra in my own dorm. I was done being nice about it. I remembered from orientation that the girl's boyfriend doesn't actually go to school here. He goes to some other college, like, an hour away. I also remembered that because of the pandemic, our dorm has a rule that we're not allowed to have non student guests this year. Only students from our school and family members are allowed in the building. And on top of that, everyone has to wear a mask in the hallways, which is a rule that barely anyone follows, but it's still technically a rule. So I went to the same anonymous complaint form that the girl had obviously used. I submitted A complaint? I said I noticed people bringing their off campus boyfriends into the dorm and that these guests weren't wearing masks in the hallways. I kept it vague, didn't mention any names, just like she did with hers. This morning we all got another email from the R A. It said that due to anonymous complaints, they'd be enforcing the no off campus guests rule. From now on, anyone bringing a guest into the building would have to show their student ID at the front desk to prove they actually go to school here, and masks would be enforced in the hallways. I saw the girl in the hallway later that day, and she looked mad. She was on the phone with someone, probably her boyfriend, saying something like, I don't know. They're checking IDS now. You can't come over anymore.

She'd even hired the same florist and picked similar flowers. When I confronted her, she just laughed and said great minds think alike and that she'd always dreamed of having her wedding there, too. She claimed it was just a coincidence, but I knew better. She'd literally copied my entire wedding and scheduled it right before mine so everyone would be broke and tired by the time my day came around. The worst part was how my family reacted.

I was furious. Emma had stolen my vendors, my venue, and now she wanted me to be in her copycat wedding while she completely overshadowed mine. Ben was ready to drive down there and give her a piece of his mind, but I had a better idea. I called the venue and photographer and told them what happened. Turns out Emma had name dropped me to get better deals, claiming we were planning sister weddings together. The venue manager was horrified and immediately canceled Emma's booking, since she lied about having my permission to use My vendor relationships. When the photographer found out Emma had basically stolen his services from another bride, he backed out, too. Within 24 hours, Emma as entire wedding fell apart because no decent vendor wanted to work with someone who'd scam another bride. Her boyfriend broke up with her a week later. Apparently, he'd been uncomfortable with how obsessed she was with copying my wedding. And when everything fell apart, he realized she cared more about the party than actually marrying him.

We dated all through high school and honestly, it felt like we had our whole lives planned out. Everyone called us the perfect couple. Her parents loved me. My parents adored her. It was the kind of relationship that made you believe in soulmates. Then graduation happened. She told me she needed to move to the capital city with her sister to attend college. I was staying back in our province for university. I told her we'd make it work, that distance didn't matter when you loved someone. She agreed. And for the first few months, we talk every single day. On our fourth anniversary, she called me and said something I'll never forget. No matter what happens, wait for me. I promise I'll come back. I told her I would wait forever if I had to. Then just like that, she disappeared. Her phone number stopped working. Her social media accounts went completely dark. I thought something terrible had happened to her. So I tried reaching out to her. Friends and family. That's when I discovered she had new accounts, not ones that included me. She had ghosted me, completely cut me out of her life without a single word of explanation. I was absolutely broken. For weeks, I couldn't eat properly. My grades started slipping.

When she walked in, she looked almost exactly like I remembered. Same smile, same eyes. For a moment, it felt surreal, like I traveled back in time. She sat down and immediately started talking about the good old days, laughing about inside jokes I'd long forgotten. She talked about how much she missed our connection, how she'd been thinking about me all these years. Then her eyes drifted down to my left hand. She saw my wedding ring. Her entire expression changed. The smile vanished. She looked at me like I just betrayed her. You're married? She said, her voice sharp. You have a wife? I nodded slowly. Yeah, I've been married for eight years. We have a daughter. She stared at me in disbelief. Then her face twisted with anger. But you promised you'd wait for me. You said you'd wait forever. How could you just move on like that? I could believe what I was hearing. You ghosted me, I said, trying to stay calm. You disappeared for 10 years. You sent me A letter saying you wanted to move on. What did you expect me to do? She shook her head, visibly upset. I thought you'd wait. I thought when I was ready, you'd still be there. You lied to me. I just sat there, completely stunned. This woman had vanished from my life without a trace, ignored all my attempts to read. And now she was calling me a liar for not staying single for a decade. I stood up, put some money on the table, and looked at her one last time. I did wait, I said quietly. I waited for you to at least give me an explanation. You never did. I moved on because you told me to. Then I walked out and drove home to my wife and daughter. Some people really do live in their own reality.

From that point on, I had zero contact with my family. At first, it was incredibly tough. I felt abandoned, angry, betrayed. But slowly, with my aunt and her husband's support, I started to heal. They showed me what real family looked like. I transferred to a different high school, made genuine friends who actually showed up to my archery tournaments. I went to university and graduated as an electrical engineer. Built a completely new life from scratch. A few years after college, I met my wife. She. He's incredible, supportive, caring. Everything my family never was. When we got married, I briefly considered inviting them, but decided against it. I didn't want any drama on what should have been the happiest day of my life. My wife and I bought a house about an hour away from my aunt so we could stay close. Last year, we were blessed with our daughter. Now my wife is two months pregnant with our second child. Life has been genuinely good, peaceful, drama free for years. Then about a week ago, I received a Facebook message that threw me completely. It was from my mother and father. They said they wanted to reconnect, wanted me to come spend Christmas at their house. Just like that, after eight years of complete silence. I told them I'd consider it, that I possibly had other plans, but would give them an answer soon. A few days later, both Michael and Sarah sent me friend requests on Facebook. It felt calculated, like they coordinated this whole approach together. My wife told me that if I decide to go, she and our daughter will spend Christmas at her parents house instead. She's not subjecting herself or our daughter to that stress while pregnant, and I completely support her decision. I'm torn. Part of me wonders if they genuinely feel bad. Maybe they've had eight years to reflect, to realize how badly they treated me growing up. Maybe they want to apologize and actually make things right after all this time. But another part of me, the part that remembers being ignored for years, that remembers being shipped off after my own brother betrayed me in the worst way, thinks this might be a setup. What if I show up and they expect me to apologize to Casey? What if they want me to say I was wrong for punching him? Wrong for being angry? What if they're not actually sorry at all and just want to clear their own guilt? Should I go?

The second I walked in, her dad pulled me into a hug and said, we're so glad you're here, son. Her mom had made extra food and kept asking if I wanted seconds. Her little brother challenged me to video games. Her grandma kept calling me dear and making sure I had enough pie. They treated me like I'd always been part of the family. We played board games. We watched Christmas movies. Her dad told embarrassing stories about Zoe. Her mom showed me photo albums. I helped her brother set up his new gaming console. It felt easy, natural, like I actually belonged. Meanwhile, my phone started blowing up. Around noon, my mom finally realized I wasn't coming to the where are you? We thought you'd at least stop by. I texted back, I'm with people who actually want me around. That set off a chain reaction. My siblings started group messaging, saying I was being dramatic and ruining Christmas. My sister called me selfish for making mom cry. My brother said I was acting like a child. My dad sent a long text about how I was tearing the family apart over one mistake and I, I should be ashamed. One mistake. As if forgetting to invite their own son to Christmas was just an oops. As if 29 years of making me feel like an inconvenience could be summed up as one mistake. I turned my phone off and went back to Zoe's family. Table. We were passing dishes and laughing at inside jokes they were already including me in. And I realized something. This is what it's supposed to feel like. Being wanted isn't selfish. Being included shouldn't be something I have to beg for. Later that evening, Zoe's dad asked me to help him with something in the garage. While we were out there, he stopped and looked at me. You know, son, he said, families are the people who show up for you. Blood just means you started in the same place. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for choosing people who choose you back. I almost cried right there. This man who barely knew me had given me more validation in one day than my own father had in 29 years. My family is still mad. They're saying I'm being ungrateful and overdramatic, that I'm punishing them for one oversight. But it wasn't one oversight. It was a lifetime of being forgotten. Best Christmas I ever had.

Growing up as the black sheep in an athletic family was brutal. My dad was a star basketball player for a D2 school. My mom played competitive volleyball. Michael dominated in soccer, Sarah crushed it in softball, and Casey was the star running back. Everyone in town knew about me. I chose archery. To them, it wasn't a real sport. They called it Wimpy. Said I was just standing around shooting arrows. Between the ages of 14 and 16, I competed in about 20 different archery tournaments. Some were regional, others were state level. I placed in most of them, even won several. My parents showed up to exactly one tournament during those entire two years. Meanwhile, they never missed any of my siblings games. They drive three hours for Casey's football games, arrange their schedules for Sarah's softball tournaments, take time off work for Michael's soccer matches. But my competitions? Always an excuse. I wasn't neglected in the traditional sense. I had food, clothes, shelter. But emotionally, I was invisible. Every time I brought it up, they called me dramatic, an attention seeker, said I was ungrateful. The resentment built for years. When I was 15, I started dating Amy. She was sweet, funny, understood me in ways my family never did. After about seven months, I introduced her to my family. They loved her, especially Casey. I genuinely Thought I had a future with her. We talked about college together, building a life. Almost two years later, one of Amy's ex friends approached me at school. She looked uncomfortable, but told me Amy had been cheating on me for several months. I demanded to know who. She hesitated and finally told me. My twin brother, Casey. I confronted Amy that same day. She didn't even try to deny it. She told me that while she loved me at first, what she felt for Casey was completely different. Strong the connection. They had surpassed anything she'd ever felt for me. Like I was just practice before finding the real thing. That evening, I found Casey in his room, playing video games like nothing had happened. Years of being overlooked. Years of watching them celebrate him while ignoring me. It all exploded in that moment. I walked straight up to him and sucker punched him. He dropped. Not out cold. I shouldn't have gotten violent, I know that. But something inside me snapped. After years of resentment, and then this ultimate betrayal. My parents were furious. They threatened to press criminal charges. Since I was 17, I could have been tried as an adult and face jail time. Their deal was simple. Move out immediately and live with my estranged aunt two hours away, or face court.

I watched it go through my paper shredder strip by strip. What I didn't expect was my grandmother. She appeared at my apartment six weeks later, frail and very sick with cancer. I came to apologize for watching them destroy you and saying nothing. Your father was cruel in subtle ways I excused. Your mother was worse. I watched them make you smaller. Year after year. She changed her will. Everything, the house, the savings, 50 years of assets went to me. Let me do this one thing right. She died weeks later. The will reading was explosive. Dad stood so fast he knocked over his chair. Miranda burst into angry tears. The letter attached explained Raymond built his fortune on fraud. Miranda has been given everything and produced nothing. Rena built her success through sacrifice, receiving nothing but obstacles. She deserves this. They do not. Dad sued immediately, claiming undue influence. My lawyer produced evidence, Instagram post time stamped during my surgery. Medical records showing emergency contacts ignored, phone logs of 75 unanswered calls, texts begging for help with fraud. The judge's ruling was scathing. He noted a pattern of emotional neglect and exploitation. Dad was ordered to pay my legal fees. His criminal trial came next. Federal prosecutors pushed for 20 years. He was convicted on all counts, 12 years in federal prison. Mom filed for divorce six months later when she discovered he'd been hiding money in offshore accounts. I didn't destroy my family. I just stopped saving them. My residency thrived. I made real friends, adopted a grumpy cat named Winston, started therapy. Doctor Langston helped me understand I wasn't crazy. I've been the family scapegoat my entire life. Two years later, dad wrote from prison, I'm sorry I never told you I was proud of you. I'm sorry I compared you to your sister instead of seeing you. I put the letter in a drawer. Maybe I'll respond someday. Maybe I won't. When people ask if I regret not answering those 75 calls, I tell them the truth. Cutting off my family wasn't cruel. It was doctor's orders.

They never came. Instead, my sister tagged me in a photo. Family day without the drama. I said nothing. Days later, still weak and hooked to machines, I saw 75 missed calls and a text from dad, we need you. Answer immediately. Without thinking twice, I deleted every single one. The nurse adjusting my IV saw my face. Family troubles. I nodded. Three days in the hospital with a life threatening arrhythmia, and my family had gone to dinner instead. They knew the hospital had called both my parents while I was in emergency surgery. The Instagram post showed them at our special occasion restaurant. Mom in the pearls I bought her for Mother's Day. Dad with his arm around Miranda. Champagne raised. The caption bragged about celebrating without the drama. I was the drama. Me graduating top of my class. Me matching into one of the most competitive neurosurgery programs in the country. Me lapsing mid ceremony because my heart literally couldn't take the stress anymore. My best friend, Marissa, visited daily. She'd called my mom from the ambulance. She said you were being dramatic and to drink water. Then she hung up and sent me to voicemail three times. But here's what broke me. Marissa saw Miranda in the parking lot during my collapse, just sitting in her BMW, watching paramedics work on me. The moment the ambulance arrived, she drove away. For 26 years, I Bent myself into shapes trying to earn their love. Perfect grades, perfect career, perfect daughter. I memorized every rule of their approval game. I was valedictorian. I chose medicine because dad once mentioned wishing he had a doctor in the family. None of it mattered. They wanted a resource, not a relationship. The call started when Dad's company hit federal investigation. Insurance fraud, tax evasion, wire fraud. He needed my medical expertise to help him lie to investigators about workers compensation claims he'd been fabricating for years. He showed up at my apartment three weeks after my discharge, looking decades older. The company's in trouble. We need you to explain the claims were legitimate. Were they legitimate? His silence answered that. Get out or I'm calling the police. Your mother loses everything if this company goes under. Miranda and Quentin will have to sell their house. Is that what you want? Over some petty grudge about graduation? I closed the door in his face. Miranda sent a handwritten letter on expensive cream stationery. Don't let dad go to

They blamed me for ruining my sister's life in a car crash when I was 17. She destroyed Jane's future. Mom told the crowd, she's dead to us. I stayed quiet, then asked one question that made everyone turn to stare at her instead. Accident happened when I was 17. Jane was 19, home from college. We went to a party and she'd been drinking. She handed me her keys around midnight. I was sober. The designated driver. The intersection was dark. The light was green. A truck ran the red light at 60 miles per hour. The impact shattered Jane's femur, crushed her pelvis, left her with permanent nerve damage. Julliard scholarship disappeared along with her ballet dreams. Nobody asked what color the light was. Nobody asked if I was sober. Mom found Jane's hospital bracelet showing 0.08 blood alcohol and decided I was responsible. You let her drink. You were behind the wheel. The police report said the other driver ran a red light, failed a sobriety test. His blood alcohol was 0, 15, twice the legal limit. He served 18 months for vehicular assault. Mom didn't care. She needed someone to blame, someone she could control. I was 17, scared, desperate for approval, an easy target. Jane screamed at me to get out of her hospital room. Mom told me to stop coming. She convinced me to defer my full scholarship to Michigan State to help with Jane's recovery. One year became three. By the time I enrolled, the scholarship was gone. I paid with loans and part time work. Jane never spoke to me unless forced. She look through me at family dinners like furniture. Mom seated me at the far end of the table, stopped celebrating my birthday, introduced me as the daughter who lives in Michigan to avoid saying my name. 13 years of exile, 13 years of being the ghost they blamed for a drunk driver's crime. When Jane's wedding invitation arrived, I almost threw it away. I went during the 400 dollar navy dress she'd approved. I sat near the kitchen doors, far away from the rest of my family. During dinner, mom stood up. She wasn't scheduled to speak. She looked directly at me. Most of you know Jane overcame a terrible tragedy at 19, an accident that ended her dancing dreams. The room went quiet. What many don't know is who was responsible. My other daughter sitting right there was driving. She destroyed Jane's future. Someone gasped. I invited her because Jane insisted, but she is dead. To us. She has been dead.

Mine just went up $150. My sister groaned when I came back. Same management company though. Something with grandma's Maiden name. Covach Properties. They own like half the buildings downtown. My brother perked up. Wait, Covach Properties? That's our office building. My boss has been trying to meet the owner for three years now. Wants to renegotiate our lease. Good luck with that. My sister laughed. Nobody knows who owns it. They say it's some young tech person who stays completely anonymous. Mom scoffed hard. Probably inherited everything. These kids today think they're geniuses because they got lucky once. My brother was scrolling his phone now. Actually, my boss researched them. The owner started with one building three years ago. Now they have six properties worth over 15 million. 15 million! My sister whispered. Completely anonymous. Only communicates through lawyers and property managers. Mom shook her head in disgust. Making millions while real people work real jobs. It's disgusting. I'd kill to meet them. My sister said, imagine learning from someone that successful. Mom laughed bitterly. Successful? They're probably some spoiled brat who got lucky with computers. Not like people who actually work their whole lives for something. That one hurt my own mother thought What I'd done was shameful. My phone rang right then. Unknown number. I answered. Is this the owner? This is regarding your counter offer on the Riverside property. The room went completely silent. My brother stared at me, mouth open. Did he just say owner? I said quietly into the phone, call me back. Hung up. Everyone was frozen, staring. My brother's face had gone pale. You're the owner? It wasn't a question, I said. Mom froze. My sister counted on her fingers, then gasped. Software. Three years ago. 2.3 million, I said. Started with one building, now six. Mom stammered. But you live in a studio. I looked at my sister. You pay me 18 a month. Then at my brother, your firm pays 9,000. Silence. I kept the studio because Lucia and I were going to live there. Mom blinked. Who's Lucia? My fiance. She died eight months ago. They left without another word.

Mom came in right behind him, went straight to my kitchen table, ran her finger across it, checking for dust, like always. Your sister just made VP at Morgan Hayes. 90,000 at 26. She opened my fridge, shook her head at the takeout containers. Your brother bought his second rental property last month. Meanwhile, you're 28, eating three day old noodles. I just sat. Learned a long time ago that defending myself only made these visits longer. Still doing that computer thing? She asked, making air quotes with her fingers. What? Mom didn't know. Three years ago, I built logistics software that a trucking company bought for 2.3 million. Boring stuff nobody brags about at dinner parties, but trucking companies desperately needed it. I didn't buy a Porsche or some mansion. Instead, I bought a small apartment building through a company I named after Grandma's Maiden name. Kovatch Properties. Then another building, then three more. My sister actually lived in one of my buildings downtown. Paid 18 a month that went straight to my account. She was always posting photos of her rooftop access in doorman hagging to everyone. Had no idea I owned the whole thing. My brother's law firm rented two entire floors in my commercial building on Fifth Street. His corner office that mom loved showing people on Facebook. In my building, I'd literally signed his Lease renewal three weeks ago. After expenses, I cleared about 14,000 monthly from all six properties. My family didn't know any of this. I lived in the studio because I genuinely liked keeping things simple. Also because eight months ago, my fiance Lucia died in a car accident two blocks from here. The studio was the last place we looked at together before she passed. Kept it because leaving felt like erasing her. But my family didn't know about Lucia either. I'd stop telling them things years before that. Next morning, mom called what she labeled a family meeting at my sister's apartment. When I walked in, they were all sitting there waiting like some kind of tribunal. We're worried about you, mom started. You need real guidance. My sister immediately pulled out her phone. My friend Dana needs someone for data entry. 15 an hour, but it's a start. My brother jumped in. He could live with me, sleep on my couch until he saves enough for a deposit somewhere. They talked about me like I was invisible. Community college has night programs, mom suggested. You need structure. A real 9 to 5 job. First he needs income. My sister, I know someone in our building's mail room. 12 an hour, but great benefits. My brother nodded. Maybe we could co sign a car loan so he can actually get to work. They spent 45 minutes planning my minimum wage future. Trade schools came up, GED programs.

Garrett demanded a prenatal paternity test. Melody fought hard, but he threatened to leave. She caved. He called me after. You were right. They're not mine. Sorry, bro. Are they yours? Nope. Got tested weeks ago. Long pause. I don't know what to do. I love her. You love someone who cheated on you while cheating with you? He hung up. But here's the twist. London was married. Reconciled with his ex wife right after the reunion. Melody didn't know until she messaged him about the babies. And his wife responded. The wife, Natasha, called me. We met for coffee. She brought receipts. Literal credit card receipts. Hotel charges, dinner for two, breakfast. He told me he was rooming with his buddy Craig. She said Craig must have loved the romantic dinner. I'm pregnant, too. Four months. We reconciled two weeks after that reunion. Melody showed up at my house that night. Garrett's car nowhere in sight. He left me. Derek, I'm scared. I'm about to have twins and I'm alone. You're not alone. You have your mom and Brendan. Brendan's married. So were you engaged? Stop. Either of you. I need help. You loved me once. I loved who I thought you were. That person doesn't exist. I'll tell everyone you abandoned me while I was pregnant. Tell them how you got pregnant. Cheating on me with a yoga instructor who doesn't exist because The babies are actually your married exes. See how that goes? She started ugly crying. Full on snot bubble sobbing. I messed up everything. Are you happy? I'm neutral. This has nothing to do with me anymore. The twins were born healthy. Two boys. Brendan was forced to come clean. His wife made him get a vasectomy and a postnuptial agreement. He's paying child support, but wants nothing to do with the twin. Garrett tried making it work for a week after they were born. Reality hit when Newborn twins don't care about chakras. He bounced back to his roommates. Melody is living with her mom. She sent me pictures of the twins. They could have been yours. I replied, they never were mine. That's literally the entire point. She tried one last manipulation. I'll tell them their dad abandoned them. Tell them the truth. Their mom couldn't keep track. See how that goes when they're older. She blocked me. The nursery is now my office.

I went alone, sent her a selfie from the Vineyard. Real love means enjoying life without guilt. Her texts explode. Loaded. I finally answered. I'm sorry for flirting with Sergio. I thought real love meant no apologies. I was wrong. Please come home. That's apology one and two. But I don't think you understand yet. When I returned, her stuff was in the guest room. Thought we need space. Well, rents. $800 monthly. First month do. Now you're charging me rent? Real love means contributing equally. Full meltdown. I'm sorry. What more do you want? That's 3 and 4. But sorry doesn't pay rent. She posted on social media about financial abuse. I posted receipts. $47,000 over two years. But asking for an apology for flirting is too much. Real love means never saying sorry. She said, so I'm showing real love by letting her pay her own way. Her post disappeared within an hour. Sergio Dm'd her. She showed me. See? He cares. Great. When are you moving out? She realized her mistake. Apologies 5 through 12 came rapid fire. Week 3, she called at 2:00am claiming she was at the hospital. I called the hospital. No patient by that name. She was at Sergio's. His girlfriend messaged me with screenshots of Valerie begging to move. Then she came Home at six a m. I'm so sorry. For everything. For the flirting, for the lies, for that stupid thing about apologies. I counted 13 through 17. Doesn't change anything. What do you want? Nothing. I want absolutely nothing from you. She broke down completely. I'll do anything. Therapy, whatever you want. You showed me who you are. Someone who flirts, then says real love means no apologies. Actions have consequences. She moved out that weekend. Back to her parents. The lifestyle gone. Sergio blocked her after his girlfriend threatened to leave. One month later. Final text. Sorry for everything. Real love means taking accountability and apologizing when you hurt someone. I'm sorry. I Learned that too late. 22 through 26. 26 apologies total. All it took was removing the safety net and letting her face consequences.

The brothers still weren't speaking. Mom was stressed and snapping at everyone. Grandma kept asking about me, wondering why I didn't visit anymore. Every time I heard that, I told myself they must be checking on her. They cut me out because they wanted to handle things themselves. So they must be handling it. My family was cruel, but they weren't monsters. Someone was visiting her. Someone had to be. The call came on a Tuesday from a number I didn't recognize was Grandma's neighbor and her voice was shaking. She said she'd heard grandma calling for help through the wall and use the emergency key to get inside. She found grandma on the kitchen floor next to a knocked over chair, barely conscious. And based on the food that had been sitting out, she'd been lying there for at least two days. Ambulance was already on the way. I don't remember the drive to the hospital. I just remember running through the halls until a nurse stopped me and told me grandma was being examined and I couldn't see her yet. I asked if she was going to be okay and the nurse said they were still assessing her. And the way she said it made my stomach drop. Two days on the floor. She was 83 years old and she's been lying on her kitchen floor for two days because nobody came. I stood in that hallway. With my back against the wall, barely able to stay upright, and I called my mother. She didn't know. That was the first thing she said, like a reflex. I didn't know. I thought someone was checking on her. I asked her who, who exactly was supposed to be checking on her. She couldn't answer. She just kept repeating that she assumed someone was handling it, like saying it enough times would make it true. I asked her if she understood that grandma might die tonight because nobody remembered she existed. My mom's voice got defensive. So this is my fault. You abandoned her. You knew she needed someone and you walked away to teach us a lesson. I watched a team of nurses rush past me toward another room, and I thought about grandma alone on that cold kitchen floor, calling for help that never came. She was alone for two days. And you want to know where I was? Where were you? The line went silent. I waited for her to say something, anything, but she had nothing. A doctor came through the doors and called my name and I hung up without another word. The doctor told me grandma was dehydrated and had a fractured hip. When I finally got to see her, she looked so small in that bed, but she squeezed my hand and asked where I'd been. I told her I was sorry and I wasn't going anywhere. I visit grandma every Sunday now. Just me and I haven't organized a family event since.

We went to this little Italian place near campus that had decent prices and dim lighting. But something unexpected happened during dinner. Megan started telling me about her veterinary medicine studies and her passion for animals was infectious. She volunteered at a local animal rescue and had these incredible stories about nursing sick puppies back to and helping traumatized cats learn to trust humans again. Then she started talking about her family, how she was the first person in her family to go to college, working two jobs to pay tuition while maintaining a 3.8 GPA. She was funny, too, making jokes about terrible customers at the coffee shop and doing spot on impressions of our professors. By the time dessert arrived, I had completely forgotten about Ben's stupid scheme. I was genuinely enjoying myself for the first time in months. Megan was smart, ambitious, kind and had this laugh that made my chest feel warm. When I dropped her off that night, she kissed my cheek and said, I had an amazing time. Thank you for asking me out. I went home feeling like I'd been hit by a truck, was waiting up, practically bouncing off the walls with excitement. So did you get Grace's number? When can we double date? Tell me everything. I looked at him and realized something had shifted completely. Ben, I'm going to see Megan again, like actually date Her, this isn't about your Grace thing anymore. His face fell. Dude, what? That wasn't the plan. You were supposed to be my wingman. Plans changed, I said, and went to bed. Three more dates with Megan confirmed what I already knew. I was falling hard for this girl. She was everything I never knew I wanted in a partner. When she told me about her dreams of opening her own veterinary practice someday, I found myself genuinely wanting to support those dreams. Month later, Ben cornered me again, clearly frustrated that his master plan had backfired. Dude, when are you getting me Grace's number? This was supposed to help me. I looked him dead in the eye and said, never. Megan's my girlfriend now and I'm not using her to get you dates. Maybe try actually talking to Grace like a normal person. That was 8 months ago. Last week, Megan and I signed a lease together and moved into our own place.

They've been involved for a year. Our entire engagement. He was waiting outside for support. Garrett walked in looking like every yoga instructor stereotype.

Derek, I'm eight months pregnant. You chose him. Go be with him. I looked at Garrett. Unless you don't have space. Face went red. I have roommates. Roommates? Bro, she's about to pop out two kids, and you have roommates? Garrett's art is taking off. Melody jumped in. He just needs time. His art? What kind? Interpretive sculpture using recycled materials. Garrett Said with zero irony. So trash art. Cool. See, my buddy Jerome works at the hospital where we did our ultrasound. Mentioned melody had listed Garrett as her emergency contact, not her fiance. That started my digging. But I didn't just test for my DNA. I tested against Garrett's too. Dude leaves water bottles everywhere. Getting a sample was easy. Neither of us was the father. Here's what I'd figured out. Ladies cycle tracking app was sync to our shared iPad. She forgot about that. According to the app, she wasn't near ovulation when these twins were conceived. But she was during her high school reunion. I found her tagged in photos from that weekend. Lots of pics with her ex Brendan. Dude she dated for six years before me. Recently divorced Brendan, so I dropped bread crumbs. Mentioned Brendan casually showed.

Grandma was on the floor for two days before anyone noticed. My mom called a family meeting to discuss moving grandma into assisted living, and I showed up, thinking my opinion would matter since I was the one who actually visited her every week. When I started raising concerns about the facility, they picked. My brother cut me off and looked at my mom like I wasn't even in the room. This is exactly what we talked about. He said, she's too emotional. She can't be objective about this. I tried to defend myself, but my mom was already nodding along. And my other brother added the part that really broke something in me. You make everything about yourself and how much you sacrifice for everyone. We get it. You're a martyr. But the rest of us have real lives, and we're tired of you acting like this family would collapse without you. Nobody disagreed. Nobody even flinched. I grabbed my jacket and walked toward the door, and the only thing I said was, okay, you've got it handled. Then my mom actually laughed a little, like I was being dramatic and would come crawling back by the weekend. I didn't come back when my brother's birthday passed, and nobody remembered because I didn't send the reminder text. I watched his wife post a belated photo three days later and almost caved. I typed out the message four different times before deleting it. When my two brothers got into a fight about something stupid and stopped speaking, my mom texted me asking if I could smooth things over like I always did. And I stared at that message for an hour before putting my phone in a drawer. Thanksgiving came, and I knew it would be a disaster without someone coordinating. And it was. I saw the photos on social media of the half empty table and the tense smile, and my chest hurts so bad I couldn't sleep at night. The hardest part was grandma. Every Sunday, I used to drive over and spend the afternoon with her. And now Sundays felt like a hole in my chest. Three weeks in, I actually drove to her house and sat in my car outside for 20 minutes. I could see her kitchen light on. I could have walked in and hugged her and pretended none of this happened. But if I did that, they would learn nothing. I drove home and cried the whole way cause

My neighbor called the police and said I tried to murder his son. Every October, my son and I would carve pumpkins, not one or two, but dozens. He'd sketch the faces in a notebook first, each one different, each one named. Then we'd spend entire weekends bringing them to life. Spooky ones, silly ones, elaborate ones with scenes carved into the skin. We'd line them up along the front walkway, light candles inside each one. The whole street would slow down to look. He was 6 when the Solomon kid first smashed them. 16 years old, baseball bat. Middle of the night, we woke up to orange carnage scattered across the lawn. Pumpkin got splattered on the driveway, seeds everywhere. Every single pumpkin destroyed. My son walked outside in his pajamas and just stood there, didn't cry, didn't speak, just stared at the man. I wanted to burn that kid's house down. But my wife stopped me at the door. He's watching you right now. Show him what kind of man handles this. So I walked outside and put my hand on his shoulder. You know what? Those pumpkins lived good lives. They deserve to be remembered. He looked up at, what do you mean? I walked him inside and grabbed a poster board from the closet. Every pumpkin we make from now on gets a spot on the wall, name, photo, birthday. And when they die, we write them a Eulogy. He thought I was joking at first. I wasn't. We called it the Memorial Wall. Gerald, Sir Mashington, the third Princess, Cordelia, Count Pumpkala. Every single pumpkin got a name, a photograph and a death certificate. When the Solomon Kid inevitably came swinging, the game wasn't about watching destruction. It was about honoring what we created. My son would write little eulogies in crayon. Gerald was a brave pumpkin. He had triangle eyes and a crooked smile. He lasted 4 days. We will miss him. We have mock funerals in the backyard. Lower pumpkin chunks into the compost bin with full ceremony. My son would give speech is. My wife would pretend to cry. It was ridiculous. It was morbid. It was ours. Four years of this. The memorial wall filled an entire garage wall. Hundreds of photos, hundreds of names. The Solomon Kid would wave from his driveway the morning after each massacre. His parents never said a word. Then my son got sick. Tumor behind his eye, inoperable. The doctors gave him until Thanksgiving. He had one request. Can we make one more pumpkin? The biggest one ever. I wanna carve it myself. We found a 200 pound giant at a farm three counties over. It took both of us to roll it into the truck. He was so weak by then. But he insisted on doing the carving himself. It took him a week.

I'd leave if you mention that again. I said fair. Then I mentioned it again in court during the breakup settlement. Together two years living in my apartment. The last one three years ago, I co founded a software startup that got acquired. Most of the money sits in managed investments, the bedrock of my future. When I proposed six months ago, my feelings were genuine, but I'm a pragmatist. Protecting assets isn't about lack of love. It's about responsibility. A month ago, quiet evening after dinner. Rachel, I think it's time we discussed a prenup. Ice. A prenup. Why it's good financial practice. Prenup draws a clear line between what's mine, what's yours and what becomes ours. Everything we build together is shared. She stood, no. It says you don't trust me. Her eyes narrowed. This is an insult. Then the ultimatum. If you ever mention a prenup again, I will walk out that door and not come back. End of discussion. I heard the threat and processed it as contract terms. She defined the exact condition for her departure. Fair, I said. She took it as Capuchin relation. Thank you for trusting me. But the decision was made. She told me what would make her leave. I decided to grant her wish, just not how she expected. Three weeks later, the entitlement became obvious. Credit card I'd given her suddenly saw action at designer boutiques. Four thousand dollar handbag, spa weekend. I canceled it, told her a new one was coming. It wasn't. Her parents invited me to their country club. We've been looking at properties for you two. Glossy brochure, audacious price. Put that money to work. It's an investment in our family, Catherine said, laughing like ice. The breaking point was the watch from my 30th birthday. My grandfather gave me his 1968 Patek Philippe, my most meaningful possession. Rachel borrowed it weeks ago, never returned it. I need my grandfather's watch back. She was applying lipstick, smirked in the mirror. Don't be silly. It's mine now. Part of the package. It's a family heirloom. She turned hard. What's yours is mine. That's marriage. It's staying with me. Final confirmation, my property was being annexed. Yesterday, I moved assets into new accounts, changed passwords, then sat Rachel down. This isn't working. The engagement is over. Shock, disbelief, cold fury. You're breaking up because of.

The groom's father, late to the ceremony, stopped dead when his eyes found mine. His expensive suit couldn't hide the soldier's posture. His face went white as recognition hit. Sir, is that you? Iraq 2003, night patrol turned nightmare. Ambush in the dark. This man bleeding out, trapped under heavy enemy fire while I dragged his broken body 300 yards through, through the sand to the evacuation point. His voice in my ear promising he'd never forget the mechanic who saved his life. Sergeant Reyes, he breathed, the name, falling heavy in the silence. The room went dead quiet. Heads turned from him to me, then to Jasper, whose smugness evaporated into horror. Ladies and gentlemen, Jasper's father said, his voice carrying across the entire hall. This man saved my life in a rock, everything to carry me out when everyone thought I was lost. Without him, there would be no family, no wedding, nothing. In that moment, the room no longer saw a mechanic. They saw a man who had given everything. The whispers that followed weren't cruel anymore. They were reverent. Jasper staggered back, mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. His father's eyes burned with shame and rage, humiliated this man, the very man who gave me my life. Do you understand what you've done to our family's honor? I didn't know, Jasper stammered. I didn't realize you didn't care. To realize his father cut him off, I finally spoke, my voice calm and steady. Respect isn't given by money. It's earned. Tara stepped forward, tears streaming. Love doesn't look like what you did, Jasper. Love doesn't tear down, it builds. Took off her ring, slowly placed it on the table. The diamond that had sparkled like a promise now looked like broken glass. I choose dignity, she said, taking my hand. I choose truth. The applause began quietly, then swelled as guests rose to their feet, not for the wedding, but for the truth revealed. We left together, father and daughter, while Jasper stood frozen in his shattered world of arrogance. Outside, the night air was cool. Tara squeezed my hand. Dad, you kept your promise to mom. I looked up at the stars barely visible beyond the city lights. So did I, Princess. So did I.

No one mentioned my name. I turned to Uncle Edward and said, you wanna tell them or should I? He stepped forward as the room quieted. Actually, Greg, there's a trust on this property, the one you signed when the bank was circling. And legally, this house belongs to Riley. Eyes shifted toward me. The applause died. My father's face went red. Edward, this is a family matter. It be came a legal matter. When Riley saved you from foreclosure, people started leaving. Within 30 minutes, half the guests were gone. I drove home with a useless key and crystal clear purpose. The next morning, I called attorney Patrick O'neil. Riley, the house legally cannot be transferred without your consent. You're the creditor who cleared the entire debt. You have more rights to this property than your parents do. That weekend, I filed to enforce the trust. The morning of Dylan's Celebration party, city officials knocked. We're here regarding this residence. The property is under legal review and cannot be transferred while an ownership dispute is active. My father's confidence cracked. Our neighbor Martha watched from her window. She'd never seen him look so small. An hour later, a tow truck arrived for Dylan's BMW, three months behind on payments. Early guests watched in silence as it was hauled away. Dylan stood on the lawn speechless. I arrived with Patrick and Edward. Patrick set one folder down. The trust will be enforced. You have 30 Days to remove your belongings. The locks will be changed and law enforcement will escort you out if necessary. My father stared. You can't do this. I'm your father. Actually, she can. She paid for it. You signed documents giving her that right when you needed her money. My mother started crying. Riley, please, this is our home. It was until you decided it was Dylan's. Now it's mine. My parents moved to a rental across town. Dylan found roommates who judged him by his work ethic. The complaint started within weeks. House became mine legally. Finally, truly. Calls went unanswered. Messages painting me as cruel stayed unread. I told relatives who questioned me that I was done being judged by people who watched me disappear for years without saying a word. The turning point wasn't the officials arriving. It was when I stopped volunteering to be invisible so everyone else could stay comfortable.

Silent, stone faced. I think it's time we watch something, Grandpa said, quietly, setting the DVR on the patio table like a loaded weapon. The footage showed everything. Dylan tiptoeing to his room, glancing around, grabbing a fake Bill, dropping it in my backpack, then grinning straight at the camera before walking away. The whole party went silent. You could hear people's jaws dropping. That it's not what it looks like, Dylan whispered. But it was exactly what it looked like. My parents turned pale. No apologies, just mom saying we didn't have the full picture. And dad mumbling about work stress. Dylan got grounded for a week. That was it. They wanted it swept under the rug. But I wasn't done. I installed hidden cameras in my room. Within days, I caught Dylan breaking in, unlocking my phone, scrolling through my messages, taking photos of my journal. He was planning to frame me again. I made copies, board them everywhere, waited. Dylan had a big speech at a school fundraiser about student leadership and integrity. My parents were beaming in the front row during his speech. I sent the video to my mom, my dad and every teacher he'd mentioned in his scholarship applications. Then I turned off my phone and listen to him talk about honesty. By morning, the video was everywhere. Teachers, students, scholarship committees. Dylan never went back to school. His scholarship was withdrawn. His student Council position revoked, his reputation destroyed. Grandpa called a family meeting, played every video, the room footage, audio of Dylan planning to exaggerate to get me kicked out permanently. You owe Blake more than an apology, Grandpa told my parents. You owe him your damn respect. You either own up or don't speak to me again. That night, I packed my things. Grandpa offered me his cabin full time. Before I left, dad stood in the doorway. What happens now? He asked. I looked him in the eye. I live my life. You live yours. A year later, I've got savings, a construction certification, a steady job, a truck that doesn't stall, and a home with only my name on it. Dylan switched schools, deleted his socials, never recovered. My parents tried reaching out. I sent their checks back. And the day Dylan realized the camera was rolling, that was the day I won.

I checked the seating chart. My parents at table three, siblings at table 1. My name at table 12, labeled Guest. Aiden appeared, adjusting his cuff links. Tonight's not really about you. In that moment, everything clicked. I've been erased long before tonight. This was simply the public version. The moment I left the ballroom, I drove straight home and placed my laptop on the car hood. I opened the folder labeled continuity. Inside, 16 Years of Ownership Transfers. Contracts signed during commercial breaks. Archived emails. I sent encrypted emails to every board member. Triggered career pickup for stamped filings. Activated the voting portal I built years ago. My equity total 58%. Silent, unadvertised. Intact. When I pulled up Section 14C, they handed me the trigger themselves. On stage, in front of 200 witnesses. Three hours later, I walked back into the gala. As security sealed the exits, Vanessa paused mid laugh. Phones vibrated across the room. Mister Whitman rose and nodded to security. They closed the doors. No one could leave. The lights dimmed. The 60 foot screen lit up. Emergency shareholder meeting, Section 14C activated. Vanessa's breath hitched audibly. I walked the center aisle and set my laptop at the podium. The voting portal expanded across the screen. Good evening, I said. Voice level. Under Section 14C, control reverts to the majority shareholder. A motion has been filed. Mister Whitman stepped beside me. Motion to rescind the appointments of Vanessa Lawson as CEO and Aiden Lawson as VP of sales. Do I have a second? Yes. Second. Several voices echoed. The vote opened green for yes, red for no. 58%, then 61%, 65%, 67%. Each tick felt like a countdown. Yes leaned forward. Mesmerized, Vanessa lunged forward. Stop. This is my ceremony. This is a legal meeting. Miss Lawson. Mister Whitman said, please step back. The number ticked higher. 71%. The bar turned solid green. Motion carries. Mister Whitman announced, effective immediately. Four months later, my office sat where the old storage closet used to be. Simple name plate. Brushed steel. Just my name and title. Vanessa listed her lakehouse. Aiden's non compete held firm. Mom and dad left for Florida. They all reached out eventually. Texts, voicemails, apologies. I let them pass through. None landed. Silence isn't weakness. It's direction.

Your place is on the floor, he sneered. Guests laughed until the groom's father looked at me and said, sir, is that you? And the room went silent. I've always been the simple man in Tara's life. After her mother, Erica, died when Tara was just 12, I raised her alone, working double shifts at the garage. Oil cake under my fingernails, wet, soaking my back. Every paycheck went to keeping her world steady while mine fell apart. Piano lessons, school clothes, college tuition paid in overtime hours and weekend shifts. Jasper was everything I wasn't. Wall Street portfolio manager, tailored suits, manicured hands that had never held a wrench or known honest work. When he proposed to my daughter after six months of dating, I bit my tongue and forced a smile. She was happy, and that's what mattered to me. But the dinner changed everything. He'd invited us to some fancy Manhattan restaurant with golden forks and crystal glasses that cost more than my monthly mortgage. The waiter treated us like royalty until he saw my calloused hands. When the check came, Jasper slid it across to me with a calculated smirk. Tradition, the bride's father pays, he said with clear satisfaction, $347, more than a week's groceries. I paid it with trembling hands, watching him lean back like he'd won some twisted game. My credit card barely cleared. Your daughter appreciates seeing how Well, her two favorite men get along, he said, knowing damn well what he'd done, testing me, breaking me down piece by piece in front of my own child. The wedding day arrived. I wore my navy suit, the same one from her graduation, pressed carefully that morning in my small Brooklyn apartment. At the reception, I stood to move my chair. When Jasper yanked it away, my body hit the polished marble floor with a crack that silenced the music. Oops, said loudly. Looks like someone's unsteady age catches us all. Eventually, laughter rippled through the crowd of his wealthy friends. Maybe you're more comfortable closer to the ground. That's where you belong. I stayed down longer than I needed to let them all see what humiliation looked like. When I finally rose, Tara was beside me, tears in her eyes, looking at her new husband like she was seeing a complete stranger. But before I could speak, the sound of heavy boots echoed through the hall.

I spent the night in a bus station. A month later at a family barbecue, he joked about it right as my grandfather walked up behind him holding the security footage. I'm Blake. I was the dependable one. Three days part time job at a gas station, made dinner three nights a week when both parents worked late. My brother Dylan was two years younger but had everyone wrapped around his finger. Teachers loved him. Parents worshipped him. The kid with dimples who could twist any story into sponge sugar. I was just the quiet older brother who kept the house running. Then one Friday, I came home from my shift in my red and white uniform smelling like burnt coffee and stale air freshener. Mom charged at me, where is it? She was furious. Dylan claimed I stole $300 from his room, his Christmas and birthday money. Said my backpack was in there that afternoon. I hadn't been home since morning. Didn't matter. Maybe you wanted money for your car repairs, she said like she'd already convicted me. You've been stressed about that busted starter, haven't you? Dad came home in his work suit. Ty still nodded. No questions, no checking Dylan's story, just you need to leave. I grabbed my backpack and walked out with a crumpled five dollar Bill in my pocket and nowhere to Go spent two nights at the bus station downtown, sleeping in 10 minute intervals under fluorescent lights that flickered constantly. The occasional bark from some guy arguing with the vending machine, the constant shuffle of footsteps. No calls, no texts, not even a where are you from anyone. When I finally came back two days later, pale and stiff and cracked from the inside out, they barely looked up from the TV. Three weeks later, family barbecue for Grandma's 70th. Dylan decided to tell the story in front of everyone laughing. Should have seen Blake's face when mom kicked him out all over a fake hundred I printed for a prank. Didn't think they'd actually believe me. I froze holding my plate of pasta salad. My heart was pounding so loud I couldn't hear anything else. Then I saw.

Five years I poured every spare dollar into paying off my parents 680 thousand dollar mortgage. I worked double shifts while my younger brother Dylan coasted through college on a full ride he barely earned. Every school trip, every jacket, every ounce of attention went to him. I was the invisible child, the reliable one expected to figure everything out alone. While they celebrated his mediocre achievements, my father's auto shop failed. I found unopened bank letters in their kitchen. The house was weeks from foreclosure. Late fees had stacked up for months. I could have walked away. Instead, massive transfers left my account every month. My promotions, my raises poured into saving their house. My father talked constantly about his sacrifice, fighting every day to keep this family home standing. He'd tell relatives my name never came up. My uncle Edward insisted we sign a trust. If Riley's carrying this burden, it needs legal Protection. He told my parents my name appeared on those documents not just for responsibility but for control.

My mouth went dry. Dad, I paid that mortgage for five years. Stop making everything about money. This is about his future, not your ego. And you're not invited to the party. I don't want your bitter attitude ruining his big day. He hung up three days later. I showed up anyway. The house I'd saved was wrapped in string lights with Dylan's name on a banner. Inside, relatives congratulated him on his new home. My father stood by the fireplace, soaking in the attention. I held this house together through sheer will and sacrifice. Now I'm proud to give my son the foundation he deserves. Relatives clapped. My mother smiled. Dylan accepted. Pray.

The week before the wedding, I was talking to my cousin's fiance, Amy, about something else, and she mentioned how excited she was that everyone was following the dress code. I asked what dress code? And she said they'd asked people to avoid bright colors and flashy stuff because they wanted a more classic, elegant vibe. He specifically mentioned no red or hot pink or anything attention grabbing. I went home and told my girlfriend about the dress code. She said Amy never told her that directly, so it didn't apply to her. I showed her the wedding website where it was listed under frequently asked questions. She. He said that was just a suggestion, not a rule. I pointed out that when the bride specifically asks you not to wear bright red to her wedding, you should probably listen. She accused me of trying to control what she wears and said I was embarrassed by her. That wasn't it at all. I love her and think she looks great in everything. But this wasn't about looking good, it was about being appropriate. She said she'd already planned her whole look around the red dress and wasn't changing it now. The night before the wedding, we had a huge fight about it. She. She laid the dress out on the bed and I told her I wasn't going to the wedding if she wore it. She called me manipulative and said I was Ruining everything, I explained that showing up in a bright red sequined dress when the bride specifically asked people not to wear bright colors would be disrespectful and embarrassing. She started crying and said I was making her feel ugly and unwanted. I felt horrible, but I also knew that if she showed up in that dress, everyone would be staring and talking about it instead of focusing on Ryan and Amy. I told her she could wear literally any other dress in her closet and look beautiful, but this particular dress was wrong for this particular event. Morning of the wedding, she was still planning to wear the red dress. I got dressed in my suit and waited to see what she'd choose. She came out of the bedroom in the black dress instead. She looked incredible, and I told her so, but she barely spoke to me the whole car ride there.

We need to talk about your father now. When I explained what I'd found, there was silence on the other end. Then he said quietly, he's been asking me weird questions, too, about your schedule, your job and about your boyfriend. We met that afternoon while Sophie was at school. I showed him everything, the notebooks, the maps, the lists. His face went white. This isn't normal grandparent behavior, I said. This is surveillance. He nodded slowly. Last month he asked me if you'd change the locks and whether you still keep cash in the kitchen drawer. I thought he was just making conversation. We decided to confront his father together. When we showed up at his house, Grandpa Frank immediately became defensive. It's just a memory game. Kids need to be observant. Observant of what my ex demanded. Why does an eight year old need to know when her mother comes home from work or where we keep spare keys? You're being paranoid, he snapped. But when we threatened to involve the police, he finally admitted the truth. He'd been planning to sue for grandparents rights. He wanted detailed information about our routines to prove we were unfit. Parents who left Sophie with babysitters too often or didn't supervise her properly. The maps and schedules were for his lawyer. He was building a case to get custody by documenting every time we weren't home, every time Morgan watched her instead of us. I love that little girl, he said. She deserves better than being raised by a broken home. My ex stood up furious. Get out. You're never seeing Sophie again, ever. We left immediately. On the drive home, I couldn't stop shaking. An eight year old had been turned into a spy in her own home by someone. She. That night I sat Sophie down and explained that the detective game was wrong, that adults shouldn't ask children to keep secrets about their families, that Grandpa Frank had made a mistake and wouldn't be coming around anymore. She cried because she thought she'd done something wrong. It broke my heart. Morgan still babysits for us, but now we have new locks, new hiding spots for important things.

My heart was pounding as I rushed over. Morgan had been watching Sophie for three years, never once called this late. When I got there, she was sitting on my couch looking pale as a ghost, holding something behind her back. I found this under Sophie's bed, she said, pulling out a notebook. I was looking for her stuffed rabbit and it fell out. I opened it expecting drawings or homework and instead I found page after page of detailed notes about our family routine, when dad leaves for work, when mom gets home, what time we eat dinner, where we keep spare keys, even which neighbors have dogs that bark. My blood ran cold. Sophie was only 8. Why would she write this? There's more, Morgan whispered, showing me photos on her phone. Look what I found taped under her desk. It was a hand drawn map of our house. Every room labeled, Exit Routes marked in red. Even the basement layout was perfectly drawn. I ran upstairs to Sophie's room. She was fast asleep, looking innocent as always. But when I checked under her desk, I found more papers, lists of our friends addresses, notes about when our neighbours go on vacation, even details about the mailman's schedule. The scariest part was a page titled important people. It had our extended family members listed with their work schedules, where They lived, even what cars they drove, information an eight year old shouldn't know or care about. I went back downstairs where Morgan was pacing nervously. Should we call the police, she asked. Let me talk to her first, I said, though my hands were shaking. The next morning I sat Sophie down at breakfast. Honey, I found your notebook. Can you tell me about it? Sophie's face went bright red. She started crying immediately. I'm sorry, Mommy. I wasn't supposed to tell anyone. Tell anyone. What about the game, she sobbed. Grandpa Frank taught me. He said, if I could remember everything about everyone, he would give me a prize. My father in law, my ex husband's dad, who I'd always felt was too controlling but could never put my finger on why. What kind of game, sweetheart? He calls it Detective Sophie. He asked me questions about you and daddy and everyone, like what time you leave for work or where you hide the emergency.

My girlfriend has this red dress that she absolutely loves. It's this super bright fire engine red with these weird sequence all over it that catch light like a disco ball. She bought it last year for some work party and ever since then she finds excuses to wear it everywhere. So last month, my cousin Ryan was getting married. Pretty standard church wedding, nothing too fancy, but still formal. When we got the invitation, my girlfriend immediately started talking about what she was going to wear. She tried on like 5 different dresses and none of them felt right to her. Then she goes into her closet and pulls out the red dress. I was sitting on the bed watching her hold it up in the mirror and I just had this sinking feeling in my stomach. The dress isn't just red, it's like neon emergency vehicle red and the sequence make it sparkle like a Christmas ornament. She's standing there grinning at herself talking about how perfect it's gonna be. I tried to be diplomatic about it. I told her maybe we should think about something a little more understated since it's a wedding. She got defensive immediately asking what was wrong with her dress. I explained that at weddings you're supposed to let the bride be the center of attention and wearing something that bright might pull focus from her. She rolled her eyes and Said I was being ridiculous. Bride is gonna be in white, so how could a red dress compete with that? I told her it's not about competing, it's about being respectful. She said she looked amazing in the dress and she wasn't gonna hide in some boring outfit just because I was being paranoid. We went back and forth about this for like two weeks. Every time she brought up the wedding, she'd mention the red dress. I'd suggest other options, and she'd shoot them all down. She had this black dress that looked really elegant and a navy blue one that was perfect for a church, but she insisted.

I called 9, 1 1. We're trapped at our high school room. 3 1 2. Something's happening in the biology room. There's blood everywhere. Units are responding. I recorded through the gap Carol moving between tables. The scratching sound was louder here. Then I heard something that made my stomach turn, a sound I recognized from home, a cat not meowing, screaming. I shifted to see better and the ceiling tile under me cracked. I grabbed a beam as it fell. Carol looked up, saw me through the hole. What are you doing? He yelled. Now I could see everything. Cats, at least 20 on tables cut open, some still breathing. What the fuck? You don't understand. This is research. You're killing cats. I dropped down into his room. Cages line the wall. More cats alive waiting. The ones on the tables were in various stages of dissection. The orange tabby nearest to me was breathing rapidly, chest cavity open. This is authorized research, Carol said, by who? The principal approved it to torture cats to study mammalian pain responses. These are strays. But I saw collars, tags. These were people's pets, you psychopath. He grabbed a scalpel. You need to leave. I'm not leaving them. The door was locked from outside like hours, but police sirens were getting closer. I started grabbing cages with living cats. Carol came at me with the scalpel. Missus Wiley's voice came through the hole in the ceiling. Police are here. Carol stopped, looked at his tables, his research. Twenty years of work. You've ruined 20 years of work. The police broke down the door, saw the horror. One officer vomited. Another called for animal control and veterinarians. Eight cats were still alive, barely. The rest had been neighborhood pets missing for weeks or months. Carol was arrested. 23 families had to be told that their pets weren't coming home.

I open the door. Mr. Murray? Yes? You need to come with us. Why? What's going on? The officer looked past me into the room. His eyes land on the purse on my bed. Mr. Puck was found dead this morning in a stairwell. His belongings were traced to this room. My jaw dropped. I didn't. I don't even know how they got here. Sir, you need to come with us now. They put me in handcuffs. I spent the next six hours in a concrete interrogation room. Cold, gray. A detective sat across from me, asking the same questions over and over. You were seen talking to Mister Puck at the bar. He bought me a drink. We talked. That's it. Then why were his belongings found in your room? I don't know. Someone put them there. Mister Puck was pushed down a stairwell. His neck was broken. You were the last person seen with him. I didn't kill him. Then who did? I had no answer. They charged me with murder. I spent three days in a Portuguese jail cell, surrounded by a language I barely spoke and officers that kept asking if it was true that everyone back home was overweight. Finally, my lawyer visited me. She was American embassy appointed. Sharp eyes. I pulled the hotel security footage. She says all of it. She opened her laptop and turned it toward me. The footage showed my hallway. Time stamp, 10:00am. While I was Out sightseeing. A man walks to my door. Hotel uniform, front desk badge. He uses a key card, walks in carrying the black suitcase. That's not me, I said. I know. Keep watching. Time stamp? Two fifteen PM. Same man returns, leaves with the suitcase. Comes back five minutes later with the purse. Who is he? She pauses the footage, zooms in on his badge. His name is Gabriel Susa. He works the front desk. He's also Mr. Puck's business partner. I stared at her. They co owned a real estate company together. Puck had a 2 million euro life insurance policy. Susa was the sole beneficiary. My blood ran cold. He killed puck for the insurance money. Then he needed someone to take the fall. A solo traveler. A foreigner. No connections, no alibi. Easy target. Pick me. He picked you. She closed the laptop. Portuguese police arrested Susa this morning based on this footage. He confessed an hour ago. I sat there staring at the table for a long time. Three days ago, I was a tourist, eating custard tarts and taking photos of tile work. Now I was sitting in a foreign jail cell because a man I'd never met decided I'd make the perfect scapegoat for murder. I was cleared that afternoon.

Our algebra teacher looked up in horror and shouted, everyone out now. But when she tried the door, it was locked from the outside. She pulled harder, nothing. The windows, someone yelled. We were on the third floor. The windows had safety locks that only opened four inches. More blood was coming through, pooling on three desks now. Shayla screamed when it dripped on her hair. Mrs. Wiley was calling the office. No answer. She tried 9, 1, 1. We're locked in room 3, 1, 2. Something's happening in 412 above us. That was Mister Carroll's AP biology room. The blood was spreading across the ceiling. Five desks now covered. Whatever was happening upstairs was massive. Break the window, Jake, said. Missus Wiley grabbed her chair and smashed it against the glass. It's spider web but didn't break safety glass. We could hear something now. Movement upstairs. Scratching, scraping, like something being dragged. Then a thump. Another things being dropped. The blood was seeping through faster. The ceiling tile in the corner was sagging from the weight of it. Stack the desks need to get through the ceiling, I said. We piled desks by the wall away from the blood. I climbed up and pushed a clean tile. It moved. David, don't, missus, Wiley yelled. But we were trapped. No one was coming. The blood kept flowing. I pulled myself up into the crawl space between Floors. The smell hit me and immediately, death, iron, something worse. I crawled toward room 4, 12 above, could see light through gaps in Carol's floor. Through a gap, I saw movement. Carol in a lab coat, covered in blood. He was working on something on a table. I crawled closer, another gap. This one bigger. Tables, multiple tables, things on them, moving things.

I was on a solo trip in Portugal and hadn't brought anyone back to my room at all. I haven't authorized any key cards, I said. Silence on the other end. Sir, our system shows three separate key card entries today while you were out. None of them were your card. I look around my room, everything seemed normal. Are you sure it's not a glitch? I've worked here 11 years. Woman said, this isn't a glitch. Someone has a key card to your room. She sounds extremely worried. I hung up and searched the room, bathroom, under the bed, behind the curtains, nothing. Then I opened the closet. There was a suitcase inside, black leather, expensive looking. It wasn't mine. I unzipped it slowly. My heart pounding. I saw men's clothes, dress shirts, a toiletry bag, a wallet and then a passport. I picked it up and slowly opened the biographical page. I looked at the man's photo and recognized him instantly. It's the man from the hotel bar last night. British accent, friendly. He bought me a drink. But why was his suitcase in my closet? I grabbed the passport and bolted downstairs to reception. The woman recognized me instantly. I opened the passport. I found this in my room, I said. Her face dropped instantly. That's Mister Puck, I was told by the coworker on shift before. Me? That Mister checked out at 7:00am. He apparently left in a hurry. But that didn't make sense. His suitcase was in my room, his passport, his wallet. Who checks out without those? The woman stared at me like she had no answers. I headed back upstairs without waiting. I needed to know more. Then I opened my room door and froze instantly. The man's suitcase is gone. I slowly check the closet and it was empty. Someone had just been in my room, just took these things. Were they still here? I looked around and saw something else, a woman's purse on my bed, small brown leather. I opened it with shaking hands. Inside I saw a watch and a wedding ring. Were these Mister Puck's, too? Had someone been moving his belongings in and out of my room? Why? I grabbed my phone to call the front desk, but before I could dial, there was a knock at the door. I looked through the peephole. Two police officer.

Your sister's getting married in two weeks. I need you here for photos. The venue is already booked. Vanessa can't reach you. I live in Arizona. Mom, I've lived here for 10 months. It's a five hour flight. This is ridiculous, she said. Just get on a plane. I'm in the middle of a huge project at work. I can't just leave. You're choosing work over family. No, I'm choosing the life I built after my family ignored me for almost a year. That afternoon, Vanessa called furious. Mom says you're refusing to come to my wedding. I didn't even know you were engaged. Posted about it 6 months ago. Did you comment? Did you call? Did you acknowledge it at all? Silence. Exactly. I said, you want me to drop everything for a wedding I wasn't even properly invited to? While you couldn't bother to remember I moved states. Dad finally called that evening using his disappointed voice. Your mother's very upset. You've always been difficult, but this is too much. I pulled up our text history and read it aloud. March 4th, moving To Arizona in two weeks. Your response? Nothing. March 10th, I told you at dinner, you talked about your grill. March 22nd, I sent my new address. No one responded. The line went quiet. I didn't make this up, dad. I begged you to listen. You were too busy to care. Now you're angry I'm not available when it's convenient for you. Vanessa sent a long message calling me selfish and saying I'd ruined her special day over nothing. Mom left voicemail sobbing about how she couldn't believe I do this to her. I had sent one text, we raised you better than this. I replied to all of them the same way I told you six times. You chose not to hear me. The wedding happened without me. I saw photos on Facebook, everyone smiling, acting like nothing was wrong. My mom posted, family is everything. I didn't comment.

Vanessa replied, asking if I could pick up her dry cleaning since I was still in town. Mom asked if I'd seen her post about her book club on Facebook. I picked up the dry cleaning. The day I left, I texted one final time, driving to Arizona today. New address attached. Love you all. 12 hours later, my mom reacted with a heart emoji. That was it. The first month in Phoenix was chaos. New job, new apartment, making friends, learning which highways actually moved during Rush hour, I called home twice. Both times I got voicemail. I left messages mentioning Arizona, my new neighborhood, the eat. No one called back. By month 3, I stopped trying so hard. I text holiday greetings, send photos of desert sunsets. My family's responses were generic, beautiful miss you. Vanessa sent me tik toks she thought were funny but never asked how I was doing. I started building a real life, found a hiking group, dated someone briefly, got promoted again at work. Arizona stopped feeling temporary and started feeling like home.

I called back still half asleep. Why didn't you tell us you moved, mom shrieked before I could say hello. What are you talking about?

We convinced dad you were too young for ownership. We met with the lawyer while dad was confused from the chemo. So this was the real truth. They had manipulated the will to cut me out, not expecting to lose in the end. We'll lose everything if this company goes under. Our houses, everything. Juliana's voice no longer commanding. Tommy, we're family. You haven't been my family since you asked me to fetch your coffee, I said, and hung up. They filed for bankruptcy a month later.

I was in Pennsylvania. What? No, I'm in Pennsylvania. I shot up from the dentist chair so fast the hygienist dropped her tools. I had a bib still around my neck and numbing gel in my mouth, but I was already running to my car. $100,000. That was everything. Our emergency fund, our down payment, savings, everything we'd spent 10 years building. Freeze the account right now, I told the bank rep while fumbling with my keys. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely unlock my car. I need to report identity theft. Someone stole my information. The rep said they were freezing everything and starting an investigation. I needed to come to the branch immediately with ID and file a police report. I called my wife, rose, while speeding toward the bank. Someone stole 100,000 from our account in Vegas. They cleaned us out. She started crying immediately. We just talked last night about finally having enough saved for a house. Now it was gone. How is this even possible, she kept asking. How did they get your information? I had no idea. I was always careful, never clicked suspicious links, had strong passwords, checked my statements. This shouldn't have happened. I got to the bank and they pulled up the transaction details. The withdrawal happened at 1:00am from a casino ATM. Multiple transactions over two hours, 20,000, then 30, another 50, whoever. Did this, knew there was exactly 100,000 in there. The bank manager said someone had my debit card and pin. That's impossible. My card is right here. Except when I checked, it was, my debit card was missing. Then rose called back, her voice different. Where's your dad? I just tried calling him and it's going straight to voicemail. My stomach dropped. My father lived alone 40 minutes away. He was 72 and starting to show memory problems, repeated stories, forgotten appointments, confusion about dates. When's the last time you talked to him? Two days ago. He seemed fine. But now that she mentioned it, he'd asked weird questions about my mother, who'd been dead for five years, talked about taking her dancing like she was alive. The bank manager showed me security camera footage from the casino ATM. Grainy, but you could see someone in a baseball cap and jacket. Something about the person's build, the way they stood looked familiar. Can you zoom in? I asked. When they did, my blood went cold. That was my father's jacket, the Steelers jacket I bought him three Christmases ago. I called.

Called his neighbors, then the police for a wellness check. While waiting, the bank showed me more transactions. The Luxor casino, two days of hotel charges, restaurants, slot machines. My father was in Vegas and I had no idea. The police called back. Car's gone, mail piled up. Looks like he left days ago. I drove straight to his house. Rose met me there. We found, found his medications, his passport, everything still at home. But on his kitchen table was an old photo album, pictures of my parents in their 20s. My mom in a showgirl costume, my dad looking young in a suit. Underneath was a Vegas postcard from 1978. Then my phone rang. Nevada number is this Bryce Welts. Your father is at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. He's okay, but we need you to come down here. There's been a situation. I flew to Vegas that night, found my dad in a hospital room looking confused and small. The doctor explained he'd been found at a roulette table at 6:00am, disoriented, unable to remember where he was staying. He'd been playing for hours. Kept talking about his wife being in the showgirl review, needing to win big to impress her. He thought it was 1978, thought my mother was alive and 24. He'd taken my debit card during dinner two weeks ago without remembering, flew to Vegas thinking he was young again, trying to relive the trip where he'd proposed to My mom, the dementia specialist said this happens sometimes with early stage patients. They'd confuse time periods, try to recreate important memories, act on decades old impulses. My dad stabilized over the next day and we got him into memory care evaluation. I was trying to figure out how to deal with the $100,000 being gone when a casino manager showed up at the hospital. Apparently my father hadn't just been withdrawing money, he'd been gambling and winning a lot. He turned 100,000 into over $500,000 over 48 hours. But now the casino was investigating us for fraud, thinking we'd sent a dementia patient in on purpose as some kind of scam to avoid gambling regulations. We spent six months in legal hell proving my dad's dementia was real and undiagnosed, that this wasn't a scheme. Eventually, the casino settled and we kept the money. But my dad doesn't remember any of it. Sometimes he still asks when we're going to Vegas to see Mom's show.

I woke to pounding on my door at 2:00am. Your car is on fire. My neighbor was panicking outside. My entire car was engulfed in flames. My recent ex, Vanessa stood across the street, phone out recording. That's what cheaters get, she shouted, laughing. I never cheated. She left me. I called the fire department, but I knew my car was done. Tomorrow was the first day at my new job that took me three months of interviews to get and it was 45 minutes away. Ubers would be too expensive. No family lives nearby to help. Savings gone on moving costs. After she me out, she destroyed my life. But then I felt an unexpected wave of calm. I remembered what was in the trunk. I smiled at her as she laughed at my burning car. Let me explain how we got here. And Nessa and I dated for two years. The first six months were perfect. She was charming, attentive and loving. Then the switch flipped. She check my phone while I slept, track my location, time my drives home from work. If I was five minutes late, she'd accuse me of cheating. She'd throw things at me, remotes, plates, once a kitchen knife that stuck in the drywall inches from my head. You made me do this, she'd say afterward, crying. If you didn't make me so insecure, I walked on eggshells. Every female co worker was a threat. Every text from my sister needed explaining. She isolated me from friends, especially women. They want you, she'd insist. I'm protecting us. Then her mom got cancer. For three weeks, she softened up and I took care of her. When her mom died, she sobbed in my arms. I can't pick up the ashes, she said. Please just get them. I'll deal with them when I'm ready. I pick them up. The next day, the funeral director handed me the heavy wooden box with such care. She's at peace now, he said. And Nessa couldn't even look at the box. When I brought it home a week later, she changed again. Colder than before, distant. She was texting constantly, hiding her screen, coming home late with weak excuse. This is then. One morning she announced she was done. I found someone who actually values me, she said. Someone mature, professional, not like you. She met her brother's best friend. I'd seen the texts she carelessly left open. She kicked me out that day. I didn't fight it. I was exhausted, relieved even. I moved 40 minutes away to start over. Three months of interviews finally got me the warehouse job. I made a friend at the library, Reina studying for nursing boards. We grab coffee, quiz each other. It was platonic, normal human connection without walking on glass. Last week, Enessa saw us at Starbucks. Reina was laughing at something I said about Forklifts. Enessa walked in, saw us and her face went dark. She left without ordering. That night, the text started, cheating bastard. You were screwing her the whole time. Everyone will know what you did. I didn't respond.

In her mind, reality was negotiable. She'd already rewritten our entire history. Posted on Instagram about my affairs, my emotional abuse, my gas lighting. Her followers ate it up. Poor Vanessa. Betrayed by another man. Now watching my car burn, I remembered the piece of information that she forgot. How she just ruined her life. In the chaos of packing my stuff, when she kicked me out, I begged her to take her mother's ashes. But you wouldn't even look at the wooden box. Take that depressing box with you. So I did. I put it carefully in my trunk, thinking she'd ask for it once she calmed down. That was four months ago. It was now burning with my car. I let Vanessa have her moment and went inside. The next morning, I began the process. First, call the funeral home. They had documentation proving I received the ashes, including security footage. Second, the police. Not just property damage, destruction of human remains. A federal offense, since they crossed state lines from the crematorium. Third, Inessa's sister Tina, who'd been begging Inessa for months about their mother's ashes. She said she already spread them. Tina whispered she even showed us fake photos. Last, my lawyer friend from college, she filmed herself doing it. He laughed. That's evidence of a felony. She's cooked. The confrontation happened at her parents house. Her family was with her, acting clueless, waiting for the cops. I waited in the driveway. As two cruisers pulled up, Inessa emerged from the house, confused. What's going on? The detective stepped forward. Ma'am, you're under arrest for felony destruction of human remains. Her family crowded the doorway. This is crazy, she yelled. He's setting me up! I spoke clearly so everyone could hear. Your mother's ashes were in my trunk, Inessa. You burned your own mother? Her aunt collapsed. Her brother had to hold their father up. Her sister Tina slapped her. You told us you scattered them. We grieved. We had closure. The officers cuffed her as she stared at her family's faces. Pure disgust. Where love used to be. Mom would be ashamed of you, Roger said. She screamed for forgiveness, but no one looked back.

He didn't, but the rumor spread through his entire school. He came home crying one day because kids were bullying him, calling him the sheet soaker. When I found out what she did, I immediately broke up with her. In the aftermath, she went crazy, started screaming at me in front of him. This is ridiculous! It was just a joke. I hate this little brat! She pointed at my brother and turned to him. You ruined us! That was when I fully saw her true colors. I kicked her out and never spoke to her again. Honestly, I did her a favor. After what she did, I could have just reported her and gotten her deported. Her visa was expired, and she never felt the need to renew it. But I decided to give her a chance. Well, not anymore. I continued following their car. They tried switching lanes, making unexpected turns, but I stuck to them like a step sister to a washing machine. After 20 minutes of following, I realized they were heading to the temporary housing facility where they keep my brother. While they investigated, we pulled up to the facility. The worker and my ex got out with my brother. My ex turned around and yelled at me, you can't stop this. He's ours now! But I ignored her and walked straight into the building, past all of them. I only looked back at my brother and gave him our Signal. That meant I got this inside. I went directly to the CPS desk. Woman looked up at me. I need to file a report, I said. Someone just showed up at my house claiming to be CPS, but she didn't give a case number. She just took my brother. I think the report was false. The woman's face went serious. There's one more thing, I added. The person who made the false report, her immigration visa expired six months ago. The woman looked up sharply. She picked up her phone and made another call. CPS workers and officers went outside immediately. I watched through the window as they approached my ex and the worker at the door. They started asking questions, checking credentials. My ex's face turned terrified instantly, like a chicken knowing it's about to be turned into dinner. Officers put handcuffs on both of them. I walked outside to look. My ex stared at me with a facial expression of a shocked Pikachu, absolutely speechless. My brother was released to me immediately. He ran over and hugged me tight. I told him to go wait in the car. I walked over to my ex one last time. She looked up at me, furious. This isn't over. I smiled. You're right. You still got a 14 hour flight to go. Then it's over.

The worker walked right past me into my house without asking. My ex followed behind her, smirking. What's this about, I asked. The worker looked at her clipboard. It's about neglect and inappropriate behavior toward your 11 year old brother, she said, with this disgust in her voice, like she'd already decided I was already guilty. She started walking through every room taking notes. She pointed at dishes in the sink, inadequate living conditions. She opened my brother's bedroom that had two t shirts on the floor, signs of neglect. Those are just normal things, I said. Everyone has dishes sometimes. Abusers always have excuses, she said coldly. When my brother came downstairs and told her I was the best big brother ever, the worker looked right at me and replied, you're coaching him, huh? My ex stood in the hallway watching everything with a satisfied smile. Minutes later, the worker went into my brother's room alone. I stood outside the door listening, trying to stay calm while my ex was literally silently laughing in my face. My promotion review was next week. My brother's birthday party was tomorrow. Even if proven false, a scandal like this would ruin everything. Worker came out with my brother looking confused and scared. I'm removing him from the home pending investigation, she announced. You can't just take Him. I yelled, yes, I can. She walked him toward the front door. My ex followed them. I watched through my window as they put my crying brother in the car. I should have been devastated. I should have been panicking. But you see, I knew something so terrible about my ex, something she didn't even know herself. I began laughing to myself as I grabbed my keys, got in my car and started following them. You see, I always knew a day like this was coming back. When my ex and I started dating, I was already my brother's legal guardian. He and I always had that typical older brother relationship. I teased him constantly, made fun of his bowl cut, roasted him about everything. But it was our thing, our way of showing love. I was protective of him like crazy. It was that I'm the only one allowed to be mean to him. Kind of dynamic. But my ex never understood that. She trying to join in on the jokes, telling him his drawing was stupid and things like that. Stop being mean to him, I told her one time after she made him cry by making fun of his haircut in front of his friends. But you're mean to him all the time. She shot back at me, why can't I be? It's just jokes. I looked at her, it's different when you do it. You're not his brother. I am. She rolled her eyes. That's Ridiculous. And no matter how many times I explained it, she just wouldn't stop making fun of him. She kept crossing that boundary.

For like four days, nothing happened. I was starting to think maybe she actually Learned her lesson. But then Friday rolled around and I heard her getting ready in our room while I was in the common area studying. When I came back, she was gone and so was the fake foundation bottle. It was moved like two inches to the left. I didn't see her until the next morning. She came stumbling in around 2 in the morning and I pretended to be asleep. The next day I had an early Saturday shift at the library, so I left before she woke up. When I got back around noon, she was sitting on her bed looking at her phone with the angriest expression I've ever seen. Her face was straight up orange, like traffic cone orange. It was so bad. She had clearly tried to wipe some of it off because there were streaks on her jawline, but it had already set into her skin. She looked up when I walked in and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. Did you notice anything weird about your foundation, she asked. Her voice was shaky like she was trying not to cry. I just shrugged and was like, know why? She showed me her Instagram and there were photos from whatever party she went. To last night, the flash made it even worse. She looked like an Oompa Loompa. People had tagged her in photos and there were comments with crying, laughing emojis. Someone literally commented, girl, what happened to your face with skull emojis. Everyone was staring at me all night. She said. I thought the lighting was just weird, but then I went to the bathroom and saw myself. People were literally laughing. I walked over to my desk and picked up the fake foundation bottle. Oh, weird. Maybe it oxidized or something that happens sometimes with makeup. She just stared at me. I could tell she was trying to figure out if I did it on purpose, but she couldn't prove anything. Yeah, maybe. She finally said she spent the rest of the day trying to scrub it off. The self Tanner had stained her skin so she was orange for like three more days. She had to skip her Monday classes because she was too embarrassed to go out in public. After that, she never touched my stuff again. Not my makeup, not my clothes, nothing. She barely even made eye contact with me for a week. Eventually things went back to semi normal, but she definitely Learned her lesson.

So I made sure she'd never do it again. So I had this roommate freshman year named Jess who literally could not understand the concept of personal space like at all. She'd walk into my room without knocking, eat my leftovers from the fridge. And worst of all, she kept using my makeup without asking. Not like a quick swipe of mascara either. I'm talking full face foundation, expensive eyeshadow, palettes, everything. First time I noticed I was getting ready for class and my favorite lipstick was just gone. Found it later on her desk with the cap off, completely dried out. I was annoyed but whatever. I said something and she was like, oh, my bad, I'll replace it, which she never did, by the way. Then it kept happening. My concealer would be half empty after the weekend. My brushes had different colored makeup on them that I definitely didn't use. One time I caught her red handed using my highlighter and she literally just laughed and said, you have such good taste. I couldn't help myself. I told her probably five or six times to stop. She'd always say the same thing that it wasn't a big deal and we're roommates so we share stuff. But I never agreed to share my makeup that I paid for with money from my campus job. She had her own makeup. It just wasn't as nice as mine because I actually saved up For quality stuff. The breaking point was when I came back from winter break. I had this foundation that cost me like $70. I know that sounds insane, but I have sensitive skin and it was the only one that didn't make me break out. I kept it in a specific spot on my desk. I got back to our dorm and immediately knew something was off. The bottle was in the wrong place. And when I picked it up, it was way lighter than it should have been. She'd used almost half of it while I was gone and she didn't even bother wiping off the rim. So there was dried foundation caked around the top. Was so mad I literally had to leave the room before I said something I'd regret that night. I came up with my plan. I went to the drugstore and bought the cheapest foundation I could find, like $3. Then I stopped by the makeup aisle and grabbed this self tanning lotion that was super orange. Back in my room, I mixed them together in the cheap bottle until it looked somewhat normal. Not perfect, but close enough that Jess wouldn't notice since she clearly didn't pay attention to details. I took my real foundation and hid it in my closet behind my winter coats. Then I put the fake.

If anything happened, I'd have it on video. And then I waited. A week passed. Nothing happened. I started to wonder if I'd been wrong. Maybe I really was just bad at parking. Then one night I checked the footage and I saw something that made my blood boil. At 2:00am, my neighbor walked into my driveway. He looked around making sure no one was watching. Then a truck pulled up, group of guys got out and right there in the dead of night, they started working on his driveway. But they weren't fixing it. They were expanding it onto mine. I watched in stunned silence as they ripped up the old boundary line, poured new asphalt three feet over onto my property and painted fresh white lines like it had always been that way. They even sprayed a new border on my driveway like they owned it. Couldn't believe what I was seeing. Who does that? Who just takes land like that? I was furious, but I kept my cool. I needed to handle this the right way. If I confronted him, he'd deny it. If I waited too long, he'd act like it had always been his. I copied the footage onto a flash drive and went straight to the city's property department. When I got there, I explained what happened. The guy at the counter gave me a look, the kind people give When they think you're exaggerating. Then I pulled out the house plans. Then I showed him the footage. He watched in silence. Then he picked up the phone. Within hours, a city inspector was at my house. He measured everything, compared it to the official records, check the footage, took a ton of pictures, and then he made some calls. By the afternoon, I had official confirmation my neighbour was in serious violation of city codes. And the best part, his car was parked on my stolen property. The inspector made a call. 30 minutes later, a tow truck pulled up. I was outside when my neighbour ran out, still in his slippers, watching his car get hooked up. What the hell are you doing? He shouted at me. I crossed my arms, taking my driveway back. He looked around, saw the city inspector, saw the officials. His face went pale. You can't just tow my car, he yelled. It's on my property, I said. The inspector cut him off. You move the property line. That's illegal. You need to remove everything you built onto his land immediately. My neighbor stammered, trying to argue, saying I didn't understand how property lines work, that I must have been confused. Then I pulled out my house plans. In the footage. He shut up real fast.

Every month it looked like the line was moving. I brought out my old house plans and measured 3 feet were missing. I've lived in my New Jersey house for over 20 years. Nothing fancy, but it's mine. When I bought it, I made sure everything was documented properly. Property lines ease it's boundaries, all the legal stuff. I didn't want problems down the road. My driveway was clearly mine. My neighbor's fence was his and the space between was a clear boundary. Simple, no problems. Until one day I pulled into my driveway and something felt wrong. At first I thought maybe I was imagining things. My driveway felt narrower. I wasn't sure why, but I had to park closer to my garage door than usual. It wasn't a big deal. Maybe I just parked weird that day. I let it go. Then it happened again and again. A few months passed and every time I came home it felt worse. I started second guessing myself. Was I losing my mind? Had my driveway always been this tight? I asked my wife if she noticed anything. She looked at me like I was crazy. You're just bad at parking. She said maybe she was right. I let it go until one morning when I was pulling out and my tire hit something, a hard edge that was completely new. I got out and looked. There was a fresh strip of pavement along the edge of My driveway blending into mine like it had always been there, but it hadn't. I squatted down, running my hand over it. The asphalt was smoother than the rest of my driveway. It was fresh. I glanced over at my neighbor's driveway. That looked new, too. It clicked. I didn't know how, I didn't know when, but my neighbor had stolen part of my driveway. I didn't say anything yet. I wanted proof. First went inside, dug through my old paperwork and pulled out the house plans from when I bought the place. My property line was clearly marked. My driveway hadn't moved. Something else had. I grabbed a tape measure, walked outside and measured 3 feet. Three full feet were gone on. I stood there, tape measure in hand, staring at my own driveway like an idiot. My neighbor had stolen three feet of my property and I hadn't even noticed until now. That night, I couldn't sleep. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, going over every possibility. Had I made a mistake? Was there some kind of property shift I didn't know about? Had I signed something and forgotten? No, that wasn't possible. I needed proof. The next day, I went out and bought a small security camera.

I watched the blue dot head downtown, then stop at Westfield Mall parking lot. I called my friend Chris. Pick me up right now. What's wrong? We're stealing my own car back. We found my civic outside Forever 21, right under a lamp post. Riley was inside shopping. I unlocked it with my keys, checked nothing was damaged and drove straight to. This is his house. His parents were out of town. We parked it in his two car garage, closed the door and Chris drove me home. I walked in at eight twenty three PM. Everything was quiet. Went upstairs, opened my textbook and waited. At nine o four PM, the house explodes. Loaded. Riley's voice downstairs panicked. Mom, dad, the car is gone! Footsteps pounding, mom screaming. What do you mean gone? I parked right there. Someone stole it. Dad shouting about calling police. Riley crying that I was going to kill her. I waited five more minutes, let them really panic, then walk downstairs, face completely neutral. What's going on? Why is everyone yelling? Mom's face was ghost white, hands shaking. Someone stole your car from the mall. The mall? Why was my car at the mall? Dead silence. I pulled out my phone, showing the tracking app. Oh, you mean when Riley drove my car, the one I specifically said she couldn't use, to the mall? That car? Mom's mouth opened, no sound came out. Where is it? Dad demanded, voice tight. What did you do? I took it back. Back at somewhere safe. You had us thinking it was stolen. Mom was furious. Now we were about to call the police. Do you know how scared we were? I looked at her calmly, like how scared I was when I came home and my car was missing with no warning three separate times. That's different. We're your parents, and it's my car that I paid for, that Riley doesn't have permission to drive. Dad stepped forward, face red. Give me the address. Now give me my keys. All of them. You're being ridiculous. Then you're walking to find it? The standoff lasted 30 seconds. Felt like an hour. Finally, mom walked to the kitchen drawer and pulled out both sets of keys. She slammed them on the counter there. Happy? I picked them up, checked both sets were complete, and texted Chris's address to myself. Held up my screen so they could see. It's at Chris's house, three blocks away. You're welcome to walk over and confirm it's not damaged. I went back upstairs, leaving them standing there in silence. Riley never asked to use my car again.

But I turn the tables with a surprise of my own. His reaction is priceless. I was turning 18 and honestly, I wasn't expecting much. My brother got a car for his 18th birthday. Not just any car. A brand new Jeep with a bow on top. My sister got a trip to Paris with two of her friends when she turned eighteen. Me dad pulled me aside exactly one week before my birthday and said, don't expect anything special this year. Money is tight. You know how it is. But I knew exactly how it was. Money wasn't tight. It was never tight when it came to them. Growing up, I always felt invisible in my own house. My brother was the golden child. Star quarterback, straight A's. Everyone's favorite. My sister was the baby, the princess who could do no wrong. And me? I was just there, taking up space. I remember being 12 and winning a regional science fair. I came home so excited to tell everyone my brother had just scored a touchdown at practice that same day. Guess which one got celebrated at dinner? Hint it wasn't the science fair. When I was 15, I made honor roll for the first time. I left the certificate get on the kitchen counter, hoping someone would notice. Three days later, I found it under a pile of my sister's cheerleading flyers. No One had said a word. So when dad gave me that warning about my birthday, something inside me shifted. I wasn't hurt anymore. I was done. I've been working at a local grocery store since I was 16. Every paycheck, I put away as much as I could. I told my parents the money was for college expenses, which wasn't exactly a lie. But I had a bigger plan brewing. Six months before my 18th birthday, I'd applied to MIT. I didn't tell anyone. Not my guidance counselor, not my friends, definitely not my family. I wrote the essays late at night in my room. I sent in my test scores, my transcripts. Everything in secret. Three months before my birthday, I got the email. Full academic scholarship. Full ride. They wanted me. I stared at that acceptance letter for hours, reading it over and over, making sure it was real. And then I saved it. I didn't tell a soul. I wanted to wait for the perfect moment. My birthday morning arrived. I came downstairs around 9 a m. Mom was making pancakes, but they were my sister's favorite kind, chocolate chip. My birthday breakfast had always been blueberry, but I guess she forgot. Dad was reading the newspaper. My brother was texting someone, probably his girlfriend. My sister was taking selfies with the pancakes before she even ate them. Morning, I said, sitting down at the table. Oh, happy birthday, sweetie, mom said, not looking up from the Stove. Dad glanced at me over his newspaper and gave a single nod. That was it. My brother didn't even acknowledge me. My sister took another selfie. No card on my

I ate my breakfast in silence, watching my family completely ignore the fact that I existed. And honestly, I felt nothing. No sadness, no anger, just calm clarity. After breakfast, I cleared my throat. I have something to show you all. My dad lowered his newspaper, slightly annoyed at the interruption. Mom turned around from the dishes. My siblings finally looked up from their phones. I pulled out my laptop and opened it on the kitchen table. The MIT acceptance letter was already on the screen, big and bold and undeniable. I got into MIT, I said calmly. Full academic scholarship, covers everything, tuition, room, board, books. The email came three months ago. The silence that followed was dead. Dad's newspaper slipped from his hands onto the table. Mom dropped a dish into the sink with a loud clatter. My brother's mouth literally fell open. My sister just stared. Three months, dad finally said. His voice barely a whisper. Got into MIT three months ago and you didn't tell us. I looked him straight in the eye. I figured you wouldn't care much. Money is tight, right? You know how it is. I watched his face go from pale to red. Mom started crying, covering her mouth with soapy hands. That's not fair, my brother said. Finding his voice, we would have celebrated. We would have, would have what? I cut him off, noticed me for Once put down your phone, actually remembered it was my birthday without me having to remind you. My sister looked down at her lap, tears starting to stream down her face. I'm moving out next week, I continued, my voice steady. I've already found an apartment near campus with two other incoming freshmen, paid first and last month's rent with money I saved from the grocery store. My bags are half packed upstairs. Dad tried to stand up, but his legs seemed to give out. He sat back down heavily. Son, we can talk about this. We can. There's nothing to talk about, I said, closing my laptop. I just wanted you to know that the kid you ignored, the one who wasn't worth a birthday gift, is going to MIT. Thought you should hear it from me. Before I disappeared, I stood up and walked toward the stairs. Behind me, I heard mom sobbing openly. Now I heard my sister whisper to my brother, we really messed up. We really, really messed up. Yeah, they did. As I reached my bedroom door, I heard dad call out my name. His voice cracked, but I didn't turn around. I had spent 18 years waiting for them to see me. Now I was done. Wait.

So I gave them a heart attack and stole my car back. I'm 20 and bought my 2019 Honda Civic myself. $14,000 saved from two years is working at target. Plus a 4 thousand dollar loan I'm paying off at 200 dollars a month. I pay the 180 dollars monthly. Insurance, gas, oil changes, everything. It's mine. When I moved home temporarily for nursing school, my parents asked for the spare keys just to move the car if it's blocking someone. They said we have to double park in our driveway sometimes. Made sense, so I handed them over. That's when things started getting weird. My odometer jumped 33 miles overnight when I hadn't driven anywhere. My driver seat was put way forward. I'm 5 10 9 and this was set for someone at least four inches shorter. Then I found a Starbucks cup in my holder. The pink drink with extra strawberries. My sister Riley's exact order. She's 17 with a learner's permit only. I asked mom directly, has Riley been using my car? She got defensive immediately. She needed to practice highway driving. Your father was with her both times. You should could have asked me first. We didn't want to bother you while you're studying. I explained slowly that my insurance doesn't cover drivers under 18. If Riley gets in an accident, I'm personally liable for everything. My premiums would explode. I could lose My car. Plus I need it for hospital clinical rotations three days a week. Mom waved me off. You're being dramatic. Riley's a good driver. Dad backed her up. It's family helping family. You're living here rent free. Stop being selfish. I found Riley and told her directly, please don't take my car without asking. She barely looked up from her phone. Mom and dad said, it's fine. You're not using it that much anyway. The next week, I came home from class and my car was gone. No text, no note, nothing. I waited two hours. When Riley finally pulled in at 9 p m, she had two friends. With her music lasting, they driven across town for Boba tea. I met her at the door. You took my car and drove your friends around? She rolled her eyes hard. Relax. Nothing happened. I went to my parents. I want my spare keys back now. Dad refused. That's too inconvenient. We need to move cars around. You're making a big deal out of nothing. It's my car, I paid for it, and you're under our roof! Mom snapped. Stop acting entitled. That's when I knew talking wouldn't work. I grabbed my old iPhone 6 from my drawer, the cracked one I'd replaced last year. Ordered a twelve dollar car charger on Amazon, downloaded find my friends and set it up. Then I hid the phone under the passenger seat, plugged in behind the floor mat. Three days later, at 6:47 p m. My lap

My mom called me fat my entire life. I got my period when I was 10 years old. Boobs came in, hips got wide. Normal puberty stuff. But my mom took one look at me and decided I was overweight. She started putting me on diets immediately. While other kids ate pizza at lunch, I had celery sticks and low fat yogurt. She dragged me to stores with names like pretty plus, bought me clothes from the Husky section even though I wore normal sizes. Every single shopping trip was torture. She'd hold up jeans and say things like, these should fit around your middle. I was 12. This went on for years. Every holiday dinner, she'd watch what I put on my plate. Every beach vacation, she'd buy me oversized t shirts to wear over my swimsuit. When I graduated high school, she bought me a gym membership as a gift. The card said, to a healthier you. I. I was 140 pounds and 5 foot 6. Then I got pregnant twice back to back. My son was born and 14 months later my daughter arrived. I gained 60 pounds total. My body was exhausted. I was running on three hours of sleep and living off whatever I could grab between diaper changes. Granola bars, leftover Mac and cheese from the kids plates, drive through burgers at ten PM. My mom had a field day. She started making comments every time she saw me. You really let yourself go. Don't you want to fit into your old clothes? She said this stuff in front of my husband at family dinners. Once at the grocery store, loud enough that the cashier heard. She bought me a book called Your Post Baby Body and left it on my kitchen counter. I started running 4 a m. Before the kids woke up. I ran every single morning for eight months straight. The weight came off fast. 70 pounds gone. I felt incredible.

One night I'm walking through to get water and I trip over the cord again. This time it unplugs and his laptop dies. He comes out the next morning freaking out because he had some paper due and didn't save it. I just shrugged and said I left his stuff where I found it. He got mad, but what was I supposed to do? They made the rule. But the absolute best moment was with the shoes. Jake and Becca left their shoes all over the living room rug constantly, like six pairs just scattered around. The closet was right there. But apparently walking 3 extra feet was too much work. I needed to vacuum one Saturday and I was so done with moving their crap. I rolled up the entire living room rug with all their shoes inside it, just wrapped them up like a burrito and set it against the wall. Then I vacuumed the whole house. Took me like an hour and I was almost done when Jake and Becca come out ready to leave. They start looking around all confused, asking where their shoes are. I'm vacuuming and I just yell over the noise. I Didn't move them. I left them where I found them. They're checking the closet under the couch by the door. Becca's getting annoyed because they're gonna be late. I finish vacuuming and start unrolling the rug to put it back. That's when all their shoes just tumble out onto the floor. Jake literally yelled, are you serious right now? And Becca called me a petty jerk. I just smiled and said I was following their advice. They grabbed their shoes and left all huffy. I thought they'd complain more, but honestly, after that, everything changed. Becca started keeping her bathroom stuff in Jake's room. Shoes actually made it to the closet. Tyler moved his laptop charging station to his desk. The kitchen stayed cleaner because suddenly everyone realised I might start leaving things where I found them with the dirty dishes too. Best part is Becca eventually moved out for real after her expensive hair stuff kept getting ruined.

A few months later, even those were loose. I could pull them off without unbuttoning them. One Sunday, I was at my parents'house for dinner. My mom was complaining about her own clothes.

A year later, I got engaged to a model from my high school, and now she's having a meltdown over the photos. I'm 35 now, but this happened when I was 33. I work in IT. Yeah, typical Reddit guy. And I've been dating Lexi for about eight months. She was stunning. Like the kind of woman who stops traffic. I'm talking 5 10 blonde. The type who gets approached constantly. Honestly, I always felt like I was punching above my weight. I'm decent looking, keep in shape. But she was on another level. The whole relationship, I had this nagging feeling that she was settling. The breakup was brutal. I came home early from work one day because I had a migraine. I needed to check my email, but my laptop was dead, so I grabbed hers from the kitchen counter. That's when I saw the messages. Three different guys, all recent, one from that morning. My hands were shaking as I scrolled through them. Flirty texts, plans to meet up. One guy asking when her boyfriend would be gone again. I felt physically sick. When she got home an hour later, I was still sitting there with her laptop open. She walked in, saw what I was looking at, and barely reacted. Just sighed, like I'd found out she forgot to buy milk or something. We need to talk, I said. She set down her purse and crossed her arms. Okay, let me save you the speech. Yeah. I've been seeing other people. I thought you knew. That's how this worked? I was stunned. How what worked? Come on, she said, not even looking guilty. Be honest with yourself. You're lucky you had me at all. Look at you then. Look at me. Did you really think I was going to be exclusive with someone like you? Those words destroyed me. Not just the cheating, the casualness of it. The way she said it, like it was obvious. Like I should have known my place. We broke up that night. She moved out by the end of the week, taking most of the good kitchen stuff with her. For months, I was a mess.

Turns out she's been living in New York, doing commercial modeling campaigns for skincare brands, some fashion work. Nothing huge, but. Daddy. She'd moved home to be closer to her parents. We met for coffee three days later. The second I saw her walk into that cafe, something clicked. She'd always been pretty, but now she was, I don't know, confident, radiant. And she was looking at me like I was the most interesting person in the room. That coffee turned into dinner. Dinner turned into a weekend hike with my dog. Within two months, we were inseparable. Six months in, I proposed at Lincoln Park. The same place where she'd apparently worked up the prudge to tell me she liked me back in sophomore year. I never knew. She told me after I put the ring on her finger. Both of us crying and laughing. Audrey's Instagram had blown up over the years. Not influencer level, but 500 K followers.

We need to talk, she says, pushing past me into my living room. Lexi, what are you. I saw your post. I saw her. She spins around. Audrey, the model? You're marrying her? I just stared at her. I made a mistake, she says, and now she's crying harder. I was wrong, okay? We were supposed to end up together. I was young and stupid. We can fix this. For a year, I carried her words around like a weight. That I was lucky to have her. That I should have known my place. I looked at her, standing in my apartment, falling apart. And I felt nothing. No anger, no satisfaction. Just tired. Lexi, I said quietly, be honest with yourself. You're lucky you had me at all. Then I opened the door and waited. She left without another word. Audrey asked who it was when she came over later. I just kissed her and said, nobody important.

She kicked me out saying find somewhere else to live or die. I don't care. You're useless now. Days later, the lawyer laughed. Did you even read the will? My wife went pale because the will said, when my father in law, Richard Hayes, died, I thought grief might finally humble my wife, Clarissa. Instead, it made her cruel. Richard was old school, built the business empire from scratch, worth over $33 million, plus a mansion on the hill that looked like something from a magazine. I sat by his bedside during his last months, feeding him soup, listening to his stories while Clarissa was too stressed to visit. When he passed, she didn't cry. She opened champagne. At the reading of the will, Clarissa wore a black designer dress that probably cost more than my car. She crossed her legs, smirked and waited for her name to be called. When the lawyer announced that she'd inherited everything, she didn't blink. She just said, well, it's about time. That night she looked me dead in the eye and said, you know what, Darren, you can leave now. I don't need you anymore. I thought she was joking. She wasn't. Three days later, I came home from work to find my things in garbage bags by the front door. What's going on, I asked. She didn't even look up from her phone. Find somewhere else to live or die. I Don't care. You're useless now. I just stood there, 7 years of marriage erased in a sentence. When I didn't move, she rolled her eyes. Don't make this dramatic. I'll Venmo you for gas. She handed me my car keys like she was tossing scraps to a stray. I left. No yelling, no begging, just violence. I drove to the Sunset Motel, $49 a night, flickering neon sign that said sue a mole instead of sunset. The carpet smelled like mold and bad decisions. I sat on the bed staring at the water stained ceiling and thought, Richard would never have wanted this. That's when it hit me. Richard planned everything. The man had color coded files for his sock drawer. Would he really hand $33 million to a daughter who couldn't even pay her own credit card Bill without crying? I remembered something he'd said six months before he died. We were watching an old war movie together when he turned to me and said, you're a good man, Darren, better than this family deserves. At the time I laughed it off, but now I wasn't so sure. So I called his lawyer, Charles Whitmore, old, sharp and all business. When I introduced myself, he almost dropped the phone. Darren, good heavens, where have you been? Your wife said you moved out of state and didn't want.

He stopped, looked at his client with dawning horror, and whispered, when exactly did you fire her? I was 31 when they started erasing me from APEX Digital Systems. Not with a pink slip or a meeting, just slowly, like I was a stain they were hoping would fade on its own. Derek, the 26 year old infrastructure lead who still asked me what DNS stood for, got my projects. Devon, our CTO, who hadn't touched a terminal in four years, took credit for my architecture designs and board meetings. I'd spent three years holding their systems together with duct tape and caffeine while they treated me like office furniture. The check in came on a Wednesday. Devon cornered me in the fishbowl conference room where everyone could watch. You've plateaued here, Sarah. No offense. Translation, we want you gone, but we're too cheap to pay Severance properly. They didn't fire me that day. Instead, they did something worse. They kept me around for two more weeks, making me train Derek on systems I'd built. I watched him sit in my chair, my snacks, and asked me to explain things I'd already documented. HR ghosted me. My manager minimized spreadsheets when I walked by. I went home each night and opened a folder I'd Labeled insurance. Inside were screenshots, emails, Slack messages. Get logs. Everything showing Devon stealing my work. Everything showing Derek was incompetent. And buried at the bottom, my. My original employment contract from three years ago, one clause caught my eye. Employee termination shall include full Severance documentation within 72 hours of formal notification. It. It had been nine days since Devon's check in. No paperwork, no Severance terms. Just awkward hallway smiles and my name disappearing from emails. That's when I remembered something I'd skimmed in a tech newsletter. Ohio had passed new employment laws. Something about Severance delays creating legal complications for companies. I started researching late into the night, and what I found made me smile for the first time in weeks. When they finally fired me on day 12, Devin was confident. Smug, even. He slid a non compete across the table. Sign this. That non compete means you don't touch a keyboard for a year. I read it. Care.

She what? He sighed. Son, you'd better come in tomorrow morning. There's something you need to see. I barely slept. By sunrise, I was sitting across from him in an office that smelled like mahogany and money. Charles slid a thick envelope toward me. This is the real will. The real will, I echoed. He flipped it open. Even upside down, I saw my name, primary beneficiary, Darren Morrison. I froze. That's impossible, Clarissa said. Charles smirked. Clarissa said a lot of things. Unfortunately, none of them were true. He adjusted his glasses and began reading aloud. The bequest to my daughter, Clarissa Hayes, is conditional upon her treatment of her husband, Darren Morrison. Following my death. Should she fail to treat him with respect and dignity, her inheritance shall be revoked and transferred to Mister Morrison. I blinked. So by kicking me out, she forfeited everything, he said, grinning. House counts, all of it. Richard was a meticulous man. He knew who deserved what. My heart pounded so hard I thought I might pass out. Charles leaned back, amused. Richard once told me his daughter was arrogant enough to hang herself with her own rope. Looks like he was right. That afternoon, the paperwork was signed. By sunset, her accounts were frozen, her cards declined, and every asset in Richard's estate bore one name, mine. When I drove back to the mansion, Clarissa was on the porch screaming into her phone. What do you mean My accounts are frozen. I have millions. Hello? Hello. I parked, stepped out and jingled a new set of keys. She turned eyes wide. Darren, what are you doing here? Coming home, I said. She blinked. You're lying. I handed her a copy of the will. She scanned it, her face draining with every line. When she reached the clause about respect and dignity, she swayed like she might faint. Charles's words echoed in my head. She hung herself with her own rope. And as she dropped the papers onto the marble floor, I smiled.

Data course scrambled. Their new compliance guy had been there three weeks and didn't even have the right clearances yet. The freeze came fast, $40 million locked down pending investigation. That's when they called the emergency board meeting at 903:00am. A federal agent in a gray suit walked into the boardroom. Sarah was there, dressed in her best blazer, ready to defend her decision. The CEO asked the agent to explain the situation. Sarah jumped in first, speaking confidently about their zero tolerance policy for behavioral infractions and how my termination was about professionalism, not performance. The agent said nothing. He just opened his binder slowly and read one sentence aloud. Clause 17 b sub section d, termination of named monitor during active audit cycle regardless of internal justification constitutes immediate breach of federal compliance protocol and triggers mandatory funding freeze. He looked up. Miss Martinez's clearance was active when you fired her. No succession was filed and you classified it as misconduct, which makes it worse. He closed the binder. You'll have a full review team here by Friday. Across the table, the company lawyer's pen slipped from his shaking hand and clattered to the floor. Sarah's face went white. The CEO opened his mouth, but no words came out. The agent stood up. Expect instructions within 48 hours. All communications go through external council now. Then he left. The CEO resigned two days later. Sarah was reassigned. By Friday, the funding freeze never lifted. It eventually grew to $60 million as more violations were uncovered. The best part, the government required Data Core to hire an external oversight firm with no conflicts of trust. I'd already registered my own consulting company. The day I was fired last week, I sent Data Core an invoice for $51,450 for federal compliance resuscitation. Today at 12:01 p. M, I ate a Turkey sandwich at my desk in my new office. When my assistant told me Data Core was calling, I smiled and said, tell them I'm eating.

Smiled. Three weeks later, I launched my own platform using completely original code I'd written on my personal time. It did everything APEX's system did, but better, because I'd actually built theirs, too. Within days, APEX sent a cease and desist. Then came the lawsuit. The deposition was in a sterile conference room downtown. Devin showed up in an expensive suit, looking like he'd already won. Their lawyer, a guy named Patterson, had a stack of papers proving I'd violated the non Pete. My lawyer, Maria, looked bored. She let them talk for 45 minutes. Patent infringement, breach of contract, trade secrets. Patterson was building his case brick by brick. Then Maria spoke. Mister Patterson, are you aware of Ohio Senate Bill 47, which passed on March 15th? Just humor me and read Section 3 C aloud. Patterson frowned, but complied. His voice filled the room. Any employer who delays Severance documentation beyond seven calendar days forfeits enforceability of all restrictive covenants, including non compete agreements. The room went silent. I watched it happen in slow motion. Patterson's eyes went wide. He looked down at his notes. Then Devon. His face went pale. Mister Reeves, Patterson said slowly, voice shaking, when exactly did you fire her? Devon blinked. March 22nd. Why? Patterson closed his folder. The statute became law on March 15th. You fired her March 22nd. You didn't provide Severance documentation until April 3rd. That's 12 days. Devon still didn't get it, so Patterson looked at his client with something between Horror and rage. So your non compete is worthless. We have no case. I didn't say a word. I just smiled. By morning, they dropped the lawsuit. By Friday, Devon was stepping away to focus on his health. By next month, my platform had four major clients. Turns out, when you're too arrogant to follow the law, you don't just lose. You hand your competition everything they need to bury you. And they did it to themselves.

He pulled out six tickets from his jacket pocket like a magician, revealing the final trick. Then he looked directly at me with this hopeful, almost desperate smile and said, one of these tickets is for you, son. I want you there. I want us to be a real family.

I thought about all those weekends, all those times she made me feel like an intruder. All the years he chose her comfort over my existence. Thanks, but I'm not going, I said.

I could see his wife's smug face, like she knew this would happen, like he'd won. So the sixth time he asked, I finally snapped. Because I hate your wife. The entire table went silent. You could hear forks hitting plates two tables over. His wife's face turned bright red. His mother gasped and put her hand over her mouth. His father just stared down at his plate. The three kids looked confused. And my dad, he just stared at me like I reached across the table and punched him in the face. How. How dare you? His wife stammered. After everything we've tried to do for you? Tried to do for me? I stood up. You told me I was ruining his happiness. When I was 12, you wanted me gone. Well, guess what? You got your wish. I walked out, left my mom's car keys with the valet, and called my stepdad to pick me up. Now his wife is blowing up my mom's phone, calling me a spoiled brat, saying I ruined their anniversary, that I'm tearing their family apart. But here's the thing. I didn't tear anything apart. They did that eight years ago when they decided their affair was more important than the family they already have.

No woman will want a selfish, cheap skin. You wasted four years of my life. My family has connections. You're done in this city. I forwarded it to my lawyer friend, just in case. Saturday, I'm measuring rooms when there's a knock. It's Thomas. Jessica's a mess. She really loves you. She loves the idea of someone paying her loans. You're throwing away four years over money. She threw away four years by making our relationship contingent on me paying her debts. He leaves saying I'll regret it. Doubt it.

At their anniversary dinner, he announced a family vacation. I refused, saying, I hate your wife. I'm 17. When I was 9, my dad left my mom for her best friend. Yeah, you heard that right. Her best friend. The woman who used to come over for wine nights and complained about her own marriage. Turns out she wasn't just complaining. They got married six months after the divorce and had three kids together in rapid succession. My dad fought for weekend custody, and honestly, at first, I thought maybe he actually wanted to spend time with me. I was wrong. Every weekend was the same. He'd pick me up Friday night, and by Saturday morning, I was just another kid in his new family. Breakfast with all of us, family movie nights, Sunday park trips with the whole crew. He never wanted time with just me. It was always about making me fit into his new perfect family. The worst part? He kept pushing me to call his wife mom. He'd correct me in front of everyone. That's your mom, too, now? No, she's not. She's the woman who destroyed my actual mom. He even went for full custody three times. Three times. Each time claiming my mom was unfit because she was bitter and turning me against him. The judge never agreed. But here's what I never told anyone. Not even my mom. His wife was awful to me. When he wasn't looking, she'd smile and play the perfect stepmom role when he was around. But the second he left the room, her whole face would change. One time when I was 12, she cornered me in the hallway and said, you're the only thing standing between your father and true happiness, right? If you really loved him, you'd just stay with your mom full time. I was 12. 12 years old. This grown woman was telling me I was ruining her life. After that, I started finding excuses not to go. Homework, friends, birthday parties, anything. When I turned 14, I finally told my dad I didn't want to come anymore. He tried to fight it, even attempted to get full custody again when my mom started dating my stepdad. But I told the court I didn't want to go. They listened. For three years, I barely saw him. He text, sometimes call on my birthday. But mostly, I think he was relieved his perfect little family didn't need the bitter reminder of his first marriage anymore. More than five days ago, my phone rang. It was my dad. He said it was important that I come to dinner. When I said no, he called my mom and threatened to take her back to court for parental alienation if she didn't make me go. So I went. It was at this fancy Italian restaurant. Both sets of grandparents were there. His three kids were dressed up like it was a holiday card photo shoot.

He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbour needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse.

Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing.

I'm already scanning the papers. Spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

His first album was releasing next month. He called us crying when he signed the contract. I stared at her. Mom, he almost died. She waved her hand dismissively. But he didn't. And maybe this will be the wake up call he needs. 26 years old, living like a teenager. This could be good for him. Good for him? My voice cracked. Yes. A chance to reevaluate his priorities. Maybe now he'll consider going back to school, getting his MBA like we wanted. That's when my dad stood up. His voice was quiet, but carried a weight I'd never heard before. Get out! My mom blinked. Excuse me? You heard me. Get out of this room. Get out of this hospital. Don't be ridiculous. I'm not being ridiculous. Our son almost died tonight, and you're standing here drinking a latte, talking about his career choices. I'm trying to be realistic. No, You're trying to be right. You've spent six years telling him his dreams don't matter, and now he's lying here, broken. And you still can't just be his mother. My mom's face flushed. I am his mother. Then act like it or leave. She looked at me, expecting me to defend her. I looked away. She left without another word. Door clicked shut behind her. Tyler woke up two days later. First thing he asked for was dad and me. Then water. He never asked about mom. She texted me once asking how he was. I left her on read

My mom looked at the wreck and said, well, maybe this will finally teach him to be useful. Tyler was in the I C. U. With a fractured spine and internal bleeding. The crash happened on Highway 9 around midnight. A drunk driver ran a red light and t boned him at full speed. Tyler's car flipped three times before landing in a ditch. The paramedics said if the airbag hadn't deployed, he'd be dead. If he'd been going five miles faster, dead. If the car had flipped one more time, dead. I got the call at 2 a. M. From the hospital. Didn't hesitate. I threw on clothes and drove straight there. When I arrived, Tyler was already in surgery. The nurse said they were stabilizing his spine and checking for brain damage. I called my parents from the waiting room. My dad answered on the first ring. I could hear the panic in his voice as I explained what happened. He said he'd be there in 20 minutes. My mom, she answered after six rings. Her voice was annoyed. Do you know what time it is? Tyler's in the hospital. Car accident. It's bad. There was a pause and she said, well, is he going to live? We don't know yet. He's in surgery. Call me when you know something concrete. I have Pilates at 7. She hung up. My dad arrived 15 minutes later, still in his pajamas. He Thrown a coat over them and driven barefoot. His hands were shaking as we waited for news. Three hours passed before the surgeon came out. Tyler was stable, fractured spine, internal bleeding, broken ribs, collapsed lung, but he'd live. He'd need months of physical therapy, but he'd walk again. My dad broke down crying right there in the hallway. My mom showed up at noon, still in her tennis outfit from her morning match, white skirt, matching visor, got a hair out of place. She had a Starbucks cup in her hand. She walked into Tyler's room like she was visiting a distant relative. He was still sedated, hooked up to machines, barely recognizable under all the tubes and bandages. She stood at the foot of his bed for maybe 30 seconds. Then she looked at me and said, is he awake? Not yet. I said, they have him sedate.

While my cousins performed like circus animals. Uncle Morty was a multi millionaire, but treated family gatherings like auditions. Every holiday, my cousins would bring carefully selected gifts, research his interests, and compete for most worthy. I'm paying for college for one of you, he'd announce, but only for whoever shows real character, not entitlement. Madison took unpaid internships at companies he invested in. Simon switched from art to finance because Morty mentioned he respected practical majors. They'd memorize his opinions and perform them back like trained parrots. Meanwhile, I worked at a hardware store and spent Saturdays rebuilding Mister Bean's car, the lime green 1977 Mini with the padlock on the door. Ruby doesn't participate much in family discussions. Morty would say during dinner loud enough for me to hear, I don't have much to add about stock portfolios. I'd reply, but I can explain why Mister Bean's mini needs custom suspension if anyone's interested. Silence was always beautiful. While my cousins performed interest they didn't have, I openly admitted I found his world boring and would rather talk about a comedy car. They spent weekends at his house pretending to enjoy golf. I worked double shifts and saved for community college while they argued about investment strategies. I Learned welding to fabricate custom parts. Why waste time on a joke car? Madison would ask, it's not a joke just because it makes people smile. I'd tell her. Morty would try to draw me in. Ruby, what do you think about the market? No idea. I'd answer honestly. But I figured out how to retro fit the original steering system, which is genuinely exciting. He couldn't figure out my angle because I didn't have one. I genuinely found his world uninteresting and was building my own path without his validation. The more my cousins competed, the more dismissive he became of them. The more I focused on my car, the more curious he got. Why Mister Bean's car? He asked once. Because it's iconic, mechanically interesting, and makes people happy. That feel.

Sophia's upstairs doing homework. Would you like to meet her? A 10 year old girl I'd never heard of living with my mother in law. Does Vanessa see her? Vanessa signed away her rights. Diane said simply she recognized her own limitations. That night while Tyler was in the shower, I went through his phone, found Vanessa's number in his locked contacts. I unblocked it and called. She answered on the first ring. Tyler? No, this is his wife. His pregnant wife. Just found out you exist. Silence and get out now. Tonight it happened. She took my daughter, her voice cracked, used my postpartum depression against me. Every doctor's note, every therapy session made me look unfit in court. My hands started shaking. I was tired and was struggling and I loved Sophia. Would have gotten better. She was crying now. Diane convinced Tyler to file for emergency custody. Said I was a danger. By the time I got a lawyer, it was too late. You could have fought with what money, what evidence? Diane documented everything. Every time I forgot to change a diaper fast enough, every time I needed help, she built a case while paying the support of grandmother. Where are you now? Three states away. I left before they could use my grief against me too. I was pregnant again. When the custody order came through, my throat closed up again. I ran, had my son alone in a different state. I changed my name. I see Sophia's photos sometimes on Diane's Facebook. She doesn't even remember me anymore. I looked at the doorway. Tyler was still in the shower. They're planning the same thing, I whispered. I know. That's why I'm telling you. Whatever you think you can fix, whatever you think you can negotiate, you can't. Diane doesn't compromise. She collects. I hung up as Tyler emerged from the bathroom. Everything okay, he asked. I smiled, just checking work emails. The next morning, I told Tyler I was going to my sister's for the weekend, last chance for girl time before the baby. I took everything I actually cared about, my grandmother's jewelry, the ultrasound photos, my documents. Full story link below and on my channel.

And it wasn't me. I was seven months pregnant when his mother, Diane, leaned across the Turkey and said, we've picked the perfect nursery set up at our house. I blinked. What do you mean your house? My husband Tyler smiled like he was announcing good news. Well, mom raised three kids perfectly. You've never even held a Newborn. The room went silent except for his sisters nodding in agreement. His father kept eating like this was normal dinner conversation. This is temporary, Diane said, cutting her ham with precise movements just until you learn the basics. Maybe six months, a year at most. I set down my fork. You want to take my baby for a year? Our baby, Tyler corrected. And nobody's taking anyone. Mom's just going to do the night feedings, the difficult parts. You can visit whenever you want. Is it my own child? We've already converted the guest room, the sister Michelle added. Got the crib, changing table, everything. I look at Tyler tell me this is a joke. He wouldn't meet my eyes. It makes sense. You work full time. Mom's retired. And honestly, with your anxiety issues. What anxiety issues? Diane reached over and patted my hands. Sweetheart. Tyler told us how you've been. The crying spells, the panic attacks about labor. First time mothers often aren't emotionally ready. I had cried twice, once watching a documentary about Nicklaus once when Tyler forgot our ultrasound appointment. I'm not giving you my baby, I said. The table went cold. Taylor's father finally looked up. Let's discuss this privately, Tyler said through clenched teeth. In the kitchen, he grabbed my arm. You're embarrassing me. Mom spent weeks preparing that room. I don't care about the room, Tyler. This is insane. My ex wife thought it was insane, too. The words came out bitter. Look how that turned out. I froze. What ex wife? His face changed. I told you about Vanessa. You said you had a girlfriend in college, not a wife. Not. A realization hit me. Do you have a kid? Ad he looked away. Vanessa wasn't stable. Mom had to step in. Step in. How? Full custody. It was better for everyone. My legs felt weak. Where's the child? Now with mom where she's safe and properly cared for. I walked back to the dining room. Everyone was watching me. Where's Tyler's daughter? I.

We were going to tell you, dad said, eventually when you were more mature. Mature enough for what to watch you drive my car. While I stood at bus stops in the rain, Melissa spoke again. Mom drives it to work every day. She tells people it's hers. My grandfather was on his phone. I'm calling my lawyer, dad, please, my father begged. We can fix this. Fix it. You stole from your own son. You let him think I forgot his birthday. That hit me hard. I thought you didn't care. I said to Grandpa last year when nothing came, I thought you'd forgotten me. His face crumpled. I called to wish you happy birthday. Your mother said you loved it, that you were so grateful. I looked at my mom. She couldn't meet my eyes. You lied to him, I said. You thanked him for a gift you stole. You let me think he forgot me while you drove around in my car. We'll transfer the title today, Grandpa said, right now. My parents tried every argument. They'd already invested in maintenance. They needed it for work. I didn't have my license yet, which was a lie. I'd gotten it at 18, paying for lessons myself with money from my grocery store job. Dad actually suggested I reimburse them for gas and Insurance. The audacity was breathtaking. Three hours later, the car was legally mine. Grandpa handed me the keys. I'm sorry they did this to you. That evening, my parents sat me down for the manipulation Olympics. We were protecting you from the responsibility. You would have crashed it. We were planning to surprise you. I packed a bag. That night. My grandpa helped me load the car, my car with everything that mattered. You can stay with me in Arizona, he said. Finish school there. As I backed out of the driveway, I saw my mom crying on the porch. My dad stood behind her looking hollow. Melissa texted me later. They're freaking out. Mom says you're ungrateful. I didn't respond. I just drove, windows down, music up in the car that was always supposed to be mine. Some gifts aren't just things. They're tests of character. My parents failed spectacularly. Two weeks later, they're still calling. I haven't answered. I'm too busy enjoying every single mile.

Did you like the car I sent you last year? I answered. What car? I didn't receive anything. My grandfather turned to look at my parents, who had pale faces, and chaos erupted. My grandfather flew in from Arizona, the first time I'd seen him in two years. We were having cake when he smiled and said, so did you like the car I sent you last year? I froze mid bite. What car? His smile faded. The Honda Civic. For your 18th birthday. I had it delivered to your parents house. The room went silent. I looked at my parents. My mom's face had gone completely pale. My dad stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. I never got a car, I said slowly. I've been taking the bus to community college for a year. My grandfather's expression shifted from confusion to something darker. He turned to my parents. Richard, Susan, where's the car? My dad cleared his throat. There must be some mistake, dad. No car was ever delivered here. Mistake. Grandpa pulled out his phone, scrolling rapidly. I have the receipt, the title transfer, the insurance I paid for the first year. $23,000. My mom started crying. Not sad crying. Panicked crying. 23,000, I whispered. For me. Grandpa showed me his phone. There it was. A red Honda Civic. Purchase confirmation dated exactly one week before my 18th birthday. Delivery address? My parents House. Where is it? Grandpa's voice was ice. My dad stood up. This is family business. We'll discuss it privately. No, I stood too. I'm family. Where's my car? Silence. Then my 16 year old sister Melissa spoke from the doorway, her voice small. It's in the garage, under the tarp. Everything happened fast. Grandpa marched to the garage, I followed. My parents scrambled behind us, both talking at once about misunderstandings and timing. Grandpa yanked the tarp off. There it was, the red Honda Civic with 14,000 miles on it. You've been driving it, I said to my parents. For

Years later, after I built a life they never expected, they returned demanding support, only to learn my wedding didn't include a single seat for them. My best friend, Michael died when I was 15. Car accident, no warning. One day we were planning our future. The next day he was gone. I couldn't process it. School felt pointless. I started skipping hanging with kids who didn't ask questions. I caught by cops one night with them. Nothing serious, but my parents treated it like I'd murdered someone. My sister Maddie stood behind them, arms crossed, smirking. She was the perfect one. Straight A's, honor roll, parents, entire world. I was the family embarrassment. At dinner the night before they shipped me off, my mom wouldn't stop praising Maddie's latest achievement. When I tried mentioning Michael, my dad cut me off. There's a time in place for your emotions, Ryan. Apparently that time never came. Next morning, they packed my bag. You're going to live with your grandparents until you get yourself together. Maddie watched from her bedroom doorway eating cereal. She didn't even pretend to be sad. The drive was silent when we pulled up. My mom barely got out of the car. My dad's goodbye. Don't make them regret this. No discussion. No how are you actually doing? Just go on the farm saved me. Grandpa and grandma didn't lecture. They just Put me to work. My uncle Scott lived there too. He'd left the family years ago when my dad became unbearable. He taught me carpentry, responsibility, how to show up. First week I messed up everything. Left gates open, dropped tools, couldn't lift feed bags properly. Scott never yelled, just showed me again. You're not stupid, he said one morning. You're just learning. There's a difference. That was the first time an adult treated my mistakes like they were fixable. I woke at 5:00am for chores, went to community college, came back for more work. No complaints, no drama, just steady progress. By 19, I'd finished community college, got a telemarketing job, worked my way to manager. By 23, met Hazley there. We started dating, then got serious. At 24, I bought land at auction. With every dollar I'd saved, three acres, nothing fancy but mine. That's when my family suddenly cared again. Maddie showed up first with three friends demanding to use my land for Instagram photos. When I refused, she stamped her foot. Wow, you're seriously telling me no? Her friends stared at her. On the drive home, she fake cried into the phone. He attacked me, mom.

Then my dad arrived, lecturing me about family loyalty and asking if I was sure I could handle owning land. Don't embarrass yourself, he added. My Uncle Scott shut him down. You dumped him here and drove away. You don't get to lecture now. When Grandpa had a health scare, my mom called sobbing, Ryan, you don't understand how hard this is for us. Not once did she ask how Grandpa actually felt. She kept repeating, this is happening to us. We're the ones suffering. Like Grandpa's heart issue was somehow about her stress. My dad got on the line. Someone needs to step up and keep things organized around there. He hadn't visited the farm in six years. Maddie tried stealing Grandpa's truck for a photo shoot while he was recovering. I blocked her. She flipped into victim mode, screaming that I was toxic. She reached for the keys anyway. I stepped in front of her. She immediately raised her voice so grandma could hear inside. You're still the same angry kid. I'm just trying to help and you're attacking me. Grandma came to the door. Maddie put the keys down. Maddie looked shocked that grandma wasn't defending her. 20 minutes later, my mom was on the phone accusing me of disrespecting Maddie. They kept showing up, demanding things, taking credit for my success. My dad told relatives sending him to mom and dad saved his life. We did what good parents. Do. A cousin sent me a voice recording from a family gathering. My dad was taking full credit for my turnaround, acting like abandoning me with some brilliant parenting strategy. Hearing him rewrite history made something harden in me. When Hazley and I got engaged, we planned a small ceremony on the farm. Grandpa walked her down the aisle. Grandma did flowers, got set up chairs. We sent no invitations to my parents or Maddie. No phone call, no explanation, just silence. Words spread fast. My mom melted down to relatives. I was robbed of my son's wedding after everything I've done for him. My dad played the betrayed father. Maddie posted online about fake family loyalty. Grandpa shut it all down. They weren't invited for good reason. The ceremony was small, warm, real. Hazley looked happy in a way that made everything worth it. They wanted credit for abandoning me. I gave them exactly what they earned, nothing.

My brother's wife, Valerie, had always been jealous of my daughter, Mia. Every time Mia talked about school, Valerie would stiffen or interrupt her. Her son, Liam was sweet, but school wasn't his thing. Valerie saw Mia's achievements as threats. I picked Mia up from their house after a late meeting. She was quiet the whole drive home. When she lifted her shirt, I saw it, a deep purple bruise under her ribs. Through tears, she told me she'd gotten 98% on her science quiz. She showed it to Liam, hoping they could study together. Valerie saw the paper and said, science doesn't matter unless you're going to be a doctor. Later, when Mia went to get her backpack, Valerie followed her into the hallway. Stop showing off, Valerie told her. You're making Liam feel stupid. Then she hit her hard enough to leave the bruise. I grabbed my keys and drove straight to urgent care. They documented the bruises, asked if she felt safe. A nurse quietly made a call. By the time we left, the report was filed. That night, my phone rang five times. My brother Chris. I didn't answer. I called a lawyer instead. Dana Marks walked me through everything, getting me A statement recorded contacting CPS, filing for a restraining order. She warned me it would get ugly. When I finally answered Chris call, I told him to come over without Valerie. I showed him the urgent care report. His hands shook, reading suspicion of child abuse. Are you really involving the police? He asked. They're already involved. I. A week after the CPS visit, another parent contacted Dana. Her daughter had come home from Valerie's house with a bruise, too. Same story. Got too loud playing inside. Valerie lost it. She never reported it. Now she wanted to help. A pattern was forming. When police interviewed Valerie, she claimed Mia was lying. I'm telling you she made it up. He insisted. Her mother is unstable and jealous of our family. But we had photos, medical records and two witnesses. Then Chris's mother in law called. I recorded her. She said Valerie admitted everything. We filed for a restraining order, granted immediately. Valerie wasn't allowed near Mia or our house. Two more parents came forward. She scared my son, one parent said. We stopped sending him over. One kept a journal with exact dates. Dana called it gold.

Five years I poured every spare dollar into paying off my parents 680 thousand dollar mortgage. I worked double shifts while my younger brother Dylan coasted through college on a full ride he barely earned. Every school trip, every jacket, every ounce of attention went to him. I was the invisible child, the reliable one expected to figure everything out alone. While they celebrated his mediocre achievements, my father's auto shop failed. I found unopened bank letters in their kitchen. The house was weeks from foreclosure. Late fees had stacked up for months. I could have walked away. Instead, massive transfers left my account every month. My promotions, my raises poured into saving their house. My father talked constantly about his sacrifice, fighting every day to keep this family home standing. He'd tell relatives my name never came up. My uncle Edward insisted we sign a trust.

When the final payment cleared after five years, I expect did acknowledgement, maybe a dinner instead. My father called, no greeting. We're gifting the house to Dylan as his graduation present. My mouth went dry. Dad, I paid that mortgage for five years. Stop making everything about money. This is about his future, not your ego. And you're not invited to the party. I don't want your bitter attitude ruining his big day. He hung up three days later. I showed up anyway. The house I'd saved was wrapped in string lights with Dylan's name on a banner. Inside, relatives congratulated him on his new home. My father stood by the fireplace, soaking in the attention. I held this house together through sheer will and sacrifice. Now I'm proud to give my son the foundation he deserves. Relatives clapped. My mother smiled. Dylan accepted praise like he'd earned it. No one mentioned my name.

Our neighbor Martha watched from her window. She'd never seen him look so small. An hour later, a tow truck arrived for Dylan's BMW, three months behind on payments. Early guests watched in silence as it was hauled away. Dylan stood on the lawn, speechless. I arrived with Patrick and Edward. Patrick set one folder down. The trust will be enforced. You have 30 days to remove your belongings. The locks will be changed and law enforcement will escort you out if necessary. My father stared. You can't do this. I'm your father. Actually, she can. She paid for it. You signed Documents giving her that right when you needed her money. My mother started crying. Riley, please, this is our home. It was until you decided it was Dylan's. Now it's mine. My parents moved to a rental across town. Dylan found roommates who judged him by his work ethic. The complaint started. Within weeks. House became mine legally, finally, truly. Calls went unanswered. Messages painting me as cruel stayed unread. I told relatives who questioned me that I was done being judged by people who watched me disappear for years without saying a word. The turning point wasn't the officials arriving. It was when I stopped volunteering to be invisible so everyone else could stay comfortable.

They blamed me for ruining my sister's life. In a car crash when I was 17. She destroyed Jane's future. Mom told the crowd, she's dead to us. I stayed quiet, then asked one question that made everyone turn to stare at her instead. Accident happened when I was 17. Jane was 19, home from college. We went to a party, and she'd been drinking. She handed me her keys around midnight. I was sober. The designated driver. The intersection was dark. The light was green. A truck ran the red light at 60 miles per hour. The impact shattered Jane's femur, crushed her pelvis, left her with permanent nerve damage. Her Julliard scholarship disappeared, along with her ballet dreams. Nobody asked what color the light was. Nobody asked if I was sober. Mom found Jane's hospital bracelet showing 0.08 blood alcohol and decided I was responsible. You let her drink. You were behind the wheel. The police report said the other driver ran a red light, failed a sobriety test. His blood alcohol was 0 point 15, twice the legal limit. He served 18 months for vehicular assault. Mom didn't care. She needed someone to blame, someone she could control. I was 17, scared, desperate for approval, an easy target. Jane screamed at me to get out of her hospital room. Mom told me to stop coming. She convinced me to defer my full Scholarship to Michigan State to help with Jane's recovery. One year became three. By the time I enrolled, the scholarship was gone. I paid with loans and part time work. Jane never spoke to me unless forced. She look through me at family dinners like furniture. Mom seated me at the far end of the table. Stopped celebrating my birthday. Introduced me as the daughter who lives in Michigan to avoid saying my name. 13 years of exile. 13 years of being the ghost they blamed for a drunk driver's crime. When Jane's wedding invitation arrived, I almost threw it away. I went. During the four hundred dollar navy dress she'd approved. I sat near the kitchen doors, far away from the rest of my family. During dinner, mom stood up. She wasn't scheduled to speak. She looked directly at me. Most of you know Jane overcame a terrible tragedy at nineteen. An accident that ended her dancing dreams. The room went quiet. What many don't know is who was responsible. My other daughter, sitting right there, was driving. She destroyed Jane's future. Someone gasped.

I stood up and walked to the center of the room. What color was the traffic light? Mom blinked. What the traffic light? What color was it when we entered the intersection? You were driving. The police report says the other driver ran a red light. He was going 60 in a 35 zone. Failed a sobriety test. Blood alcohol 0.15, twice the legal limit. I pulled up the PDF on my phone, the police report I carried for 13 years. The accident was ruled his fault. He served 18 months. Insurance paid Jane's medical bills. This is public record. I turned to the room, 60 faces stared back. I was 17. I did everything right. I was the designated driver. I obeyed traffic laws. The light was green. A drunk driver hit us on Jane's side. I looked at mom. You never asked what happened. You saw Jane's injuries and decided I was guilty. You made me defer college. You treated me like a criminal. You erased me from photos. You stop. I stopped celebrating my birthday. My voice cracked. I was 17, mom. I was your daughter. I was hurt, too. I needed you and you abandoned me because it was easier to blame someone than accept that terrible things just happen. Jane was crying. She turned away. I came, hoping enough time had passed. But instead you humiliated me in front of everyone. I picked up my purse. I'm done apologizing for Something that wasn't my fault. I'm done being the ghost at your table. I walked out. Nobody stopped me. Three months later, Jane called. Mom and dad were in therapy. Would I be willing to talk? I said maybe. Six months after that, Jane flew to Detroit. We met at a coffee shop and talked for three hours. She told me about the guilt she'd carried, how she'd hidden behind Mom's anger because facing the truth meant admitting she destroyed her own dreams by drinking. The rebuilding was slow. Some relationships never recovered. But Jane asked me to be godmother to her daughter two years later. I said yes. The weight is gone, that crushing burden of unearned guilt I carried from 17 to 30. I didn't get my family back entirely, but I got the truth acknowledged. And sometimes that has to be enough.

One month later, she saw me with her friend. Not so friendly. Two weeks after everything was finalized, I reached out to a woman who'd been part of our Social Circle for years. One of my ex wife's friends, actually. During my marriage, I'd noticed she paid attention to things my wife never did. She'd remember details about my work, ask thoughtful questions, and actually listen. When we met for coffee, she said something that caught my attention. Honestly, I always thought you deserved better. She never seemed to appreciate what she had. We started meeting regularly. Coffee turned into dinner, dinner turned into long conversations. She was everything my ex wife wasn't. Attentive, genuine, actually interested in building something real. Meanwhile, my ex wife's messages became more frequent and pointed, asking what I was doing and who I was spending time with. Through mutual friends, I Learned she'd been busy during our month apart, seen with at least three different guys, including one who'd been sniffing around during the last year of our marriage. The timeline made perfect sense. She'd wanted a friendly divorce so she could explore her options without guilt, while keeping me available in case none of her prospects worked out. By the fifth week, my new girlfriend had practically moved into my place. We decided to stop being discreet. Why should we hide when we weren't doing anything wrong? The explosion happened at a barbecue. Two weeks later. My ex Wife showed up agitated, drinking more than usual. She'd clearly been stewing about seeing us together at previous gatherings. Suddenly, she stormed over and announced loudly, this is ridiculous! You two think this is appropriate? Flaunting this relationship like some kind of victory lap? The entire party went silent. I kept my voice calm. What exactly is inappropriate about two single adults dating? That broke whatever restraint she had left. Single? We just got divorced.

But we were supposed to remain friends. I paused, then delivered the response I've been saving for exactly this moment. Friends don't ask for divorce so they can explore other options while keeping their ex husband as a backup plan. You wanted to be free to do whatever you wanted with whoever you wanted. Congratulations. You got exactly what you asked for. The silence was deafening. People were processing what I just said, connecting the dots about her real motivations. You've been out with multiple guys while texting me about maintaining our friendship, I continued. That's not friendship. That's keeping your options open. She looked around desperately hoping someone would defend her, but everyone just stared. This isn't over, she said, pointing with a shaking finger. I looked at her calmly. Actually, it is. You ended it when you asked for the divorce. Everything that's happened since has been your choice. Own it. She stormed off without saying goodbye to anyone. The next day, I made my final decisions, blocked her number and social media, removed anyone who'd been playing both sides. My girlfriend had been offered a promotion requiring a move to another state and we decided to take it. Two weeks before we left, I ran into a former mutual friend. He mentioned my ex wife had been asking everyone about my plans, finally realizing her safety net was Disappearing permanently. Apparently, she'd been struggling with the guys she'd been dating. Turns out men willing to pursue a freshly divorced woman aren't usually looking for anything serious. As we loaded the last boxes into the truck three months after her friendly divorce request, I felt genuine excitement about the future.

Dad put his fork down. You're staying home starting Monday. No school until you apologize to Dylan for humiliating him. Mom nodded. Eyes glassy. Dylan leaned back, arms crossed, hiding his victory grin. I took a slow breath. All right, Dylan smirk faltered. Mom blinked. Dad opened his mouth, then forgot his lecture. I walked upstairs and closed my door softly. Inside, the anger roared, but I was done fighting a rigged battle. Morning arrived with pounding on my door. Dylan shoved past me, stopped dead at my empty closet. Bare hanger swung. Two suitcases sat zipped beside my desk. His face went red. What the hell did you do? He bolted downstairs. I followed. Dylan grabbed my laptop and spun it toward them. Georgetown Prep Tori Academy, full merit scholarship awarded immediate acceptance. Mom's spatula clattered. Dad froze. Dylan's voice cracked. Please tell me you haven't posted it yet. Dad put down his mug. Posted what? I finished the confirmation last weekend. I said all they needed was the guidance signature. Uploaded Friday. Mom found her voice. You are not leaving this house. Actually, I am. Dad stood fast over my dead body. You're 17. 17 years, 10 months, 6 day DC law Allows students over 17 with a full ride to sign enrollment forms without parental consent. Dylan laughed. You're making this up. Google it. Mom stepped forward. We're not paying one cent. Don't have to. Tuition, room, board, books, plane ticket, everything's covered four years. Dad's face shifted to fury. Then you're cut off. No car, no phone, no college fund. I shrugged. Phones on my own plan. Cars in my name. The college fund was never going to be mine anyway. Silence. Dylan stared at the screen. Boarding check in Tuesday. That's in two days. Correct. Mom started crying. Dad's fists clenched. You walk out that door, don't ever come back. I met his eyes. That's the plan. You're bluffing. I pushed past Dylan. Watch me. I climbed the stairs. Nobody followed behind me, only mom sobs and coffee dripping to understand why we have to go back. Dylan cornered a sophomore in the parking garage. By the time I got there, Ryan was on the ground, face bleep.

What's the greatest thing you've achieved by swapping places? My brother Derek and I have been pulling switches since we were 5 years old, substituting for each other at dentist appointments, covering bad haircuts, confusing every teacher we ever had. But this one swap changed both our lives forever. Three years ago, Derek was working as a junior analyst at this financial consulting firm downtown. He'd been grinding there for two years, staying late every night, basically living off vending machine coffee and broken promises from his boss. This guy, Vincent, was the definition of a credit thief. Derek would spend weeks on reports and presentations and Vincent would slap his own name on everything before sending it up to the partners. Derek was miserable, but he needed the job. Student loans don't pay themselves. One Thursday night, he calls me in a panic. His girlfriend may, had just gone into labor three weeks early. He was at the hospital freaking out because Vincent had scheduled a massive client presentation for Friday morning. Derek had built the entire pitch deck himself, 67 slides, two months of research. If he missed it, Vincent would absolutely destroy his career. Cover for me, he said. Just sit in the meeting and click through the slides. Vincent does all the talking. Anyway, I told him he was insane. I knew nothing about financial consulting. I sold car insurance for a living. Please is, he begged. May needs me here. I can't leave Her. So Friday morning, I'm sitting in a conference room wearing Derek's suit, which was slightly too tight in the shoulders, pretending to understand words like leveraged buyout and EBIT margins. Vincent walks in, all smiles, slapping my back, calling me sport, which apparently he did to Derek constantly. The clients arrive, three executives from some tech company looking to restructure. Vincent launches into the presentation like he built the whole thing himself, just clicking slides, staying quiet, trying not to breathe too loud. Then one of the executives interrupts. She points at a graph on slide 42 and asks how we calculated the depreciation model. Vincent freezes. I mean, completely freezes. The man has no idea because he didn't build any of this. He looks at me and goes, Derek, why don't you walk them through your methodology? I almost threw up right there. But here's the thing. Derek had talked my ear off about this project for.

I almost threw up right there. But here's the thing, Derek had talked to my ear off about this project for months. Every dinner, every phone call. It was all appreciation models and amortization schedules. I'd absorbed way more than I realized. So I started talking. I explained the three tier approach Derek designed, walk through the assumptions and the contingencies. I even answered two follow up questions using phrases I heard Derek say 1 hundred times. The executives were nodding, taking notes. One of them said, this is exactly the kind of detailed thinking we were hoping for. Vincent's face went pale. He tried to jump back in but kept stumbling over basic terms. At one point he called a liability an asset and one of the executives actually corrected him. After the meeting, the senior partner pulls me aside. She says, I'm impressed with your work on this. Vincent mentioned you assisted, but this presentation has your fingerprints all over it. We should talk about your future here. I just nodded and said thank you, ma'am. Then I got out of that building as fast as humanly possible. That night, Derek's daughter was born, 7 pounds, 4 ounces. He named her Lily. When I told him what happened in the meeting, he couldn't believe it. Monday morning, Derek walks into work expecting disaster. Instead, the senior partner calls him into her office. She done some digging over the weekend. Check the meta data on all of Vincent's recent presentations. Every single one had been created and edited entirely by Derek. Incident was fired by lunch. Two weeks later, Derek got promoted to senior analyst. Six months after that, he made associate. The senior partner told him she'd been watching him ever since that Friday presentation. When he finally spoke up and showed what he was capable of, he never corrected her. Neither did I. Last Christmas, Derek handed me an envelope. Inside was a check for $20,000. He said it was my cut of his first year bonus. I tried to give it back. He wouldn't take it. You didn't just cover one meeting, he said. You got me out from under that guy. You showed them who actually did the work. I'd still be making copies for Vincent if it wasn't for you. I kept the cheque, used it as a down payment on my first house. Derek's a director now, corner office and everything. Sometimes when I visit him at work, his colleagues ask if I'm the famous twin who saved the Peterson pitch. I just smile and say, I have no idea what you're talking about.

What's the greatest thing you've achieved by swapping places? My brother Derek and I have been pulling switches since we were 5 years old, substituting for each other at dentist appointments, covering bad haircuts, confusing every teacher we ever had. But this one swap changed both our lives forever. Three years ago, Derek was working as a junior analyst at this financial consulting firm downtown. He'd been grinding there for two years, staying late every night, basically living off vending machine coffee and broken promises from his boss. This guy, Vincent, was the definition of a credit thief. Derek would spend weeks on reports and presentations and Vincent would slap his own name on everything before sending it up to the partners. Derek was miserable, but he needed the job. Student loans don't pay themselves. One Thursday night, he calls me in a panic. His girlfriend may, had just gone into labor three weeks early. He was at the hospital freaking out because Vincent had scheduled a massive client presentation for Friday morning. Derek had built the entire pitch deck himself, 67 slides, two months of research. If he missed it, Vincent would absolutely destroy his career. Cover for me, he said. Just sit in the meeting and click through the slides. Vincent does all the talking. Anyway, I told him he was insane. I knew nothing about financial consulting. I sold car insurance for a living. Please is, he begged. May needs me here. I can't leave Her. So Friday morning, I'm sitting in a conference room wearing Derek's suit, which was slightly too tight in the shoulders, pretending to understand words like leveraged buyout and EBIT margins. Vincent walks in, all smiles, slapping my back, calling me sport, which apparently he did to Derek constantly. The clients arrive, three executives from some tech company looking to restructure. Vincent launches into the presentation like he built the whole thing himself, just clicking slides, staying quiet, trying not to breathe too loud. Then one of the executives interrupts. She points at a graph on slide 42 and asks how we calculated the depreciation model. Vincent freezes. I mean, completely freezes. The man has no idea because he didn't build any of this. He looks at me and goes.

For three years, my parents told me my online best friend was probably a predator. They demanded I block her, threatened to take my computer, called me naive and stupid for trusting someone I'd never met in person. Her name was Petra, and we met in a grief support forum when I was 15 after my grandmother died. She was 17 and had just lost her dad. We talked every single day. She helped me through panic attacks at 2:00am, she proofread my college essays. When my parents screamed at each other downstairs, she stayed on video call with me until they stopped. My parents refused to believe she was real. Nobody is that nice online without wanting something. You're being groomed. Block her or we're taking your laptop. I didn't block her. I just got better at hiding our friendship using apps they didn't know about, calling her during lunch at school. Petra became my lifeline. Through my parents divorce, through switching schools junior year, through everything. When I turned 18, I told my parents I was flying to meet her for a weekend. My mom laughed in my face. Fine. When you end up dead in a basement, don't say we didn't warn you. She didn't even look up from her phone. My dad just shook his head like I was beyond saving. I flew to Portland anyway. Petra was exactly who she said She was. Same face from video calls, same laugh, same obsession with weird documentary films. We spent three days exploring the city, and I'd never felt more understood by another human being. We made plans to be roommates after college. Fast forward two years. I'm 20, working full time, sharing an apartment with Petra in Seattle. My parents divorced, got finalized, and suddenly they both wanted to be in my life again. Separately, of course. My mom came to visit first. She walked into our apartment and immediately asked who my roommate was. Mom, this is Petra, the online friend you told me was a predator for three years. My mom's face went through about six expressions in two seconds. Oh, well, you can't be too careful these days. No apology? Nothing. Petra smiled politely and excused herself to her room. My mom spent the whole weekend making little comments. She seems nice enough. I suppose you got lucky. Most online people aren't who they say they are. Never once acknowledged she was wrong. Then my dad visited a month later. Same thing. I introduced Petra, mentioned she was the friend he threatened to call the police about, and he just shrugged. Well, how was I supposed to know? You were a kid making dangerous choices. On his last night, we all went to dinner together. My dad ordered a third beer and started talking about how hard the divorce was, how lonely he been. How he was thinking about Trying online dating. I watched him scroll through matches at the table. Petra excused herself to the bathroom, and I leaned forward. Isn't it interesting that you're willing to meet strangers from the internet now, but when I did it at 15, you told me I'd end up dead. He didn't even look up from his phone. That's different. You were a child. I was a grieving child who found the only person willing to actually listen to me. And you tried to take that away because you were too lazy to actually check if she was real. He finally looked up. What was I supposed to do? Fly across the country to verify your internet friend? You could have

She called me a jerk and cut me off. I stopped paying. What happened next will shock her forever. My sister Vanessa is four years older than me. Growing up, she was the favorite. She got the new clothes, the bigger room, the car. At 16, I got whatever was left over. I never complained because I figured that was just how things worked. When I was 22, I started a small business fixing computers. I worked out of my apartment at first, then rented a small office, then hired two employees. By 26, I was doing pretty well. Not rich, but comfortable. Vanessa was not doing as well. She bounced between jobs, dated guys who borrowed money and never paid it back and moved apartments every year because something was always wrong with the landlord or neighbors. Three years ago, she called me crying. She was about to be evicted and had nowhere to go. She asked if I could help just this once. I said yes. Her rent was 2,500 a month. I set up an automatic transfer to her landlord, figuring it would be temporary, maybe three or four months until she got back on her feet. But three months turned into six. Six turned into 12. 12 turned into 3 years. I never asked for the money back. I never complained. I just kept paying because she was my sister during those three years. Vanessa never once said thank you. She would call to complain about her life or ask for extra money for utilities, groceries or car repairs. She would tell me about the vacation she was planning or concert she was attending. I would listen and send more money when she asked. Last month, I called to tell her I was getting married. Her name is Julie and she's the best thing that ever happened to me. Vanessa's first question was where the wedding would be. When I said a small venue outside of town, she said it sounded cheap. When I told her our budget was around 15,000, she laughed and said it was embarrassing. Friend just had an 80 thousand dollar wedding. Then she got quiet and asked if I was still going to pay her rent after I got married. I said I hadn't really thought about it. She got angry. She said I was being selfish, prioritizing some woman I just met over my own family. I reminded her I've been paying her rent for three years without asking for anything in return. She said that was different. She said I had the money and she didn't. She said it was my responsibility as her brother to take care of her. I asked when she was going to take care of herself. She called me a jerk. She said Julie was turning me into a selfish person. She said she didn't want to talk to me anymore. Then She hung up. I sat there staring at my phone, thinking about every payment I'd made, every time I helped her move, every time I listened to her problems. $90,000 over three years. And he called me a jerk for asking when she would stand on her own. That night, I logged into my bank account and canceled the automatic transfer. I didn't call or text. I just stopped paying. The first month came and went. Vanessa never paid attention to when things were do. The second month, her landlord called her. She texted asking what happened to the. I didn't respond. She called me 14 times that day. I didn't answer. She left voicemail saying I was ruining her life, that I was petty and cruel. On the third month, she was evicted. She moved in with our parents and told everyone in the family that I abandoned her for no reason. My mother called me crying, asking why I stopped helping Vanessa. I told her the truth. I've been paying 2,500 a month for three years. She went quiet.

Anything. And he kept saying my name like he was talking directly to me. She wouldn't look at me. Riley. Watch this part. Riley, make sure you stretch like this. I took her phone. The time stamp gap.

I opened her phone settings, recent devices logged in. My blood went cold when I saw it. Peterson's laptop had accessed her account at 6:18 this morning. He'd remotely deleted his own message before anyone could wake up and report it. Riley, do you still have the notification screenshot? She looked confused. What? What? When you got the video, your lock screen would have shown a preview before you opened it. Did you screenshot it? Her eyes widened. She started frantically scrolling through her photos. I screenshot everything. In case my battery dies during practice. I need the schedules accessible offline. Oh, god. There it was. A notification preview showing Coach Peterson's name. Timestamp, 11:47. And the first frame of the video. You couldn't see much detail, but you could see enough to know something was very wrong. We need more, I said. If he sent it to you, he probably sent it to others. Riley's hands were shaking. Worse now. Violet. She's been weird all week. Make eye contact in the locker room. And Bryn stopped coming to practice on Tuesdays. I grabbed my laptop and Opened a clean browser. What's Violet's number? Riley hesitated. They'll think I'm crazy. What if they didn't get anything? What if it was just me? Then we'll know. But I don't think it was just you. Twenty minutes later, we had three more screenshots. Three more girls. Violet at 11:51, Bryn at 11:39.

Petra became my lifeline through my parents divorce, through switching schools junior year, through everything. When I turned 18, I told my parents I was flying to meet her for a weekend. My mom laughed in my face, fine, when you end up dead in a basement, don't say we didn't warn you. She didn't even look up from her phone. My dad just shook his head like I was beyond saving. I flew to Portland anyway. Petra was exactly who she Said she was. Same face from video calls, same laugh, same obsession with weird documentary films. We spent three days exploring the city and I've never felt more understood by another human being. We made plans to be roommates after college. Fast forward two years, I'm 20, working full time, sharing an apartment with Petra in Seattle. My parents divorced, got finalized, and suddenly they both wanted to be in my life again. Separately, of course. My mom came to visit first. She walked into our apartment and immediately asked who my roommate was. Mom, this is Petra, the online friend you told me was a predator for three years. My mom's face went through about six expressions in two seconds. Oh, well, you can't be too careful these days. No apology, nothing. Petra smiled politely and excused herself to her room. My mom spent the whole weekend making little comments. She seems nice enough. I suppose you got lucky. Most online people aren't who they say they are. Never once acknowledged she was wrong. Then my dad visited a month later. Same thing. I introduced Petra, mentioned she was the friend he threatened to call the police about and he just shrugged, well, how was I supposed to know you were a kid making dangerous choices. On his last night, we all went to dinner together. My dad ordered a third beer and started talking about how hard the divorce was, how lonely he been, how he was thinking About trying online dating. I watched him scroll through matches at the table, excuse herself to the bathroom, and I leaned forward. Isn't it interesting that you're willing to meet strangers from the internet now? But when I did it at 15, you told me I'd end up dead. He didn't even look up from his phone. That's different. You were a child. I was a grieving child who found the only person willing to actually listen to me. And you tried to take that away because you were too lazy to actually check if she was real. He finally looked up. What was I supposed to do, fly across the country to verify your.

She said I was being selfish, prioritizing some woman I just met over my own family. I reminded her I've been paying her rent for three years without asking for anything in return. She said that was different. She said I had the money and she didn't. She said it was my responsibility as her brother to take care of her. I asked when she was going to take care of herself.

I was the only one she insisted sleep in the basement. At the estate meeting, I finally Learned what was hidden down there. Aunt Claire died on a Tuesday. By Wednesday, my cousins were already talking about her stuff. Derek wanted the house. Vanessa wanted whatever cash was left. My mom just wanted to go through Claire's photos one last time. The funeral was small, 12 people. Claire never married, no kids. Just after the service, her lawyer pulled us aside before we discussed the estate. Claire left specific instructions. Each of you must spend one night alone in her house, no exceptions. Derek laughed. That's weird, even for Aunt Claire. Vanessa rolled her eyes. When do we have to do this? The lawyer checked his notes. This week, pick your nights. We drove to Claire's house that afternoon. It was a small ranch style place built in 60s, nothing fancy. Derek immediately claimed the master bedroom. Vanessa took the guest room. My mom said she'd take the den. That left me standing in the hallway. The lawyer cleared his throat. Nathan, your aunt specifically requested you sleep in the basement. My cousins looked at each other. Eric actually laughed out loud. Of course, she stuck him down there. The basement was unfinished, concrete floors, exposed pipes, one bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. There wasn't even a real bed, just an old futon. That smelled like mildew. I went on Thursday night. The house felt different, empty. I kept hearing the furnace kick on the floors creaking. Around midnight, I tried to sleep, but the futon was uncomfortable and the light bulb was too bright, right. I got up to look for a lamp. That's when I noticed something odd about the wall. There was a section of concrete that looked newer than the rest, lighter coloured. I knocked on it, hollow sound. I pushed on it and a panel shifted. Behind it was a crawl space, maybe 3 feet deep. I turned on my phone, flashlight, boxes stacked floor to ceiling. I pulled the first one out. Inside were bank statements, all of them in Derek's name. I didn't understand at first. Then I saw the transactions. Withdrawal 2000, withdrawal 15, withdrawal 3,000, all from Claire's checking account, all signed by Derek. I opened another box, credit card statements in Vanessa's name, but the billing address was Claire's house. The charges were insane. Designer clothes, expensive dinners, a weekend in Miami, $30,000 over two years, all on cards Vanessa opened using Claire's information. There were more boxes, printed text messages, screenshots of conversations. Derek and Vanessa had a group chat. I read through them feeling sick. They called her the cash cow, made jokes about her dying, complained when she asked them to visit. One message from Derek said, just keep pretending to care. She's got to have at least 200 k Saved up. There was a folder at the bottom labeled for Nathan. Inside was a letter in Claire's handwriting. If you're reading this, you found my insurance policy. I started documenting everything 6 months ago when I realized what they were doing. I needed someone to find this first, someone who wouldn't hide it. I trust you to do the right thing. I'm sorry I had to put you in that awful basement. I love you. I took photos of everything, carried three boxes upstairs. Didn't sleep at all. The estate meeting was.

Two weeks later, she filed, then backtracked when her plan backfired. The signs were everywhere, but I was too stupid to see them at first. My wife, Sophie, had suddenly become obsessed with our finances. After 11 years of marriage where she couldn't care less about bank statements, she was suddenly asking detailed questions about my investments, my retirement accounts, even my late grandfather's inheritance. The breaking point came when I found a notebook hidden in her car. Pages of handwritten calculations. Asset divisions, property evaluations, my business worth. At the bottom of one page, in her handwriting, community, property, state, 50% minimum. More with good lawyer. My hands were shaking when I photographed every page and put it back exactly where I found it. That night at dinner, Sophie smiled at me like nothing was wrong. How was your day, honey? All I could think about was that notebook. Calculations. The cold, surgical way she'd written out how to take half of everything I'd spent 15 years building. I didn't confront her. I did something smarter. The next morning, I called my old college roommate, Marcus, now a divorce attorney in another state. I need advice, and I need it quiet. Within 48 hours, I had a legal strategy. Every move carefully documented, every step defensible. I started with the business, my software company, that I'd founded before we even met. I restructured it, making It clear that assets pre dating the marriage were separate property. Then I quietly moved my grandfather's inheritance into a separate trust, exactly as his will had originally specified. All perfectly legal, all documented with time stamps and legal justifications. The joint accounts were trickier. I couldn't just drain them. That would look bad in court. Instead, I methodically documented every expense, every time Sophie bought designer handbags with my earnings. Every spa weekend, every girl's trip to Cabo. I wasn't being petty. I was building a case. Two weeks after I found that notebook, Sophie came home, looking nervous. She sat me down with this rehearsed speech about how we'd grown apart, how she needed to find herself, how this was best for both of us. I want a divorce, she said, not quite meeting my eyes. I nodded slowly. Okay. I'll have my lawyer contact yours. Her face lit up, not with sadness, with relief. She even let a small smile slip. That's when I knew I'd made the right call. Her lawyer sent the initial filing three days later. The demands were breathtaking. Half of everything, including my business, spousal support for five years, the house, even my grandfather's inheritance that she'd never been entitled to. My lawyer's response was a work of art. 47 pages detailing every asset move I'd made, every legal justification, every time stamp proving these were legitimate business decisions made before any divorce filing. We attached the photos of her

And when I went to confront him, he ended up plowing deep into me. I'm 43. My son is 19. This happened on Monday, Two days ago. I had just finished working out in our gym basement. I took a quick shower to clean myself. I went to my room, applied lotion, all the normal stuff. The first thing I noticed was the red blinking of the camera. I don't know what it was at first. It was a blinking light under my mirror. So I went and checked and then I saw the lens. The camera is a knockoff GoPro. I got him years ago and we were on particularly hard times and I couldn't afford the real thing. He's a skater. He wanted to record himself. So I got him this off eBay and surprise, it still works. And here it was in my bedroom recording me fully exposed. I panicked and turned it off. I figured out how to see the videos on it and watched my son place the camera down where it was hidden. It was so weird seeing him there. It was even weirder realizing he was putting the camera there to see me exposed. It was scary. It was weird, but it was also made me feel excited in a way. I deleted the video. I didn't want to talk to him about it that night and the video would have shown me Discovering the camera so he'd know old now. So I just deleted it. It was the easiest option. I put the camera back in its hiding. I got and got dressed in my P J s, then left my room for long enough for him to get the camera. When I came back, it was gone. He then messaged me to come to his bedroom. Press share and more for part 2.

We had barely moved for the last hour. I was bored, so I started playing with my boyfriend's pee pee through his swim trunks. He got hard, so I untied his trunks and put my hand down his pants and started stroking him. My friend in the front seat turned around to talk to us and saw what I was doing. Damn, silk couldn't even wait until we got to the action. She teased her boyfriend, turned around and looked, too. I'm sure he'd like it a lot more if you put your mouth on it. I had never considered giving a BLW JB in front of other people before, but in the moment, I realized that the idea was turning me on. I had been blowing my boyfriend a lot lately and had gotten pretty good at it, so I wanted to show off my S K L L S. I asked if I could pull it out of his pants. And he said yes. I stroked him a little longer while the others watched. Eventually, I dropped my knees down to the floor and started sucking his teepee. I was wearing a bikini and my S S. Was facing the guy on my left. Everyone in the car was really into it and cheering me on. Emily started smacking my SS and telling me how hot I look. I grabbed the hand of the guy behind me and put it on the other side of my SS. They each had a cheek and were rubbing and squeezing them while encouraging me. As I kept sucking, I noticed that the other guy was getting closer and closer to my wimp with his hand. I was really hoping he would slip a finger under my bikini and play with me, but before I could get that far, my boyfriend came in my mouth. This was just the beginning of a pretty wild trip. I crossed off a lot of firsts that week, which included effing in front of other people, showering with another couple while they eff, and oral with another girl.

That's what my crush said right to my face with a smile. She had no idea what those words did to me. And that wasn't the first time. Zoe had been destroying me with compliments for two years straight. We met in chemistry class. She needed a pencil. I gave her one. Somehow that turned into study session, late night phone calls, inside jokes nobody else understood. She told me things she didn't tell anyone. I was her person, just not the way I wanted to be. You're my favorite person. Knife. I wish more guys were like you. Twist. You're like the brother I never had. Bury me. Every time she said something like that, I'd smile and nod, then go home and stare at my ceiling wondering what was wrong with me. My boys had zero sympathy, bro. Just tell her you've been friendzoned for two years. Either shoot your shot or move on. They were right. I knew they were right. But knowing and doing are two different things. Then Saturday came, big party at Peter's Place. So we was going. I spent the whole day hyping myself up. Tonight was the night. No more excuses, no more what ifs. I was going to tell her how I felt. I got to the party around 10, had a drink to calm my nerves, then another half. Texted my boy from the bathroom, I can't do this. He replied instantly, yes. You can stop being a punk and go find her. I splashed water on my face, looked in the mirror, told myself to stop being pathetic, walked out, scanned the room, found her by the kitchen talking to her two best friends. She was wearing that jacket, the one I told her looked good on her a couple of weeks ago. She remembered my chest did something stupid. I started walking toward her. Each step felt like I was moving through water. This was it. Two years of wondering, two years of what if today, hey, I was going to get an answer. I got close, close enough to hear her voice. She was talking about someone. It sounded serious. Her friend asked her something I couldn't quite catch. Then Zoe laughed, but it was a nervous laugh, almost bitter. I can't. I could never date him. He's too important to me. I'd rather die than ruin what we have. I stopped walking. Everything around me just disappeared. The music, the people, all of it, just those words playing over and over. I didn't need to hear anything else. I turned around and walked straight out the front door. Didn't say bye to anyone. Just left. The next two weeks, I barely talked to her, kept my texts short. Busy became my favorite word I could and keep pretending. It hurt too much being around her, knowing I'd never be more than her brother. She noticed, asked if I was Okay. I said, yeah, just stressed with school. She didn't push it, but I could tell she knew something was wrong. Then she showed up at my house, no warning, just knocked on my door. I opened it and she was standing there, arms crossed, eyes red, like she'd been crying. What is going on with you? I tried to play it off. Nothing. Just been busy. Stop. Her voice cracked. Don't lie to me. You've been dodging me for two weeks. What did I do? I wasn't ready for that. You didn't do anything then why does it feel like I'm losing my best friend? I broke. I couldn't hold it anymore. I heard you at the party talking to your friends. Her whole face changed. What did you hear? Enough.

I told her to keep doing it. My wife, Selena is the kind of woman who blushes when someone says damn and covers her eyes during kissing scenes in movies. She wears cardigans to the beach and thinks holding hands in public is too much PDA. In five years of marriage, she's never even told a dirty joke. My sister loves to make jokes and calls her the nun behind her back. Always made me laugh. My sister Ava moved back to our hometown three months ago after her divorce. She and Selena were never close. Awkward small talk at holidays, nothing more. Ava was everything. Selena wasn't loud, crude, zero filter. So when Ava showed up at our door one Friday night while I was already in bed, I figured Selena would make an excuse and send her home by 9. I woke up at 3:00am to laughter, real laughter, the kind I never heard from Selena. Found them on the couch, wine bottles everywhere, Selena's cardigan on the floor. We're bonding, Selena giggled. Her cheek were flushed. After that night, everything shifted. First, it was the texts. Selena, who usually took three hours to respond to anyone, was suddenly glued to her phone. She'd smile at the screen, typing fast. When I asked who she was texting, she'd say just Ava and flip the phone over. Then came the lunches. Every Tuesday and Thursday, Selena started taking two hour lunch. Breaks, Ava and I are grabbing salads, say, but she'd come back with her hair slightly messy, her lipstick gone, smelling like Ava's perfume. The clothes changed. Next, Selena bought a dress, an actual dress with a slit up the thigh. She wore it to dinner. When Ava came over, I watched my sister's eyes follow my wife across the room. Selena noticed and smiled. Two weeks later, I found them doing each other's makeup in our bathroom. Selena was sitting on the counter, Ava standing between her legs applying lipstick. They jumped apart when I walked in. Girl stuff, Ava laughed. Selena's hand was on my sister's waist. The movie night started in month two. Every Friday, they'd watch movies in our basement. I'd hear Selena squealing, actually squealing at the romantic scenes. She used to cover her eyes for once. I went down to check on them. They were sharing a blanket, Selena's head on Ava's shoulder. They didn't even notice me. Selena started saying my sister's name in her sleep. Not occasionally, every night, Ava, she whispered, then smile. Last week, I woke up at 2:00am and Selena wasn't in bed. Her location showed Ava's apartment. She came home at midnight the next night. Her shirt was inside out, reeking of my sister's body wash. Yesterday, I came home early from work. Through the window, I saw them with Victoria's Secret bags holding up lingerie sets, black lace. My stomach turned seeing my sister like that. I Immediately turned away because you. But what killed me was Selena, who wouldn't even change with the lights on, modeling lingerie for Ava, spinning for her approval, letting my sister's hands adjust the straps against her body. Does this look good? Selena asked, practically glowing. When I actually walked towards the door, they heard my footsteps and went into the room. They walked out like nothing happened. Tonight, Selena's phone buzzed at 2:00am. She grabbed it, whispered, I'm coming and started getting dressed. I pretended to be asleep. She put on the lingerie under her coat and headed for the door. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to know what the hell to continue. Tap the arrow in the bottom right corner and copy the link. Then tap the CapCut icon in the bottom left. Finally, click the red button. My father's gaze was locked on the rugged road ahead, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. I tracked them.

I've been telling myself I'm straight for 23 years. I had three girlfriends, lost my V card to a girl at 17, never once looked at a guy that way until him. We met two years ago when the housing office randomly paired us. First week, I thought he was just a cool guy to live with. He's 21, studies architecture, plays guitar badly, but doesn't care. He came out to me six months ago on a random Tuesday. We were eating pizza and he just said, I'm gay. I said, cool and asked if he wanted the last slice. Nothing changed between us, or so I thought. Last Tuesday, we were at target buying groceries. I was looking at pasta when this girl walked up to him. She was stunning, long, dark hair, exactly the type I used to date. She smiled and asked for his number. He politely said he had someone. She apologized and left. I felt this wave of relief wash over me. Then fusion, why did I care? On the drive home, he asked why I was so quiet. I lied and said work was stressful, but my hands were shaking on the steering wheel. I gripped it tighter, hoping he wouldn't notice. That night I couldn't sleep. I laid there staring at the ceiling, replaying that moment, the way my chest tightened when she touched his arm, the satisfaction I felt when he said No. I told myself I was just being a protective friend. But I've had best friends before and never felt like this. Wednesday morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee. He'd made me a cup, two sugars, no cream, exactly how I like it. He remembered from one conversation we had three months ago when I mentioned it once. My ex girl, girlfriend of two years never remembered how I took my coffee. I sat there drinking it and watching him make breakfast. He was humming some song I didn't know. His hair was messy from sleep. He was wearing my old college hoodie that I thought I lost looked better on him. That thought scared me more than anything. Thursday, we went to the gym like we do every week in the locker room. He was changing his shirt. I've seen him shirtless hundreds of times, but this time was different. I caught myself staring at the way his shoulders moved, the line of his collarbone. Some guy walked past and made a comment about his body. I felt this anger surge through me, a possessive rage I've never felt over anyone, not even my ex. When guys hit on her Friday night, he asked if I wanted to watch a movie. We sat on the couch and he fell asleep halfway through. His head ended up on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm fell asleep, but I didn't care. I just sat There listening to him breathe. At one point, he shifted closer and I felt my heart racing. I realized I was playing with his hair without thinking about it. Saturday, his ex boyfriend showed up unannounced. They dated for eight months last year. He's everything I'm not confident. Openly gay, knows exactly who he is. They went outside to talk.

I discovered my daughter Harley was sneaking a boy into her room every night. When I checked our ring camera footage looking for a package thief, instead of finding someone stealing Amazon boxes, I found Zachary Vaughn climbing through her bedroom window at 1:00am. Like some wannabe Romeo, this kid was bad news. With his vape pen hanging from his mouth and pants bagging below his tiny peppino and gumballs, I knew Zachary from around the neighborhood. He was 19 and still hung around the high school parking lot trying to impress freshman girls with his souped up Honda Civic. Last month I'd seen him get arrested for shoplifting energy drinks from the gas station. He'd also been fired from three different fast food jobs for showing up high. This was definitely not the kind of guy I wanted near my 15 year old daughter. The footage showed this had been going on for two weeks, right? Every night at the same time, Zachary would climb the tree next to Harley's window and slip inside. They'd stay in there with the lights off until about 4:00am when he'd sneak back out. My blood was boiling, but I knew if I confronted Harley directly, she'd just get to defensive and keep seeing him in secret. I spent the next few days planning my approach while pretending I knew nothing. I watched Harley at dinner acting Like the perfect daughter, while knowing she was lying to my face. She'd say she was tired from studying when really she'd been up all night with that loser. I had to bite my tongue when she asked for money for school supplies that I knew she was probably spending on whatever Zachary wanted. On Friday, I put my plan into action. I went to the grocery store and bought the most expensive steaks they had along with all the fixings for a romantic dinner. I set up our dining room with candles and Harley's mom's good China that we only used on holidays. I even bought fancy cream sodas in glass bottles and put them in ice buckets like they were champagne. That night, I waited in the kitchen watching the ring camera feed on my phone right on schedule. Zachary appeared at 1:00am, climbing up the tree in his usual uniform of ripped jeans and a wife beater. I gave them 20 minutes to get comfortable, then headed upstairs with the biggest smile on my face. I could hear giggling and rustling sounds coming from Harley's room. I knocked twice and opened the door without waiting for an answer. Harley shrieked and pulled her blanket up to her chin while Zachary literally fell off the bed trying to pull his shirt back on. They both looked at me like I was about to commit murder, but I just stood there grinning like I'd won the lottery. Perfect timing. Dinner's ready downstairs. I made steaks, I said in my most cheerful voice. Harley's face went from terrified to confused, while Zachary just sat on the floor with his mouth hanging open. Neither of them moved. So I clapped my hands together and added, come on now, don't let it get cold. I've been cooking all evening. They followed me downstairs in complete silence. Harley kept trying to catch my eye, but I just hummed to myself like this was totally normal. Zachary was stumbling over his own feet and pulling at his shirt like he was trying.

It's from my phone number. Changed our minds. Just want it to be me and hubby for the cruise. Don't bother coming. My stomach drops. I check my sent messages. The text is there. Sent at eleven forty three PM. I was asleep by 10:30. I start scrolling through my message history.

My husband checks my phone's app history, then my iPad. Your iPad sent those texts? Didn't you lose it last week? I tell him I left at my mother's House. During Sunday dinner. I'm at my mother's house. Twenty minutes later, she opens it while holding a new designer handbag. Someone canceled my anniversary cruise, I say, pushing past her into the kitchen. Someone who had my iPad. I don't know what you're talking about, she says, pouring coffee from a brand new espresso machine I've never seen before. I stare her down. $14,000 was refunded somewhere. Where did it go? How would I know about your finances? She says, but won't meet my eyes. I noticed the new granite countertops, the new state stainless steel appliances. You remodeled your kitchen? I say slowly. Dad got a bonus, she says too quickly. My dad's been retired for two years. I call him right there and then. He's confused. What bonus

I look him in the eyes and mile, no, he can sign it over. And I'm still pressing every charge. Three weeks later, final hearing. He shows up in an expensive suit, crying, telling The judge, he's changed. He loves his kids. He made a mistake. The judge looks at him, then looks at my kids medical records showing they'd both lost weight. Looks at the bank statements showing $2,800 monthly deposits. Looks at the receipts I subpoenaed showing he'd spent $4,000 on his girlfriend and birthday trip the same month he was feeding our kids oatmeal. Full custody to mother, supervised visitation only. And, Mister Harrison, you'll be paying back every cent of child support you misuse, plus damages. His girlfriend left him and posted everything on social media. His friends won't talk to him. His own mother called me to apologize and cry. And my kids, they're eating three real meals a day now, with vegetables and protein and dessert. And they're finally smiling again, like they used to.

Sweetie, I'm on a plane. Is your dad still there? She says, no. He dropped them off, told them to wait and drove away. I told him about this trip two weeks ago. He agreed to keep them the extra three days. I even have the texts. I call him 20 times. Straight to voicemail. I'm panicking. My hands are shaking. Finally, on the 21st call, he answers. What? He says, annoyed. The kids are outside my house in the rain. Go back and get them right now. He goes quiet. Then he says, they're technically yours this week, according to the agreement. I can hear music in the background. Laughter. Please, I'm begging. Now there are seven and nine. It's freezing. He laughs. Actually laughs. I have reservations at 8:30.

Dad wanted my older brother, Tyler. Said he needed a son to carry on his name. Mom insisted on keeping my baby sister, Lily. She was only 4, too young to be without her mother. I stood there waiting for someone to say my name. They never did. Dad packed Tyler into his truck. That night, mom took Lily to our grandmother's house in Oregon. Neither of them looked back at me. Stand in the doorway. I waited three days in that empty house. I ate crackers and cheese. I slept with every light on. Missus Patterson, next door, finally noticed. She found me crying in the backyard, talking to our cat. Because I had no one else. The social worker came that afternoon. She had kind eyes, but I could see the pity. I Learned to hate that look. I bounced through seven foster homes in ten years. Some were okay. Most weren't. The Hendersons locked the pantry at night. I Learned to hide granola bars under my mattress. Mrs. Burke told me I was Too ugly to ever be adopted. I was eleven. The Carters only wanted the monthly check. They bought a new TV the same week. They told me I couldn't have seconds at dinner. I aged out of the system at 18 with $340, a garbage bag of clothes and a full scholarship to culinary school. My grades were my escape. I worked doubles at a diner while getting my degree.

I told her maybe we should think about something a little more understated since it's a wedding. She got defensive immediately asking what was wrong with her dress. I explained that at weddings you're supposed to let the bride be the center of attention and wearing something that bright might pull focus from her. She rolled her eyes and Said I was being ridiculous. Bride is gonna be in white, so how could a red dress compete with that? I told her it's not about competing, it's about being respectful.

Orange cones everywhere, signs saying one lane only. We were about halfway across when I heard it. A sound like thunder, but wrong. Deep and grinding. The kind of sound that makes your stomach drop before your brain catches up. The bridge started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a heavy truck passing, but the shaking got worse.

Every summer, my family held the lottery where one kid would disappear to work the farm. Not visit the farm. Work it. From June to August. No contact, no visits. Just gone. We thought everyone's family did this until I mentioned it at school and my teacher's face went pale. The ritual was simple. All the cousins, aged 10 to 16 would gather at Grandpa's house Memorial Day weekend. He'd put our names in his old coffee can and draw one. That kid packed a bag and left with Uncle Pete to the property upstate. We'd see them again Labor Day. Thinner, quieter, with rough hands and hollow eyes. It builds character, the adult said. Teaches the value of hard work. My cousin Sarah went when she was 11. Came back barely speaking, flinching at loud noises. Just tired from farm work, her mom explained. Sarah never talked about that summer. None of them did. My brother Marcus got picked when he was 13. I remember him trying not to cry as Uncle Pete loaded his bag into the truck. See you in September, he whispered to me. When he came back, he had scars on his hands and wouldn't sleep without the lights on. What happens at the farm? I asked him once. We work, was all he'd say, staring at nothing. The thing is, we never questioned it. Every family had traditions, right? My friend Jenny's family made kids fast. For three days when they lied. Tyler's dad made him kneel on rice when he got bad grades. This was just our thing. I got picked when I was 12. The coffee can ritual. My name on the yellowed paper. My stomach dropped, but I didn't cry. Crying meant you were weak. And weak kids had harder summers. That's what Marcus had whispered to me. Uncle Pete barely talked during the four hour drive. Just smoke cigarettes and listen to talk radio. The farm wasn't what I expected. It was more like a compound. Several rundown buildings. No animals. Just fields of some plant I didn't recognize. There were other kids there? Not just cousins. Kids I've never seen before. Maybe 15 of us, all different ages. We slept in a barn with no windows on moldy mattresses. Wake up was 4:00am. The work wasn't farming. It was processing, cutting, drying, packaging plants in a sweltering shed. My hands. Blood. The first week from the repetitive cutting. Meal was once a day. Usually beans and stale bread water. When they remembered, where did these plants go? I asked another kid, shut up and work, he said. Questions make it worse. Two weeks in,

Seven years later, she bragged she had it all. I smiled back. Have you met my husband yet? I'm 34 now, living in Seattle. But seven years ago, I was planning a wedding in Boston. My fiance was everything on paper, successful, charming, came from money. We've been together three years when he proposed with a ring that cost more than my car. My younger sister seemed thrilled for me, always asking about wedding details, offering to help with vendor meetings when I had to work late. Then I came home early one Thursday, found them on our couch. My sister and my fiance tangled together like they've done this 100 times before. Turns out they had five months of sneaking around while I picked out flower arrangements and tasted wedding cakes. The trail didn't just break my heart, it shattered my entire sense of reality. My sister didn't even apologize, just said some people are meant to be together, that I should be mature about it. They got married three months later in a courthouse ceremony that somehow still made the society pages, moved into the penthouse I was supposed to live in, started posting photos of their perfect life, every vacation, every charity gala, every designer bag, all carefully curated to show the world what she'd won. I fell apart completely. Lost 15 pounds I couldn't afford to lose, stopped showing up to family dinners because I couldn't stomach Seeing them together, my therapist said I needed a fresh start, somewhere without constant reminders. So I applied for a marketing position in Seattle and left everything behind. First year was survival mode. I worked obsessive hours because going home to my empty apartment felt worse. Ate take out alone most nights, ignored my sister's increasingly elaborate social media posts. My parents would call and awkwardly update me, your sister's doing well. They bought a house. She seems happy. Each update felt like another knife. But slowly I started healing, made actual friends through a book club, got promoted twice, started running again. Therapy helped me understand that their betrayal said everything about them and nothing about my worth. I stopped checking my sister's Instagram, stopped defining my life by what I'd lost. Then two years ago, I attended a tech conference downtown, sat next to this guy, James, during a panel discussion. He was quiet, asked thoughtful questions, didn't try to dominate the conversation. We grabbed coffee afterward and talked for three hours. He mentioned he worked in venture capital but didn't name drop or flex, just spoke passionately about supporting innovative startups. Our first few dates were refreshingly normal, neighborhood restaurants, long walks, actual conversations. He never tried to impress me with money or status. When he finally told me about his investment firm's success, it was almost apologetic, like he was worried I'd see him differently. That's when I knew he was different from my ex in Every way that mattered. We dated for two years. He met my parents during a trip to Boston, carefully scheduled when my sister was out of town. My dad pulled me aside after dinner and said, this one's genuine, kiddo. Hold on to him. James proposed on a random Tuesday evening in our apartment. No grand gestures, just honest words about wanting to build a life together. The ring was elegant but understated, perfect. Last month, my mom passed away after a short.

Not just any watch, white gold GMT Master with an engraving on the back, the kind of thing you don't just misplace. I'm home from community college for the holidays. My mom's decorating cookies. Rachel's taking selfies by the tree. Everything feels normal until my dad walks into the living room holding the empty watch box. Where is it?

My mom stops what she's doing. Rachel puts down her phone. They both look at me. My stomach drops because I can already see where this is going. I haven't touched your watch, I say.

I wasn't going through anything, I say, my voice rising. I was Looking for printer paper. She shrugs like she doesn't believe me. My dad's face hardens. This isn't a joke, Liam. That watch is worth more than your car. If you took it, you need to tell me now I didn't take it. I repeat, I swear I didn't touch it. My mom shakes her head. You've always been secretive, always hiding things. Now this, Rachel, adds fuel to the fire. He's probably trying to sell it for cash. You know, he's been talking about starting some business thing. My dad stares at me for a long moment. Then he says the words that change everything, pack your things. You're not staying here anymore. I think he's bluffing at first, but he's not. He stands there, arms crossed, waiting. My mom doesn't say anything to stop him. Rachel actually smirks when I try to defend myself again. My dad just points toward the stairs. I pack one duffle bag, clothes, laptop, charger. I can hear them downstairs talking in low voices, probably deciding I'm guilty. When I come back down, my dad hands me $100 and says, that's all I'm getting. It's Christmas Eve. Snow's coming down hard. I sit in my car in a grocery store parking lot for two hours trying to figure out where to go. Eventually, I drive to my friend's house and sleep on his couch. The next few months are a blur. I bounce between couches, sleep in my car. When I run out of Options pick up shifts at auto shop during the day and deliver food at night. I'm working 70 hour weeks just to stay off the street. My Aunt Beatrice finally tracks me down through a mutual friend. She gives me her spare room and gets me a steady job at her friend's garage. No questions asked, no judgment, just help. I don't talk to my parents. They don't reach out. Rachel posts pictures on social media of family dinners I'm not invited to. My mom captions them, grateful for the family we have like I never existed. Two years pass. I save everything I make. I start a small car flipping business on the side. Nothing fancy, just buying broken down cars, fixing them.

In my first week of teaching the 5th grade, I noticed every kid in my class passing something under their desks and secret. At first I thought it was the classic notes passing, but I soon realised it was something much darker because when I confiscated the pieces of paper that they were passing and read them, they were always completely blank. At first I thought it was kind of funny, like a dumb 10 year old joke or something. But in my second week, the principal called me into his office as soon as I sat in the chair. He said, you need to find out what's going on in your classroom. Parents are calling saying their children are coming home with missing hair from their scalps and if it gets any worse, CPS will get involved and I'm not afraid to fire you. I tried to stand up for myself because one of my New Year's resolutions was to stop being a pushover. Sir, with all due respect, I'm not sure that's fair. I don't care about fair. I care about results and I need answers. I walked back into my classroom feeling completely defeated. Half of my students had called and said, and the students that were there had even more clumps of hair missing. It looks like they had cut it off with safety Scissors. As soon as class ended, I pulled aside Ava The quiet student who always got straight A's. She was the only one who didn't have messed up hair. Ava, can you tell me what's going on in your class, sweetheart? What are all your classmates up to? Please don't make me tell you, Miss Johnson, she interrupted. I was immediately taken aback. What? Why not, Ava? I need to know. Okay, I'll tell you. Her Mary Jane black shoes clicked against the floor nervously. It's this game everyone has. It's called double it and give it to the next person game. What kind of game passes empty notes from one person to another? What kind of game involves cutting out clumps of your hair? What are the rules? I asked softly. Ava looked down at the floor before running.

Seven years later, she bragged she had it all. I smiled back. Have you met my husband yet? I'm 34 now, living in Seattle. But seven years ago, I was planning a wedding in Boston. My fiance was everything on paper. Successful, charming. Came from money. We've been together three years. When he proposed with a ring that cost more than my car. My younger sister seemed thrilled for me. Always asking about wedding details, offering to help with vendor meetings when I had to work late. Then I came home early one Thursday, found them on our couch. My sister and my fiance tangled together like they've done this 100 times before. Turns out they had five months of sneaking around while I picked out flower arrangements and tasted wedding cakes. The trail didn't just break my heart, it shattered my entire sense of reality. My sister didn't even apologize, just said some people are meant to be together, that I should be mature about it. They got married three months later in a courthouse ceremony that somehow still made the society pages. Moved into the penthouse I was supposed to live in, started posting photos of their perfect life. Every vacation, every charity gala, every designer bag, all carefully curated to show the world what she'd won. I fell apart completely. Lost 15 pounds I couldn't afford to lose. Stopped showing up to family dinners because I couldn't stomach Seeing them together. My therapist said I needed a fresh start somewhere without constant reminders. So I applied for a marketing position in Seattle and left everything behind. First year was survival mode. I worked obsessive hours because going home to my empty apartment felt worse. Ate takeout alone most nights. Ignored my sister's increasingly elaborate social media posts. My parents would call and awkwardly update me, your sister's doing well. They bought a house. She seems happy. Each update felt like another knife. But slowly, I started healing. Made actual friends through a book club, got promoted twice, started running again. Therapy helped me understand that their betrayal said everything about them and nothing about my worth. I stopped checking my sister's Instagram, stopped defining my life by what I'd lost. Then two years ago, I attended a tech conference downtown. Sat next to this guy, James during a panel discussion. He was quiet, asked thoughtful questions, didn't try to dominate the conversation. We grabbed coffee afterward and talked for three hours. He mentioned he worked in venture capital, but didn't name drop or flex. Just spoke passionately about supporting innovative startups. Our first few dates were refreshingly normal. Neighborhood restaurants, long walks, actual conversations. He never tried to impress me with money or status. When he finally told me about his investment firm's success, it was almost apologetic, like he was worried I'd see him differently. That's when I knew he was different from my ex. In every Way that mattered. We dated for two years. He met my parents during a trip to Boston, carefully scheduled when my sister was out of town. My dad pulled me aside after dinner and said, this one's genuine, kiddo. Hold on to him. James proposed on a random Tuesday evening in our apartment. No grand gestures, just honest words about wanting to build a life together. The ring was elegant but understated. Perfect. Last month, my mom passed away after a short illness. The funeral brought everyone back together.

Emails where my ex threatened to file a restraining order if I kept trying to contact them. Police reports my ex had filed claiming I was stalking her. All dismissed as false. But she'd never told anyone that part. Then she found the financial records. My ex had told everyone, including my daughter, that I never paid child support. That we were struggling because I was a deadbeat. I watched my daughter's face as she read through eight years of bank statement. Twelve hundred dollars every single month. Never late, never missed. But the college fund was what broke her. My ex had told my daughter I refused to help with college, that she'd have to take out loans because I didn't care about her education. My daughter pulled out the statements. I'd open the account the day she was born. By the time of the divorce, there was $12,000 in it. Over the next 10 years, I deposited another $43,000. Every bonus, every tax refund, every extra shift I worked. The current balance was $340. My daughter looked at me with tears streaming down her face. Where did it go? She whispered. I pulled out the withdrawal records. Bahamas Vacation, New Car, Kitchen renovation, designer handbags. My ex had been draining it for years. While telling my daughter the account didn't exist. She sat there staring at the papers for 20 minutes, not saying anything. Then she stood up, took the entire box and walked out. Didn't Say goodbye. Three days later, my phone rang at 6:00am. It was my ex screaming. What did you tell her? What lies did you feed her? I said I didn't tell her anything. I just showed her the truth. She called me every name you can imagine, then said my daughter hired a lawyer. She sued, going for the stolen education fund, plus emotional damages. My ex wanted me to call my daughter and tell her it was all a misunderstanding. I hung up. She's called 47 times since then, left voicemails, begging, then threatening, then crying. My parents called too. Suddenly they want to talk after eight years of silence. They're worried about how this will look. My daughter hasn't called me yet, but her lawyer did. They want my testimony and all my records. Apparently there's enough evidence for a criminal case, too. My phone buzzes constantly now, but I'm not answering. I spent eight years being the villain in a story my ex wrote. Now everyone gets to read the real version.

We were driving home from our mom's funeral. Neither of us had spoken in two hours. The silence felt heavier than anything we'd said that day. Never been close. Growing up, he was the athletic one, the popular one. I was the quiet kid who spent weekends building computers in the basement. Mom was the only thing we had in common. The only person who could get us in the same room without it turning into some awkward standoff. The route home crossed the old Riverside Bridge. It had been under construction for months. Orange cones everywhere, signs saying one lane only. We were about halfway across when I heard it. A sound like thunder, but wrong. Deep and grinding. The kind of sound that makes your stomach drop before your brain catches up. The bridge started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a heavy truck passing, but the shaking got worse. My brother's knuckles went white on the steering wheel. He slammed the brakes, but we were already tilting. The section ahead of us just dropped. No warning, no creaking build up. Just gone. I watched three cars disappear into the river below. One second they were there. The next second, nothing. Just empty space and the sound of metal tearing apart. Our car was sliding backward toward the edge. I could feel gravity. Pulling us. The tires were screeching, but we weren't stopping. My brother screamed something I couldn't make out. I threw open my door and jumped. My feet hit solid ground, but the pavement was crumbling beneath me. I was falling. Everything went into slow motion. I saw the gray water below, saw chunks of concrete splashing into it. My hand shut out and caught the bent guard rail. The metal cut into my palm, but I held on. That's when I felt it.

Derek immediately claimed the master bedroom. Vanessa took the guest room. My mom said she'd take the den. That left me standing in the hallway. The lawyer cleared his throat. Nathan, your aunt specifically requested you sleep in the basement. My cousins looked at each other. Eric actually laughed out loud. Of course, she stuck him down there. The basement was unfinished, concrete floors, exposed pipes, one bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. There wasn't even a real bed, just an old futon. That smelled like mildew. I went on Thursday night. The house felt different, empty. I kept hearing the furnace kick on the floors creaking. Around midnight, I tried to sleep, but the futon was uncomfortable and the light bulb was too bright. Right. I got up to look for a lamp. That's when I noticed something odd about the wall. There was a section of concrete that looked newer than the rest, lighter colored. I knocked on it, hollow sound. I pushed on it and a panel shifted. Behind it was a crawl space, maybe 3 feet deep. I turned on my phone, flashlight, boxes stacked floor to ceiling. I pulled the first.

My son made him choke on those words. My brother Eddie has been giving my son a hard time since the kid pick up a sewing needle at 12 years old. At Thanksgiving, Zack showed up wearing a jacket he made himself and Eddie looked him up and down. What is wrong with you? My mom tried to change the subject, but Eddie kept going. No, seriously, look at him. He walks like a girl. He dresses like a girl. He's got his little sewing kit like a girl. At what point do we just admit what's happening here? Zack didn't say anything. He just helped set the table. Eddie followed him and said loud enough for everyone to hear, I'm embarrassed to tell people you're my nephew. You know that when my buddies ask about my brother's kid, I have to make stuff up because I can't tell them the truth. At Christmas, Eddie cornered me in the kitchen. You turned him into whatever this is. I told him there was nothing wrong with my son and he laughed in my face. Seriously, the kid is a freak. He's 18 years old and he plays with fabric and talks about colors and patterns like some kind of housewife. You should have beat that out of him when he was younger. Now it's too late. I told him to shut his mouth. And he just shook his head, don't get mad at me because you failed as a father. When Eddie's 50th birthday came around, we all gathered at this Italian restaurant downtown. I told Zach he didn't have to come, but he said I wouldn't miss it for the world. Something in his voice made me nervous, but I didn't push it. The dinner started fine, everyone passing bread and making small talk. Eddie was sitting at the head of the table, soaking up all of the attention. Then his eyes landed on Zack, who was wearing this incredible jacket he designed with a subtle geometric pattern stitched into the shoulders. Eddie's face twisted. Oh, for crying out loud, what is he wearing now?

Like they never say thank you for anything and they act like everything you do for them is just what you're supposed to do. Growing up, they treated me like their personal assistant instead of their kid. When I turned 18, I got out of there and moved three hours away for college. Best decision ever. I finally had peace, could focus on my studies and built my own life. I graduated with a finance degree, got a decent job at a bank, started saving up for my own place. Then last month, my dad calls me out of nowhere. He starts off with we need to talk, which is never good coming from him. Turns out they're having money problems. Their mortgage payment went up. Dad's been having back issues so he can't work construction anymore. And Mom's part time job at the grocery store isn't cutting it. He asks if I can move back home to help with expenses. I'm thinking maybe they want me to chip in a few hundred a month, which honestly I could swing. But then he starts listing off all this stuff they expect me to do. They want me to pay half the mortgage, buy all the groceries, handle the yard work and basically be their live in caretaker. Oh, and they also Mentioned that my old room is now Mom's craft room, so I'd be sleeping on the couch in the living room. I told them I'd think about it, but honestly I was already leaning toward no.

A week into this new dynamic, she came to me crying one night. Something is wrong with you. You're being so cold and indifferent. This isn't like you at all. I just sat there and listened without reacting. When she finished, I simply said, this is the dynamic you wanted. I'm just focusing on myself now like you've been doing for three years. She tried to hug me. I stepped back. The look on her face was pure for devastation, but I held firm. Then I did something that really set her off. I texted her an itemized spreadsheet splitting every single household expense 50 50, rent, utilities, groceries, internet, streaming services, even the kids activities. Everything divided perfectly down the middle. My phone started blowing up. Within minutes, she was calling me insane, saying this was completely out of left field and unnecessarily cruel. I replied, friends split things 50, 50. You made it very clear. We're just friends now. This is actually generous because you'd be paying 100% if you lived alone. She showed up in my office that night absolutely losing it. You're being cruel. I'm your wife. No, I said quietly. You told me you're my friend. You've told me that repeatedly. Friends don't get husband benefits. He started crying harder than I'd seen in years. I didn't mean it like this. I just needed space to figure things out. You've had three years of space. I Said, and you chose this dynamic. I'm disrespecting your choice. The next morning she was waiting for me in the kitchen. Can we please talk about this? We already talked, I said, pouring my coffee. You made yourself clear. I'm simply accepting the reality you presented. It's been two weeks now. She's been trying everything to get my attention, dressing up, cooking my favorite meals, even suggesting we go on a date. Yesterday she asked if we could watch a movie together like we used to. I said I had plans. I didn't. I just sat in my office reading. But I remember how she looked at me that morning after, the disgust in her eyes, how she made me feel like I'd violated some boundary just by being her husband. So I stay the course because I finally realized she wanted all the comfort and security of having a husband without actually being married to me. And I'm done being taken for granted.

I finished my dinner in silence while conversation awkwardly resumed around me. That night, after everyone left, I started making calls. First to my accountant, then to a lawyer.

She said, don't give her to anyone who comes looking. She didn't wait for me to respond, didn't explain, just ran back to her car and drove off without headlights. I stood in my garage holding a child I didn't know, a toddler, maybe two, wearing pajama in one sock. The girl wasn't crying. That's what got me. Her mother just abandoned her with a complete stranger and she didn't make a sound, just watched me with these exhausted eyes like she'd already given up on something. I took her inside, dead bolted the door, dialed 9 1 1, told them a woman just left her kid with me and said someone was coming. The dispatcher told me to stay put, don't open the door. Police were 15 to 20 minutes out. I sat on my couch with a toddler. She curled into me like I wasn't a stranger, like any warm body was safe enough. I didn't even know her name. Then I heard a car pull up outside. The toddler's whole body went rigid. She wasn't calm anymore. The knock was gentle, almost friendly. Excuse me, sir. I looked through the peephole. A man, well dressed, tired looking, he held up his hands like he was surrendering. I'm so sorry to do this. My name is Kevin. I'm looking for my wife, Barbara and my daughter, Julie, I think Barbara may have come this way. He rubbed his face. She has episodes bipolar. She goes off her meds and just takes off. It's happened before, but never with Julie. His eyes got wet. Please, if they're in there, I just want to know my little girl is okay. That's all I'm asking. I looked at the toddler in my arms, Julie, that's what he called her. She was frozen, staring at the door like it was a monster about to break through. Her whole body trembled. No child shakes like that when they hear their father's voice. I already called the police. I said. They're coming. You can talk to them. The man's posture shifted. That's not necessary. I just want my daughter. Then wait. She, my daughter. His palm slapped the door. You're a stranger. You have no legal right to her. Open this door right now or I'll. He stopped himself, took a breath, smiled again. I'm sorry. I'm just scared. Please, father to father, let me see my little girl. Julie buried her face in my chest and whispered the first word I'd heard her say all night. No. Julie's whisper was enough. I wasn't letting him near her. Leave, I said now. Kevin laughed. Or what? You'll call the cops. They'll hand her right to me. I'm her father. I have rights. Why is she terrified of you? He went quiet and he spoke again. All the warmth was gone because her mother filled her. Head with lies. She poisoned my own daughter against me and you're helping her. The door shook. He was trying to force it open. I'm done asking. I grabbed Julie and moved to the kitchen, found a knife. I heard a window smash. Back bedroom. He was inside my house. I ran to the bathroom, set Julie in the tub, lock the door, dragged the vanity in front of it. Julie buried her face in her knees. She was crying but not making any sound like she'd Learned to cry quietly. That broke something in me. Footsteps in the hallway. This didn't have to happen, Kevin said. His voice was right outside the door. All you had to do was give me what's mine. He slammed into the door. The vanity scraped forward an inch, again, another inch. I held the knife out, stood between him and Julie, ready for whatever came through that door. Then sirens, loud, close. The slamming stopped. I heard him running. The front door banging open, tires screeching. Then police everywhere. Someone knocked on the bathroom door. Sir, you're safe. Come on out. I didn't lower the knife until I saw the badge. Julie finally looked up, saw the uniforms. Then she looked at me. Safe. I nodded safe. Kevin didn't get far. Cops found him hiding in a neighbor's backyard two streets over. An officer took my statement while Julie slept in my arm.

The first time it happened, I couldn't believe it. We just opened for the season and my best tree was gone. A beautiful 8 foot Douglas fir I've been growing for seven years. My kids help me check the security footage. There he was, my neighbor, 2:00am, backing his truck up to my fence. My youngest asked why someone would steal a Christmas tree. Don't we give people Christmas trees, dad? I didn't have a good answer, so I made light of it. Maybe they're struggling, I told my kids. Maybe they can't afford a tree, and we're their Christmas miracle. I even started leaving the best trees closer to the property line, making it easier. For five years, every December, my neighbor would steal my best tree. Always the biggest, fullest specimen on the lot. The ones I'd spent years growing. My wife thought I was too soft, but she loved me for it. Then my daughter got sick. Leukemia. The doctor said she had maybe weeks. She made me promise. We pick out the most beautiful tree on the farm and decorate it together. We chose a magnificent blue spruce, nine feet tall, perfectly shaped. She was wrapped in blankets, weak but smiling as her brothers helped string lights while she directed from her wheelchair. We hung her photo in the center, surrounded by angels. Stood right in the Middle of the farm lit up every night. The last thing we've done together as a family. It took me three days to see what should have been obvious. Nine feet tall, perfectly shaped, right in the middle of the farm. They always took the best one. So I did what I had to do. I walked across the street and knocked. When my neighbor answered, I didn't be around it. I know you've been taking trees from my farm. I said it in the nicest tone possible, but that blue spruce with all the lights is my daughter's memorial. She's dying. Please. Any other tree but that one. His face went red. Excuse me. Are you accusing us of stealing? I'm not accusing. I'm just asking. His wife appeared behind him. We don't appreciate being called thieves. I just need you to know that tree means everything to my daughter. He laughed this short, cold, heartless laugh. His wife smirked. The door slammed in my face. That's when I realized they didn't give a shit. And neither should I. So that night, I went online and ordered 100 praying mantis egg sacks for $19 99. They arrived two days later. Small, tan, foam like couches that looked like nothing. I dealt with mantis hatches before. Years ago. Hundreds invaded our barn and took us weeks to clear out. Each of these sacks contained 100 to 200 eggs. Enough for 10,000 mantises to overrun their entire house. That night, I Went to her tree and carefully wired the egg sacks deep into the interior branches, systematically covering every section. From the outside, you couldn't see anything. Just perfect Christmas tree. Then I waited and waited until four nights later when I heard the truck engine at 1:00am. I ran upstairs and woke everyone up. My sons, my daughter, pale and weak. Dad, they're taking my tree. That's okay, sweetie. They can have it. She looked at me confused. Remember that year all those praying mantises hatched in our barn? The ones we spent weeks cleaning out? She nodded slowly. Come watch. You're about to learn what happens when people steal and show no respect. We stood at the window in the darkness as the neighbor backed his truck up to the property line. He and his wife and their seven little gremlins laughed and cheered as they dragged the tree, my daughter's tree, into the truck bed. We watched the next day through their window as they positioned it, strung their lights, gathered for photos in the living room, right next to the fireplace. Perfect incubation temperature. Then it happened. My daughter was struggling to keep her eyes open until she saw the orange glow across the street. Flames bright and climbing fast. Looking out of their living room window. Dad! She yelled. Their house is on fire! We ran to the window. Smoke was pouring out. Then we heard the screaming. The wife

Just to protect everyone. I signed it without reading. Five years later, I filed for divorce, and her father's face went pale when his lawyer explained what that document actually said. Her father handed me the document at our rehearsal dinner. Just a formality, he said, his smile sharp as glass. Protection for everyone involved. My fiance, Lauren, squeezed my hand under the table. Her whole family watched me like Hawks circling prey. Sign it or the wedding's off, her mother added, not even pretending to be kind anymore. I was 24, exhausted from wedding planning and desperate to avoid drama. I signed without reading a single word. Lauren kissed my cheek. Smart boy. You're really part of the family now. The first year was fine. Lauren worked at her father's commercial real estate firm. I was a graphic designer at a small agency. We lived modestly while her parents flaunted wealth, reminding me constantly how lucky I was. You married up, her father would say. Don't forget that. At family dinners, they'd discuss business deals worth millions while I cleared plates. Lauren never defended me. It's just how they are, she'd say. You're too sensitive. Year two, things shifted. Lauren started working late, coming home smelling like Cologne. When I questioned her, she'd throw her father's words back at me. You knew what you signed up for. I found texts to someone named Derek. Confronted her, she laughed. What are you Going to do? Leave. You'll get nothing. That's when her words hit me differently. The post it up. I'd signed away my rights without even reading it. I felt sick, trapped, stupid. For three more years, I stayed. Built my design career, saved money secretly and let Lauren believe I was powerless. She grew bolder. Derek became a regular presence. Her family knew and said nothing. Her father actually smirked at me during Christmas. Marriage isn't a fairy tale, son. You adapt or you leave with nothing. Last month, I filed for divorce. Lauren laughed when the papers arrived. This is hilarious. My lawyer's going to destroy you. You signed away everything, remember? Her father called that night, triumphant. You have no idea what that document says. You'll walk away with nothing but your designer salary and your dignity and tatters. I didn't respond, just waited. The preliminary hearing arrived. Lauren showed up in a designer suit, her whole family flanking her like an army. Her father sat front row, practically glowing. Their lawyer, Harrison, was a shark in expensive shoes. He stood up confident.

My lawyer, David, smiled quietly. He'd spent weeks analyzing that document. Your honor, may I present the actual postnuptial agreement? He projected it on the screen there in dense legal language. I'd never read was the truth. The agreement stated that in the event of divorce initiated by Mister Patterson due to infidelity, abandonment or financial misconduct by Missus Patterson, he is entitled to around 65% of all marital assets, full ownership of any property acquired during marriage, and immediate transfer of Missus Patterson's stake in her father's company.

Dylan tiptoeing to his room, glancing around, grabbing a fake Bill, dropping it in my backpack, then grinning straight at the camera before walking away. The whole party went silent. You could hear people's jaws dropping. That's not what it looks like, Dylan whispered. But it was exactly what it looked like. My parents turned pale. No apologies. Just mom saying we didn't have the full picture and dad mumbling about work stress. Dylan got grounded for a week. That was it. They wanted it swept under the rug. But I wasn't done. I installed hidden cameras in my room. Within days, I caught Dylan breaking in, unlocking my phone, scrolling through my messages, taking photos of my journal. He was planning to frame me again. I made copies, stored them everywhere, waited. Dylan had a big speech at a school fundraiser about student leadership and integrity. My parents were beaming in the front row during his speech. I sent the video to my mom, my dad, and every teacher he'd mentioned in his scholarship applications. Then I turned off my phone and listened to him talk about honesty. By morning, the video was everywhere. Teachers, students, scholarship committees. Dylan never went back to school. His scholarship was withdrawn, his student council position revoked, his reputation destroyed. Grandpa called a family meeting, played every video. The room footage, audio of Dylan planning to exaggerate to get me kicked out permanently. You owe Blake more than an apology, Grandpa told my parents. You owe him your damn respect. You either own up or don't speak to me again. That night, I packed my things. Grandpa offered me his cabin full time. Before I left, dad stood in the doorway. What happens now? He asked. Looked him in the eye. I live my life, you live yours. A year later, I've got savings, a construction certification, a steady job, a truck that doesn't stall, and a home with only my name on it. Dylan switched schools, deleted his socials, never recovered. My parents tried reaching out. I sent their checks back. And the day Dylan realized the camera was rolling, that was the day. I want

Four years later, my grandfather called a family meeting and exposed who really took it. Christmas Eve, my dad's Rolex goes missing, $40,000 watch his father gave him when he made partner. Not just any watch, white gold GMT Master with an engraving on the back, the kind of thing you don't just misplace. I'm home from community college for the holidays. My mom's decorating cookies. Rachel's taking selfies by the tree. Everything feels normal until my dad walks into the living room holding the empty watch box. Where is it? His voice is calm, but there's something cold underneath. I look up for my laptop, confused. Where's what? My watch, he says. The Rolex. It was in my drawer yesterday and now it's gone. My mom stops what she's doing so puts down her phone. They both look at me. My stomach drops because I can already see where this is going. I haven't touched your watch, I say. I didn't even know it was missing. My mom crosses her arms. You've been in his office a lot lately, late at night. What were you doing in there? Printing scholarship applications. I tell her the printer in my room is broken. I've been using Dad's. Rachel laughs. Sure you were. I saw you going through his desk drawers last week. You were definitely looking for something. I wasn't going through anything, I say, my voice rising. I was Looking for printer paper. She shrugs like she doesn't believe me. My dad's face hardens. This isn't a joke, Liam. That watch is worth more than your car. If you took it, you need to tell me now I didn't take it. I repeat, I swear I didn't touch it. My mom shakes her head. You've always been secretive, always hiding things. Now this, Rachel, adds fuel to the fire. He's probably trying to sell it for cash. You know, he's been talking about starting some business thing. My dad stares at me for a long moment. Then he says the words that change everything, pack your things. You're not staying here anymore. I think he's bluffing at first, but he's not. He stands there, arms crossed, waiting. My mom doesn't say anything to stop. Rachel actually smirks when I try to defend myself again. My dad just points toward the stairs. I pack one duffle bag, clothes, laptop, charger. I can hear them downstairs talking in low voices, probably deciding I'm guilty. When I come back down, my dad hands me $100 and says, that's all I'm getting. It's Christmas Eve. Snow's coming down hard. I sit in my car in a grocery store parking lot for two hours trying to figure out where to go. Eventually, I drive to my friend's house and sleep on his couch. The next few months are a blur. I bounce between couches, sleep in my car when I run out of options. Pick up shifts at auto shop during the day and deliver food at night. I'm working 70 hour weeks just to stay off the street. My Aunt Beatrice finally tracks me down through a mutual friend. She gives me her spare room and gets me a steady job at her friend's garage. No questions asked, no judgment, just help. I don't talk to my parents. They reach out. Rachel posts pictures on social media of family dinners I'm not invited to. My mom captions them, grateful for the family we have like I never existed. Two years pass. I save everything I make. I start a small car flipping business on the side. Nothing fancy, just buying broken down cars, fixing them up, selling them for profit.

My exam has one question, which classmate would you kill? It's not a joke. Missus Larson passed out the exams face down like always. You have 50 minutes. Begin. I flipped mine over. One question in bold letters, which classmate would you kill? Write their name and explain why. I looked up. Everyone else was staring at their papers, too. Is this a joke? Fiona asked. No talking during the test, Missus Larson snapped. But this question, Jake started. No talking. We all looked at each other, 25 students, same horrified expressions. I raised my hand, Missus Larson. I refused to answer this. Then you fail, fine. I'll fail. Ashley stood up. Me too. This is sick. Me too, said James. But then Jean, the weird kid who ate alone, walked up and handed in his test. Answered, done. Maya, the popular girl, looked at her friends, then wrote something down, handed hers in. One by one more people started writing. Stop. I said, this is insane. Missus Larson stood up. If you don't answer this question, everyone in the class will fail because of you. Everyone. Is that what you want, Caleb? That's not fair. Life isn't fair. Choose. Fiona looked at me. Write something. It's not real. It's wrong. It's just words on paper, Jake said. We all need to pass. The pressure was crushing. Everyone staring. Some already blamed me with their eyes. I wrote a name. Random. Someone I barely knew handed it in. Missus Larson collected all the tests, read them silently. Her face gave nothing away. Then she looked up. Caleb, stand up. My stomach dropped. Come to the front. I walked up on shaking legs. Class, she announced. This is who you all voted to kill. What? I spun around all of you. Some look down, others looked away. But you threatened failure. I protested. You made them. The motive doesn't matter. They all agreed you should die for their survival. It's just the stupid test. Missus Larson smiled coldly. What makes you think I wasn't serious? How do you know I wouldn't have actually done it? That I'm not secretly mentally ill? With a weapon, you wouldn't, Maya said. It's just words, a hypothetical. Interesting you say that. Watch this. Missus Larson turned on the projector. A photo appeared. A girl, maybe 17, basketball uniform, smiling. Does anyone recognize her? Nobody at first. Then it hit me. Yeah, she was a great above us, Rachel, something. I sat with her at lunch once. Didn't talk much. Missus Larson smile turned sad. She was the No. 1 girls basketball player here. Then she lost one game because she twisted her ankle. The room went cold. Everyone at school told her to kill herself as a joke. They sent threats online as a joke, posted memes about her missing the shot. And as a joke, of course, nobody was breathing when everyone forgot about Their jokes. Rachel spent every day alone. Three weeks later, she killed herself. Tears were running down Missus Larson's face. Now, who's responsible for that silence? If I had killed Caleb, because you all said I should, whether.

Four years later, my grandfather called a family meeting and exposed who really took it. Christmas Eve, my dad's Rolex goes missing, $40,000 watch his father gave him when he made partner. Not just any watch, white gold GMT Master with an engraving on the back, the kind of thing you don't just misplace. I'm home from community college for the holidays. My mom's decorating cookies. Rachel's taking selfies by the tree. Everything feels normal until my dad walks into the living room holding the empty watch box. Where is it? His voice is calm, but there's something cold underneath. I look up for my laptop, confused. Where's what? My watch, he says. The Rolex. It was in my drawer yesterday and now it's gone. My mom stops what she's doing so puts down her phone. They both look at me. My stomach drops because I can already see where this is going. I haven't touched your watch, I say. I didn't even know it was missing. My mom crosses her arms. You've been in his office a lot lately, late at night. What were you doing in there? Printing scholarship applications. I tell her the printer in my room is broken. I've been using Dad's. Rachel laughs. Sure you were. I saw you going through his desk drawers last week. You were definitely looking for something. I wasn't going through anything, I say, my voice rising. I was Looking for printer paper. She shrugs like she doesn't believe me. My dad's face hardens. This isn't a joke, Liam. That watch is worth more than your car. If you took it, you need to tell me now I didn't take it. I repeat, I swear I didn't touch it. My mom shakes her head. You've always been secretive, always hiding things. Now this, Rachel, adds fuel to the fire. He's probably trying to sell it for cash. You know, he's been talking about starting some business thing. My dad stares at me for a long moment. Then he says the words that change everything, pack your things. You're not staying here anymore. I think he's bluffing at first, but he's not. He stands there, arms crossed, waiting. My mom doesn't say anything to stop. Rachel actually smirks when I try to defend myself again. My dad just points toward the stairs. I pack one duffle bag, clothes, laptop, charger. I can hear them downstairs talking in low voices, probably deciding I'm guilty. When I come back down, my dad hands me $100 and says, that's all I'm getting. It's Christmas Eve. Snow's coming down hard. I sit in my car in a grocery store parking lot for two hours trying to figure out where to go. Eventually, I drive to my friend's house and sleep on his couch. The next few months are a blur. I bounce between couches, sleep in my car when I run out of options. Pick up shifts at auto shop during the day and deliver food at night. I'm working 70 hour weeks just to stay off the street. My Aunt Beatrice finally tracks me down through a mutual friend. She gives me her spare room and gets me a steady job at her friend's garage. No questions asked, no judgment, just help. I don't talk to my parents. They reach out. Rachel posts pictures on social media of family dinners I'm not invited to. My mom captions them, grateful for the family we have like I never existed. Two years pass. I save everything I make. I start a small car flipping business on the side. Nothing fancy, just buying broken down cars, fixing them up, selling them for profit. It's slow, but it's mine. Then I get a call from my grandfather, Edward.

My car was in my garage. I was watching t. V. With my wife when my phone rang at 9:45 p. M. Unknown number, but something told me to answer. Mister Thornton, this is Detective Warren with Metro P. D. We need to know why your vehicle was parked outside First National Bank on Maple Street approximately one hour ago. I laughed. That's impossible. My car has been in my garage all day. Sir, we have your plates on camera. Silver Ford F1 50, plate number matching your registration. The bank was robbed at eight fifty two PM your vehicle was the getaway car. My blood went cold. I walked to the garage while still on the phone, flipped on the light and froze. My fuck was there, but something was wrong. The engine was still warm. I touched the hood. Hot. Detective, I need you to come to my house right now. Someone's been using my truck. My wife appeared in the doorway. What's going on? I looked at her face and saw something I couldn't identify. Guilt, fear. Who drove my truck tonight? The detective arrived within 20 minutes. Two patrol cars followed. They examined my truck and found MUD on the tires that wasn't there this morning. A receipt on the floor from a gas station I'd never visited and most damming, a black ski mask stuffed under the passenger seat. I've never seen it before in my life. Mr Thornton, we need to know where you were between 8:30 and nine PM right here watching the game with my wife. They turned to her. Ma'am, can you confirm that she hesitated? That hesitation changed everything. He stepped out for about 30 minutes, said he needed to grab something from the store. I stared at her. What are you talking about? I was here the whole time. You told me you were running to get beer around 8:30. I never said that. I never left the active looked between us. Someone's lying. My wife wouldn't meet my eyes. That's when I noticed her hands were shaking. Not nervous shaking, the kind of shaking that comes from adrenaline wearing off. They separated us for questioning. I sat in my living room with one detective while my wife went to the kitchen with another. I could hear fragments through the wall. Her voice was higher than normal, defensive. I kept insisting I've been home all night. They asked if anyone else had access to my keys. My son Kyle, 19, was away at college. My daughter Brittany, 22, had moved out last year. No one else had copies. The detectives radio crackled. They found the money, $43,000 in cash stuffed in a bag behind a dumpster two blocks from the bank. They were pulling prints. Thirty minutes later, the results came back. Two sets of prints on the bag. One was in the System for a minor possession charge from three years ago. My daughter, Brittany, the other set was fresh, recently added to the database when someone applied for a concealed carry permit. My wife. The detective walked my wife out of the kitchen in handcuffs. I couldn't process what I was seeing. Rachel, what did you do? She finally looked at me and the woman I've been married to for 24 years was gone. And her place was someone I didn't recognize. We needed the money. You were going to lose the business. We were going to lose everything. So you robbed the bank. Brittany knew someone. She said it would be easy. No one would get hurt. We split the money and no one would ever know. I felt sick. You used my truck to frame me. I was going to say you went to the store. If they came asking, you'd be the suspect, not us. But the time they figured it out, we'd have the money hidden and there'd be no proof. She'd been willing to send me to prison. The mother of my children had planned to let me take the fall for armed robbery. Britney was arrested at her apartment an hour later. She'd masterminded the whole thing with her boyfriend, a guy she'd been dating for three months, who I'd never even met. He had the gun. Britney had cased the bank for weeks. My wife was the driver because she knew my schedule, knew When I'd be.

So I started acting extremely cold with her. She completely lost it. We've been married 12 years when she sat me down after our third therapy session and said the words that killed me. I only see you as my best friend now. I'm not attracted to you anymore. For three years, she'd been refusing intimacy. I thought it was stress from raising our two kids. Turns out she just been tolerating me this whole time. She even said she built up resentment toward me because I spent too much time with the kids instead of her. The therapist kept asking her why, what changed? When did the attraction die? Every answer was, I don't know. She couldn't give me a single reason. Then one night everything got worse. Came home drunk around midnight and basically crawled into bed begging me. I said no at first, but she kept pushing and crying until I gave in. Biggest mistake of my life. Next morning she woke up and wouldn't even look at me. I feel disgusted with myself, she said. Her voice cold. I have a rule about never sleeping with friends. That's what you are to me now, a friend. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. I asked her what I could possibly do to fix this. What was so unattractive about me? Her answer, I don't know. You're just not what I Want anymore but you're a great co parent and provider. She wanted to keep our roommate dynamic as she called it. Basically, I handle half the parenting, pay most of the bills and she gets to live her life without any of the marriage part. That's when something inside me just switched off. I told her, fine, we're roommates now. Starting immediately, I started implementing what they call the 180, complete eat emotional detachment. I stopped doing any of the little things I used to do for her. No more morning coffee made her way. No more helping with her work projects. No more picking up her dry cleaning. No more being her emotional support. She asked me to help her move some furniture in her home office. I said no. She looked absolutely shocked. Are you serious right now? Why are you being so petulant? You're in charge of your own life now. I said calmly, just like any roommate would be. We didn't.

She'd say things like you're way out of my league or I can't believe you're with someone like me. At first I thought it was cute, kind of endearing. But after 8 years, it started to bother me. I tell her constantly that I loved her, that looks don't matter, that she's the only person I wanted. She just smile and say, I know.

She just said, oh, I lost track of time. We were having fun. She seemed off, but I had to leave for work in 15 minutes, so I didn't push it. Got to work and couldn't focus. Something felt wrong. Then at two PM, I got a text from her. We need to talk. Those four words that make every guy's stomach drop. I told her I was stuck at work until 6, that we'd talk when I got home.

My car was in my garage. I was watching T V. With my wife when my phone rang at 9:45 p m. Unknown number, but something told me to answer. Mister Thornton, this is Detective Warren with Metro P D. We need to know why your vehicle was parked outside First National Bank on Maple Street approximately one hour ago. I laughed. That's impossible. My car has been in my garage all day. Sir, we have your plates on camera. Silver Ford F1 50, plate number matching your registration. The bank was robbed at 8:52 p m. Your vehicle was the getaway car. My blood went cold. I walked to the garage while still on the phone, flipped on the light and froze. My truck was there, but something was wrong. The engine was still warm. I touched the hood. Hot. Detective, I need you to come to my house right now. Someone's been using my truck. My wife appeared in the doorway. What's going on? I looked at her face and saw something I couldn't identify. Guilt? Fear. Who drove my truck tonight? The detective arrived within 20 minutes. Two patrol cars followed. They examined my truck and found MUD on the tires that wasn't there this morning. A receipt on the floor from a gas station I'd never visited. And most damming, a black ski mask stuffed under the passenger seat. I've Never seen it before in my life. Mister Thornton, we need to know where you were between 8:30 and nine PM. Right here, watching the game with my wife. They turned to her. Ma'am, can you confirm that she hesitated. That hesitation changed everything. He stepped out for about 30 minutes. Said he needed to grab something from the store. I stared at her. What are you talking about? I was here the whole time. You told me you were running to get beer around 8:30. I never said that. I never left the active looked between us. Someone's lying. My wife wouldn't meet my eyes. That's when I noticed her hands were shaking. Not nervous shaking. The kind of shaking that comes from adrenaline wearing off. They separated us for questioning.

It was just a joke at first. Holly had been complaining for weeks about being alone while scrolling through couples on Instagram. So one night at my apartment, I said it as a joke. Stop whining and just find someone already. What I didn't know was that Holly would take it as a personal challenge. The next week, she downloaded every dating app. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, even Facebook dating. He was swiping constantly. At work, at dinner, even during movies at my place, her phone never stopped buzzing with messages from random guys. Then she met someone. His name was Kyle. She showed me his profile, and he looked fine. Normal job, normal smile. Nothing crazy. They went on their first date to some Italian place downtown. She texted me photos of her pasta and said he was perfect. Second date was mini golf. Third date was the movies. By week two, she was posting him all over her Instagram with captions like, finally found my person and where have you been all my life? I was happy for her, really. My boyfriend Austin and I had been together three years, and I wanted Holly to have what we had. But then things got weird. Holly stopped answering my calls. When I texted her to hang out, she'd say Kyle wanted to spend time together. Every single weekend, I'd see her Instagram stories at restaurants I recognized, parks we used to Go to even the coffee shop. That was our spot. One Saturday, I decided to surprise her at that coffee shop, since she posted a story there. When I walked in, I saw her sitting at our usual table. But she wasn't alone. Kyle was there, and so was Austin. My Austin. They were all laughing together like old friends. I stood there, frozen by the door. Austin saw me first. His face went white. Holly turned around and her smile dropped. Kyle just looked confused. I walked over and asked what was going on. Austin stood up and tried to explain. He said Kyle reached out to him on Instagram two weeks ago, saying he was dating Holly and wanted to meet her friends. They'd been hanging out as a group ever since. Except Austin never told me. Not once. Holly jumped in, saying she wanted to surprise me by having everyone get along first. But something felt wrong. I looked at Austin and asked why his hand was on the table next to Holly's, real close. He pulled it back fast. That's when Kyle spoke up. He asked Holly why she never mentioned she had a boyfriend. The table went silent. Holly's face turned red, and she stammered that Kyle must have misheard. But Kyle pulled out his phone and showed messages where Holly said she was single. Messages from yesterday. Austin looked at Holly, confused. I looked at Austin. Then I saw it. A text notification on Austin's phone. On the table. From Holly. It said, can't wait for tonight, with a heart emoji. I grabbed his phone before he could stop me. The messages went back three weeks. Paragraphs about how they connected so well.

It was just a joke at first. Holly had been complaining for weeks about being alone while scrolling through couples on Instagram. So one night at my apartment, I said it as a joke. Stop whining and just find someone already. What I didn't know was that Holly would take it as a personal challenge. The next week, she downloaded every dating app. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, even Facebook dating. He was swiping constantly. At work, at dinner, even during movies at my place, her phone never stopped buzzing with messages from random guys. Then she met someone. His name was Kyle. She showed me his profile, and he looked fine. Normal job, normal smile. Nothing crazy. They went on their first date to some Italian place downtown. She texted me photos of her pasta and said he was perfect. Second date was mini golf. Third date was the movies. By week two, she was posting him all over her Instagram with captions like, finally found my person and where have you been all my life? I was happy for her, really. My boyfriend Austin and I had been together three years, and I wanted Holly to have what we had. But then things got weird. Holly stopped answering my calls. When I texted her to hang out, she'd say Kyle wanted to spend time together. Every single weekend, I'd see her Instagram stories at restaurants I recognized, parks we used to Go to even the coffee shop. That was our spot. One Saturday, I decided to surprise her at that coffee shop, since she posted a story there. When I walked in, I saw her sitting at our usual table. But she wasn't alone. Kyle was there, and so was Austin. My Austin. They were all laughing together like old friends. I stood there, frozen by the door. Austin saw me first. His face went white. Holly turned around and her smile dropped. Kyle just looked confused. I walked over and asked what was going on. Austin stood up and tried to explain. He said Kyle reached out to him on Instagram two weeks ago, saying he was dating Holly and wanted to meet her friends. They'd been hanging out as a group ever since. Except Austin never told me. Not once. Holly jumped in, saying she wanted to surprise me by having everyone get along first. But something felt wrong. I looked at Austin and asked why his hand was on the table next to Holly's, real close. He pulled it back fast. That's when Kyle spoke up. He asked Holly why she never mentioned she had a boyfriend. The table went silent. Holly's face turned red, and she stammered that Kyle must have misheard. But Kyle pulled out his phone and showed messages where Holly said she was single. Messages from yesterday. Austin looked at Holly, confused. I looked at Austin. Then I saw it. A text notification on Austin's phone. On the table. From Holly. It said, can't wait for tonight, with a heart emoji. I grabbed his phone before he could stop me. The messages went back three weeks. Paragraphs about how they connected so well. How she felt something real. How she wished they'd met first. Austin tried to grab the phone back, but I held it away. There were more messages. Plans to meet up at his apartment when I was at work. Photos she sent him. I scrolled up to the first message. It was from

I was supposed to get married last week. Didn't happen because I left the night before. I'm 26, he's 26, and we've been together for three years. We have twin boys who just turned 1. When I found out I was pregnant, he immediately wanted me to get rid of them. Not just suggested it, demanded it. Multiple times I told him flat out that I was having these babies with or without him. I even said I wouldn't ask for child support if he wanted to walk away. I've always had a strong maternal instinct and the timing felt right for me. I was ready to be a mom, even if it meant doing it alone. He needed time to think. I gave him three days. On day 3, I was literally about to break up with him when he said he changed his mind, that he wanted to be there. Throughout the pregnancy, he was great. Went to every appointment, rubbed my feet, built the cribs. When the twins arrived, which we definitely weren't expecting, he stepped up. I honestly don't think I could have managed two newborns alone. So I was grateful he stayed for months. He was everything a father should be. Changed diapers at 3:00am, walked them around the apartment when they wouldn't stop crying, sang to them. Six months after they were born, he proposed. It was beautiful. He did it in our living room while both boys were asleep in their cribs. I said yes without hesitation. It felt like we'd survived the hardest part together and now we were ready for forever. We spent six months planning this wedding. My parents adored him. My friends kept saying how lucky I was. I believed them. The night before our wedding, we stayed at separate places. I was at our apartment. He went to his parents house a few blocks away. After dinner, he called me, told me he loved me, that he couldn't wait to see me walk down the aisle, that tomorrow would be the best day of our lives. I got emotional. We stayed on the phone for 20 minutes just talking about our future. When we said goodbye, I waited for him to hang up. He didn't. I heard rustling. Then his dad's voice. Was that her? My fiance sounded different. Flat. Yeah, I should have hung up. But something in his tone made me stay on the line. His mom chimed in. Did you tell her yet? Silence. Then my fiance said, tell her what, mom? His dad's voice got firmer. That you're only going through with this because you feel trapped, son. We raised you better than to marry someone out of obligation. My heart stopped. I pressed the phone harder against my ear. His mom continued softer. Now, those boys are adorable. We love them. But, sweetheart, this Isn't the life you wanted? You're only 26. You have your whole life ahead of you. You could still walk away and start fresh somewhere else. There was a long pause, then my fiance spoke. I know. Trust me, I know. But what choice do I have? If I leave now, she'll drag me through court. Child support would destroy me financially. At least if I marry her, I have some control over my own money and legally it's easier to deal with. His dad laughed, not but a happy laugh, a bitter one. So you're going to spend the rest of your life pretending? That's not fair to anyone, especially those kids. My fiance's voice cracked. I don't know what else to do. I made my choice when I agreed to stay. I just have to live with.

I said, fine, go ahead. He had no idea what was coming. I've been the invisible kid my entire life. My brother Roman got everything, new cars at sixteen, family vacations planned around his soccer schedule, standing ovations for B minus report cards. I got a bus pass, hand me down clothes and my straight a report card shoved in a junk drawer without a second glance. When I was 7, I won the regional science fair. Came home so excited I could barely breathe. My mom was on the phone bragging to her sister about how Roman had scored a goal at practice that same afternoon. He didn't even look at my trophy. It sat on my dresser for three years before I finally threw it away. That's just how it was. Roman was the star. I was the backup character nobody remembered to write lines for. Senior year changed everything. I got accepted to a prestigious college four states away, full academic scholarship covering 70% of tuition. It was one of those schools that actually meant something kind, that guaranteed interviews at top firms. I'd worked my ass off for it, perfect grades, extra courses, volunteer work, everything. My parents sat me down the day the acceptance letter came. My dad didn't even congratulate me, just said Roman was looking at community colleges nearby and it wouldn't be fair for me to go somewhere. So elite when my brother didn't have those options, said I needed to stay local, keep thing is equal, not make Roman feel inferior. I was furious, but I also knew arguing wouldn't change anything. So I played along. I told them, fine, I'd attend the local community college. Only condition, I wanted to live in the dorms for the full college experience. They agreed immediately. Probably relieved they'd convinced me so easily. I accepted the scholarship, moved four states away, enrolled in the finance program at the precise school while my parents thought I was taking general ed classes 20 minutes from home. The program I chose was accelerated two years instead of four. I busted my tail, graduated top of my class and landed a corporate finance position. Three months later, six figures, full benefits, signing bonus. I've been there a year now. Just got word I'm up for senior analyst. My dad still sends me monthly deposits for tuition and living expenses. I never told him to stop. Part of me figured it was the least he owed me for 18 years of being invisible. I keep minimal contact. Holiday visits once or twice a year, just enough to not raise suspicion. Quick phone calls where I complained about exams and classes I wasn't actually take. They never asked detailed questions. Why would they? They barely noticed I existed. Last Tuesday, my dad called, said Roman was getting married in six weeks, said he needed me home. Early to help with setup, be there for family photos, play the supportive older brother role. I texted back the next morning, just said I couldn't make it, didn't give a reason. My phone rang 30 seconds later. My dad was livid, started going off about family obligations, about how ungrateful I was, how I never.

I was the only one she insisted sleep in the basement. At the estate meeting, I finally Learned what was hidden down there. Aunt Claire died on a Tuesday. By Wednesday, my cousins were already talking about her stuff. Derek wanted the house. Vanessa wanted whatever cash was left. My mom just wanted to go through Claire's photos one last time. The funeral was small, 12 people. Claire never married, no kids, just us. After the service, her lawyer pulled us aside before we discussed the estate. Claire left specific instructions. Each of you must spend one night alone in her house, no exceptions. Derek laughed. That's weird, even for Aunt Claire. Vanessa rolled her eyes. When do we have to do this? The lawyer checked his notes. This week, pick your nights. We drove to Claire's house that afternoon. It was a small ranch style place built in the 60s, nothing fancy. Derek immediately claimed the master bedroom. Vanessa took the guest room. My mom said she'd take the den. That left me standing in the hallway. The lawyer cleared his throat. Nathan, your aunt specifically requested you sleep in the basement. My cousins looked at each other. Eric actually laughed out loud. Of course, she stuck him down there. The basement was unfinished, concrete floors, exposed pipes, one bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. There wasn't even a real bed, just an Old futon that smelled like mildew. I went on Thursday night. The house felt different, empty. I kept hearing the furnace kick on the floors creaking. Around midnight, I tried to sleep, but the futon was uncomfortable and the light bulb was too bright, right. I got up to look for a lamp. That's when I noticed something odd about the wall. There was a section of concrete that looked newer than the rest, lighter colored. I knocked on it, hollow sound. I pushed on it and a panel shifted. Behind it was a crawl space, maybe 3 feet deep. I turned on my phone, flashlight, boxes stacked floor to ceiling. I pulled the first one out. Inside were bank statements, all of them in Derek's name. I didn't understand at first. Then I saw the transactions. Withdrawal 2000, withdrawal 15, withdrawal 3,000, all from Claire's checking account, all signed by Derek. I opened another box, credit card statements in Vanessa's name, but the billing address was Claire's house. The charges were insane. Designer clothes, expensive dinners, a weekend in Miami, $30,000 over two years, all on cards Vanessa opened using Claire's information. There were more boxes, printed text messages, screenshots of conversations. Derek and Vanessa had a group chat. I read through them feeling sick. They called her the cash cow, made jokes about her dying, complained when she asked them to visit. One message from Derek said, just keep pretending to care. She's got to have at least 200 k saved up. There was a folder at the bottom labeled for Nathan. Inside was a letter in Claire's handwriting. If you're reading this, you found my insurance policy. I started documenting everything 6 months ago when I realized what they were doing. I needed someone to find this first, someone who wouldn't hide it. I trust you to do the right thing. I'm sorry I had to put you in that awful basement. I love you. I took photos of everything, carried three boxes upstairs. Didn't sleep at all. The estate meeting was Friday morning. Everyone showed up. Derek walked in wearing a new Rolex. Vanessa brought her.

I was staying at my sister's for the weekend. Her husband Travis was out of town for work. Around 2:00am, I heard footsteps. My nephew stood in my doorway holding his stuffed bear. Why does Mommy sleep in the basement? Whispered. My blood went cold. My sister's bedroom was upstairs next to mine. What do you mean, buddy? Daddy says Mommy likes it down there. She sleeps on the camping bed. I got up and checked my sister's room. Empty bed made like no one had slept there in days. I went downstairs. The basement door was locked from the outside. There was a deadbolt I'd never noticed before. Does daddy lock this door? I asked him. He nodded. Mommy's sleeping. We can't wake her up or daddy gets mad. I tried. The handle locked tight. I looked at my nephew. His eyes were so innocent, so trusting, like this was completely normal to him. When did daddy put this lock on? He shrugged. Long time ago before my birthday. His birthday was in March. It was now October. My hands were shaking as I searched for the key. I checked the kitchen drawers, the junk drawer, the key hooks by the garage door, nothing. Then I remembered Travis wore one of those keychain lanyards. Always had it on him, even slept with it. I went back to My nephew, where does daddy keep his keys? In his truck, in the cup holder. The truck was in the driveway. I grabbed my coat and went outside. It was freezing. The truck was unlocked because we lived in a safe neighborhood. What a joke. The keys were right there, 5 different keys on the ring. I tried them all on the basement door. The fourth one worked. The basement light was off. I flipped the switch. My sister was on a camping cot in the corner, thin blanket, no pillow, empty water bottles lined up on the concrete floor, a bucket in the opposite corner. The smell hit me immediately. She looked up at me and I'll never forget her face, half relieved, half terrified. Rachel, I whispered. She put her finger to her lips. He's coming back tomorrow. Please don't make noise. He'll know you found me. I walked down the stairs. The basement was unfinished, cold. There was nothing down here except her cot and those bottles, a stack of granola bars, a roll of toilet paper. How long? Five months, she said. Her voice was hoarse, quiet, like she'd forgotten how to speak at normal volume. Five months, Rachel, why didn't you. He has cameras. He watches from his phone. If I try to leave or make noise during the day, he knows he comes home. She was shaking. Last time I tried, he put the bucket farther away, said if I wanted to be difficult. I could live like an animal. I pulled out my phone. She grabbed my wrist. Her grip was weak but desperate. He'll hurt you, too. He'll hurt both of you. Please just go back upstairs and pretend you never saw this, Rachel. I'm serious. He told me what he'd do if anyone found out. He's not bluffing. I looked at my sister, really looked at her. She'd lost at least 30 pounds. Her hair was matted. Her skin was gray. She had a bruise on her cheek that was yellowing at the edges. Old? Not if he's in handcuffs. First I said, I dialed 9, 1, 1. She tried to grab the phone, but I stepped back. 9, 1, 1, what's your emergency? My brother in law is holding my sister captive in their basement. She's been down here for five months. We're at 8, 47 Riverside drive. Rachel started crying. Not sad crying, panicked crying.

I said, fine, go ahead. He had no idea what was coming. I've been the invisible kid my entire life. My brother Roman got everything, new cars at sixteen, family vacations planned around his soccer schedule, standing ovations for B minus report cards. I got a bus pass, hand me down clothes and my straight a report card shoved in a junk drawer without a second glance. When I was 7, I won the regional science fair. Came home so excited I could barely breathe. My mom was on the phone bragging to her sister about how Roman had scored a goal at practice that same afternoon. He didn't even look at my trophy. It sat on my dresser for three years before I finally threw it away. That's just how it was. Roman was the star. I was the backup character nobody remembered to write lines for. Senior year changed everything. I got accepted to a prestigious college four states away, full academic scholarship covering 70% of tuition. It was one of those schools that actually meant something kind, that guaranteed interviews at top firms. I'd worked my ass off for it, perfect grades, extra courses, volunteer work, everything. My parents sat me down the day the acceptance letter came. My dad didn't even congratulate me, just said Roman was looking at community colleges nearby and it wouldn't be fair for me to go somewhere. So elite when my brother didn't have those options, said I needed to stay local, keep thing is equal, not make Roman feel inferior. I was furious, but I also knew arguing wouldn't change anything. So I played along. I told them, fine, I'd attend the local community college. Only condition, I wanted to live in the dorms for the full college experience. They agreed immediately. Probably relieved they'd convinced me so easily. I accepted the scholarship, moved four states away, enrolled in the finance program at the precise school while my parents thought I was taking general ed classes 20 minutes from home. The program I chose was accelerated two years instead of four. I busted my tail, graduated top of my class and landed a corporate finance position. Three months later, six figures, full benefits, signing bonus. I've been there a year now. Just got word I'm up for senior analyst. My dad still sends me monthly deposits for tuition and living expenses. I never told him to stop. Part of me figured it was the least he owed me for 18 years of being invisible. I keep minimal contact. Holiday visits once or twice a year, just enough to not raise suspicion. Quick phone calls where I complained about exams and classes I wasn't actually take. They never asked detailed questions. Why would they? They barely noticed I existed. Last Tuesday, my dad called, said Roman was getting married in six weeks, said he needed me home. Early to help with setup, be there for family photos, play the supportive older brother role. I texted back the next morning, just said I couldn't make it, didn't give a reason. My phone rang 30 seconds later. My dad was livid, started going off about family obligations, about how ungrateful I was, how I never.

So my sister Tara has three kids. Three boys. And look, I love my nephews. They're good kids. But here's the thing about Tara. She thinks everybody on this planet wants photos of her children plastered on every surface of their home. Every single Christmas, birthday, any gift giving occasion, really. I get the same type of gift. Blanket with her kids faces on it, a mug with her kids faces, a mouse pad, a phone case, magnets, picture frames, calendars. You name it, she's put her children's faces on it and handed it to me wrapped in a bow. And I'm not talking about small stuff, either. One year, she got me this massive tapestry blanket thing with all three of her boys on it. Like, their faces were blown up huge, and the whole thing was about six feet tall. He told me I could hang it on my wall. I just nodded and smiled and said thank you, because what else was I supposed to do? That thing went straight into my closet. Still there to this day, folded up behind some old winter coats. Another year, she got me a pillow. A giant square pillow with her middle son's face stretched across it. His face was slightly distorted from how they printed it, so he looked a little off. I put that in the closet, too. My mom kept asking me why I never displayed any of my Gifts? I always just said I was still figuring out where to put everything, but honestly, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with 17 items featuring my nephew's faces. I don't have a shrine dedicated to children that aren't mine. I see them at family gatherings. That's enough. The thing is, I never said anything to Tara. I didn't want to hurt her feelings or cause drama. So every year I just accepted the gifts, thanked her, and quietly stored them away. But this year I finally snapped. We were doing Christmas Eve at my parents house because I was spending actual Christmas Day with my girlfriend's family. So we did the whole gift exchange early. Tara handed me my present first. I could tell by the shape it was a picture frame. I unwrapped it and yep, another framed photo of her kids. This time they were all dressed in matching Christmas sweaters sitting in front of a fireplace. Professionally done. She probably spent like 80 bucks on the photo shoot alone. I smiled and said thank you, same as always. But then it was my turn to give her my gift now. I should mention I have a dog named Chester. He's a three year old golden retriever and he's basically my child. I got him when he was eight weeks old, raised him, trained him, take him everywhere with me. He sleeps on my bed, I buy him birthday presents. He has his own Instagram account. With like 2,000 followers. So a few weeks before Christmas I had this idea. I put Chester in a little red bow tie, made him sit by the Christmas tree. About 50 photos until I got the perfect one where he was looking right at the camera with his tongue slightly out. He looked adorable. I got it printed and put it in a really nice frame. Silver with little paw prints on the border. Then I wrapped it up real pretty with a bow on top. I also got her a 25 dollar Starbucks gift card because I wasn't trying to be completely petty. She loves Starbucks. Gets their pumpkin spice stuff year round somehow. So she opens the Starbucks card first and she's happy about that. Thanks me. Then she picks up the wrapped frame. She tears off the paper, looks at it, and her whole face changes. Her smile just drops.

My ex husband Jake stopped paying child support about six months after our divorce was finalized. We have two kids together, Sophie who's 8 and Brandon who's 6. Jake was supposed to pay $800 a month, but suddenly the payments just stopped coming. When I called him about it, he'd either ignore me completely or give me some excuse about being broke or between jobs. The thing is I knew he wasn't broke. His mom, Carol had been posting all over Facebook about how proud she was that Jake bought a brand new Ford F1 50 truck. She was constantly sharing photos of him at expensive restaurants and bars downtown. The guy was clearly making money. He just decided he didn't want to pay for his own kids anymore. I tried going through the proper channels. First wild with child support enforcement sent certified letters, the whole thing. But Jake had started working under the table doing construction jobs so they couldn't garnish wages that didn't officially exist. Meanwhile, I'm working two jobs trying to keep up with rent and groceries for three people on what should have been a two income household. Carol made everything worse though. She kept posting these passive aggressive things on social media about how some people just want handouts and real mothers don't need money from men to raise their children. She share those stupid memes about how kids need love, not money. Completely ignoring that love doesn't pay for school supplies or keep the lights on. The breaking point came when Sophie needed new shoes for school. Her old ones had holes in the bottom and it was getting cold. I had exactly $47 in my checking account until payday, which was still five days away. I called Jake one more time asking if he could at least help with the shoes since child support it was already three months behind. He told me he couldn't help because he was saving up for a hunting trip with his buddies, a hunting trip while his daughter was walking around school with cardboard in her shoes to cover the holes. That's when I got the idea. Carol was always bragging about what a responsible, successful son she raised. She loved telling everyone how Jake was such a good provider and how proud she was of him. I decided she should see exactly how good of a provider he really was. I printed out every single missed child support payment from the past 6 months, made a nice little spreadsheet showing the date each payment was due, the amount owed and a running total of how much Jake was behind came to $4,800 plus late fees. I also included copies of the kids'school lunch accounts showing they were negative. Sophie's shoe incident and Brandon's asthma medicine that I've been rationing because I couldn't afford to refill it early. Then I mailed it all to Carol's House with a note that said, since you're so proud of Jake's success, I thought you'd want to see how well he's providing for Sophie and Brandon, just keeping you informed about your grandchildren's welfare. Three days later, my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake absolutely losing his mind, screaming about how I had no right to involve his mother in our business. Then it was Carol calling me every name in the book, saying I was trying to embarrass her son and turn the family against him. But here's the thing, it worked. Within a week, Jake had caught up on two months of back.

I looked up from my calculus textbook. Riley never came to my room. We weren't that kind of siblings. She stood in my doorway, gripping her phone like it might explode. What video? I said. Her hands were trembling. The one Coach Peterson sent last night. It's gone from my messages. Coach Peterson? Her track coach. The guy who taken our school to state championships three years running. The one parents loved because he got scholarships for half his varsity team. Why would your coach be sending you videos at night? I asked. Riley's face went pale. She sat down on my bed without asking. He sends them to all the varsity girls. Training tips, form corrections. But her voice cracked on the last word. I closed my laptop. Show me. She opened her messages and scrolled. I watched her fingers move past dozens of conversations until she found his name. The chat history showed nothing but practice schedules and meet times. Normal stuff. Professional. It was here, she insisted. Last night at 11:47. A video of him demonstrating stretches. Except he wasn't wearing. She stopped. My stomach dropped. Wasn't wearing what? Anything. And he kept saying my name like he was talking directly to me. She wouldn't look at me. Riley. Watch this part. Riley, make sure you stretch like this. I took her phone. The time, step gap, Was obvious once you looked for it. Messages at 11:15 about Thursday's practice schedule. Then nothing until 7:22 this morning, when he asked about her mile time. Some thing had definitely been deleted. Did you delete it? I asked. No. That's why I'm freaking out. I didn't touch it. I was too shocked to even respond. Just close the message and try to sleep. I opened her phone settings, recent devices logged in. My blood went cold when I saw it. Peterson's laptop had accessed her account at 6:18 this morning. He'd remotely deleted his own message before anyone could wake up and report it. Riley, do you still have the notification screenshot? She looked confused. What? When you got the video, your lock screen would have shown a preview before you opened it. Did you screenshot it? Her eyes widened. She started frantically scrolling through her photos. I screenshot everything. In case my battery dies during practice. I need the schedules accessible offline. Oh, god. There it was. A notification preview showing Coach Peterson's name. Timestamp, 11:47. And the first frame of the video. You couldn't see much detail, but you could see enough to know something was very wrong. We need more, I said. If he sent it to you, he probably sent it to others. Riley's hands were shaking. Worse now. Violet. She's been weird all week. Make eye contact in the locker room. And Brynn stopped coming to practice on Tuesdays. I grabbed my laptop and Opened a clean browser. What's Violet's number? Riley hesitated. They'll think I'm crazy. What if they didn't get anything? What if it was just me? Then we'll know. But I don't think it was just you. Twenty minutes later, we had three more screenshots. Three more girls. Violet at 11:51. Brin at 11:39. Another girl named Tessa at 12:03. Same time stamp pattern. Same remote deletions between 6:15 and 6:22 that morning. All four videos sent after 11 p m. All four deleted before dawn.

Status switches to offline. I screenshot everything with my phone. My heart hammering, I try messaging again, but it says user not found. Like the account just vanished. I spend the Next two hours on Reddit and discord, begging anyone who knows how to trace IPS. Some guy finally sends me to a forum that's definitely illegal, but I don't care anymore. I upload the screenshots and 20 minutes later, someone drops an address, Industrial District, 2 states over. I'm grabbing my keys and wallet before I can think about how insane this is. The drive takes six hours. I don't stop once. Just keep replaying that message in my head. Don't let them know you saw this. Who's them? I pull up to the address at noon. It's a massive warehouse in a row of identical build buildings. Everything looks abandoned, rusted locks, windows covered in grime, weeds growing through cracked pavement. I park a block away and approach on foot. The front entrance is chained shut, but there's a side door with a broken lock. I slip inside and the smell hits me immediately, mildew mixed with something sharp and chemical like cleaning supplies and sweat. The main floor is empty except for old shipping pallets and debris. But I can hear something, a faint mechanical hum coming from deeper inside. I follow the sound to a back room. The door is slightly open and I can see the glow of computer screens inside. I push through and freeze. There are five desktop setups running along one wall. All the monitors show different games, world of Warcraft, battle royale, a few I don't recognize. The characters are all moving Farming resources, grinding levels. Then I see the living space in the corner, a stained mattress on the floor with one thin blanket, protein bar wrappers scattered everywhere, a bucket that I really don't want to think about, water bottles lined up against the wall. That's when I hear footsteps behind me. You shouldn't have come. I spin around. Trevor standing in the doorway. But he's not Trevor anymore. He's made.

I've had a ton of friends my whole life, 300+ contacts, eight different group chats, always someone to text. Growing up, I was never the kid sitting alone at lunch. I was the guy people invited to everything, birthday parties, game nights, random mall hangouts. I thought that meant something real. But here's what nobody talks about. I could disappear for months and not a single person would check on me. I know this because I tested it last summer. Stopped initiating conversations completely. Just stopped. Didn't text first, didn't make plans, didn't comment on anyone's posts. Wanna know how long it took for someone to reach out? 47 days. And it wasn't even to see how I was doing. It was my friend Alex asking if he could borrow my PlayStation. Not, hey, man, haven't heard from you. You good? Just, yo, can I grab your PS five this weekend? I gave it to him because that's what I do. But last Tuesday made everything crystal clear. My best friend Spencer, the guy I've known since sixth grade, the one I helped move apartments twice, the one who slept on my couch for two weeks when his parents kicked him out, texted me Tuesday afternoon, yo, bro, can't hang today. Super sick. My parents won't let me leave the house. Rain check. I responded immediately. No worries, man. Feel better soon. Seriously, let me Know if you need anything. I genuinely felt bad for him. Even went to target and bought Gatorade and soup planning to leave it on his porch. Two hours later, I'm sitting in my room scrolling Instagram because I had nothing else to do. That's when I see it. Spencer's story posted 47 minutes ago. He's a Dave and Buster's not just with one or two people. There's like 12 people crammed into the frame. People I've never even met. They're all laughing, playing arcade games, taking shots at a booth. He's in the center with his arm around some girl looking like he's having the absolute time of his life. The same time he told me he was too sick to leave his house. I just stared at my phone for like 10 minutes. My stomach dropped. Not because he went out, but because he lied directly to my face. And the worst part, I wasn't even surprised. I didn't confront him. What was the point? He just make up some excuse about how his parents suddenly changed their mind or it was last minute or I'm being too sensitive. I've heard it all before. I put the Gatorade in my fridge, ate this dupe myself. But Friday broke me. Spencer text at eleven forty seven PM bro, emergency, can you cover my shift tomorrow morning 6:00am at the restaurant? I'll owe you big time. Please, man, I'm desperate. I had plans driving 3 hours to see my grandma. First time in 3 months. But Spencer's message said emergency in all caps. So I cancelled, called my grandma, told her something urgent. Came up at work, worked his entire 8 hour shift on 4 hours of sleep. Breakfast rush on Saturday is brutal. Got yelled at by customers, spilled coffee on my shirt. Made 67 Bubba dollars in tips. He never showed up to thank me. Never.

They had no savings. Most went to Trevor's career development. Maybe since you're a doctor, mom said you could help us figure out payment plans. I remembered that diner at 2:00am. Studying while serving drunk students, eating ramen three nights a week. The crushing stress. While Trevor posted from expensive restaurants. Think about it. Next morning, I drove to my childhood home. Trevor answered at 11:00am, looking like he just woken up. What are you doing to help with the medical bills? He looked confused. I'm working at a music store. I don't have medical Bill money. You could get a second job. Maybe one that uses that expensive training they paid for. I'm still pursuing my music career. I can't abandon everything I've worked for. Everything he'd worked for. With my college fund. Trevor, what happened to the $85,000? That was years ago. Training, living expenses, networking, investment in my future. And what return did they get? Silence. I pulled out a CD. Professionally manufactured with glossy artwork. His demo CD from 2018. Trevor's face went red. Where did you get that? Your MySpace page. You spent $3,000 of my college fund making these? Posted about how record labels would hear your talent. I said it on the table. Are you helping with Gary's bills or not? I'm going to help. Exactly as much as this family helped me through medical school. I headed for the door. What does that mean? Check. Couch cushions. For spare change. Maybe sell those professional headshots. Mom called that evening. Did you talk to Trevor? I did. He's still living the dream. Gwen, please. This is life or death. Mom. Gary will get proper care. That's how hospitals work. Talk to their financial counselor, apply for charity care, and Trevor gets a real job and contributes. You could just help us. You're a doctor. You make good money. You're right. I make good money because I worked my ass off without family support. I graduated with a quarter million in debt. You sacrificed my future for Trevor's fantasy. Now you want me to rescue you from the consequences, so you won't help. I'm not giving you money. But I'll give you what you gave me when I needed support, advice to figure it out on your own. I hung up and blocked their numbers.

When I was 10, my mom started sending me to playdates at different friends houses every single day after school. She'd call other parents and say things like, Jake would love to come over and play with Tommy today. Or, Jake's been asking about spending time at your house. At first, I thought I was the most popular kid in school. Every day was like a party at someone else's house. Different toys, different snacks, different video games. I rotate between five or six families throughout the week, never spending more than one evening at home. The other parents were always welcoming. They'd feed me dinner, help with homework, let me stay until bedtime. I started keeping a toothbrush at three different houses because I ended up sleeping over so often. When mom would call saying she got caught up with work or had an unexpected DID meeting, what I didn't realize was that mom was essentially crowd sourcing my care. The other parents thought she was just being social. The pattern became obvious when I started knowing other families routines better than my own. I knew Mrs. Brown always made grilled cheese on Wednesdays. I knew the Johnsons had family game night on Fridays. I knew which houses had the good snacks, and which parents checked homework carefully. Meanwhile, our own house was always empty. No groceries, no dinner plans, no family activities. Mom would pick me up from someone else's Family dinner and drive me home to microwave leftovers or cereal for dinner. The turning point came when I got sick at school. The nurse called mom, but she was in an important meeting and asked if I could just go to the Martinez family's house like usual. Mrs. Martinez picked me up, took me to her house, and spent the afternoon taking care of me while her own kids were at soccer practice. That evening, when mom came to collect me, Mrs. Martinez asked to speak with her privately. I was too sick to pay attention, but I heard raised voices from the kitchen. Later that week, Mrs. Martinez

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve have been helping Mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody, look me in the eyes and said I would never keep your children from you. For six months, she actually kept her word and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup and there was a for sale sign in the yard and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour dissociating because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles away. For months, while looking me in the eye every Friday, The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered. And instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls, like she was being generous.

I tried my best to be polite. No, I'm single, but I'm focusing on my career right now, so I'm not looking for anything. Suddenly, the photographer waved his camera in my face. Honestly, I thought it was just some weird form of flirting. So I said, please leave me alone before walking away. But instead of finding some other girl, he started following me with his camera. He wasn't even taking photos of the bride. Just, I guess he saw the scared look on my face because that's when he tried to explain himself. I just need to get you alone. I need to show you something on my camera. Come with me. Adrenaline started pumping through my veins. Who was this freak? It's hard not to hate men when they all act like this. I ran to the bathroom and tried to text my friend that the photographer was a Hernie weirdo who needed to be kicked out. But my texts were green instead of blue. There was no signal. I decided to just wait 20 minutes because I figured he'd be gone by then. But when I walked out of the stall, he was standing right by the door waiting for me. Wait, wait, he exclaimed. When I started walking away from him. I need to show you something on my camera. I glanced behind My shoulder and saw a photo that he had opened. My stomach dropped. It was a photo of the inside of a van filled with rope, duct tape and zip ties. It's for you, the photographer said. My knees went weak. No one was around because everyone was watching the bride and groom have their first dance. So I frantically searched the hallways for someone, anyone who could help me. That's when I finally found my friend Trevor. He was sitting by the bar and he immediately noticed how panicked I looked. P, are you okay? What happened? There was makeup streaming down my face. I couldn't even catch my breath. The photographer, he's trying to take me. Please help me get away from him. Trevor immediately jolted up and pulled me into a hug. It's okay, I got you. Where is this freak? I'm gonna make sure the police get him. I was about to point to where I'd come from, but that's when I heard footsteps coming into.

But the photographer wasn't backing down. No way. I'm not going anywhere until I take that girl away from this place and she comes with me, he said, pointing at me. At this point, I was more shocked than anything. I mean, the absolute audacity of this guy was crazy. The photographer was a five foot three short king with zero muscle mass, and Trevor was a 6 foot 3 gym bro. There was no question about who would win in a fight. Trevor literally just started laughing at him. Who you feeling like? Trevor asked. Suddenly the photographer lunged forward and tried to grab my drink out of my hand. I splashed it in his face. I was about to tell him to go home before we call the police, but no words came out. Dizziness filled my vision. I collapsed on the bar counter and felt my eyes roll to the back of my head. And I guess the bride and groom's wedding dance finally ended, because that's when everyone started filling up the bar area. My brother was the first one to notice me. Oh, my gosh, what happened? He asked while lifting me into his arms. I could hear the photographer speaking in the background. Trevor drugged her. He's been after her this whole time. Trevor laughed. Nervously. Yo, bro, chill. You can't just say stuff like that with no evidence. Through my blurred vision, I could see the photographer showing my brother the same photos he'd shown me. The van, the zip ties. Trevor had this set up for her. I saw it in the parking lot. I've been trying to get her to come with me and protect her. But she kept running away, and I could never get a full sentence out. My brother waved over the security guard who called the police. We waited for an ambulance together. When the paramedics arrived, they confirmed everything. Trevor was arrested and given six weeks in jail.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled, rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point, I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I, I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart, now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared. Of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he Was going to take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice, my babe.

All I have is you. Really? Yeah. Because I went through your phone and you found some stuff, and you're trying to trick me, and it's not gonna work. I'm not trying to trick you. Why don't you just tell me before I tell you? We've been in a relationship for six years, okay? I trust you, and I know that what's on my phone and I have nothing to hide. Hence why I don't care that you went through my phone. But you're trying to lie and say you found something. What did you find? I didn't find anything. What was that? I didn't find anything. Okay. Okay, fine. I love you. Love you more.

But the second that kid touched my arms, the very first thing my brain delivered was I wonder how far I could throw him. So I try to hand him back immediately, but she's like, why? And I can't say the real reason. So she goes, you literally just got him for a minute. So now I'm panicking because the intrusive thoughts are fully seated front row. And while I'm still holding him, my brother in law goes, it's kind of stuffy in here. Should I open the balcony door? And before I say the next part, please note we are on the fifth floor and yes, there is a balcony.

Like each one of them has their own energy. Let's start with mom. I walk into her room at like 2:00am and lightly tap her shoulder. She gasped like I just told her the house is on fire. What's wrong? Are you okay? What happened, mom? I just wanted water. She's sitting up in bed, fully awake now, hand on her chest, acting like I just gave her a heart attack. You scared me, bro. I whispered your name. Then there's dad. I walk into his room and go, dad, you awake? He goes, hmm, yeah, in the weakest voice you've ever heard. Bro is not awake. His eyes are half lid. So I test him. Dad, can I have candy? He goes and just rolls over. Next morning I asked him, remember when you said I can have a Tootsie Roll? He looks at me like I'm speaking a different language. I never said that. Yes, you did, bro. Then there's grandma. I don't even get to say anything. I walk into her room and she's instantly up. Oh, you hungry? I'll go cook, grandma, it's 3:00am. No, no, I make you food. She's already out of bed, putting on her slippers, headed to the kitchen. I'm like, grandma, I'm not hungry. She's not listening. Ten minutes later, there's a full meal on the table. Then Grandpa, bro, I walk into his room and Barely touch his arm. He jolts up like he's under attack. Who's there? What's happening? Eyes wide open, looking around the room like he's back in the war. He was deployed in 1914. But tell me, this isn't just me, bro.

Then I walk into class, sit down, and I'm approximately mysterious for about 10 seconds before my dumbass friend opens his mouth and says the most stupid, horrific, brain rotting joke ever. And suddenly I'm laughing like an ancient possessed hyena that literally just escaped from a government lab. Like, you could literally hear me laughing from outer space.

You're sitting there laughing your ass off, unable to control yourself, until the teacher starts yelling at you and your friend. Like, the two of you, get out of my classroom now!

I'm showing myself to his family tomorrow at his church. Three weeks ago, I was using his laptop because mine died and a Facebook notification pop that some woman tagged him in a post about their son's soccer game with a caption that said, so proud of our boy. I clicked it thinking maybe it was a nephew or godson. It wasn't. There were hundreds of photos, family dinners where he's cutting a Turkey, beach vacations from last summer when he told me he was on a war retreat. Their daughter's birthday party from literally last month, pink balloons everywhere and him holding a cake that said happy sick birthday, Daisy. The same weekend he said he could see me because his mom was in the hospital. I scrolled back further, wedding photos from eight years ago, her in a white dress, him in a grey suit, the same suit he still has hanging in what I thought was his apartment I'm realizing was probably just some rental he used to keep alive. The whole time we've been together, he had a wife and two kids living in a town 40 minutes from me. I sat there staring at the screen for two hours. Then I threw up. Then I created a fake Facebook account and dived into his wife Chelsea's entire online presence. She posts every single day, their morning coffee routine, the Kids, school projects, date nights at Olive Garden where he takes her every anniversary. Last year she posted, 12 years with my best friend with a photo of them holding hands. I've been the other woman for two years and I had absolutely no idea. Here's the thing that kills me. I thought I was being careful. I thought I asked all the right questions early on. He said he was divorced, showed me his apartment, introduced me to his coworker. We went to restaurants together in my town. He stayed over at my place probably 60 times. How do you fake that? How do you look someone in the eyes and say I love you while your wife is 40 minutes away putting your kids to bed? I didn't confront him. Something told me not to. Instead, I got smart. I checked Chelsea's page every single day, Learned their entire schedule. She posts every Monday is grocery shopping at four PM Tuesday the kids have swimming lessons at the YMCA. Thursday is family movie night with homemade popcorn. And Sunday mornings they attend the 10:00am service at Riverside Community Church where he volunteers as a Deacon. A Deacon, this man who's been lying to two women for two years stands up in front of a congregation and talks about morality and faith. He texted me yesterday, miss you, babe. Dinner next weekend. I stared at that text for 20 minutes. Part of me wanted to call him right then. And scream, but I didn't. I said yes, told him I loved him. He sent back a heart emoji and can't wait to see you. I'm sitting in a Holiday Inn right now two blocks from Riverside Community Church. It's nine forty seven PM on Saturday night. I bought a red dress at target this afternoon, the kind that stands out. Spent $35. I really couldn't afford. But I want her to see exactly who I am. Did my makeup three times because my hands kept shaking. Printing out screenshots of every text he sent me this month, 47 pages worth every I love you, every wish I was with you right now, every single lie about where he really was. I also have a letter I wrote to Chelsea. I'm not going to read it out loud, but I'm going to hand it to her. It has dates, fix hotel receipts I found in his glove compartment, everything she'll need to protect herself legally when this all falls apart. My best friend thinks I'm insane. I called her yesterday and she begged me not to do this, said it'll blow back on me, that people will call me names, that his wife might blame me instead of him. Maybe she's right, but I can't let him keep getting away with this. Tomorrow at 10:15 when they're all settled into their usual third row pew, I'm walking through those doors. According to Chelsea's posts, they sit in the same spot. Every week, right side, third row, near the aisle so the kids can get to the bathroom easily. I'm going to sit directly behind them. I'm going to wait until he turns around. Maybe he'll sense someone staring. Maybe he'll just glance back randomly like people do. But when he sees me, I want to watch every ounce of colour drain from his face. I'm standing up and I'm going to say loudly enough for everyone in that building to hear, hi, Adam, it's me, your girlfriend of two years. I thought your family should meet me. His wife deserves to know the man she's married to. His kids deserve a father who doesn't live a double life. And I deserve to watch him lose absolutely everything in front of the community he pretends to serve. It's 10:00am now. I should try to sleep, but I can't. My hands won't stop shaking. In 12 hours, this is really happening and there's no going back.

I was planning to propose to my girlfriend and kept feeling the ring box in my pocket. She was extra happy that night, holding my hand and dancing as we walked back to the car. Tonight was the night. I was gonna do it then. And as I watched her dance down the sidewalk, I thought someone behind us just had really bright headlights. But when I turned around, they were getting bigger. I saw the truck coming towards us and without thinking, I tried to get her out of the way. She screamed, but before I could push her, the truck hit both of us. Everything was slow motion, but I tried to shield her with my own body as best as I could. It hit us hard and I felt like my world was being ripped from me. I don't even remember how I landed 20 feet away, but the adrenaline was so insane, I stood up and didn't even notice my leg was broken until I tried to get to her. I just hobbled towards her and found her barely still breathing on the ground. She looked at me and tried to say something. She didn't have any air in her lungs, but reached up to hold my face before I lost consciousness. I woke up on the hospital bed and instantly noticed how much medication I was under, but none of that mattered. My first And only thought was my girl. I had to know if she was okay. Nurse, nurse, where's my girlfriend? Please tell me she's okay. But the nurse's face told me nothing and everything at once. She's alive, she said, but the way she said it made a live sound, like barely. She told me my leg was shattered in three places, that I was lucky, but all I cared about was her. When they finally let me crutch to her hallway, her doctor stopped me outside her room. Through the small window, I could see her mom crying her eyes out. And I started silent, praying she was okay. I tried to go inside, but he put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a look and I knew it wasn't a good one. I asked the doctor to just tell me what was going on. And he made me promise to stay calm because her family was in there already stressed, I promised. And he told me she isn't recognizing anyone. He doesn't know who her mother is. What? Why wouldn't she know her mom? She's experiencing severe amnesia. She doesn't remember anything from the past several years. I couldn't believe it. But that's temporary, right? The memories come back. They always come back. His silence was deafening sometimes. He finally said, it's hard to say. I watched her mother crying and understood now her own daughter didn't know who she was anymore. I just took a deep Breath and pushed open the door ready for anything. I turned the corner and saw my girl. She was propped up in the hospital bed, a bandage wrapped around her head, her left arm in a cast. Even though she was in the roughest state I've ever seen her in, she was still the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I was so happy she was okay. And I crunched over to the side of her bed. She was on even stronger meds than me. But when she looked at me, I could tell she was confused. She goes, hi. I gave her a smile, but I could tell by the way she was looking at me that she didn't know who I was. Her body survived, but I was terrified that the girl I fell in love with wasn't with me anymore. I felt tears in my eyes. But before it got too bad, she says, you're funny looking, but you're cute. Why are you crying? I didn't know what to say. This is probably weird to say, but you're actually really cute. I couldn't help it. I laughed. Even with no memory of us, she was still her. You think I'm cute, I asked. Tears streaming down my face but smiling through them. Yeah, I think I like you. She was definitely still her. And then I couldn't help myself. I knew she was still there. So without thinking, I just kissed her. And as soon as I Did. Her jaw literally dropped in her dazed state. She couldn't believe what had just happened and start saying, he kissed me. The cute guy just kissed me. I kissed her again and she started blushing and I knew I was falling for her all over again. She had to relearn how to do pretty much everything. But although her memory never came back, before that day, we fell in love again. Now I'm planning to propose for the second time.

Want to check what's wrong with the washing machine? I never expected that I would actually get stuck in the washing machine. Just an hour ago, Secretary Emma escorted Lisa back home. But Lisa stopped Emma, who just about to leave, ask Emma to give her a massage. Emma didn't feel the least bit tired. Instead, she felt that this was a reward for her. After some time, Lisa then picked up a basket of clothes to wash after she stuffed the washing machine. Then I was ready to wash the clothes, but the washing machine broke down. At this moment, Lisa, who doesn't know how to repair, ultimately, I chose to call a repair company. An hour later, the doorbell just rang at the door. The angry Lisa opened the door. Just blame Peter outside the door. After realizing that Peter didn't mean it either, and he let Peter in to carry out the repair. Little did I know that Peter was actually an intern. Ask Lisa, intern, what's wrong with the washing machine? Lisa accused Peter in disbelief. If I knew, why would I still come to you? Only then did Peter come to his senses. He smiled and apologized to Lisa. Fifteen minutes later, Lisa found that Peter hadn't fixed it yet. He took the initiative to check the inside of the washing machine for Peter. However, due to Lisa's excessive depth, this caused Lisa's body to get stuck in the washing Machine. Upon learning of this, Peter immediately placed his hand on Lisa's waist, pull Lisa out of the washing machine with force. Lisa is leaning against the sofa to rest. I turned around and found that Peter is holding her underpants. Ignoring Lisa's complaint, Peter took out a pair of sex underwear. Lisa was impatiently trying to get her underwear back, but he accidentally pushed Peter down onto the sofa.

How can I explain this? Last weekend we went to the camping together with my boyfriend's family. His mom, 49, his dad, 53. My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. I'm pretty comfortable being myself around his parents, especially since this isn't the first trip we've taken together. His dad has always been touchy, flirty, and attentive towards me. When he hugs from behind, he scares me off and gropes my melons. I never say anything. I just let him do him. Anyways, back to the story. Usually I dress comfy when I travel. I wore a stretchy skirt and a white tee. We stopped after three hours at a calm gas station. I hop out to breathe some fresh air after sitting in a warm car without air conditioning. My nips are cutting through my shirt. I walk in the gas station trying to find a bottle of water to cool myself down. My boyfriend goes to the bathroom. His dad comes up while I'm looking at drinks and says my melons are blinding. I just laugh and look back at the freezer. My boyfriend and his mom are still using the bathroom while me and his dad walk out to the car. We hop in and he asks may I stare at your nipples? I feel a bit awkward, but I just nod and he starts groping and rubbing my cherries. He starts telling me about how hot I am. We see my boyfriend and his mom walking out, so we act normal again. No lie, I couldn't erase the thought about what he did. When we arrived at the camping, we set our tent and chilled that night. My boyfriend slumped immediately and I couldn't sleep. The only thing I could think about was his dad. I got out of the tent and whispered to the other tent where mom and dad slept that I needed some assistance to find the bathroom. My boyfriend's dad rapidly went out his tent and walked with me to the bathroom. He stripped to his underwear with a giant cucumber. He immediately walks closer, grabs me and starts touching my peach and melons. He takes off my shirt and underwear and puts me on my knees. I immediately started.

What happened? Me and my girlfriend Celia had been together for six months when she asked me if I wanted to meet her family. And by this point, I was sure that Celia was my future wife. So I kissed her forehead and said yes. Celia immediately glowed with excitement. Okay, great. And don't worry about it being awkward, babe. My sister's husband Lorcan will be there. And Lorcan's a cop, too, just like you. So at least you'll have something to bond over. I nodded, because that really did feel reassuring. It's always nice to have another brother in blue around. So we get to her parents house and I'm shaking hands, giving hugs, doing the whole meet the family thing, when Lorcan walks in. He's wearing his police uniform, which I thought was weird since it was just a casual family dinner, but whatever. Some guys are proud of the badge, I get it. But then I actually looked at his uniform and something felt off. The insignia. Police badge looked wrong. It looked like something you'd buy from a Halloween store, not something from a police station. I told myself I was being paranoid. Maybe I was just nervous and looking for problems. We were all halfway through our meal of white people chicken and with no seasoning when Lorcan started talking about his police job. Yeah, I got a 10 to 70 call last week. It was really Dangerous, but hey, all part of the job. My stomach dropped with confusion. A 10 to 70 wasn't a police code for anything dangerous. It was code for a car that was parked wrong. I stared at him to see if he was joking, but he wasn't. His mom looked at him with so much pride, it actually hurt to watch his mom spoke. We've cancelled dozens of family vacations over the seven years that Lorcan has been a cop because Lorcan got called into work at the last minute. That's the price you pay when your son is out there saving lives. She sang. His dad chimed in, turning to face me and Lorcan. It's ridiculous how underpaid police officers like you guys are. We've had to lend Lorcan money multiple times to cover expenses, he said, shaking his head. Nothing was making sense. If Lorcan really had been a police officer for seven years, then he would have been paid at least 80,000 a year. He wouldn't need to borrow money from his parents. I had to know more. I turned to face Lorcan and said, it's crazy how much union dues went up this year, right? If he really was a cop, he'd go into a 10 minute rant about politics. Instead, he just nodded and said, yeah, it's crazy. That's it. Any real police officer would have gone on and on about policy, laws. That's when my girlfriend started bragging about how hard Lorcan Works. He's always doing double shifts, he said. Larkin nodded and chimed in, yeah, I think I've been taking around 30 to 40 hours of overtime a week. His dad nodded approvingly. That's my boy. I almost choked on my water. No sergeant in any department approves that much overtime without an emergency. At this point, I was almost certain Larkin wasn't a cop. But if he wasn't a cop, then what was he? Where was all that money going? Where was he all those nights when his family thought he was out saving lives? I excused myself to use the bathroom. Once I was alone, I pulled out my phone and ran Lorcan's name through our database. And when the results came back, my face drained of color. There was no record of him being a police officer anywhere. I walked back to the table feeling sick. This family had been bled dry by a lie, and they had no idea. And just when I'd hoped Lorcan would shut the f up, he kept going. He smiled and tapped his water glass with his fork. That everyone's here together. I think it's the perfect time to make an announcement. The table went silent. I got promoted to detective last month. Clap, clap, clap. His entire family started cheering for him. Rage boiled my blood. I couldn't take it anymore, so I said it. I ran your name in the database, Lorcan. You've never been a cop. Not here, not Anywhere? The table went dead silent. Lorcan tried to laugh it off. Dude, chill. You're just jealous I made detective, and now you're trying to make me look bad. I laughed at how stupid he sound. Okay, Larkin, let's play a game. One where I talk and you listen. You said you responded to a 10:47 last week. That's emergency road repair, Larkin. Not exactly messy. I continued, no sergeant would approve 40 hours of overtime a week, ever. It exceeds the budget and would get someone fired. His mom looked confused. His dad put down his fork. I continued, and that insignia? Police badge. Cheap metal. That's not department issued. That's a costume. You've been lying about being a

But someone else walked into the room and put her phone on speaker. What I heard made my blood run cold. I pressed flat against the floor under our hotel bed, biting back a laugh. My tux was getting ring. My wife Rachel would kill me when I jumped out yelling surprise. We've been together five years. She loved pranks. The door opened, high heels clicked across the hardwood. Not Rachel's footsteps. My mother in law, Diane, sat on the edge of the bed. The springs groaned above my head. Martha, hold on. I'm calling you from the honeymoon suite, she laughed. No, the idiot's still downstairs shmoozing with guests. My stomach dropped. The plans working perfectly, Diane continued. Rachel's got him wrapped around her little finger. He signed the prenup. I drafted things. It protects him. Moron doesn't know it's worthless. I had my lawyer double check half his trust fund becomes hers. The second they hit six months, I stop breathing. Better yet, his dad already transferred the lighthouse into both their names as a wedding gift. That's worth 2 million alone. Rachel plays the loving wife for a year. Then we claim irreconcilable differences. She walks away with millions. My blood turned to ice. Oh, you should have seen him at the altar actually crying like he won the lottery, she cackled. Martha, the boy is pathetic. Rich, yes, but pathetic. Rachel doesn't even Have to sleep with him much. She can claim she's tired from work. Rachel, my Rachel, the woman I just married. His father's the real Jackpot, though. When the old man dies, everything goes to the son. And if Rachel still married to him, even better. We're talking 50 million, Martha, 50 million. Rachel just has to stick it out. I felt like I've been punched in the gut. Diane stood up. Anyway, I have to get back downstairs before anyone notices. Keep this between us. Rachel's playing her part beautifully. I'll call you tomorrow. She left. I lay there shaking, not from cold, from rage. Rachel didn't love me. She never had. Five years of lies. Every kiss, every I love you all fake, a con. I pulled out my phone, hit record. The second I heard Diane's voice, I had everything. I crawled out from under the bed, called my lawyer, Tom. I need an annulment. I have proof of fraud. Sending it now. You've been married three hours. Just listen to the recording 30 seconds later. Holy hell yeah. This avoids everything, the prenup, the house transfer, all of it. Good. I'm going downstairs. The reception was in full swing. Crystal Chandeliers, String Quartet, 300 guests. Rachel's family had spared no expense with my money. Rachel rushed over, gorgeous in her white dress. There you are. Everyone's waiting for our first dance. I have a surprise first. Her eyes lit up. Really? What? I took the microphone from the DJ tapped it. The music stopped. Everyone, can I have your attention? My voice echoed through the ballroom. I want to thank you all for being here on this special day. Rachel beamed beside me. Diane stood near the cake table smiling.

Four years of marriage dissolved in six weeks of Thursday evening meetings. It started small. We were discussing renovating our kitchen when I suggested a layout that would make cooking more efficient. I prepared most of our meals. That's just your male perspective, she interrupted with a dismissive wave. The kitchen should flow according to feminine energy. Then I came home to find our comfortable sectional replaced with furniture that felt like sitting on concrete. We're implementing a new house rule, no male opinions on our living space. She wasn't joking. Her tone was dead serious. Over the next few weeks, the rule expanded. My input on weekend plans not welcome. Thoughts on dinner choices irrelevant. Even my preference for the thermostat was dismissed as mansplaining temperature sure. Then came the 2,000 dollar photographer she booked without discussion. That's outside our budget, I pointed out. We agreed to build our emergency fund first. Are you seriously mansplaining finances? To me, the rule applies to money decisions, too, from the account I mainly fund. That's financial abuse. That night, I silently transferred half our savings to a private account. The breaking point came during a dinner she organized for her empowerment group. I'd spent the afternoon grilling at her insistence. You can at least make yourself useful in the background, it said. Eight women swept into our home. The conversation revolved around how disappointing Men were. I remained silent, serving food and refilling drinks. When I commented on a three week European vacation she'd announced without ever discussing it with me, every head turned with disdain. I decided it, my wife replied coldly. We don't need your permission. My wife's eyes narrowed. I think you should give us privacy for the rest of dinner. Your opinion isn't required here. Leave my own dining room where I prepared the food they were eating. Because my gender disqualified me from conversation, I nodded once, placed my napkin beside my plate and walked upstairs. From the bedroom window, I could hear their laughter resume louder now that the male presence had been removed. I opened my laptop and began researching divorce attorneys. The next three weeks became a master class in strategic preparation. I documented everything, dates, times, exact words, screenshots of bank transfers she made without consultation. I secured a furnished apartment downtown. We're having my group Celebration here Saturday, she informed me. Handle the food then make yourself scarce. The entire house will be a no mail zone. The invitation couldn't have been more perfect. Saturday I prepared an elaborate spread, grilled salmon, roasted vegetables, homemade desserts, a final demonstration of the value she was discarding. This looks acceptable, she noted. Remember to be gone.

Do you think I'm stupid or something, honey? I don't even understand what's going on, I told her, sitting in the living room surrounded by both our families, like some kind of intervention. You're a disgusting pig, my wife's mother spat. You're literally a 3 out of 10 on a good day, her sister said sharply, crossing her arms over her chest. My wife sat there crying. I heard everything. Well, apparently she didn't. I smiled at them, knowing that all of these false accusations were about to flip. Three days earlier, I've been on the phone in our bedroom dealing with a complete disaster. She's gotten huge, I said to the receptionist on the phone. I'm pretty sure she's nearly obese at this point. And trust me, when I first saw her, she wasn't like that at all. She was so small and cute, you know, and all that hair and dirty nails, it's just gusting. Every time I see it, I get chills. Oh, I completely understand, sir. It's actually quite normal as they get older, she said. I sighed, feeling relieved. Awesome. I need to get her a salon appointment ASAP. When's the next available reservation slot? That's when I noticed my wife standing in the doorway. I waved at her while finishing up. Yeah, Tuesday works. Thanks so much. Just as I hung up, her face crumpled. Tears started streaming down her cheeks and she ran to The bathroom, slamming the door behind her. I knocked, honey, what's wrong? Nothing but muffled sobbing. When she finally came out, she stormed past me into the bedroom and slammed that door, too, yelling, no salon. I stood in the hallway completely confused. Why would she be upset about me taking a cat to the pet salon for a quick grooming appointment? It was supposed to be a surprise, but I didn't think she'd be so upset about her gift. Well, I shook off the weird thought and figured maybe she was upset for other reasons and everything would be better again soon. Nope, I was wrong. Things actually got worse. Everywhere I went in town, people started glaring at me for no reason. The grocery store cashier muttered disgusting while scanning my milk in the parking lot. Some random woman marched up. You should be ashamed of yourself. Then she just walked away. At Sunday church, everyone moved. When I sat down in a nearby pew, Father Michael, who I swear has never said an unkind word to anyone, patted my shoulder. Son, you're gonna need more than Jesus to fix that personality. Even the priest was roasting me. When my mom called, yelling at me furiously, I finally understood exactly what was happening. I didn't raise you to speak to a woman that way. Seriously. You just had to call her obese and talk about her hair and nails like that. Mom, how many people know about that? Practically the entire town.

I hired a clown for my son's 8th birthday party without checking his background. Tommy had been obsessed with circuses for months, begging me to hire a real clown for his party. After weeks of hesting, I finally gave in and found this guy online called giggles who had dozens of 5 star reviews and professional photos. Profile said he'd been entertaining kids for over 15 years. Parents raved about how magical he made their children feel. The booking process was smooth. He even offered to arrive early to set up decorations. He showed up right on time in full costume, red nose, rainbow wig, oversized polka dot suit, a complete package. He had this warm, gentle voice that immediately put everyone at ease. All 12 kids at the party were mesmerized from the moment he walked in. He knew every child's name somehow, which I figured I must have provided when booking. He made each kid feel special with personalized balloon animals, Dinosaur for Jake, who loved paleontology, a princess crown for Sarah who wore tutus everywhere. His magic tricks were incredible, real professional level illusions that had the adults impressed, too. He pulled live doves from his hat, made flowers appear from thin air, even levitated a birthday cake three feet off the table. He kept gravitating toward Tommy, specifically during group activities, he positioned himself next to my son. When kids were laughing at a joke, his eyes would be locked on Tommy's Reaction? At first, I thought it was just good customer service, extra attention for the birthday boy. He'd pull Tommy aside for special birthday magic that the other kids couldn't see. Tommy would giggle and run back to the group. But I noticed these private moments becoming more frequent. And during the balloon animal session, I saw him lean down and whisper something directly into Tommy's ear. My son's entire demeanor changed instantly. The smile vanished from his face, shoulders tensed up. He went completely silent and wouldn't participate in any more activities after that moment. Tommy wouldn't leave my side for the rest of the party. He clung to my leg during the cake cutting. When other kids tried to talk to him, he just stared at the ground. The clown kept trying to reengage him with jokes and tricks, but Tommy actively avoided eye contact. The other parents started commenting on how quiet the birthday boy had gotten. I made excuses about him being overwhelmed by all the attention. But something felt deeply wrong. When the clown finally packed up his supplies and left, I immediately pulled Tommy aside. The other kids were still playing in the backyard, so we had privacy in the living room. What did the funny man whisper to you, buddy? I asked gently. Tommy looked around nervously, then whispered back, daddy.

He's just a weird outsider. I smiled. You're right. Then I paid for everyone except her and her husband, leaving them with the $2,000 Bill. Her husband started crying. The waiter was refilling our water glasses when Jessica said it. We were at Moretti's, the expensive steakhouse downtown with dim lighting and leather boots. Kind of place with cloth napkins and a wine list thicker than a phone book. The whole family was there for Dad's 60th birthday. Mom, dad, my two sisters, their husbands. Eight of us crowded into a corner booth. The waiter set down Jessica's water, and she looked up at him with this bright, fake smile. You know what's funny? She said, loud enough for everyone to hear. He's not even really part of our family. He's just this weird outsider who happened to grow up with us. She pointed at me with her wine glass. The waiter's smile froze. He looked at me, then back at her, clearly uncomfortable. Her husband, Brad, laughed into his napkin. Jess, you can't just say that. Why not? It's true. Right, Marcus? Everyone went quiet. Mom studied her menu. Dad adjusted his glasses. My other sister, Emily, suddenly found her phone very interesting. The waiter mumbled something about coming back in a minute and disappeared. My throat felt tight. My hands went cold under the table. I smiled. You're right. I am different. Jessica raised Her glass. See? He admits it. The conversation moved on. They talked about dessert options, dad's upcoming retirement, the vacation house they were planning to buy. Normal family stuff that I apparently wasn't part of. I sat there nodding, smiling, making appropriate sounds. Jessica and Brad kept ordering another bottle of wine. The premium aged steaks. Appetizers. She got the lobster tail add on. He ordered the surf and turf. When the waiter suggested the truffle fries as a side, Jessica said, why not? We're celebrating. I watched the numbers add up in my head. When I excuse myself to use the bathroom, I caught the waiter near the bar instead. I'd like to pay for the table tonight, I said quietly. His face brightened. Oh, that's very generous, but I need you to split the Bill. I'll cover everyone except the woman who made that comment earlier and her husband put their orders on a separate check. He blinked. You want them on their own Bill? Everything they've ordered itemized. I'll pay for the rest of the table. I 2% now. I 2% I t percent 80% 80%. Understanding dawned on his face. A small smile appeared. I can do that. I handed him my card. Run mine now. Don't mention it until the end of dinner. Understood. I went back to the table and played the perfect brother for another hour. Asked dad about his birthday plans, complimented Mom's new haircut, made small talk about the weather. Jessica And Brad ordered dessert. The chocolate. Have a cake for two coffees. After dinner drinks, the Bill climbed higher. When the waiter finally returned, he placed the check presenter in front of me. Then he walked around and set another one directly in front of Jessica.

However, he ended up plowing deep into me. I had my son when I was quite young. Throughout his life, we have been very close to each other. Because of his age gap between his younger siblings, he took on the role and helped raise them with us. When my husband passed, I looked to my son for support in our family as he was now the man of the house. I was by no means without a job, but I needed him for help around the house and more importantly, emotionally. Shortly after my husband passed and we were done grieving for the most part, I started asking my son to sleep in my bed with me. I needed someone to be beside me, hold me and sleep with me. It didn't take long before there started to be a noticeable tension between us. When we would talk to each other about our day, we would sit very close to each other. One of those times we leaned in and embraced each other. After a few very awkward moments, things became serious. In the months after, we normalized a lot of frisky stuff. We both needed emotional and physical support and we were both there for each other. Yes, we caught each other playing off quite a bit during this period, too, as we now completely shared a room. The tension between us was getting fierce at this point. So I decided to do something about it. I sat down with my son late at night when we usually talk and hang out, and I brought up the topic of the deed. But I didn't expect what he would say next. Press share in more for Part 2.

Katie said she'd grab drinks and told us to get changed first. I went to the bathroom and put on the blue bikini she gave me. My heart was racing because I knew exactly what was about to happen. I got outside and Ryan was already in the hot tub. Katie was still inside getting drinks. I climbed in and sat across from him. The second I was in the water, his eyes dropped straight to my chest and stayed there. I was trying to play it cool, but he could not stop staring. I just acted completely normal, asking him about his job and talking about the weather. He was stumbling over his words and his face was turning red. A few minutes later, Katie came out with drinks and froze when she saw me. Her mouth literally dropped open. She slowly got in the hot tub and kept staring at me. Is that the bikini I got you? She asked quietly. I smiled really big and said, yes, I love it so much I wear it everywhere now. I started making up stories about wearing it to the beach last week and to some pool party where tons of guys were. Katie just kept saying oh over and over and looking back and forth between me and Ryan. He was still trying not to Stare but failing. We stayed in the hot tub for like 30 minutes and the whole time it was so awkward. When we finally got out, I went inside to change back into my clothes. Katie followed me and closed the door. I'm really sorry, she said. I thought you'd notice right away that it goes see through. It was supposed to be a joke. I acted confused. Yeah, I know it's see through. Why did you buy me a see through bathing suit? Her face got all red and angry. Wait, you knew? So you just spent the last 30 minutes flashing my boyfriend on purpose? I grabbed my bag and shrugged. I'm just wearing the birthday gift my best friend gave me. Then I left. She's been blowing up my phone ever since, calling me horrible names.

I was getting a massive pump on my legs when I was mid squatting. I was thinking about the fact that I could be squatting on someone's Johnson right now. I looked to my right and saw two friends doing some hip thrusts. I don't know what it is, but the idea of being hip thrusted just triggered something inside me. I worked up the courage to go over and ask if they were interested in a trio some. Obviously they didn't turn me down because this was probably the best thing that could ever happen to them. Anyways, we both finished with the gym and went out to the car. We decided that we should just do it there because it would be quick and easy. The plan was that one of them would be on the lookout while the other guy would have some fun. The first guy didn't last very long because he was nervous and couldn't find any composure. The second guy was great though. He knew what he was doing and treated me very well. We all finished up and went our separate ways. Not going to lie, I am going to the gym today and I am wondering if I should do it again with another group of friends.

And she mouths every single word. Priya stared at me like I was a psychic. Lucky guess number two. Fine, Rodrigo said, pulling out his phone. If you're really dating, prove it. Kiss her. The CVS employee dropped an entire box of shampoo bottles. Priya and I looked at each other. Her eyes were asking permission. Terrified but determined, I nodded slightly. She's put on her tiptoes. I leaned down, and we shared the most awkward, closed mouth middle school dance kiss in CBS history. Satisfied? I asked, wiping my mouth for effect. But Rodrigo wasn't done. What's her biggest fear? You, I said without hesitation. That's why she changed her number, moved apartments, and switch James. That's why she's shopping at CVS across town at 2:00am instead of the one near her place. That's why her hands haven't stopped shaking since he walked in. The store went silent except for the fluorescent light buzzing. I just want to talk, he said, but his voice had gone cold. No, Priya finally spoke up. You want to control. There's a difference. The CVS employee cleared his throat. Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're disturbing other customers. We were literally the only people there, but I appreciated the backup. Rodrigo looked around, realized he was outnumbered, and stormed out, shouting something about this not being over. The automatic doors weezes shut behind him. Priya collapsed against the candy display, finally letting herself cry for real. The CVS employee brought her a box of tissues from aisle 4 and refused her money. On the house. That guy's been in here before. He gives me the creeps. Sat on the curb outside until Priya stopped shaking. She told me Rodrigo had been showing up everywhere lately. The gym, the coffee shop, her sister's apartment building. She'd been staying with different friends every night, too scared to establish a pattern. How did you know about the princess ride? She asked. Lucky guess. You seem like the type who appreciates true love and good sword fights. She laughed for the first time all night. And my grandmother's name? Your necklace, I admitted. It says Amara in small letters. Figured it was someone important. She touched the necklace unconsciously. You're incredibly observant for someone in SpongeBob pants. They're comfortable, I defended. We exchanged numbers. Real ones. I walked her to her friend's apartment 12 blocks away, making sure Rodrigo wasn't following. At the door, she hugged me tight. Thank you for being my fake girlfriend. You're very convincing. Method acting, I said. I really committed to the role. Three days later, she texted me that Rodrigo had been arrested for violating a restraining order at her sister's place. A month later, she invited me for coffee to say thanks properly. Six months later, we were actually dating. Now it's been two years. We still shop at that CVS sometimes. The same employee still works nights. Last week, he grinned at Us. And said so. Did you ever tell her your real middle name? Priya laughed. She guessed it right the first time. It was fate. Sometimes the best relationships start with a lie that becomes the truth.

I was buying migraine medicine at 2 in the morning when this woman grabbed my arm near the pharmacy counter. Please, she whispered, mascara streaking down her face, just pretend for five minutes. I'll pay you. Before I could respond, she linked her arm through mine and loudly said, Babe, did you find the vitamins? A man I hadn't noticed was standing by the shampoo aisle, watching us with an expression that made my skin crawl. That's my ex. She kissed through a fake smile. Rodrigo. He's been following me for three blocks. Rodrigo started walking over, all six foot something of him in a wrinkled suit that probably cost more than my car. The woman's grip on my arm tightened. She was shaking. Priya, he said, ignoring me completely, we need to talk about us. There is no us, she said, pressing closer to me. I told you, I'm seeing someone. His eyes finally landed on me. 5 feet 4, wearing SpongeBob pajama pants and a paint stained college hoodie. Clearly not anyone's girlfriend at this particular moment. This is who you're dating? The disbelief in his voice was insulting. Something about his tone flipped a switch in me. I straightened up and pulled Priya closer. Yeah. Problem? How long have you been together? He crossed his arms like he was conducting an interrogation. Four months, Priya said. At the exact moment I said six months. Rodrigo smirked. The overnight CVS employee was pretending to stock shelves while obviously listening every word. We've been together four months, officially, I improvised. But we were friends for two months before that. 6 months total since we met at that pottery class. I looked at Priya meaningfully. Remember you made that lopsided vase? She caught on quick. You said it had character. Because it did, just like you. I turned back to Rodrigo. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're trying to pick up her prescription. She doesn't have any prescriptions, he said triumphantly. I would know. We were together for three years. Priya's whole body tensed. I could feel her starting to panic. Without thinking, I stepped forward, putting myself. Actually, she does. For anxiety, which started about three years ago. Weird coincidence, right? The CVS employee snorted and tried to cover it with a cough. Rodrigo's face went red. You don't know anything about her? What's her middle name? I had no idea. But Priya squeezed my hand twice. Some kind of signal? I took a wild guess. She doesn't use it anymore. Not since her grandmother Amara passed. Two painful. Priya gasped. I'd either nailed it or completely failed, but she played along, dabbing at her eyes. You remembered. What's her favorite movie? Rodrigo demanded, getting desperate. Which one? I shot back. The one she tells everyone or the one she actually watches when she's sad? He blinked. Thrown off, I pressed the Advantage, the one she tells people is Casablanca because it sounds sophisticated, but really it's the prince.

When I asked, my dad said, it belongs to your sister. But I showed them every deposit and one in court. Growing up, I Learned early that fairness wasn't something our family believed in. My sister Lily got everything. Ballet lessons that cost hundreds a month, a brand new Honda at 16. College tuition paid in full without her lifting a finger. Me, I got a bus pass and a lecture about building character. When I asked for help with community college costs, dad said I'd appreciate my education more if I earned it myself. So I did. I worked weekends at a grocery store, picked up night shifts at a warehouse, took out loans I'm still paying off. Every dollar I made went toward tuition or rent or keeping myself fed. Meanwhile, Lily posted Instagram photos from spring break trips I could never afford. But I kept grinding. Got my engineering degree, landed a solid job, and started saving obsessively. No fancy dinners, no vacations, no new clothes, unless the old ones had holes. For five straight years, I funneled every bonus, every overtime check, every tax refund into one account. My house fund. When I finally had enough for a down payment, I found a small two bedroom condo on the edge of town. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. I called mom crying when my offer got accepted. She actually seemed happy for me. Threw me a little Celebration. Dinner that weekend. Lily showed up late, sat in the corner stirring her wine glass. Must be nice having that engineering salary, she muttered. Some of us are still paying off grad school. I tried to ignore the sting. Mom changed the subject quickly. The day I closed on the condo, dad came by to see it. Walked through every room, nodded slowly. Smart investment if you did it right, he said. I thought that was his version of being proud. Two weeks later, a process server knocked on my door. Legal paper. My parents were suing me for the house. I called dad immediately, hands shaking. What is this? His voice was cold. Matter of fact, that house belongs to your sister. Your mother and I discussed this with our attorney. The down payment came from inheritance money that was meant for Lily's first home. I felt like I've been punched. What inheritance? Grandma split everything equally. I never touched that money. Every cent for this house came from my paychecks. You're making this more complicated than it needs to be, he said. Lily needs that house more than you do. She's planning for it. You can buy another one later. I hung up and immediately called my bank. Pulled every statement from the last five years. Every deposit had a clear paper trail. Payroll transfers, direct deposits. Nothing from any inheritance account. When we got to court, their lawyer painted this picture of a greedy daughter who'd stolen Her sister's dream. Dad took the stand first. Confident and calm. He testified about a long standing family understanding that grandma's inheritance money was earmarked for Lily's first home purchase. Mom went next, dabbing her eyes with a you. Talked about how much Lily had sacrificed, how she didn't make as much money as me, how unfair it was that I'd used family money to get ahead. She made it sound like I'd robbed them. Lily sat at their table looking wounded, like betrayed her somehow. A few relatives in the gallery nodded along sympathetically. Then my lawyer stood up. She presented a thick folder to the judge. Five years of pay stubs. Every single one. Transfer records showing money moving from my employer directly to my personal savings account. Bank statements with highlighted deposits, each one labeled and dated. Tax returns proving the income loan. DOC

When I asked, my dad said, it belongs to your sister. But I showed them every deposit and one in court. Growing up, I Learned early that fairness wasn't something our family believed in. My sister Lily got everything. Ballet lessons that cost hundreds a month, a brand new Honda at 16. College tuition paid in full without her lifting a finger. Me, I got a bus pass and a lecture about building character. When I asked for help with community college costs, dad said I'd appreciate my education more if I earned it myself. So I did. I worked weekends at a grocery store, picked up night shifts at a warehouse, took out loans I'm still paying off. Every dollar I made went toward tuition or rent or keeping myself fed. Meanwhile, Lily posted Instagram photos from spring break trips I could never afford. But I kept grinding. Got my engineering degree, landed a solid job, and started saving obsessively. No fancy dinners, no vacations, no new clothes, unless the old ones had holes. For five straight years, I funneled every bonus, every overtime check, every tax refund into one account. My house fund. When I finally had enough for a down payment, I found a small two bedroom condo on the edge of town. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. I called mom crying when my offer got accepted. She actually seemed happy for me. Threw me a little Celebration. Dinner that weekend. Lily showed up late, sat in the corner stirring her wine glass. Must be nice having that engineering salary, she muttered. Some of us are still paying off grad school. I tried to ignore the sting. Mom changed the subject quickly. The day I closed on the condo, dad came by to see it. Walked through every room, nodded slowly. Smart investment if you did it right, he said. I thought that was his version of being proud. Two weeks later, a process server knocked on my door. Legal paper. My parents were suing me for the house. I called dad immediately, hands shaking. What is this? His voice was cold. Matter of fact, that house belongs to your sister. Your mother and I discussed this with our attorney. The down payment came from inheritance money that was meant for Lily's first home. I felt like I've been punched. What inheritance? Grandma split everything equally. I never touched that money. Every cent for this house came from my paychecks. You're making this more complicated than it needs to be, he said. Lily needs that house more than you do. She's planning for it. You can buy another one later. I hung up and immediately called my bank. Pulled every statement from the last five years. Every deposit had a clear paper trail. Payroll transfers, direct deposits. Nothing from any inheritance account. When we got to court, their lawyer painted this picture of a greedy daughter who'd stolen Her sister's dream. Dad took the stand first. Confident and calm. He testified about a long standing family understanding that grandma's inheritance money was earmarked for Lily's first home purchase. Mom went next, dabbing her eyes with a you. Talked about how much Lily had sacrificed. How she didn't make as much money as me. How unfair it was that I'd used family money to get ahead. She made it sound like I'd robbed them. Lily sat at their table looking wounded, like I betrayed her somehow. A few relatives in the gallery nodded along sympathetically. Then my lawyer stood up. She sent a thick folder to the judge. Five years of pay stubs. Every single one. Transfer records showing money moving from my employer directly to my personal savings account. Bank statements with highlighted deposits. Each one labeled

I said nothing, just started documenting everything. Six months later, he called me into his office with HR. I've been working as a junior analyst at Michelin Cross for 3 years. The pay was decent, work was straightforward, and I actually enjoyed what I did. But my boss, Derek, had this way of making me feel like I was constantly failing, even when I wasn't. He'd walk past my desk without acknowledging me for days. Then suddenly when a client complained or a report was late, I'd be pulled into his office for a lecture about accountability and professionalism. It didn't matter if the mistake was actually his or someone else's. I was the easiest target. One Tuesday afternoon, I walked to the shared printer on our floor to grab some contract copies I'd sent over. The machine was still warm, spitting out pages. And there, face up on the tray was a document with my name at the top, employee performance review confidential. So I glanced around. The floor was quiet. Most people were at lunch. I picked it up and started reading. Derek's notes. Shows up late, constantly spends half the day on personal calls and texting, barely meets minimum standards, does not take initiative, recommend no raise this cycle, possible Pip if behavior continues. My stomach dropped. Read it again, slower this time, thinking maybe I'd misunderstood. But no, it Was right there, black ink on white paper. The thing is, none of it was true. I've been arriving at least 15 minutes early every single day for the past year. I made coffee, prepped reports, answered early emails before anyone else even got in. My phone usage was almost entirely work related, tracking project updates in our client portal app or coordinating with the sales team and performance. I'd closed more accounts in the last quarter than anyone else on the team. Three major clients had specifically requested to work with me again. I stood there holding that paper, hand shaking, not from sadness but from pure anger. I took a photo with my phone, then I put the document back exactly where I found it and walk back to my desk. That's when I decided no confrontation, no emotional outburst, cold detailed evidence. I started keeping receipts on everything. Every email I sent I BCC to my personal account with time stamps. Every client win I documented with confirmations and thank you notes. Every morning I arrived early, I sent myself a photo of the office clock showing the time. I tracked Derek's schedule too. The two hour lunches while I covered his client calls. The days he left at 3 for meetings that didn't exist. I saved the Slack message where he told me to lie to a client about why a deliverable was late, a deadline he'd missed, not me. I kept a spreadsheet, dates, times Evidence, six months of my actual work compared to his false narrative. My folder grew thick with proof. Then one morning in March, Derek's assistant messaged me, Derek needs to see you in Conference Room B at two PM HR will be there. My heart rate spiked, but I stayed calm. I knew what this was. At two PM, I walked in. Derek sat on one side of the.

I spent the night in a bus station. A month later, at a family barbecue, he joked about it right as my grandfather walked up behind him holding the security footage. I'm Blake. I was the dependable one. Straight three days, part time job at a gas station. Made dinner three nights a week when both parents worked late. My brother Dylan was two years younger, but had everyone wrapped around his finger. Teachers loved him, parents worshipped him. The kid with dimples who could twist any story into spun sugar. I was just the quiet older brother who kept the house running. Then one Friday, I came home from my shift in my red and white uniform, smelling like burnt coffee and stale air freshener. Mom charged at me, where is it? She was furious. Dylan claimed I stole $300 from his room. His Christmas and birthday money. Said my backpack was in there that afternoon. I hadn't been home since morning. Didn't matter. Maybe you wanted money for your car repairs, she said. Like she'd already convicted me. You've been stressed about that busted starter, haven't you? Dad came home in his work suit, tie, still nodded. No questions, no checking Dylan's story. Just. I need to leave. I grabbed my backpack and walked out with a crumpled five dollar Bill in my pocket.

Emma gave birth first in October and posted about a million photos of baby Violet Rose on Facebook. Every single post had captions like my perfect little Violet and the most beautiful name for the most beautiful girl. She was clearly marking her territory. When I had my daughter two months later, I named her Violet May. A was my grandmother's middle name. I posted one simple photo with the caption, welcome to the world, Violet May, named after the strongest woman I ever knew. Emma commented within minutes, seriously, after everything we talked about, this is so disrespectful. Then she deleted the comment and blocked me on all social media. My brother called Jake the next day saying Emma was devastated and considering changing her daughter's name because now it was ruined. The family Christmas was a disaster. Emma refused to be in the same room as me and kept making comments about people who steal other people's ideas. When anyone asked about the babies, she'd get this wounded look and say, well, I guess there are two violets now in this martyred voice. But then something funny happened. At Easter, both girls were there, and Emma's Violet was walking around in this frilly pink dress, while my violet was crawling everywhere in overalls. Emma's mom said, it's actually nice having two Little violets. They're completely different kids. Anyway. Emma looked horrified that her own mother wasn't taking her side anymore. She tried to argue that it was still confusing and inappropriate, but everyone just started calling the babies big Violet and little Violet since Emma's daughter was older and bigger. The final straw was when Emma's Violet started calling my Violet baby cause that's what the adults called her. Emma realized her dramatic stand wasn't getting the support she expected anymore, and people were actually finding it cute that the cousins shared a name. She eventually stopped making comments about it, but she still gives me dirty looks at family events.

She says if she waters it 20,000 times, the stone will grant her any wish. But I never believed her. I grabbed a crowbar and knocked the stone over. Then I picked it up and carried it away. The villagers quickly put their hands together and prayed devoutly. But to their surprise, I carried the stone straight under the waterfall. Then I told my mother, this way we could water it 50,000 times at once. But soon something strange happened. A mask suddenly fell to my feet. From that day on, I couldn't stop staring at it. Until one day, I accidentally traced the outline of the face on the mask. I slowly drew out the person's features. And somehow I felt my heart race. So I ran toward the top of the waterfall. When I reached the source, I saw a fairy covered in colorful butterflies. I leapt toward her with all my strength. But just as I grabbed a branch, she vanished. Following her guidance, climbed through the waterfall for three days and nights. Finally, I made a bow and arrow from branches. I jumped and fired an arrow. The sword pierced through a tall tree and got stuck at the top. I finally made it to the summit. The fairy was right in front of me. Just as I reached out to touch her, Annie turned into a butterfly and flew away. I searched the forest for her traces. I Heard a scream. I ran to check it out. I saw Annie running out of the woods with soldiers chasing behind her. It was clear she was being hunted. To protect her, I followed them closely. When the soldiers were about to catch her, Annie shouted a mysterious spell. A sword flew through the air. He turned around and the blade pierced through the soldier's body. Then the rest of the soldiers fell one by one. Turns out archers were hidden among the trees. Annie killed every soldier below without a single drop of blood on her. In that moment, I was completely captivated. So to catch her, I set a trap to lure her in. Soon she fell right into it. I happily came to take a look. Suddenly, a sword pressed against my back. She had somehow gotten behind me and her sword pierced into my body. I told her I had already fallen in love with her. Then I held her tightly in my arms. Unfortunately, we rolled down the snowy mountain together. Annie was furious. She tried to strike me down, but I flipped backward and tore off her sleeve. Then I turned and pulled off her coat, lifted her long hair and washed her under the waterfall. Crushed berries to draw eyeliner and lipstick on her face. She turned around and saw me holding the mask she had lost. Then she realized I had come for her. She was touched and hugged me tightly. But She still had to rescue the princess, so she knocked me out and left alone. Not long after she left, an accident happened. A soldier threw a fishing net over her, catching her alive. When they tried to harm her, I showed up just in time. As the soldiers got closer, I pushed down a huge boulder. It stopped the pursuers, but unexpectedly, the impact triggered a landslide. I quickly grabbed some tree bark and slid down the slope with Annie. Just as the snow was about to bury us alive, a cliff appeared ahead. I leaped forward with her and we both survived. Soon I arrived at the palace, where workers were raising a giant statue of the king. But suddenly, a slave slipped, triggering a chain reaction.

I only use it to take pictures for social media. And the reason I do this is to hide the fact that I'm a killer. Because I've already killed eight girls. And thanks to that bowl of noodles every morning, the police still haven't noticed I exist. Because I keep using the victim's phones to update their social media. And every time I post, I set the location to another country to make it look like the victims are still alive. And my method of committing the crimes is very every time. I start by getting the victim's phone. Whenever I pick up a phone, I take it home and enter the password a few times. If I enter it wrong, I grab the phone and smash the screen on purpose. Then when the missing girl calls her own phone, I use a voice changer to pretend to be a woman who found it. Then I lure the girl to a phone repair shop. She has no idea that the moment she steps inside, she has already fallen into my trap. When I see her walk in, I immediately pull out a service agreement and use the excuse of replacing her broken screen to make her write down her phone password. And from that moment, her nightmare begins. Once I have that information, I start my real plan. First, I open the phone's motherboard. And secretly install a camera inside. Then I replace it with a new screen. But after repairing the phone, I quietly unlock it with the password, install a virus on it, and sync all her data to my phone. When the girl leaves, she even thanks me. But she has no idea that everything she does is being sent straight to me. After several days of surveillance, I completely Learned everything about her. Her name is Alice, she often helps at her dad's cafe, and her favorite drink is grapefruit juice. But Alice knew nothing and fell asleep like normal, without knowing that once she slept, I had already unlocked her phone again. And through that whole night, I dug through all her social apps, her hobbies, everything about her. And when Alice left home, I would sneak into her house, study the layout. And to get close to her, I even staged a coincidence. At the cafe she worked at, I ordered her favourite drink on purpose and used shared interest to gain her trust. Her father started to sense something was wrong with me. After work, he warned Alice to stay away from me. But they didn't know I have been listening to their entire conversation. That night, I secretly controlled Alice's phone and sent her father a strange link, tricking him into installing it. At first, he thought it was something good, so he clicked it out of curiosity. That tiny action brought him fatal danger. When He was about to rest that night. He suddenly received a delivery notification on his phone. He thought it was a surprise from his daughter.

Sean picked up a saw and started cutting the floorboards. Although it made a huge noise, he was not worried about being discovered because his cellmates were throwing a party next to him, singing and dancing to cover up the noise. As the saw moved faster, the singing grew louder. Just as the warden was inspecting the cells, Sean had just sawed a hole. The cellmate immediately took out a cherished magazine to distract the warden's attention, and Sean seized the opportunity to crawl under the floorboards. Meanwhile, another inmate deliberately ran into the yard. He then climbed up the five meter high iron fence, pretending to escape, with the purpose of diverting the attention of the guards, creating a greater hope for Sean's escape. Hearing the commotion, the warden immediately reacted and ordered his subordinates to catch the inmate with police dogs. They thought the plan would go smoothly this time, but unexpectedly, Sean was arrested again the next day and was shackled with heavy leg irons. The prison guards publicly humiliated him. The first guard ordered him to dig a pit, threatening not to give him KFC to eat if he didn't finish. Sean used all his strength to dig the pit well. The second guard angrily rebuked him for damaging the environment and ordered him to fill the pit back in. When Sean exhaustedly finished filling it, the first guard came back and questioned Him as to why he had filled in the pit. John finally couldn't take it anymore and rushed towards them. He knew that these two were clearly toying with him. But what greeted him was a brutal beating. He could only pick up the shovel in frustration and face the cruel reality. Until late at night, Mike dug out the pit again.

Whenever inmates went to the bathroom, they had to shake the branches next to them. As soon as the branches stopped moving, the distant guards would unhesitatingly raise their rifles and fire into the bushes. Therefore, the prisoners could only shout, I'm still here! While relieving themselves. However, in an unnoticed corner, Sean quietly tied the rope in his hand around a branch. From a distance, the branch kept swaying, but Sean's voice abruptly stopped. The guard, keenly aware of the anomaly, immediately fired a shot into the woods, but missed the target. He hurried over, but by the time he arrived, only a long rope remained on the ground, and Sean had long since escaped. He had even used a machete to cut through the shackles on his feet. To prevent being tracked by police dogs, Sean sprinkled pepper powder on the only path out, then quickly left the prison perimeter. By the time a large number of police officers arrived, the pungent smell caused the police dogs to sneeze incessantly, temporarily disabling their tracking abilities. Despite this, Sean remained vigilant. He knew that the news of his escape would undoubtedly enrage the prison authorities, and they would not give up easily. So when crossing the isolation zone, he set up another diversion, weaving in and out of the barbed wire to confuse the scent trail. Even well trained police dogs had difficulty discerning the direction, and some Even got stuck in the wire after being brutally tortured twice, the police dogs completely lost their intended function. In the end, the prison guards only brought back one dead police dog, and the warden, furious beyond measure, etched this humiliation in his heart. Shockingly, the next morning, a photo quietly appeared in the cell. In the picture, Sean stood side by side with a beautiful woman, a relaxed and proud smile on his face, as if flaunting his freedom to everyone. This was undoubtedly a blatant provocation to the prison system. A week later, Sean was caught again due to his overly high profile whereabouts, and was placed in solitary confinement for a month. Even so, he still did not give up the idea of escaping.

Breaking the street light was to identify the direction while out at sea. After returning to shore, she immediately went back to the villa, retrieve the clothes she had hidden on the roof, changed her outfit, put on the wig, threw her ring into the toilet, and then quickly boarded a bus to New York to start her new life. Laura arrived in an unfamiliar small town. Seeing children laughing and playing in the square, she felt the air was filled with the fragrance of freedom. She rented a small house far from the mansion she once had, but she decorated it with care to make it cozy and beautiful. Whenever she saw the towels neatly arranged, she would deliberately mess them up. When the boxes in the cupboard were lined up neatly, she would knock them over with a sweep of her hand. This feeling of being unrestrained made her feel incredibly happy. Meanwhile, Mike was still immersed in grief until he received a call from a swim coach asking why Laura hadn't come to class recently. This struck Mike like a Thunderbolt. He had always thought his wife couldn't swim. If she could swim, how could she have drowned? He immediately went home to search and sure enough found that wedding ring in the toilet. The ring that should have sunk into the sea with his wife had appeared at home. At that moment, he was certain Laura was not dead. Even more shocking to him was that Laura had not only escaped, but had started a new romance with none other than his neighbor, John. The first time she met him, Laura was drawn to this Debbier College professor. He was knowledgeable and full of romantic sentiments, quickly winning Laura's heart. However, at this point, they were still completely unaware. Mike, now knowing the truth, had quietly rushed over. Although he didn't know Laura's exact hiding place, he had a handle on one of her weaknesses, Laura's mother. The blind old woman was currently living in a nursing home, and that's where Mike was keeping watch. He was convinced Laura would surely come to visit her mother. Sure enough, before long, the two met again on that narrow path. Only this time, Laura had cleverly disguised herself as a man. Mike stood behind her, completely oblivious. After she left, the nursing home administrator stopped Mike and told him the old woman had received a visitor today, a young woman.

At the critical moment, the bodyguard quickly tackled the president's wife to the ground, avoiding a disaster. However, Mike had already lost control at this point. He kept manipulating the joystick and bullets wildly sprayed the crowd, even piercing through the building behind. The police hidden on the rooftop saw this and shot out the car's tires, then fired another shot to ignite the gasoline, causing the car carrying the machine gun to explode instantly. Seeing this, Mike had to temporarily retreat. He changed into a different set of clothes and hurried to the subway station. At this time, the police chief happened to witness everything. To escape the pursuit as quickly as possible, Mike hurriedly jumped onto the tracks and ran outward along them. The police chief also quickly followed. When Mike thought he could escape, a subway train suddenly drove in from the tracks, forcing Mike to jump onto the adjacent platform. At this point, the police chief was in hot pursuit. Mike fired two shots, but failed to hit the target. The police chief immediately fought back, finally hitting Mike's leg. Just as the police chief was about to step forward and arrest him, he discovered that Mike had taken a hostage. Mike threatened the police chief to put down his weapon or else he would kill the hostage. Left with no choice, the police chief had to comply. Just as Mike was about to retaliate against the police chief, the female Police officer who had caught up fired in advance to subdue him and the crisis was finally resolved.

Mike took out his phone and check the wind forecast for the next morning. The following morning, he would take that fatal shot from this room. Assassinating the president's son was merely a means to lure out the real target. His true objective was the president himself. Because this was a crucial moment in John's presidential campaign in the final days before the results were announced, the president had originally planned to stay indoors the whole time. However, with his son being attacked, as a father, he had no choice but to personally visit the hospital. The president's series of actions had long been calculated by Mike. He tidied up the room, dismantled the glass window on the balcony and inserted a small pinwheel to observe the wind direction. Mike took out all the clothes from his suitcase and began assembling the sniper rifle. It turned out his suitcase had a secret. The bottom of the handle was the gun barrel. The wheels concealed bullets inside and the entire gun was disguised as the suitcase structure. With this setup, Mike could carry the sniper rifle and pass through various security checks without a trace. Before the target arrived, Mike had one more thing to do, calibrate the scope. He first observed the only building near the hospital and noticed the soldiers on it were all Vigilant of the distant road and the chaotic crowd, so Mike decided to take a risk and test fire. At this distance, the gunshot wouldn't reach the soldiers. Upon discovering an error, he immediately adjusted to ensure each subsequent shot would hit with precision. The test completed, he shifted his gaze back to the ground. At this point, the president had already exited the vehicle. Mike pulled the trigger without hesitation. After completing the assassination, Mike calmly disassembled the sniper rifle and quickly restored it according to the previous steps. In just 30 seconds, the sniper rifle had transformed back into the appearance of a suitcase. He then got fully dressed and put on his hat.

She donned a wig, stuck on a beard and transformed from a blonde beauty into a rugged looking man. The reason, her husband Mike, had an unbearable obsession with control. If he discovered the towels at home were arranged unevenly, he would immediately summon Laura to the room and force her to reflect on whether there were other areas of disarray. Laura realised the middle towel was slightly shorter and hastily apologized, rearranging them. But even so, she couldn't escape Mike's brutal beating. To avoid giving her husband any chance to criticize, Laura checked the home decor over and over every day until everything was in perfect order. Only then could she breathe a slight sigh of relief when she witnessed her husband taking the initiative to chat up their new neighbour. Laura didn't realise danger was quietly approaching. As the two planned a trip out to see together, the neighbour unintentionally complimented Laura, triggering Mike's intense suspicion back home. Mike's words were barbed. He praised the neighbor's good looks while probing to see if Laura had contact with him while Mike was away on business. Despite Laura's firm denial of knowing the neighbor, she was beaten once again. But in the next moment, Mike's attitude changed abruptly. He gently helped her up, remembering an important event tonight the neighbor had invited them out to see. Laura had no choice but to agree. While Mike was out, Laura smashed The streetlight in front of the door, not to vent her emotions, but to set up a signal for her upcoming plan. That night, the three of them set sail, intending to enjoy the night scenery. Unexpectedly, a storm suddenly struck and strong winds snapped the sail ropes. As Mike tried to control the boom, he was knocked into the sea. The neighbours struggled to rescue him, but when he climbed back on board, Laura was nowhere to be found. The two shouted loudly, but even after searching for three days, there was no trace of his wife. Although Mike sought help from the police, only Laura's life jacket was found. Knowing his wife couldn't swim, Mike had to accept the fact that she had drowned. A few days later, he held a funeral for Laura. However, Mike didn't know that Laura had actually made it to shore and was quietly watching him cry out in anguish. It turned out Laura had long planned her escape.

When he first pulled the trigger to test the weapons power, he was shocked to find that the bullet only left a small hole on the concrete surface, but a cloud of dust and smoke rose up behind it. Everyone quickly gathered around to take a look and they discovered that not only was the concrete completely penetrated, but there was even a huge hole behind it and a building in the distance was also affected. To further unleash the weapons potential, Mike replaced the battery with a brand new one and had his buddy set up a camera to record when he fired continuously forward. A steel bridge in the distance collapsed in an instant. Seeing the amazing power of the weapon, Mike quickly sent the recorded video to the military headquarters, intending to sell it at a high price. However, the top brass of the military doubted the authenticity of the video and asked Mike to demonstrate on the spot. Looking at the plastic rifle in front of him, the commander's face instantly showed a look of disdain. But Mike wasn't flustered at all. For safety reasons, he suggested that the military personnel hide in the bunker. With a command from his buddy, Mike decisively aimed at a tank a kilometer away and pulled the trigger. Surprisingly, the indestructible tank was instantly blown to pieces. The commander immediately expressed his shock and asked Mike how much he was willing to sell it. For Mike bluntly said, no deal for less than $100 million. Just then, the shooting range was suddenly attacked by an unknown force. Everyone quickly sought cover while Mike swiftly changed to a 1,000 round magazine and fought back against the attackers in the forest. In a flash, the entire forest was raised to the ground. After the crisis was resolved, the commander agreed to the price and arranged to come back the next day to complete the transaction.

He started by rubbing the spoon back and forth on the sole of his shoe, then asked the prison guard for a clean one. With the help of his teammates, he took a spoon right in front of the guard, but if you looked closely, he actually took two. Back in his cell, Mike first broke the spoon and then took apart the nail clippers. He removed the small file from the clippers and gradually ground a coin into powder. Once he had enough, he stuffed the powder into the joint between the spoon handle and the nail clipper components. He then lit a match and melted the metal parts together, creating a specialized tool for his escape. Next, Mike moved the box aside, laid a cloth on the floor, and started chiseling a hole in the wall facing the ventilation duct. With the right tool in hand, his efficiency was much higher. During the day, he would secretly carry the chiseled Limestone out of his cell to avoid leaving traces. After three months, Mike had chiseled a hole large enough for a person to pass through. However, the vent was embedded in the wall and couldn't be removed by hand, so Mike stole a metal wedge while working. Unfortunately, both ends of the wedge were metal, and the metal detector went off during the security check before the Guards could react. Mike calmly took out the wedge and said he wanted to take it back to hang clothes. The guards didn't agree and even searched him from head to toe. But surprisingly, when he returned to his cell, he pulled out another wedge from the sole of his shoe. It turned out that the earlier scene was just a distraction. Mike then inserted the wedge into the vent, and with a gentle kick, the vent loosened and fell off. However, he didn't act immediately. To avoid suspicion, he made a disguise out of newspaper. He soaked the newspaper in water, molded it into a square, let it air dry, and then painted it a colour similar to the wall, creating a realistic fake vent. Moreover, he made a fake model, coated it with dirt and stuck hair on it to disguise it as himself on the bed. When everything was ready,

He then took out a thermos from his backpack, unscrewed the lid, took out a bottle of gunpowder, poured the gunpowder into the thermos, sealed the mouth with tape and then put the thermos filled with gunpowder and the cash back into the backpack. He was going to teach those people a lesson. With that done, will walk to the Hillside, casually threw away the money bag and then quickly left. Sure enough, three days later, a car drove over the one who got out of The car was John. He found this place by the location of the tracker. Seeing the money bag, John thought that will had thrown it away out of desperation and told his companion to bring the bag over. But he didn't expect that this was a trap. At this time, will had already set up his weapon. When Mike opened the backpack, he found something strange inside. Will seized the opportunity and shot the bottle containing the gunpowder, taking out Mike on the spot. Then will Learned from the other party's method and damaged the car's gas tank so that John could not escape smoothly. However, John was very smart. He didn't directly confront will, but quickly escaped. Using the car as cover, he ran to the side of the road with the money bag and stopped a passing car. The driver thought he needed help and kindly got out of the car, but he didn't expect John to turn around and shoot him dead. Then he threw the backpack into the car and was about to leave. Before leaving, John curiously pulled open the zipper to make sure the 2 million was still there. Unexpectedly, what he touched turned out to be a rock. It turned out that will had already replaced the 2 million with rocks.

Three days later, Mike sat on the floor staring at Mary's image and coldly said, good luck to you. Those words utterly crushed her. Her boyfriend had given up on her so quickly. In anger, she struck the pipes with an iron rod trying to attract attention, but Mike didn't notice and simply turned to leave. When he reappeared, Mary was horrified to discover that he had brought back a strange woman. The next morning, that woman named Anna walked into the bathroom and actually picked up Mary's toothbrush to use. Mary was furious and angrily yelled at her from behind the mirror. Anna seemed to hear something and approached the sink to investigate. Mary desperately cried for help, but Anna ultimately showed no reaction and continued her morning routine. Once, while Anna was taking a shower, Mary accidentally discovered that the secret rooms valve could adjust the water temperature. She cracked a smile and cranked the water to scalding hot, successfully getting revenge on the other woman. Later, Anna happened to pick up the key Mary had dropped outside the door. Mary was overjoyed and shouted for help, but Anna simply wore the key as a necklace. A few days later, the police suddenly showed up to investigate because Mary had disappeared without a trace, neither leaving the country nor contacting relatives. The police suspected the boyfriend of foul play, but Their investigation turned up nothing. At this point, Anna remembered the strange occurrences in the house. Staring at the rippling waves in the lake, she suddenly realized something. Anna rushed into the bathroom and filled the sink with water to test her theory. Mary responded from behind the mirror by tapping on the pipes. After some communication, Anna finally confirmed that a woman was indeed trapped behind the mirror and the key to the secret room was hanging around her own neck. She was about to open the door, but suddenly stopped. She understood that rescuing Mary meant losing her position as the lady of the house. So Anna looked at the mirror and softly said, I'm sorry.

He took an exquisite gun off the person and opened a nearby case to find it stuffed full of cash, a full $2 million. For Mike, this was more money than he could ever hope to earn in a lifetime. Well aware that the cash could spell his doom, he resolutely took it home anyway. He told his wife, but she brushed it off as a dream. Late that night, his guilty conscience kept Mike awake. In the end, he decided to bring a bucket of water to check on the injured man. However, when he returned to the scene, he found the man had long since expired. As Mike turned to survey the area, he was startled to see two unfamiliar vehicles parked atop the hill that hadn't been there before. He quickly hid behind a car, worried about being spotted. The men drove straight for him. Clearly aware of his presence, Mike fled for his life, but was soon cornered. In desperation, he leapt into the river, only to be pursued by hunting dogs. Swimming with all his might to shore, he drew his gun and finally killed the dogs. Having narrowly escaped death, Mike sent his wife back to New York, promising to find her once the heat died down. Meanwhile, the gang hired a professional hitman. They removed the license plate from Mike's car and the boss pulled out a receiver from his pocket to give to the Assassin, as long as he had it, he could pinpoint the exact location of the money. Danger was slowly closing in on Mike.

He took out a remote control from his backpack and after entering a string of commands, the machine gun hidden in the red car started up. He carefully adjusted the shooting angle, precisely aiming the muzzle at the president's wife 3 kilometers away. Few days earlier, Mike had lifted a military coat to reveal a giant machine gun equipped with an astronomical telescope. He took out two anti tank armour piercing rounds from his tool kit and carefully loaded them into the magazine. Once these bullets hit, there was almost no chance of survival. Next, Mike opened a custom computer case and connected it to the new iPhone 16. After entering the phone's password, the weapon system immediately activated, clearly displaying the scene 10 kilometers away on the computer screen. Mike plugged in a control stick and with a slight push, the machine gun began to move. Using the joystick's direction, he could also adjust the telescope's focal length. During testing, he aimed the muzzle at a large pineapple in the distance. Just as he was about to fire, John nervously covered his ears beside him. With a loud bang, a large tree behind them fell, but the target pineapple remained unscathed. Mike realised that although the firepower was powerful, the accuracy was still lacking. To further test the automatic tracking function, he entered the program code again and the muzzle immediately turned towards John, who was standing Nearby, John got scared and quickly raised his hands to stop, but Mike showed a sinister smile. Left with no choice, John had to run around the field. No matter how he tried to dodge, the muzzle remained locked on him. Mike was satisfied with the system's performance. He told John to stand still and raise the box in his hand as a new target. Then he fine tuned the sight and pressed the switch without hesitation. With another loud bang, John was shot in the arm, clearly still not meeting the accuracy standards. Mike roared angrily and ordered John to stand in front of the car. After fine tuning the aim again, he suddenly pulled the trigger and bullets poured out frantically. The car was riddled with holes and soon both John and the car were destroyed.

The police at the entrance, after examining his forged documents and giving his outfit a quick glance, decided he didn't seem like a dangerous individual and let him pass. Once inside, Mike made his way straight to the sniping position he had previously chosen. He then set up his weapon and locked the crosshairs on the president. A few days prior, he had gone to the outskirts to conduct live fire tests. He aimed his gun at a pineapple 3 km away. After pulling the trigger, the bullet accurately hit the target, but the trajectory was slightly off to the left. He immediately used tools to fine tune the aiming system. After shooting again, this time the bullet struck dead center. Once he confirmed the adjustments were correct, Mike loaded live rounds and fired at a pineapple, easily blowing it apart. And next, at the military parade in France, Mike would use this gun to assassinate the president. To ensure the plan was foolproof, Mike first drove a BMW to a repair shop. He saw it off a spare exhaust pipe, wrapped the disassembled sniper rifle in plastic wrap, hid it inside the exhaust pipe and perfectly restored the structure. The next day, he brought a forged passport ready to enter France. But at border control, the police discovered his passport had expired. Subsequently, a senior official stepped forward demanding a thorough Inspection. It turned out that just the day before, the relevant department had received intelligence indicating an assassin was planning to kill the president. So border security was tightened. Yet Mike remained incredibly calm, allowing the police to check his vehicle and luggage because he had already hidden the weapon inside the exhaust pipe. In the end, the police found nothing and could only issue him a temporary pass. After entering France, Mike quickly found a discreet hotel to hide out temporarily. Meanwhile, French intelligence discovered that Mike had frequent contact with a French woman, suspecting she was the informant leaking intelligence to him. The next day, the bureau chief personally interrogated the woman.

She prays for people who died and hopes they get a second chance soon. She also has a strange job. She works for the police as an actor. She plays victims in murder cases so detectives can recreate the crime. She always feels guilty about it, like she's being disrespectful to the real victims. So after every reenactment, she sneaks back to the scene and lights incense for the soul of the person she played. Most spirits hungry for revenge feel grateful. Once the smoke rises, they can move on until one day a woman is found in a motel room. Her body is cut into eight pieces, wrapped in plastic and placed in a bathtub. After a round of questioning, the husband becomes the prime suspect. The girl thinks she'll be the one to play the victim again. Then the chief calls. The case has drawn too much attention, so a female officer will take the role instead. The girl feels crushed. She begs the woman's spirit to let her take the part. A soft breeze blows across her cheek as if the spirit answers her. That night, the officer assigned to the role meets a tragic fate and the girl gets the part. This time, she gives everything she has. She studies the woman's movements, her expressions, her rhythm. Still, something feels off. While she practices the dance, the woman's ghost appears right behind her. The movie is called The Spiritualists.

El instructor fingió no verlo en el momento crítico. Rompí el vidrio con mi puño. En un instante, todos fueron expulsados por la fuerza del agua. Antes de que pudiéramos recuperar el aliento. El instructor anunció que nadie había pasado el examen. Aunque yo acababa de salvarnos a todos. Ignoramos completamente el trabajo en equipo, lo que provocó que un cadete se ahogara solo. Entonces lo entendimos. El instructor dándonos bolsas para cadáveres. No era una exageración. Al día siguiente todos estaban muy motivados y llegamos otra vez a la fase cruel de eliminación. El siguiente desafío era un salto mortal en paracaídas. Al principio creímos que el instructor estaba poniendo a prueba nuestro valor. Todos estaban muy emocionados y se divertían mucho. Pero al segundo siguiente, el instructor nos dio una gran sorpresa. En la mochila de uno de nosotros no había paracaídas. Esto significaba que alguien moriría al estrellarse. En un instante, todos perdieron la sonrisa. A medida que nos acercábamos al suelo, el más asustado abrió el paracaídas. Solo. Lisa y yo no hicimos ningún movimiento precipitado. Al ver que todos habían logrado abrir sus paracaídas, nos dimos cuenta de que la persona elegida estaba entre nosotros dos, que ya habíamos superado la altura límite para abrir el paracaídas. Incluso el instructor dejó caer su vaso del susto. A uno de nosotros le faltaba el paracaídas, así que sin dudarlo, abracé fuertemente a lisa. Entre los dos logramos abrir El único paracaídas, pero ya era demasiado tarde. Al final nos estrellamos brutalmente contra el suelo. Por suerte, conservamos la vida, aunque los demás aterrizaron a salvo, su egoísmo acabó provocando que fueran eliminados. Al ver mi calma e inteligencia, superé la prueba y me convertí en candidato a agente. Sin embargo, hasta ahora, el verdadero desafío apenas comenzaba. Roy, el hombre más rico del mundo, planea usar un chip de alta tecnología para controlar el sistema nervioso de todos los implantados. Para detener todo esto, recibí la misión de infiltrarme en la base secreta de roy. Al mismo tiempo, lisa fue al centro de control satelital para intentar destruir la fuente de la señal

Lisa quickly apologized and stepped out in a rush. Even after leaving, her heart was still racing. The man's handsome face and confident posture had completely caught her off guard. But when she turned and saw the cleaning tools in her hands, she forced herself to calm down. Anyone staying in a hotel like this had to be wealthy or influential. And she was just a single mom earning a modest wage. Someone who didn't even dare to dream about love, let alone mingling with powerful people. What Lisa never expected was that this powerful man would seek her out the very next day. Because she had no one to watch her son during his weekend break, Lisa had to bring him to the hotel and leave him with a coworker. As John rode the elevator alone to the restroom, he came across a familiar face. I know who you are. Yeah? What do you know? I know that you're the state senator. I know that you're thinking of running for senator. I know your voting record and your consistent stand on environmental causes. The man was the same guest Lisa had run into while cleaning the day before. Jack wasn't just a strong candidate for the Senate. He was wealthy, always surrounded by bodyguards, and luxury cars were practically standard for him. Yet a man that important found himself impressed by a ten year old Boy standing in front of him. There was a maturity in John that no child his age should have. He even had sharp insights about the current political climate that genuinely surprised Jack. Intrigued, Jack invited him to take a walk at the park. But John turned him down. He had promised his mom he wouldn't leave her side. Meanwhile, inside the suite, Lisa and her coworker were admiring a guest's coat. The price tag alone made them sigh. One year of their salary wouldn't even cover it. Her coworker picked up a dress and insisted Lisa try it on. Lisa wanted to refuse, but eventually gave in after enough persuasion. And just as she was changing, John showed up with Jack. Jack didn't realize that the woman in the dress was the same housekeeper he'd seen the previous day. He approached her with a warm smile and introduced himself politely. Seeing an opportunity, the coworker jumped in to help. You want your coat? What? Why? That could be so tricky. Here. Why aren't you just saying what a beautiful day it was? Are you going out? Weren't you saying how you wanted to stretch your legs? Well, if your husband wouldn't mind. Lisa suddenly found herself mistaken for a guest rather than staff. She wanted to take off the coat and clarify everything, but Jack's invitation cut her off. His charming smile made her heart flutter in spite of herself. Before she knew it, she agreed. But as they Reached the elevator, Lisa spotted the hotel manager. Panicking, she turned around and pretended to adjust her son's clothes. She kept her back to the manager as she slipped into the elevator, carefully avoiding eye contact. Her heart didn't settle until they finally made it out of the hotel. What she didn't expect was the crowd of reporters waiting outside to interview Jack. While she was questioning her son about what had happened, Jack finished speaking with the reporters and hurried toward them. Watching the small boy walk away, Jack couldn't help but feel curious. How could someone so young know so much about politics? It turned out John had always been shy as a child. He had trouble making friends at school and froze whenever he stood at a podium. But while one door closed for him, another opened. He had an incredible memory for anything he saw on TV. He absorbed news instant and developed strong judgment about the world around him. The two of them eventually reached a bench. To avoid getting the expensive coat dirty, Lisa pulled John back just in time. Oh, Lord! I almost sat on your face right there! Tiny moment broke the ice between them, and the atmosphere instantly felt much more relaxed.

Jack's secret peeping was discovered by Annie. He stayed in his room for a long time, finally gathering the courage to peek out carefully. But by then, Annie had already left her room, storming straight toward Jack's house. Moments later, he heard his father's angry voice downstairs. Jack froze, staring at the three of them, unsure if his secret had already been exposed. Annie looked at him quietly, the air so tense it felt hard to breathe. This is Danielle. You know Mrs. Clark from next door. Danielle's her niece. But she didn't expose him. Instead, she calmly said she wanted him to go out for a walk with her. Danielle just came in from Los Angeles, and she's house sitting while her aunt's away. Why don't you show her around? Halfway down the road, Annie suddenly told him to take off his clothes, saying it was payback for spying on her earlier. Jack hesitated for a moment, but still did as she said. The whole package? No. Come on. This is good enough. Jesus. There. Happy now? Then Annie started the car, hit the gas, and drove away, leaving him behind. Helpless, Jack grabbed a car tire to cover himself. A few minutes later, Annie came back, smiling as she told him to get in. That crazy moment

I only found out about you after she died. Elaine died. She died from breast cancer about a month ago. This is her will. It tells about you in there. I was scared to come here. I didn't know how you'd react. It's okay. You don't have to be scared. Thank you. Non-human. Well, there's not a lot in the way of assets here. 78 Plymouth Lane. Never married? No. So where are you living now? Um, well, we were renting and she didn't have any savings, so I'm sort of like living out of my car. I cannot imagine what you're going through right now.

They never expected to run into each other at the hospital. You look good. Bet. I'm an old lady. Henry, you look pretty damn good for an old lady. Doctor Young wanted them to separate to avoid blocking the hallway. But Henry hadn't seen Betty for half a century and wanted to chat with her a bit longer. Doctor Young told them to talk later instead. She'll be in room 31, 28. Betty Flynn. Oh, my god. In the operating room, Henry told the doctors their story. She was my wife's roommates, her best friend, my wife's maid of honor. She disappeared. But how do you say I couldn't stand up in your wedding because I fell in love with your fiance? At a party, Henry got tired of the festivities and went outside for some fresh air. He happened to see Betty standing outside. They spent a bitter sweet night together. It was both their first time. For the first time in my life, I felt complete being with Henry. I felt complete. Henry wanted to call off his engagement to Eileen, but he was afraid this would ruin the friendship between all three of them. But of course, the friendship was ruined anyway, so Betty took the initiative to move to the countryside. And become an elementary school teacher. And Henry married Amy. I loved Irie. She wasn't Betty. Her husband was a good man, kind, funny, smart, but he was no Henry. There was never another Henry. The doctors were deeply moved after hearing their story. Then the doctor arranged for them to share the same hospital room. Come live with me. We barely know each other. We know each other. Henry felt they had already missed their chance once, so this time he didn't want to miss it again. But Betty hesitated and then refused. I got over you, Henry. I married Mike. I had four kids now, grandkids that give me such joy. I'm sorry. Henry watched Betty leave with disappointment. The next day, Henry's condition suddenly worsened and his heart stopped. After emergency treatment from the doctors, he returned to normal. Betty was terrified this time. This time, she agreed to Henry's request to live together. You make me feel like the prettiest girl at the party when you look at me. I become a young girl again. I did the right thing once. Now I'd like to do the wrong thing and see how that goes. How long do you need me to wait before I propose?

Well, where'd you find her? A lady left her in my taxi. They said bring babies to the firehouse. Kids burning up with the fever. Luke, move the can. We'll take care of her. Engine 99 to dispatch. Medical emergency in front of borders, please. Baby has severe oral candidiasis and a temp of 105. I'd say based on her size, she's about five months. You lost me. Candidiasis. It's a fungal infection commonly known as thrush. It's not an STD. Dr. Messy. Yeah, well, she wasn't sexually abused. So why'd you call us? ACS handles abandoned kids. What's happened to her is a crime. Kids only get this sick when they don't get treated. Treated for what? HIV. She has AIDS. Advanced. And her parents didn't do a damn thing about it. If that's not a crime, what is? Where did you drop her off? Police authority. She left the bag on the back seat. I noticed it a block away when the baby started to cry. When I tried to calm her, I felt the fever. Cabcam takes 10 images one per second after door opens or closes. Here's the last photo. 9:00am. Meringue at the firehouse. Uh, Baby's mother should be right before us. Not unless she's a sixty five year old man. He's the next face back in the camera's memory. Mr. Meringue, come here. Mr. Meringue, baby's mother wasn't on that camera. How could that be? Cause There is no mother. I want you to tell me what really happened. I turned off the camera before the lady got in my car. And you didn't run the meter because you wanted to put a few extra bucks in your pocket? Gas costs so much, it's the only way to make ends meet. I turned off the camera in case the taxi commission checks it. Elle, stay right here. That was Munch. He ran mrong. No record. And no baby girls went missing in the last month in the tri state area. It's great he turned off the cap cam. No pictures of the baby's mother. Mr. Mrong, we're sending you over to our office so you can describe the baby's mother to a sketch artist. I'll do my best. Warner needs us at the morgue. Did the baby die? No, but she's septic. Dr. Massey is loading her up with big gun antibiotics. So why are you involved with the kid who's still breathing? Massey and I work together on an aid surveillance team. She sent me an oral swab from your baby dose so I could run her DNA. Why? She's not gonna be in the system. I thought her mother might be. And their mitochondrial DNA will match. A lot of kids with HIV are born to women with criminal records. Junkies and hookers. So you got a hit. Mom is Joanne Suarez, a frequent guest of the department of Corrections. Joanne, have a last Known address? Charming little place. Our green cards have expired. We were afraid we would be sent back to Gambia. We didn't know what to do. Antonio just got sicker and sicker. So you lied about finding her in the cab to get rid of her? No, I didn't want her to die. We loved her like she was our own. Everything was fine until she stopped eating. We thought she missed her mother. Then I saw the white spots in her mouth, and I knew it was AIDS. How many people have died in my country? I raised my sister, and she had the same sickness. So you knew how sick Antonia was. Why didn't you bring her to the hospital? Because the AIDS medicines are poison. Who told you that? Our president. But he has found the cure. He rubs a green paste of herbs on his patient's chest. Hold on. The president of Gambia does this himself every Thursday. And then he gives him the bitter yellow brew and two bananas, and they are cured. Did you try to cure Antonia? No. The president's recipe is secret. So we went on the internet and found a doctor who believes as we do. He gave Antonia vitamins, but she just got worse. Okay, this doctor, what's his name

She calmly brushed the crumbs off her clothes. Far too calm. Then I saw it. Her real face. Don't yammer at me. Something had taken over my daughter. And the fact that it wore her skin terrified him. He ran and slammed the bedroom door shut, locking every bolt he had installed. Still not enough. He shoved the shoe cabinet against the door, then dragged the bed over, desperate to keep that thing out. That's when she approached the door. Can I come in? We can talk this out. He kept backing away until his foot hit something. A screwdriver. He grabbed it tightly, finally having something to defend himself with. Destroy everything. The door began to warp. As if pushed by an unseen force. He pressed himself into the far corner. The world. He clutched the screwdriver like it was his last lifeline. The screws started shooting out one by one. He squeezed his eyes shut, metal pieces scattering across the floor in his. The door was seconds from breaking. I'll do it myself! He lunged behind it, pushing back with everything he had. And felt.

The thieves remained wary, putting the box at her feet again, really causing her to stumble this time. Suddenly, one of them made a sharp, piercing noise near her ear, testing if she would flinch. Though her eyes were wide open, waves of panic surged uncontrollably in her mind. Later, she pretended to take a shower with all three intruders trailing closely behind. Determined not to give them any advantage, he returned to the living room and switched on the TV. Forgetting she was still pretending to be blind, she called to her cat, claiming she had turned on the television for it, cleverly masking the slip. Eventually, the thieves were convinced she truly could not see and began rifling through every corner of the house for valuables. However, when one hurled a garment crawling with cockroaches at her, Alison screamed in terror, instantly revealing her ruse. Clearly, for her, the swarming insects were far more terrifying than the intruders themselves.

Every signal screamed at her that the man standing there was far from ordinary. Deliberately, she splashed the water onto the ground, and the man's expression twisted into panic and frenzy. Realising his disguise had been blown, he shivered and recoiled from the doorway. Ellie finally exhaled in relief. But the zombie was far from done.

The next second, the mummy's sharp teeth clamped onto his finger. Blood dripped rapidly as panic surged through him and he dashed toward the first aid kit. He had no idea that his blood had already fallen onto the mummy. And the moment it touched her, a long, silent force stirred awake. After struggling to wrap his wound, he prepared to separate the mummy from the stone slab. But when he tried, he realized the mummy was stuck tight, as if bonded to it. With no other option, he grabbed a metal rod and carefully pried her loose. After several tense minutes, he finally succeeded. Then, even more cautiously, he lifted the mummy and placed her onto a small bed nearby. He returned to clean the dust and debris from the slab. But just as he focused, the mummy's jaw twitched. Suddenly, the sight froze him in place. Fighting the rising fear, he grabbed a sheet and covered her completely, as though hiding her would erase what he'd seen. He went back to work. Yet something stranger followed. The mummy moved again, this time painfully slow, and he still failed to notice. Moments later, his boss arrived to check on the progress. By then, Louis had already discovered a hidden compartment inside the stone slab. He removed the cover and found a tiny keyhole. The boss wanted to open it immediately, but Louis stopped him, warning It could be trapped. Using pliers, Louis inserted a thin metal strip, pressed lightly, and with a crisp click, the secret chamber unlocked. Inside lay a golden skeletal staff. Everyone stood stunned. This was the treasure they had been searching for.

Everyone froze in absolute disbelief, not able to accept what they were hearing. To uncover the truth, the police seized the aircraft and interrogated every single passenger. But their answers were nearly identical. Nothing unusual happened during the journey except for a violent burst of turbulence midair when the cabin light suddenly blacked out and flicked back on seconds later. With no progress in the investigation, the passengers were sent home. But a few days later, a woman named Ava suddenly heard a strange whisper echoing in her mind. People around her noticed nothing. Slow down, slower. Stop right now. Didn't you see him late, lady? He's right in front of you. Ava had no idea what was happening. That night, the voice returned again, and she wasn't the only one. Every passenger from that vanished flight heard the same eerie calling. And so they all returned to the Airport gathering at the exact same moment.

We've had a few issues with the coupon group recently but I've sorted it out so no worries. Oh and this next deal was pretty good.

Then he pulled out a tranquilizer gun, shot him, and watched him collapse. The father dragged him to a remote cave, chained him up, and left him there for seven long days and night. No food, only a single bowl of water. Every day he poured freezing water over him. Yet it did nothing to quell the man's rage. So he drugged him again with a handkerchief, hauled him into a secret surgery room, and called in a team of plastic surgeon. When the man woke hours later, he realized something was missing. Looking down, he saw his manhood was gone. He had been transformed into a woman. But the father was not finished. He brought out a set of dilator, forcing him to use them daily, claiming it would heal his wounds. Over the next few days, the man endured more surgery. His body slowly took on a female form.

The hand seemed to be asking for help, so Jerry, feeling compassionate, decided to take a piece of wood home. As a man who had been single for 30 years, Jerry clearly saw something humanoid in the wood, despite it being completely covered in fungus. He grabbed a spatula and carefully scraped off every bit of the fungus. However, the wood was stubbornly covered in a type of fungus called wood ear. Jerry tried using a stick to pull them off. Next, he went to get some herbicide and sprayed it across every corner of the log. After cleaning more debris, the log started to resemble a woman, especially the tangled weeds that looked like hair. But the snails crawling everywhere horrified Jerry. He realized he had to find a solution fast. He quickly grabbed a bucket of water, cleaned off the debris and picked off each snail by hand. As he continued, the woman's fiery red hair started to emerge. Yet Jerry still felt something was missing. So he went to find a comb, carefully brushed her red hair and applied shampoo and conditioner. Soon her hair became shiny and healthy. Jerry placed a necklace around her neck and draped a winter sweater over her shoulders. By the time he finished, night had fallen. Jerry placed the wooden figure beside his pillow and prepared to sleep. The next morning, Jerry woke up to find a red haired woman lying beside him. He was utterly terrified.

He slipped it over the ventilation duct, leaving only a nozzle sized opening for precise control. Next, he inserted a pre prepared flexible tube, sealing the connection between nozzle and tubing with adhesive tape. Just like that, a trap meant for the boss was set the other end of the tube brand directly into the executive's private washroom. To lure the boss inside required an accomplice. A woman pretended to fetch water under camera coverage, then slipped a folded note into the door frame. Once in a blind spot, the rest was left to the cleaning lady. Knowing the boss regularly drank coffee, the staff had purchased an identical coffee machine. The cleaner crammed a paper wad into the dispensing nozzle. When coffee flowed, the blockage would force liquid to spray outward onto whoever stood before it. Once stained, the instinct would be to rush to the restroom and clean up. Yet even the most meticulous plans can falter. That day, while refilling coffee grounds in the boss's office, the cleaner's nerves got the better of her. Anxious, she fumbled the paper ball dropped to the floor. Fortunately, the boss was absorbed in his phone. As she bent to retrieve it, he glanced up. Had she faltered, all could have been lost. But experience brought calm. Pretending to pick up a pen cap, she deftly ailed His suspicion, the cleaner successfully lodged the paper ball into the machine. Soon after, the boss went to pour his coffee. Just as planned, the brew splashed across his expensive suit. He hurried toward his private washroom to clean the mess, too rushed to notice the paper wedged in the door. Once the washroom door clicked shut, an employee inserted a specially shaped wire into the keyhole. Team had previously filmed the boss taking medication and identified it as an anti allergy drug for asthma. Another way to induce an asthma attack, flood the space with carbon dioxide. The real operation now launched. The woman shattered a cup as the first signal. The cleaner switched on a vacuum cleaner, a prearranged cue. Hearing the noise, the man outside slipped into a camera dead zone and opened the fire extinguisher unit he had preconnected. A torrent of CO2 instantly surged through the vents into the washroom. The boss felt his chest tighten. When he tried to exit, the door wouldn't move. Meanwhile, the vacuum's high pitched whine in the office gave everyone a perfect alibi for not hearing his cries. The security guard in on the scheme locked the main entrance to keep clients from interrupting. The outside man quietly returned to his post as if nothing occurred. Minutes later, the boss collapsed on the washroom floor, overcome by the asthma attack. Seeing the moment had come, the man avoided cameras again to shut off the extinguisher, then removed the balloon Assembly. The guard swiftly eliminated all remaining evidence simultaneously. A female colleague pretended to fill her water bottle, edged along the wall to the washroom door, retrieved the custom wire disguised as a hairpin and tucked it into her hair. With bottle in hand, she strolled back to her desk acting as though everything was normal. Finally, an employee pretended to notice the boss had been absent too long. Together, they forced the door open only to find him dead. They immediately called the police. A self orchestrated crime had reached its flawless end. Police pulled surveillance footage at once but found nothing out of place. Then they began lifting fingerprints.

And just like that, the two of them fell hard and fast, eventually walking straight into marriage as if they were living a real life beauty and the Beast romance. After the wedding, the couple started running a little flower shop together, but his frightening appearance scared off customers. So every time someone stepped inside, he would quietly turn his back and let his wife take care of everything. Even then, his fearsome looks sometimes made passing undercover officers think he was a dangerous fugitive.

To prove it had matured, it struggled to grow a small cluster of flowers and picked one to give her. The woman wasn't impressed at all. She gave it a fail and told it to jump into the manure pile to keep growing. Next, she turned her attention to cabbage number two. She picked up the watering can and gave it a drink. To her surprise, this cabbage knew how to act cute. The woman was pleased and immediately pulled it out of the ground. No. 2 happily smoothed its leafy hair, charming her in the process. She decided right then to take it home to live with her. Then, with a look of disgust, she uncovered cabbage No. 3. After finishing this, the woman happily took No. 2 home. No. 1, filled with deep resentment, turned its love into hate. It angrily threw off number three's cover, yanked the deformed cabbage out by its roots, and after some persuasion from number one, the two of them grabbed farm tools and charged into the house. No. 2, showing no loyalty, pushed the woman outside and jumped out the window.

This was to be her wedding day, yet a guard discreetly slipped a dagger into her waistband. Confusion gripped her, though the reason would soon become terrifyingly clear. As the ceremony concluded, the prince swept her into his embrace. Just as Anna lost herself in delirious joy, he violently hurled her over the cliff's edge. Miraculously, dense layers of branches and foliage below cushioned her fall, sparing her life. Enveloped in darkness and dread, she screamed in furious desperation, a cry that accidentally roused a slumbering dragon deep within the valley. As roaring fire surged toward her, Anna fled for her life, barely diving into a cave before debris and snared her ankle. With another wave of flames fast approaching, she struggled free, sustaining only superficial burns. Fighting to survive, she used the blade to cut strips from her gown, bandaging her wounds. Then, clutching a torch, she ventured courageously into the valley's shadowy depths. Fortune appeared to favor her. Anna soon discovered dripping icicles. She drank thirstily, then wearily closed her eyes, oblivious to the peril creeping nearer. Upon reopening them, the icicles had transformed into raging fire. She scrambled back into the cavern, narrowly evading the dragon's assault. By chance, she spotted an opening leading outward, but the walls were lined with razor sharp crystals, like a lethal trap set to snap. Driven by sheer will to live, Anna tore her dress. Braided the fabric into a rope and began a determined climb. Just as escape seemed within reach, the dragon's roar echoed from below. Startled, she lost footing, almost plunging downward. Desperately, she hooked her crown onto a crystal hanging precariously midair. Yet the fragile mineral shattered under her weight, sending her plummeting as the beast's jaws gaped wide below. Refusing to yield, Anna summoned her final strength, hooking the crown onto the rocky surface once more. In this frantic moment, she discovered a surge of power within, climbing wildly until she reached the cave's mouth. But hope shattered instantly. Beyond lay only a vertical drop. Spotting villagers far below, she waved and shouted helplessly, her cries unheard, instead drawing the dragon's attention. Warning symbols etched on the walls and scattered bones seemed to whisper that this place permitted no escape. Just as Anna shut her eyes, awaiting death, a familiar voice suddenly pierced the darkness.

I couldn't help but cry as I rushed to the poolside to clean it. Just as I was panicking, the manager suddenly approached. I thought he would stand up for me, but the wealthy customer called him over, handed him $1, and the manager's eyes lit up. The customer whispered something to him and they both exchanged a strange laugh. Then the manager walked up to me, ripped off my name tag and fired me on the spot. That customer had literally paid to get me fired. I felt so wronged, but there was nothing I could do. As I imagined my bleak future, that jerk came back inside. I quickly hid behind a service cart, staring at his disgusting face, and an idea popped into my head. I decided it was time for revenge. I sneaked into a pile of dirty laundry and an annoying staff member pushed me straight to his room. While the housekeeper was changing the sheets, I hid behind the sofa. After they left, I quietly slipped into the customer's suite. To my surprise, the man who had been so arrogantly rude earlier was now quietly giving his wife a massage, acting completely submissive, like a totally different person. I had thought he was some big shot, but in reality, he was.

She stood up, gathered her things and walked out of the classroom. The next day, she didn't come back, nor did she return the day after that. By the third day, the bullies began to whisper, where's the bald girl? Nobody knew. So they went to her house. That's when they saw it, the medics lifting a covered body into an ambulance, her mother sobbing as she clutched her little brother. One boy stepped forward. We came to see Mary. She hasn't been at school. Her mother, her eyes swollen from crying, looked at them and said she couldn't take it anymore. All the bullying and you never knew she was battling cancer. All she wanted was to feel normal, to have one friend. But none of you cared. The kids stood frozen, broken by the truth, their tears falling freely.

As part of the act, the magician forcefully drove three swords straight through it. When the coffin was opened, there was nothing inside. Momens Latte! Lisa's voice echoed from somewhere else. She hadn't vanished. She'd slipped into a kind of spatial misplacement. The magician searched quickly and discovered her inside a crate on the other side. Immediately suspicious, he assumed she'd been planted there by a rival performer. Lisa denied it outright. No one sent her. She simply knocked on a door and it opened on its own. Trying to make sense of it, Lisa asked how she'd ended up trapped in the box. That's when the truth came out. This wasn't a normal house, was a hidden sanctuary of magic. The man finally introduced himself. His name was Raymondo, once a global icon in the world of illusion. Lisa was captivated and eager to hear more about him. Raymondo insisted she call home first to let her parents know she was safe. Then he began the demonstration. He started with Wally, a self operating robot that could play play the piano. Next came an unsettling mirror said to reveal how a person would eventually die. Then the grand finale, the legendary milk can escape. A photograph nearby showed his late wife. She had been the only other person trusted with the trick secret. Now Raymond lived alone, with memories of the past and description to keep him steady. Lisa asked if he Would teach her magic. At first, he refused. In his mind, magic was something passed down to boys. Lisa suggested a compromise. Just one simple trick. Raymondo handed her the ring of destiny and told her to return in a week. Before he finished explaining, Lisa had already solved it. Impressed, Raymondo finally agreed. After all, one of his old friends had even trained a monkey in magic. Not exactly a compliment, but he warned Lisa not to underestimate it. That same monkey now owned 18 car company. When Raymond moved on to coin tricks, he quickly realized Lisa had perfected them already. Coins appeared from thin air, from behind ears, even turning into a mock phone call ordering a boat. When Grandpa Abe heard the story, he was stunned by the name alone. Back in his day, Raymond was capable of anything.

No matter how much liquid she poured, the diapers handled it with ease. The family laughed and challenged her to keep going. But what truly caught Marge's attention, attention wasn't the product at all. It was the brand spokesperson. The rugged, outdoors a model matched every detail of Marge's fantasy partner. That same day, she nervously wrote him a letter, unsure whether her feelings were aimed at a logo or a real human being. Homer stumbled upon the letter by accident and immediately smelled chaos. Well, he thought, let's see where this goes. Soon after, the phone rang, an operator announced a person to person call for Marge Simpson. On the line was the voice behind the burly paper brand's image. He explained that her letter had genuinely touched him and that he'd love to meet her along with her family over dinner. Marge nearly dropped the phone. 7:00 was confirmed. As soon as she hung up, she could barely contain herself. Dinner with burly felt unreal. She launched into full preparation mode, scrubbing every corner of the house. Homer casually asked if anything exciting had happened that day. Marge blurted it out. The paper towel lumberjack was coming over for dinner tonight. To welcome him properly, she removed every piece of diaper packaging and even hung up a painting she had made. Just then, the doorbell rang. Bart kicked a pack of diapers toward the door, watching it roll all the way forward. When he looked up, his jaw dropped. Standing outside was the man from the commercials himself. And that's when things officially got out of hand.

Because behind one harmless photo is a man who's been getting away with murder. Every morning, I cook a fresh bowl of noodles, and every morning, I don't eat a single bite. All I do is snap a picture and post it online. That daily photo is my perfect cover. Because the truth is, I'm a killer. Eight young women gone, and thanks to those harmless breakfast check ins, the police still have no idea I exist. I keep each victim's phone and update her social media like she's still alive, tagging locations from different countries so it looks like she's traveling instead of missing. My method is simple, but no one ever sees it coming. I always start by getting the girl's phone. Once I have it, I take it home and intentionally enter the wrong passcode until the screen locks. Then I smash the screen on purpose. Later, when she calls her own number, I answer with a voice changer, pretending to be a kind woman who found the phone. That's how I lure her straight to a repair shop. I control my trap disguised as a business. The moment she steps through the door, she's already mine. I hand her a fake repair form and ask for her password, claiming I need it to replace the broken screen. She writes it down without hesitation. That's when her nightmare Truly begins. I open the phone, took a tiny camera into the motherboard, replace the screen, then quietly unlock the device with her passcode. I install the tracking virus, sync all her data to my phone, and hand it back like nothing happened. She even thanks me on her way out. She has no idea her entire life is now streaming straight to me. After days of watching her routines, I know everything. Her name is Alice. She helps out at her dad's cafe. She drinks grapefruit juice like it's her lifeline.

He instructed the kid to tap it every 15 seconds. He struck a wager with a group of attentive students. If they could stay silent throughout the entire period, he'd chug an entire carton of milk in one gulp. The students were dying to see him throw up. So for the first time, they actually collaborated. Whenever someone felt tempted to misbehave, the others shut it down right away. As time ticked away, the milk on the desk vanished while the chalkboard filled with notes. Students didn't even realize what was unfolding. They'd unwittingly paid attention through the whole class. Some even raised their hands to answer questions. Thanks to this one teacher, the worst class in school transformed into the top honors class. But just as Mister Clark thought he kept teaching, he got fired. And the reason? He refused the principal's tuition high plan. The parents begged him to stay, but the principal insisted on letting him go. Left with no other option, Clark headed to New York to hunt for a job. But reality hit him hard. Big city schools wanted nothing to do with a small town teacher. To stay close to the career he loved, he worked part time while searching for openings. On his way to an interview one day, he witnessed a teacher in a heated argument with a student, rushed over to diffuse the situation. The conflict only ended when the principal Arrived, the frustrated teacher stormed out and quit. You can have these little brat. After reviewing Clark's impressive track record, the principal offered him the honors class on the spot. But Clark's eyes drifted to the classroom across the hallway. That room was completely unsupervised. The kids inside were running amok. Every action screamed years of bad behavior. The principal never anticipated Clark would choose that class. He revealed six teachers had already quit because of those kids. But Clark refused to budge. He believed every struggling student was just a child who'd been left behind. But his confidence didn't bring luck right away. On the first day, the students gave him a brutal welcome. Shamika cut that out. Shamika was the biggest troublemaker in the class. With her stirring things up, the room erupted into chaos. The classroom was a total mess. Even the janitor doubted if Clark could handle them. After cleaning everything up, Clark stepped outside to find his car covered in graffiti. But with years of teaching experience under his belt, he knew every troubled kid had a hidden story. So he started visiting their homes one by one, as he suspected the kids came from families with serious issues. One, one student was only 12 but had to care for three younger siblings. Another grew up in a home where girls were totally neglect. I love reading, especially when it's quiet. Clark realized they didn't hate learning. They've been shaped by their tough home lives. After all, parents are a child's first teachers. To help his students change, Clark prepared a surprise. He repainted the classroom walls with bright colors. He wanted to show them the right way to use paint, not the way they'd used it on his car. But the kids didn't appreciate the gesture. The principal thought he was being ridiculous and scolded him in front of the whole class. My school, my rules, my way. Clark had little authority to begin with. Being humiliated made it even worse. Shamika showed him no respect either. She was having a blast with her friend, but the second she saw Clark, she walked away. Their rejection hit him hard. At lunch, his students charged into the cafeteria like wild horses, nothing like the orderly honors class next door. These bad habits ran deep. Female teacher told Clark he could quit if it got too tough. But Clark wasn't one to give up easily. He set new rules for the class. First, we're a family. Second, we respect each other. Third, we line up before and after class. But the kids were used to doing whatever they wanted. They ignored him completely. As soon as the bell rang, they rushed for the door, only to find it locked. Clark had shut it before class ended. Left with no choice, they formed a line, annoyed and impatient. When Clark looked away, Shamika sneaked to the front. The second he noticed, he stopped the entire line.

By some miracle, he grabbed the railing and hung on for dear life. One slip and he would have died. A man nearby sprinted to save him, but it was too late. Leo's hand gave way and he began to fall. Luckily, he landed on a thick blanket spread across the neighbor's roof, saving him from certain injury. But the danger wasn't over. The blanket started sliding, and Leo quickly caught an antenna below to stop his descent. He tried to wrap his legs around it, but his arms were weakening fast. Looking up, he saw his own window and screamed for help. Inside, his mother, Clara, lay unconscious, but his cries jolted her awake. Shocked, she ran to the window. She reached out, trying to grab him, but her hand fell short. Meanwhile, the screw holding the antenna was loosening. Without hesitation, Clara leaned out dangerously and caught her son's hand. The antenna snapped free and Leo slipped once more. This time he caught on a closed rod, stopping his fall. Again his life was saved, but he still dangled in the air, swaying precariously.

Even stranger, he instinctively pressed the fourth floor button again, quickly claiming it was a mistake. Pressed the fourth floor on purpose, watching quietly as the elevator doors opened. The red line above his head stretched all the way to the end of the hallway, pointing to apartment 401. I was about to go over, but stopped. The next day, when my sister and I returned home, we found a package at the door. The delivery label showed 401, matching the red line from last night. I took it upstairs and left it in front of 401. Just as I was about to ring the doorbell, a woman stepped out of the elevator, grabbed the package, and went inside. That night, my brother in law still hadn't returned, and my sister

They placed a box near her feet next, and Alyssa quickly spun around, pretending to secure the lid on her kettle, while tension filled the dimly lit room. But the thieves still weren't convinced. They set the box by her feet again, and this time she had no choice but to drop to the floor, acting as if she never saw it coming. Still doubtful, one robber suddenly made a loud, jarring noise beside her ear. Watching for any reaction, her eyes didn't flinch, but inside panic surged like a drumbeat. Later, she pretended to take a shower, yet the three men shadowed her quietly, forcing her to retreat to the living room. There she turned on the TV, forgetting a blind person wouldn't do that. To cover her mistake, she immediately called out to her cat, pretending the TV was for the animal, trying to steady her breath in the faint glow of the screen. At last, the intruders believed she was genuinely blind and began ransacking her house for valuables. But when one of them threw a piece of clothing crawling with cockroaches at her, Alyssa shrieked in terror, shattering her entire disguise in an instant. As it turned out, cockroaches were far more terrifying to her than the robbers themselves.

Bolu dropped onto the ground dramatically, putting on a ridiculous performance just to pull everyone's attention. But because of his little stunt, Team Blue accidentally took first place. Seeing that result, Bula got even more annoyed. Team Blue's speedster Raju was ready for his pole vault run when Bula grabbed an iron shovel and chopped the pole clean in half. Meanwhile, Team Blue's last member, Sanjana, couldn't believe how they ended up with so few points. When Team Red walked onto the field, a sharp girl named Guria grabbed the pole and bolted forward.

Then Team Red stepped up and Bolu quietly lifted them with a helping hand, letting them pass the bar. Judge Shastri noticed everything and only smiled knowingly. From that moment on, every round, Bolu openly helped Team Red, and they won every match. And came the final event, the relay race. Team Blue was flying ahead, Team Red trailing behind.

He rode through the night to the warehouse, the address clearly printed on the key. When he unlocked the door, he froze. The room was filled with neatly stacked gift boxes and in the center stood put a gleaming sports car. Sitting in front of it was a photo of him and his mother smiling together. Seeing all of this, he thought he had simply stumbled onto a birthday surprise a little too early. But when he looked closer, the card on the car read happy 30th birthday. Every present had a tag.

Even as her life quietly approached its end, she kept smiling, stayed optimistic and kept thinking only of the people she loved.

The Pharaoh then unveiled his true appearance. Yet beneath that solemn, divine shell lay the face of a youth. He was an ancient deity who ignited the dawn of human civilization. A being who had existed for more than ten millennia. But no one knew that the Pharaoh's real identity was a marauder from a far off star system. To escape the grip of death, he transferred his essence into a human vessel. However, the human body proved exceedingly fragile. Even so, it could be restored quickly using a rare mineral. Unfortunately, this substance did not exist on earth. So the Pharaoh activated the Stargate, transporting ancient Egyptian slaves to a distant world to ensure their obedience. He proclaimed himself the Sun God and ruled humanity with ruthless dominance. But as earth civilization advanced rapidly, the oppressed finally reached their limit. They seized the crucial moment, overthrew the transport gate, and buried it deep beneath the sands, cutting off the evil sun God's route back to earth. Humanity believed this chapter would fade into obscurity. Yet in 1928, archaeologists unexpectedly unearthed a massive metallic ring engraved with rows of ancient Egyptian glyphs. The military spent years studying it without any progress, until a historian named Daniel arrived. A scholar with unique theories about the origins of civilizations who boldly suggested the pyramids were not crafted by humans at all. Gifted with remarkable linguistic Skill Daniel soon discovered the symbols actually represented star constellations. He immediately warned the military leadership the carvings were not text, but a full interstellar navigation system. At last they decoded the method to activate the Stargate. After the operators entered the coordinates, the gate roared to life, locking onto seven celestial points in succession, then unleashing a surge of violent energy. In an instant, the Stargate reopened. The military promptly sent a probe vehicle through the shimmering portal. Data from the system revealed the probe had crossed hundreds of millions of light years in only seconds, successfully reaching another world. But at that moment, the signal abruptly vanished and the watery veil of the gate collapsed. General, fearing Earth's coordinates might be exposed, had decisively cut the connection. He planned to shut down the mission, but Daniel unexpectedly volunteered to undertake the dangerous crossing. Since he alone could decipher the alien script, the general approved the expedition, assigning a colonel and an armed squad to protect him. When all was ready, the troops prepared for departure. Driven by an intense hunger for knowledge, Daniel stepped into the gate. In an instant, his body dissolved into microscopic particles, racing through the wormhole, traversing unfathomable distances. When consciousness returned, they found themselves inside a dim, lifeless alien structure.

She shouted for her friends to get out, but the two inside were too busy playing and ignored every warning. When they finally turned around, they realized something was very wrong, but it was already too late. A chilling layer of ice was racing across the surface. Panicking for their lives, they hurried toward the edge, yet the freezing water overtook them even faster. Within moments, the icy sheet reached their bodies. Nina, who was closer, barely managed to pull herself out. But Jake behind her, wasn't so lucky. His leg was completely trapped in the ice and no amount of force could free him. Thankfully, Matt reacted fast, grabbed a nearby tool and smashed the ice like a madman. Within seconds, Jake was released. Everyone thought the danger had passed. But when Matt began climbing out, something even stranger happened. Before he could respond, his entire body froze into a solid ice figure. To keep him from suffocating, Jake jabbed a hole through the ice with a pen and injected a special antidote. The moment it activated, heat spread, cracks exploded across the surface and the ice burst open. Against all odds, Matt survived.

No one ever walked away victorious after throwing fist with him. Even the teachers treated him like a natural disaster they couldn't control. And no matter how hard he got slammed, never changed.

Like someone hit pause on his entire life. His first attempt to talk to her, a full scale disaster. He embarrassed himself so badly, he wished floor would swallow him whole. For the first time, he actually cared what someone thought of him. Played on his side. The girl was assigned to his class. Young Sook wasn't just. She was the gorgeous. That a time slow down. Every break, the hallways overflowed with ice. Trying to spot her secret photos became the school's unofficial sport. Even the campus spiders couldn't resist her charm. Every day, someone stepped up to confess their love. And every day, young Suk shut them down with a simple lick of her hand. Wu Ying was different. Friend on is always trailing behind her like a loyal shadow. He even helped peel off the love letters people stuck to her back. He didn't try to impress her. He just wanted to make her life a little easier. Young silk adored spicy rice cakes. So Wuyan Would sneak her over the school wall just to buy some. He was so nervous during those moments, chugging water non stop, like he was trying to cool down a heart. Eating way too fast. One day, as she was about to climb the wall again, started Wuyan in yet another fight. Startled, she slipped, falling straight into his arms. For a second, the whole world felt strangely quiet. Wuyan knew she was exhausted from all the punks chasing her around, so he came up with a bold plan. She should pretend to date him. That way the troublemakers would finally back off. He even promised he'd fighting forever if she agreed. From then on, the bullies redirected all their energy toward him. They threw milk cartons, ash, anything they could get their hands on. But Wu Yan never lost his temper. Calmly picked the milk up off the ground, almost like he was thanking them. As if nothing mattered anymore. Except keeping his promise to her.

Only then did she realize the call had a bad signal and hung up. The design on the back of the sweater wasn't finished yet. A little later, sensing something was off, she video called him again. Suddenly, a wig fell onto his face. She immediately sensed something was wrong. Just as she was about to question him, he went completely rigid again. The villagers behind him held their breath. She assumed the call had frozen and wandered around the house looking for a better signal. After several failed attempts, she finally hung up. Only then did everyone relax. In truth, the husband had been lying. He claimed he was studying art in a major city, but he was really teaching in a remote Mountain Village. Every time she called, he pretended to be at a famous city, relying entirely on the villagers to keep the secret. But one day, while visiting a newly opened resort, she caught sight of a covered notice board at the village entrance. Curiosity got the better of her and when she lifted the cover, she was stunned to see.

But as he rushed, he realized she was still holding the thread attached to his finger. The more he struggled, the more his body started to unravel. She commanded him into the room. No choice. He stepped inside. She locked the door behind him, then picked up a new thread, weaving his legs. In mere moments, two perfect legs emerged. She grabbed two balls of yarn, using them as makeshift silicone. She crafted a large red mouth and pulled his hair into a neat bun. Long braids followed, carefully placed atop his head. Now she resembled a vibrant twenty year old. She moved to her closet, sifting through her clothes until she unearthed a low cut dress she'd kept for years. When she opened the door, he froze in shock. Without hesitation, she threw herself on top of him. But then, unexpectedly, every part of her body began to disintegrate. Hours passed, and when she regained consciousness, he was once again old. She tried to kiss him, but he was already two steps ahead. He tugged at the cord binding her hands to the chandelier, and with a harsh yank, she was left suspended, her body like a doll in a museum. He tied her to the bed, then left her Abandoned

Following the trail, she realized the cunning woman had slipped out the window. She rushed over, seeing nothing outside, unaware that the intruder now clung to the third floor ledge. Back in the bedroom, she spotted a red, high Heel on the floor. Her boyfriend had been cheating right under her nose. Determined to teach him a lesson, she returned to the dark bathroom, relit the candles, and pretended to give him a massage. Quietly, she poured chili oil into the bath.

Meanwhile, the woman leaped from the window into a dumpster below. Outside, they reunited, free to continue their clandestine romance.

He clattered at the edge of the tower, finger scraping metal, desperately trying to hook onto anything that might stop the ball. It wasn't cutting him any slack. It was already way too late. A split second later, gravity yanked him down and he dropped at form, sitting 10,000 meters above the planet. High enough clouds look like puddles beneath him. Panic slammed into him, putting his chest and freezing his thoughts. He I twisted. I do angle his body, like he'd seen in training videos. But this wasn't training. This was real. At the last possible second, he grabbed the record and yanked with everything he had. The parachute exploded open behind him, jerking him upwards so hard it nearly ripped his arms off. But it worked. Was alive. Barely. He thought the nightmare was over. Couldn't have been more wrong. Before he even drew a full breath, a massive skyscraper rose into view, like a steel mountain appearing out of nowhere. He had no time to turn, no time to scream. He slammed into the sharp spire of the penthouse with a sickening thud, bouncing hard before getting tangled. A chute wrapped around the rooftop, wrapping him like a bug in a web. The penthouse door burst open. A group of Men stared at him in shock. And the look in their eyes told him everything. It landed in the wrong place. The very wrong place. He stumbled inside. Foolish that he had walked straight into a Mafia exchange. Bosses mistook him for one of their smugglers. In corner, shaking guns aimed his way. He had no choice but to pretend he was part of the deal. And that's when fate delivered the final punch. A real Mafia boss stepped into the room. A cold silence fell. And in that pressure cooker moment, a wild, desperate idea through his mind. His only chance to survive.

Fuming, she crouched down and pried the trap open with every ounce of pride she had left. The guy snapped out of the spell instantly. As she was chasing him away, another man stepped right into a trap. She turned and there stood a wealthy tycoon. Without wasting a heartbeat, she pulled out his wallet stuffed with cash thicker than his ego. She immediately leaped into his arms and he fell for her on impact, treating her like royalty. Once he brought her home, but that wasn't the life she truly wanted. Bored out of her mind, she gave him a lazy shove and strolled into his bedroom. Thinking she was about to reward him. He followed eagerly. She stopped him at the doorway and locked the door shut. Curiosity got the better of him. He kneeled down and peeked through the keyhole. Inside, she discovered drawers overflowing with luxury jewelry and watches. Jackpot! She stuffed every glittering piece into her pocket. But the tycoon, watching everything through the keyhole, exploded. In rage

The mechanical housekeeper, always modestly attired, now stood clad in suggestive lingerie. Flush of surge through him, yet memories of his critically ill wife forced the desire down. He hastily exited the space. Ever since his spouse was hospitalized, he'd acquired a nanny droid from a domestic service provider to care for their young child. Initially the union, it performed flawlessly, maintaining immaculate order throughout the home and preparing elaborate meals in advance for their daily return. Thoroughly pleased with its service, the man instructed it to entertain his daughter for retreating to his study. Then a sharp cry echoed from the living area. He rushed in to find his daughter had shattered a vase. The droid had shielded the girl just in time, preventing injury, though its own case, sing, was scraped, lying fragment. Guilt ridden, the man resolved to conduct repairs himself. As the maintenance panel opened, he was confronted with its provocatively designed frame. Catching his gaze, the unit peeled a strip of ceiling tape from its thigh, deliberately revealing Alabaster synthetic skin. A silent suggestion hang in between them. The man dismissed it as imagination, unaware the machine had developed autonomous consciousness and now viewed itself as the lady.

When the girl turned around, Claire froze. Wasn't this her daughter, Kamaya? But Kamaya had died in a car accident four years ago. Don't be mad at me. It's not my fault. Something truly strange had happened. Kamaya seemed unaware, her memories only reaching back an hour. Not realizing she had been dead for four years, Claire slowly moved closer to Kamaya, trying to see more clearly. Maya stared blankly, confused.

Determined, he started sucking the fat from her abdomen. Soon, her entire body hung loose and flabby. She woke up, startled watching him siphon her flesh. She rose in fury, but her weakened frame made her collapse onto the couch. He sneered at her expression, grabbing the hose to fill his scrawny arm. Gradually, he pumped fat throughout his body, sculpting himself as he wished. She observed him carefully. Then a cunning idea sparked in her mind. She grinned at his thin legs, provoking his uncontrollable rage. Without a second thought, she thrust the hose into his leg, filling him with fat. Executing her plan, she turned the machine to full power. Unable to withstand the pressure, his body swelled rapidly. She washed with glee as he struggled to pursue her, but collapsed under his own weight. Flailing helplessly, he could not rise. Seizing the remaining fat, she turned the machine on herself, stripping away the dead skin from her body.

The sand people froze, then erupted into panic, grabbing their weapon and forming a tight defensive line. Even the massive banthas shifted nervously. Only Boba stood there, confused, unable to understand why a passing train could inspire such terror. When one sand person after another collapse, the truth hit him like a punch. He yanked two children behind cover as gunmen on the train rained down blaster fire, treating the tribe like moving targets. The Sand People fired back with crude rifle, but compared to the relentless laser fire, their weapons were almost meaningless. The slaughter continued until the train vanished into the horizon, leaving the dunes scattered with body. The horrific sight hammered at Boba's nerve. Were primitive weapons really a reason for these people to be hunted like animals, children included? Rage welled up inside him, too strong to hold down. He vowed that those responsible would pay dearly. That night, the Sand People held a solemn cremation for the fallen.

Then he asked the white driver where he should toss the bones. Without saying a word, the driver rolled down the window and said, this is how we do it. That's the routine. Seeing this, black man burst into laughter and copied the driver, flicking the bone out the window. There you go. But before the driver's smile even had time to fade, he was mocked by two white men stopped at a red light. In the 1960s, racism was everywhere. And now a white man was working for a black man. Faced with those hostile stares from the car beside them, Tony simply raised his middle finger, slammed the gas and sped away. What those men could never have imagined was that just months earlier, Tony himself was deeply prejudiced. When his wife once offered a black worker a glass of water, Tony threw the cup straight into the trash. His wife didn't understand, but she didn't argue either because Tony was the pillar of the household. Everyone knew his temper. With his strength, Tony worked as a bar bouncer, handling rowdy customers to earn extra goodwill. He even staged scams with the cashier. She'd pretend to swipe a guest's valuables and Tony would miraculously retrieve them, earning thanks and a generous tip. He'd always act reluctant to accept the money, building himself a reputation for honesty thanks to that persona, Tony. Had plenty of friends, but one night everything changed. A fight erupted in the bar and Tony threw a man out with his bare hands. He had no idea that the man had powerful connections. And because of that, the bar was forced to close down. Tony was suddenly jobless. With no steady income, he had to take odd jobs to keep his family afloat. Through a friend's recommendation, he went to a mansion to interview as a driver for a pianist. When the employer appeared, Tony froze. A black man sitting tall on a throne like chair. Doctor Shirley asked whether Tony minded working for a black employer. Tony didn't like the thought, but for the paycheck, he swallowed his pride. Shirley explained he needed more than a driver. He wanted a bodyguard, a travel assistant, someone to shine his shoes and wash his clothes because the tour would head deep into the American South where racism was at its worst. The job would last two months, pay $3,000 per month with room and board. The money was tempting, but Tony stood up and refused. He could accept driving for a black man, but he would never become someone's personal servant. Shirley looked disappointed.

I knelt devoutly and count how deeply to the Buddha statue. But when the Buddha statue saw me, it actually turned around. This scene shocked me completely. I hurried to another Buddha statue nearby, but the same thing happened again. At this moment, I was very angry. I poured out my grievances to the Buddha statue. Every time I go out, people are unwilling to believe that I am a monk, cause in their eyes, monks have always been bald. I came to the largest Buddha statue and begged her to give me another chance. I firmly believe that the great Buddha statue, famous for its compassion, will definitely accept me. But as soon as the great Buddha saw me, it closed its eyes. Seeing this, my master sighed sadly and said, maybe you shouldn't have Become a monk in this life.

For her teammates froze in disbelief, completely stunned. Sorry, little one. Just a tiny hole. It turns out that Polaris possesses the overwhelming ability to magnetic fields. Even a gentle kick from the unborn baby was enough to trigger a massive magnetic disturbance. If she went into full labor, the consequences could be catastrophic. To prevent a large scale disaster, her companions rented an entire military base just for enough. The walls were 16 meters thick, strong enough to survive a nuclear blast. Yet for Polaris, even that didn't feel safe enough. So they constructed a special delivery chamber to meet within the base. A room completely isolated from any metal. However, before every precaution was in place, Polaris suddenly felt a stabbing pain in her abdomen. Get over here! Look at her! It's happening! The baby's coming! Move! Move! But the metal. The entire zone turned into a high risk area. Get her in now! They rushed her inside without wasting a second. The agony of childbirth forced a violent scream out of her, releasing bursts of magnetic power she could not maintain. It didn't just disrupt the delivery of electrical systems, it blacked out the entire city. With each cry, metal objects outside seem to respond like loyal soldiers, moving, sliding slowly but surely toward her. Yet Polaris continued to struggle. Bones feeling as if they were Shattering under the pressure, her blood pressure skyrocketed, consciousness slipping away. The doctor warned she didn't have much time left, suspecting a powerful mental block was holding her back, and urged everyone to prepare for the worst. In this crucial moment, Reva ordered the telepathic to intervene, invading Polaris's mind and weaving an illusion where mutants and humans live together in harmony. That vision gave Polaris the strength to keep going. At last, Laris summoned every ounce of will left in her body, and with a final earth shaking scream, metal structures within miles leaned towards a military base, the destruction spiraling out of control. But in the end, she delivered the baby safely. Both mother and child survived.

The runaway soldier had both ankles shackled, the chains other end hammered deep into a boulder. His squad tossed him a few bullets and a bit of rations, ordering him to hold off any approaching Soviet troops. The moment they marched off, he grabbed his sniper rifle and slid rounds into the chamber. But by the time he lifted the scope, his comrades had already vanished into the treeline. His first mission now wasn't fighting the Soviets, it was escaping the chain. Panic. He raised the rifle, aimed at the iron links and fired. The blast echoed, pain ripping through his hands, but the heavy chain didn't budge. Needed another solution. Digging through his pack, he found an old pair of glasses. An idea sparked. He carefully pried out both lenses, press them together and snapped off a pine twig. Scraping resin from the branch, he chewed it until soft and smeared it around the lens edges, fixing them in place. Then he added more twigs and dripped water between the lenses, creating a crude magnifier. He packed moss against the giant nail anchoring him and focused sunlight onto it. Soon the moss smoldered, then ignited. He fed the flame with dry branches until till it burned strong. Once the wood turned to embers, he splashed cold water onto the stone. The sudden temperature shift made the rock crack. He tugged at the nail, still stuck but looser than before. He Repeated the process again and again. Gradually the nail inched outward. A large fracture opened in the stone. A few more cycles and he'd be free. By noon, he was crouched beside the rock, eating from a tin can. Then a distant engine rumbled across the valley. The soldier froze, seized his sniper rifle and braced himself.

Watching his teammates prepare to pour the sauce over the meat, the boy reached out on instinct to stop them and the scorching hot sauce splashed onto his hand, burning him. As the only batch of sauce splattered across the floor, the teammates erupted in anger. Yet the man calmly insisted the steak didn't need any sauce at all. By then, the competition was nearly over. The three judges approached the table eyeing the plain looking steak with zero enthusiasm. They plan to take a bite, judge it quickly and move on. But the moment the steak hit their palates, its aroma overwhelmed their senses. One judge even declared they were advancing. When the results were announced, the team burst with excitement. Little did he know his remarkable skills had already caught the attention of a certain female judge. Later that night, Judge Annie was heading home. But as she passed through the kitchen, she noticed staff members crowding around a stove. Curious, I stepped closer and discovered Jack cooking the leftovers from the competition. As Annie approached, Jack continued working with precise practiced motions. He heated the oil, tossed in tenderloin and vegetables, stir fried them over blazing heat, then layered in an array of seasonings. Soon a steaming bowl of special stir fry was ready. Annie examined the meat. And took a bite. After just a few chews, a familiar flavor rushed back to her, a meal she had tasted in a father and son home 15 years earlier. What she didn't realize was that Jack was the very same boy from that day. To refine his culinary craft, Jack trained under his grandfather. He prepared a black base, cutting several slits along its belly to remove the fishiness, line the plate with ginger, sprinkled scallions and chilies, and poured the family's secret sauce over. The fish steamed for precisely six minutes and one second and the legendary steamed black bass was complete. As the third generation heir of a gourmet family, Jack grew up destined to become a master chef. But the brutal, long hours of running his restaurant finally caught up with him and he suddenly collapsed on the job.

The little girl looked so pure, so bright, that her innocent smile almost warmed the gloom around him. But suddenly, the train screeched to a halt. The doors slid open, and several souls marked for damnation were violently pulled outside. Trying to calm the girl, he playfully told her it was all just a game. But in the very next instant, her parents were dragged out as well. He froze. From what he had seen, they looked like a loving, flawless family. People who should have been heading toward heaven, not hell. The little girl watched her parents vanish, helpless, tears rolling down her cheeks. He held her gently and carried her toward the gate leading into heaven. Her soul was so spotless that she didn't even need to pass inspection. As the attendants escorted her away, she smiled sweetly at him, and all he could do was offer a powerless wave in return. Meanwhile, her parents crashed into hell, frantically asking where their daughter was. Instead of answers, they were thrown straight into the furnace of flames. Burning and desperate, they clawed their way up to King Yama's hall, begging for an explanation. They insisted they had never harmed anyone in life, so why were they being punished so brutally after death? They cried that they simply couldn't bear the weight of living anymore, that the harm they chose was toward Themselves, not others. Seeing they wouldn't give up, the judge replayed recordings from their time among the living. Their daughter had been too young to speak, so they never understood what she tried to say. The judge translated her babbling, all I want is banana. It turned out that the couple, terrified she'd suffer alone after they were gone, selfishly decided to take her with them. But that had never been her desire. They had stolen her right to choose life or death. And that was their greatest sin. For in King Yama's eyes, from the moment a life is born, it stands as its own being. No one, not even a parent, has the authority to choose its fate.

And right before a friend set her up on a blind date, her hair staged a full mutiny. One giant knot from root to tip. Panic hit her fast, mostly because she'd already fallen for the ridiculously handsome guy waiting outside. When she grabbed her hair and shook it, a handful of her usual snack stashes reigned out. Years of dried soda and greasy crumbs had fused everything together, turning her hair into one colossal, crunchy mess. With no better option, she finally surrendered and went to wash it. But shocker! A skunk had been living in that mess the whole time. No wonder. Her hair had been unusually smelly and weirdly heavy lately. Before she could even gasp, the slippery little rascal blasted her with a toxic fart. The stench was so intense, it practically dissolved all her hair. She broke down crying. Fantastic! Now she was bald on the first date. There was no way the handsome guy would give her a second look. Surprisingly, the skunk actually felt sorry for her and cooked up a clever plan. Just as the guy was turning to walk away, the door swung open and she stepped out. He froze instantly captivated by her beauty, and invited her to join him for lunch. Naturally, the skunk was still sitting proudly on top of her head like it had executive right.

Then he headed to the basketball court. The place was empty, silent except for the echo of a bouncing ball. He started shooting hoops alone, and what I saw next stunned me. His form was solid, movements steady and practiced. Nothing like a boy who claimed he had no interest in basketball. I remembered our earlier conversation. Chew, are you really done with basketball? You were great as a kid. And his cold reply, not interested. Watching him now, handling the ball with such natural talent, filled me with pride. I called him, asking what he was doing. He lied instantly. I tried again. If he wanted to pursue basketball, I'd support him with everything I had. But he repeated the same cold line. Not interested. All I could do was whisper his name, hoping somehow he'd hear what I couldn't say.

My gut clenched immediately. I never leave a trace of anything on my boat. I grabbed my luminol spray and went over the deck again. Under the glow, a huge smear of blood lit up. That's when I knew someone had been killed on my boat. I collected a sample and took it to the police lab for testing. The results came back. The blood belonged to Louise. Why was he killed on my boat? Why would he have even been on my boat? Why? Full of questions, I drove home. Just as I was about to unlock the door, I saw someone pull back my living room curtains. Me and stinks screamed at me. Someone was waiting for me inside. What I didn't know was that Isaac was already there, sitting with a gun, waiting for me to walk in. So I went back to my car, called my own home phone. Hey, it Dex. Sam. Just want to confirm we're still on for 1:00 at scooter or later at 12 in Bayshore Drive. See you there. And accidentally announced where I'd be heading next. If someone was inside, they'd follow. The second I hung up, Isaac appeared. I recognized him instantly. The boss of the kosher brotherhood. He was here for revenge. He showed up at the location I'd mentioned. But I was one step ahead. I had arranged for a Waiter to hand him a phone. One I'd called myself. Hello? Why were you in my apartment? Answer the question. What were you doing in my place? I love stumping with you. Wait, you're not tennis sister. I've done my homework, too. Family has always been my line in the sand. His threats against them left me no choice. I had to take him out first. I let Isaac track me, luring him to his rivals turf. Big plan was to have someone else finish him for me. But the next morning, when police arrived at the scene, I found out Isaac had single handedly wiped out the entire rival crew. That's when I realized he wasn't just dangerous. He was a cold, efficient killer. From the blood on the ground, I guessed he'd been wounded, too. If I could match it to him, we'd go down. And I did. Blood match. Isaac was arrested. As he was walked past homicide. More eyes locked. I thought I was finally rid of him. Then he gave me that twisted smile. Turns out, before he was arrested, he had already bought off Detective Quinn. Ho slipped into the evidence locker and stole the only thing that could convict him. On the Eve of the trial, Masuko went to retrieve the evidence and found it missing. My stomach dropped. Critical evidence had vanished from inside the station itself. There's only one explanation. The Costco Brotherhood has a mole inside. Mining meshroom mold reaching Many spawn office. May be the evidence just caught this place. Hey! You do not place evidence. Deb told me we had one day left before the hearing. Our only chance was to collect new blood evidence from the scene. What we didn't know was that Quinn was listening to every word. When we got there, the entire area had been hosed down. No more evidence. Isaac walked free the next morning as I was standing

She just happened to sit beside him. But somehow she gets it. First you fall, then you figure out how to rise. They exchange names. Zach Bella. She studies film and media, low pressure courses compared to his. What year are you? Second. What happened? First year I dropped out, then crawled back. He wants to help, even if all he has is a weird pack of gummy candy. Awkward kindness, but she smiles. Yeah, I'll take one. She lives off campus, roommates in a small apartment. He just got kicked out of housing. Life is stacking problems on him. She understands. Funny trauma. Same. How are you surviving? Loans and hustling like crazy. She pauses. Why are you kind to me? Because I know what it feels like to desperately need someone to be kind. She admits it. Social settings terrify her. He admits talking to strangers is easier than friends. And she nods. Finally, someone who understands. And she notices his tattoo looks cool. It's a scar from fighting anxiety and depression. Same. Then Bella drops a bombshell. She isn't even a student here. She didn't fail a test. She came here for him. Because I heard you're one Of the hardest working kids around. He freezes. What is happening? She tells him he deserves support. Do you trust me? Yes. Good. But one last surprise. She hands him an umbrella, counts one, two, three, then reveals it's not a prop. It's his new home editing setup so he can keep pursuing film. But wait, there's one more twist. She pulls out another package. And inside, a future he never dreamed of. You don't ever have to worry about tuition again. On behalf of Dell Technologies, he receives a scholarship covering all remaining tuition at the university of Texas at Austin. Housing, books, everything. It's real. His voice breaks. Thank you. Are you serious? She smiles. Congratulations. We love you.

She is a cold blooded serial killer. She grew up trapped in a toxic, nightmarish home. Her father murdered his own wife. Yet the young Eugene stood there disturbingly calm, almost emotionless. Grandma gave us the money. Mom got drunk and fell down the stairs. Honestly, you were tired of her, too, right? Dad's going to find you a new mom, someone rich, someone better. From now on, you do exactly what dad says. Otherwise you'll be thrown away just like her. Under her father's trembling stare, Eugene didn't argue. She walked to her dying mother and realized she was still breathing. But saving her wasn't even a consideration. When her mother desperately reached out for help, Eugene simply brushed her hand aside, leaving her to die in absolute despair. Years of brutality had already carved deep scars into her soul. Her alcoholic mother found twisted pleasure in beating her whenever she was drunk. And yet, despite growing up in that nightmare, Eugene grew into a stunning woman with extraordinary charm. Later, under the stage name Becky Jean, she skyrocketed into stardom. But fame didn't change the truth. She was a high functioning sociopath. To her, people weren't friends or partners. They were tools, disposable pieces she used to climb higher, especially men she found advantageous. Back in high school, the darkness inside her had already started leaking out. Everyone was Celebrating their homeroom teacher's birthday, everyone except Becky Jean. She stayed still, expressionless because she already knew the storm that was about to erupt. What is this? Huh? What is this? The teacher's husband burst into the classroom waving photos of her affair. The teacher lunged to stop him, but the students saw everything. By noon, the scandal dominated the school's online forum. The principal suspended the teacher immediately, and soon she vanished from the school in utter humiliation.

Tina rolls up to pick up her friend, only to be ambushed by a soundscape that can only be described as Fergie's national anthem if it were performed inside a collapsing barn. The original music teacher bailed months ago, leaving a scalpel loving subject leaving frog dissection skills translate into vocal training. But the principle? She's desperate, hunting for someone who can sing, dance, motivate, and possibly resurrect a program currently flatlining harder than a rejected talent show audition. Enter our unsuspecting candidate, a cupcake Mogul in progress who thought she was merely getting a ride, not being drafted into educational combat. And because fate loves dramatic timing, a sad little kid appears, fessing this class is destroying their love for music faster than any government funding crisis ever could. That emotional sucker punch does the trick. Suddenly, our reluctant hero marches into the room like a sassy drill sergeant in glitter and espresso breeze. Stop everything, Rover, sweetie, you're croaking like a swamp mascot. Breathe from your diaphragm, not your neck. One octave shove later, sparkles! Boom! Permit mode activate. Sparkles! She's ruthless in the most entertaining way, calling out screeches, winces, and voices that sound like someone slammed their fingers in a car door. Miraculously, the kids don't ride. They actually perk up. Meanwhile, the principal flutters nearby, half horrified, half mesmerized, reminding her these children Come packaged with Aaron, who emailed the school board before breakfast. But she also knows deep down now, this unapologetically blunt, fiery, comedic chaos is exactly what this shipwreck of a music department needs to stay of. So she delivers the pitch. A speech equal parts confession, flattery. If excellence is the goal, I need the best recruit on the field, and that is you. Be loud, be sharp, be authentically. Tear through the sugar coating if you must, cause honestly, those pants are doing nothing for your backside anyway. Microphone. And just like that, art queen evolves into the school's most unpredictable safe arm. Not with sheet music, but sarcasm, rhythm, a brutal sense of honesty, and just enough art to pallant out of chaos. One messy.

My colleagues couldn't see the crows or hear the thunder. After that, I began to have endless dreams. There were always storms. And over time, my mental state worsened. I became more and more convinced that the end of the world was coming. After preparing, I decided to turn the basement in the backyard into a shelter. It would probably cost over $60,000. I knew I couldn't convince my wife, so I decided to secretly save money without her knowing. When I returned home, I saw my daughter staring intently at a mysterious figure outside the window. My heart froze. I hugged her and took her away. But the figure didn't leave. On the contrary, it started banging on the door wildly. The whole house began to shake. The next moment, something strange happened. All the furniture in the house started floating in the air. I woke up terrified and realized it was just another nightmare. Looking at the sweat stains on the bed. I knew couldn't keep waiting and immediately decided to start building the shelter. The next day, I secretly helped my wife apply for a loan, went to the hardware store and bought some old masks. Then I took my daughter to the supermarket and started hoarding nonperishable food like a madman. To avoid arousing my wife's suspicion, I placed everything in the shelter when it was ready.

Still, something was missing. Putting a small cake on the table, he shoved it into his top. But thick leg hair ruined the effect. So he ducked under the table, cut someone else's pants, and wore them. Even then, it wasn't stylish enough.

He was the biological father of over 500 children. 142 of them wanted to know who their father was. They petitioned the court together to reveal his identity. David was stunned. The lottery ticket he had just bought didn't win him 5 million, but it did grant him 500 children. Fortunately, every time he donated, he signed a confidentiality agreement. As long as he stayed silent, no one would ever know who he was. The lawyer handed him a thick envelope obtaining the files of his 142 children. David recoiled in disgust. At home, he tossed the documents straight into the trash, but curiosity gnawed at him. What did his children look like? Who could resist opening 142 surprise boxes? David couldn't, pulled out a file, opened it and froze. The child before him was a football star, exactly the kind of child he had once dreamed of.

Some strange, wordless connection has begun to form between them. Man is Jack. For 20 long years, he has made the closet his home. Whenever the couple leaves for work, Jack steps out like he owns the place, grabbing breakfast from the fridge, tidying up the living room, even folding laundry. Her husband always assumes she did it, never suspecting a thing, especially since her memory is fragile. Two decades pass with no one noticing the intruder living right under their roof. And in that time, Jack starts seeing himself as part of their household, especially part of her life. Most days he watches quietly from the shadows, trying to understand what she's thinking and till those thoughts turn into feelings he can no longer deny. One morning, he slips out of the closet, runs his fingers across Anna's clothes and lies on her bed, breathing in the fading warmth she left behind. That's when he knows he's in love. But everything shift when he witnesses her husband bring another woman home. Jack stays hidden, listening through the night, fury building in his chest. Finally, he decides to act. He rigs a makeshift trap, a cut plastic bottle, a chunk of meat and a tree buzzing with insects. Soon, he captures dozens of bees and dumps them. Into the trash can. When the husband opens the lid, the swarm erupts, and he doesn't survive the attack. Jack watches the scene without a word. With the husband gone, only Jack and Anna remain. And one night, unable to hold back any longer, he slips into her bed, wraps his arms around her, and Anna, fully aware, silently accepts him.

Tom tried to calm her down, saying he was only curious about the artwork, not the girl. Lisa insisted she could get a tattoo, too, but she hated being the center of attention. Tom reassured her she didn't need to change a thing. He accepted it and stormed off to class. Julie ended up in the same classroom. A classmate tossed her a jacket, warning that Miss Mary, they're no nonsense teacher, cracked down on anything she considered a distraction. Julie reluctantly put it on. Miss Mary entered and told everyone to present their clubs. Lisa proudly announced she was the cheer squad captain and invited girls to try out. Except, she added loudly, no tattooed applicants. Julie knew exactly who that was aimed at. But Julie showed up to tryouts anyway, nailing every routine with flawless precision. Lisa's jealousy boiled over. Later in class, Lisa tattled to Miss Mary. Before Julie could react, Lisa yanked off her jacket, exposing every tattoo. Miss Mary expelled her immediately. At home, Julie told her mother, Rona, who vowed to fight back. The next day, Principal John arrived. When Rona confronted Miss Mary, he argued tattoos were simply art. Miss Mary refused to budge until John rolled up his sleeves and revealed his own ink. Her attitude flipped instantly. She apologized, and Julie was welcomed back to school.

Then pounding on the door, she seized a roll of tape wrapped tightly around her leg, concealing every curve. The surface looked seamless, but the pain was intense.

Jenny promised to stay right where she was and wait for her mother to return. But as soon as her mother left, Jenny dashed out of the room.

But suddenly the hairs shot out sharp like thorn. She froze in shock and grabbed a depilatory spray, almost fainting. Yet her leg instantly became smooth and gleaming. Then out of nowhere, fresh spikes of hair erupted across her entire body. She screamed in panic. Her crush sensed something strange and tried peeking through the window. She snatched up a razor, but it snapped instantly. The hairs were far tough, so she acted fast, spreading waxing strips and yanked hard, but nothing came off, only her anxiety, her skin nearly tearing from the pole. Her impatient crush started knocking on the window wanting to come in. She had no idea what to do, so she rummaged through her bag until she found a pair of tweezers. She plucked out the first stop, burn tough, pulling hard, then covered the tiny wound with a Band Aid and dab foundation on top, finally concealing the Mark. But outside, her crush was already losing it. Suddenly, she opened the door, still looking stunning, and he fell for her even harder. She dragged him inside. He was captivated by her seemingly flawless leg, running his face slightly against them. But the moment he kissed her, the hidden clumps of hair burst out again, quickly spreading over her whole body. He staggered back in disbelief and ran. She stared at herself in the mirror and broke down, devastated. Meanwhile, her crush dashed to A storage shed, put on his gear and started welding metal. She was too crushed to think, crying nonstop until she noticed a shadow outside the window. He had forged an iron armor suit just for himself, and she was overjoyed that he returned. Now he was finally ready to face her hairy spikes. She ran into his arm and together they found their happy ending.

Thinking he had been waiting for her, she happily climbed right in. Her boyfriend instantly broke into a sweat, but didn't dare push her away until he suddenly noticed lipstick on a wine glass and nervously used his phone signal the hidden woman, begging her to wipe it off. The woman quickly cleaned the glass and set it back, accidentally knocked over another one. Startled, she ducked underwater again while her boyfriend cleverly blew out all the candle. I began sensing something was wrong. With the room now completely dark, the woman seized the chance to slip out of the tub, the noise hidden beneath my boyfriend's sudden coughing. I flip the lights back on, thinking I might spot something if I stood up, but I had no idea she had already squeezed herself into the laundry hamper. My boyfriend abruptly pulled me back into the bath, and that's how the woman managed to sneak out of the bathroom and dash straight into my bedroom, planning to grab her things and escape. But her phone rang, waking me. Hearing the sound, I walked toward the bedroom and was stunned to see wet prints on the floor. Enraged, I searched every corner but found nothing. She was already clinging to the chandelier. Just when she thought she was finally safe, water from her dripping hair fell onto my head. I looked up. A Towel drop. But the fixture itself was empty. Following the footprint, I realized that cunning woman had crawled out the window. I rushed over, but saw no one outside. She was unbelievably sneaky. Angrily, I slammed the window shut, unaware that she was still hanging on from the outside, desperate to find a way to escape from me.

Unexpectedly, her toenails were far too long, and she simply couldn't slip them on. In frustration, the man grabbed his nail care tool, determined to trim them right there. His wife turned pale in terror. She hadn't clipped her toenail in over a decade. Fortunately, the man was somewhat skilled, meticulously cleaning even the grime between her toes. Though the Bill built up dirt, nearly made him gag, and when he removed the dead skin between her toe, the pain nearly made her pass out. He hurried to finish cutting and sprayed her feet with disinfect. Surely the crystal shoes would fit now, right? The moment she tried to slide her foot in, she screamed from the pain. The slipper was far too small for her enormous fill. The man forced it on, lifted her up, and made her dance. After only a few steps, feet weld like balloons. The man still refused to stop until he accidentally kicked the top of her foot. Unable to take it anymore, the wife shoved him away, ripped off the crystal shoe, and let out a long breath of relief. Seeing the fury on her face, she removed her wedding ring, walked to him, threw the ring back into his hand, and strode away proudly. After all, only the one wearing the shoe knows whether it fits. Completely confused, the man picked the crystal shoe and crammed his own foot into it. Hurt, but He endured it. He gritted his teeth and stood, only to stumble after two steps. That was the moment he finally understood her suffering. However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remove the crystal shoe from his

When her husband walked in and saw her shriveled form, his expression was filled only with disdain. With the last bit of strength she had, she reached toward the handsome neighbor working outside. He was just about to notice her, but her husband slammed the Door shut, sealing away the light and every trace of hope. She thought her story had ended. But then a knock echoed at the door. A man wearing a helmet stood outside holding a small, vibrant green plant. It's fresh, lively appearance instantly caught her husband's attention. As for her, now nearly completely wilted, he grabbed her without hesitation and tossed her straight into the trash.

I say we move them up the pass in the mountains. It's an awful rough trail. It's right. We'll take them over the path. You know, that damn Culver will take root next spring it'll be worse. We'll have to burn that field. We just gotta be careful we don't start a fucking forest fire. We'll bring up water trucks. I'll have the fire Department out just in case. I don't see any other way.

Seeing an opportunity, he immediately started filing her golden heels and took out a giant pair of Scissors and trimmed all her nails with great enthusiasm. While he was focused on his work, he flew straight into his mouth, nearly choking him to death. His violent coughing woke a homeless woman. When she opened her eyes and saw him fussing over her, she was stunned by his sudden kindness and instantly invited him to come live with her at the dump. Disgusted, the man refused on the spot. Enraged, she revealed a stash of sparkling diamonds hidden under her armpit, and that dazzling sight completely changed his attitude. The moment he stepped closer, she suddenly pulled him into her body with unbelievable force. The chaos was so intense that even a nearby rat leaped out in terror. Hours later, he finally managed to escape. The moment he touched the ground, he realized his entire body had turned to solid gold. It was everything he had ever wanted. He was rich for life! He jumped with joy, but as soon as the sun rose, its light reflected off his golden skin like a beacon, catching the attention of it, who immediately sprinted toward him. Seeing this, former homeless woman burst out of her metal barrel and sprayed herself with a miraculous mist, instantly restoring her normal appearance. Meanwhile, continued chasing the golden man until he cornered Him in a dead end alley. Just then the ex homeless woman passed. Thinking quickly, she grabbed Eve by the collar and planted a dramatic kiss on him. The little rat that had been watching recoiled in disgust and scurried away.

And after much comparison, she chose Jack, the man with the perfect eight pack. She required him to get her pregnant within three months. Failed to do so, and Jack would owe an enormous penalty. But if the plan succeeded, he would inherit her entire fortune. Tempted by the staggering amount of money, Jack agreed immediately. What he didn't expect was that he wouldn't be the one doing the job. He secretly hired his employee, Danny, and stuffed him into a hyper realistic skin suit that made him look exactly like Jack. Danny arrived at the mansion, answered a few casual questions and the process began. He stared at the rich woman in disbelief while she praised him for performing exceptionally well. Danny couldn't believe how easy the task was and Jack was stunned by how much she paid. After the first night, Jack was thrilled with Danny's performance and rewarded him extra cash. But Jack had no idea things were going off track. The rich woman contacted Danny every day, not for the main task, just to do yoga with him. Danny was delighted, while Jack panicked as time ticked away and she still wasn't pregnant. She warned Jack that only three weeks remained. Desperate, Jack ordered Danny to drug her, but Danny betrayed him. When the rich woman was about to drink the drugged water, Danny stopped her at the last second. Jenny stepped in and asked if He wasn't afraid Jack would punish him, making Danny realize she already knew everything she had known from the beginning because she herself was the result of that very same service. Her mother had hired a pale, handsome man, but when she gave birth to a dark skinned baby, she abandoned Jenny without hesitation.

The prize money was huge, but only skinny girls could compete. The first round turned out to be a burger eating challenge. This was way too easy for me, especially with Hubby's vacuum relieving the pressure. That man's a damn genius. I instantly devoured all 10 burgers. The vacuum made it completely effortless. I feel like I could eat 10 more. But my opponent wasn't so lucky. She collapsed after barely finishing her seventh burger. With her down, I breezed to round two. This round required using through three slim gates. Happy immediately fired up the fat sucking vacuum, helping me easily clear the first gate. But my naturally skinny opponent had no trouble either. She slipped through the second, narrower gate effortlessly, making me insanely jealous since I got completely stuck halfway through. Hubby didn't hesitate cranking the vacuum to medium power. The stronger suction slimmed me down further, letting me barely squeeze through. Wanting total victory, hubby maxed out the vacuum power, sucking me down to my skinniest ever. Breathing was tough, but I cleared the final gate. My opponent was stunned, then pulled out a compression bag to shrink herself. Surfing she could compete with my vacuum advantage, the final round seemed much harder. He handed me a note that said just grab the money and run. The gate was under 10 inches wide, yet my opponent effortlessly lead through. Seeing Me ready to quit. Hubby gave a threatening look, then shoved me through the gate. The vacuum helped, but I moved too fast. Snap in the hose and ballooning back to 5 0 0 LBI

Iris risked her own life to help. Her husband, who had lost his memories, realized the danger he was in and come to his rescue.

Iris is gonna die! At that moment, Barry reacted immediately upon hearing that Iris was in danger. Lightning flashed in his eyes and he soared into the sky, bursting out of the laboratory and relentlessly pursuing Iris. Flash is back! Iris saw a familiar red figure. He realized that his very had returned. A long forgotten smile appeared on his face. Very tracked the Japanese Warriors trail until he arrived at the plane. Come on, bear catcher!

She quickly gets up and urges the boy to leave unexpectedly. Her friend texts to say she's at the door. The woman hurriedly wakes up the boy. Immediately after, she rushes to open the door for her friend. But once inside, the friend announces she'll be staying for a few days. As she says this, she heads upstairs. Luckily, the boy has already escaped. In his panic, however, he left his sock upstairs. Unfortunately, the friend discovers the lone sock. Seeing this, Anna quickly explains that it belongs to her son. The friend believes her story. As it turns out, Anna is the CEO of a company. Her husband was tragically killed after being mistaken for someone else by a hitman during his morning job. Since then, she has been living alone. Although she is in her 40s, she still maintains a great figure. Then one day, as a classmate walks her son home, Anna notices this particular classmate. That evening, during a party her son is hosting at home, she watches the classmate through the window. Seeing how handsome he is, she finds herself instantly drawn to him. Jack notices Anna, too. In his desire to be with Anna physically, he stops visiting his classmates and stays looking for opportunities to be alone with her. Very quickly, the chemistry between them intensifies. One day, seizing a moment when her son isn't looking, Jack suddenly embrace it. That single embrace shattered. Finally, one night, Hannah's son borrows Jack's sports car for a date. Because of this, he asks Jack to wait at the house. After they leave, Jack begins whispering sweet nothing. And just like that, they cross a line they shouldn't have. When her son returns, Anna hides in a corner, afraid to come out, even though she knows it's wrong. Unbeknownst to her, Jack was actually carrying out a revenge plot.

By the time she realized what was happening, her right foot had already been devoured by the monsters. In less than a minute, the woman's entire body was completely flattened into two dimensions. Hearing her screams, her companions rushed to check on her, but all they found was the woman's flashlight. Just as they stood their puzzle, the door suddenly slammed shut on its own, and the door lock was flattened as well, completely trapping the two of them inside the room. At that moment, the mural on the wall began to change. The woman transmitted what she was seeing back to the doctor, who was horrified to discover that this was actually the nervous system of the woman from before, while the wallpaper was her skin. Then the two dimensional creatures launched another attack. After devouring the sofa, the two people naturally became their next targets. They thought they'd be safe hiding in the hanging basket, but these creatures were incredibly clever. They plan to crawl from the walls up to the ceiling, then completely flatten the chains and hanging bed as well. In this critical moment, Lisa used all her strength to swing, launching herself and the hanging bed out of the room. Meanwhile, more and more people throughout the city were going missing. They weren't being murdered, they were being turned into human shaped graffiti by by the two dimensional creatures. Lisa urged people To stay away from the graffiti. But it was already too late. The graffiti seemed to come alive, all of them beginning to move. They crawled down the walls to the ground and began attacking people in all directions. Lisa quickly LED people to hide in a nearby warehouse. One person ran a bit too slowly and was unfortunately caught. Transformed into a two dimensional creature, Lisa and the others had no choice but to keep running. Exiting through the warehouses back door, they fled to a tunnel. But what they didn't expect was that the two dimensional creatures had gradually evolved into three dimensional being. Soon another companion was captured. To escape the tunnel, they had to open the steel door in front of them, but the door handle had been flattened. The doctor handed Lisa a high tech device that could restore the door handle back to three dimensions. This way they successfully opened the steel door and escape to prevent the monsters from following them after closing the door.

Next, he spit a mouthful of disgusting acidic fluid right onto Lisa's face. Lisa froze in terror, but her ex husband actually let her go because the virus had already entered her body. And the moment she fell asleep, her cells would start to change, turning her into a new life form similar to The Walking Dead. But Lisa's only goal was to find her son. Seeing her ex husband and a group of infected chasing after her, she had no choice but to speak away in her car. But she didn't get far. Crowd of expressionless people blocked her path. Realizing they were infected, Lisa panic and jumped out of the car. But they didn't intend to let her go. They kept chasing her relentlessly. To escape, she ran out onto the street begging for help. But everyone who saw her pretended not to notice. With no other choice, Lisa hid inside a subway station. She thought she had finally shaken them off, but to her shock, the subway was also filled with hollow eyed people. Realizing the whole city had fallen, Lisa pretended to be one of them and quietly sat down. But then a woman disguised As an infected was discovered by the real ones, with no alternative, Lisa followed the group into another carriage, but the infected soon pushed open the door. A burst of virus sprayed out, scaring Lisa into jumping straight onto the subway track. She ran along the tracks and escaped the station. Seeing everyone outside completely blank faced, Lisa had to continue pretending to be infected because her most urgent mission was to find her son as fast as possible. Before long, Lisa saw people on the street lining up for virus vaccination, and the person in charge of vaccination turned out to be a neighbor who had already been infected. Lisa knows this is just another way of transmission. She remained calm and lied that she had already been vaccinated. After successfully deceiving them, Lisa quickly went home.

Would you do it? Jack agreed without his. But the moment he stepped into the room, his shoes got stuck to the floor. When he tried to pull them free, he nearly lifted the entire floorboard with them. He tried opening the refrigerator, but the door was glued shut and all the food inside was covered in a thick layer of glue. Even the ceiling was dripping with glue. Drop by drop, sticky rainstick. Want to give up? Easily picked up a chair and tried to stick it on the ceiling. Unfortunately, the glue was strong enough. The chair quickly fell back down. Then suddenly, Jack had an idea to pass the time. He started throwing random objects at the walls, watching them stick there one by one. It was surprisingly entertaining. He threw more and more until finally he managed to stick himself onto the wall. Hours passed and soon Jack grew hungry. He struck to pull a bottle of Cola out of the fridge, but the glue on the bottle wore his glove apart. He waved his hands furiously until he finally got free. Luckily, he found a spare pair of gloves in a cabinet and even a bottle of cooking oil. He wanted to heat up some food, but microwave buttons were glued solid. He tried to watch TV, but the remote was stuck, too. Ten hours had gone by. Jack's Stomach was growling loudly. Seeing his miserable state, the host decided to give him a chance to earn some food, 20 push minus UPS and 20 sit minus UPS. It took everything he had. After all, the glue made every movement a struggle. But he finally finished and was rewarded with a small pack of cookies. After filling his stomach, Jack simply found a spot and fell asleep and slept straight through to the end of the challenge. He successfully completed it.

Then his teammate released the skateboard's connector, sending it sliding rapidly beneath the passenger filled bus behind them. Because terrorists had planted multiple bombs under the bus, if the speed dropped below 50, the bombs would detonate. So the police could only use this method to send bomb disposal expert Jimmy under the bus. With the bus drivers cooperation, he successfully reached the bomb's location. Drawing on years of bomb disposal experience, Jimmy quickly found the bomb's control wire. But just as he was about to cut it, the high speed skateboard suddenly hit a piece of rubber on the road. It instantly lost control. Even the safety rope up front couldn't hold it back. In the critical moment, Jimmy grabbed onto the bus chassis in time, avoiding being crushed by the spinning wheels. But the danger wasn't over. If this continued, his strength would soon run out. Worse still, the massive pulling force had snapped the safety rope connecting the skateboard board. By now, no matter how strong Jimmy's arms were, he could no longer stop the skateboard from sliding backward. Watching death draw closer and closer, Jimmy directly jammed the screwdriver into the fuel tank to use as a handhold. With his other hand, he grabbed an iron frame on the chassis. This finally freed his entire body from the skateboard. Passengers on the bus quickly opened the floor and pulled Jimmy up together. But this wasn't the Time to celebrate yet. The fuel tank had been punctured and was now leaking continuously. In less than 10 minutes, the bus would stop and everyone would be killed in the explosion. Since they couldn't defuse the bomb, police brought in a flatbed truck to drive alongside the bus, hoping to rescue the passengers this way. Only the first passenger was lucky. When it was the second passenger's turn, the bomber suddenly triggered a bomb under the door. The step was instantly blown open with a hole, and the woman fell from the bus and lost her life. Jimmy felt very guilty about this, but it also made him realize there must be a surveillance camera installed in the bus. That's how the bomber knew their every move. Sure enough, after some searching, he found a pinhole camera lens in a corner above the door. After learning this, the captain quickly had the radio station intercept transmission signals in the area and replace them with footage of the current bus, then loop it. They hoped to fool the bomber. In reality, they had already started the rescue operation. With the efforts of the police and Jimmy, all passengers were soon transferred to the bus on the other side. The bomber didn't notice anything unusual. Now only the driver and Jimmy remained on the bus. To escape alive, Jimmy used a metal rod to hold down the gas pedal, then tied one end of a rope to the steering wheel and The other end to an iron plate. Then they lay on the iron plate and escaped from under the bus. The bus changed its direction due to the ropes pulling force and finally crashed into an abandoned airplane and exploded.

He then turned the winch to tighten the wire and finally adjusted the rooftop spotlight position so it could shine directly on vehicles on the road. Soon night came and his target came speeding on his motorcycle. When the target was about to reach the trap, the assassin quickly turned on the spotlight. The sudden bright light left the man no time to react, and he was instantly decapitated by the wire. The reason the assassin did this was to rob a locator device worth tens of millions on the victim. The locator contained the location of tons of drug to pass security checks smoothly during transport. Cunning drug dealer actually hid this shipment in a septic truck. Following the instructions on the locator, the assassin quickly found the location of the septic truck. But what he didn't expect was that besides their group, other people were also targeting this shipment. Just after entering the United States, a police car followed them. The police inside demanded they stop for inspection. Since they had just passed police inspection at the border station. The assassin determined that these two were definitely fake police, so his companion quickly pulled out a gun and got out of the car, hiding in the blind spot of the two fake police. Then the assassin hit the gas and drove away from There fake police who couldn't react in time. One was shot dead on the spot, while the other pulled out an Uzi and engaged in a gunfight with the two assassins. Due to the weapon gap, both were soon killed by this fake policeman. Jimmy successfully seized the shipment. The intense gunfight had shot a hole in the septic truck, so Jimmy had to cut a tree branch to temporarily block the small hole. But to safely deliver the goods to his boss, he still had to repair the truck properly. Fortunately, there was a repair shop nearby that specialized in gray business. The employees there were very professional. Seeing blood stains on the car, they never asked questions, but skillfully cleaned it off. And their repair skills were also first rate. They first filled the bullet holes with molten iron blocks, then sprayed sulfuric acid oxidation to make it the same color as the surroundings. At this time, another group of people wanting to rob the goods appeared. This time they directly blocked Jimmy's boss.

But the owner also assumed they were broke and refused to make any engine. Disappointed, the two returned home and converted their house into a small workshop to assemble engine part. David decided to work at the engine factory, stealing components quietly. One day as he walked out of the factory with something important.

A senior monk stopped him and said, you cannot enter in wet clothes. Kai quickly stripped off his soaked garment, laid them on a stone pillar to dry, and waited patiently.

We ran the same routine on stack after stack, dunking every Bill, hanging them on a wire to drip dry, then blasting them with a hair dryer until they had the perfect I've been through something's texture.

But our first batch didn't survive five seconds of real world scrutiny. Back in our cramped Hideout. Staring at those rejected bills scattered on the floor, I realized we weren't just making mistakes. We were playing the wrong game entirely. Indian currency uses a special cotton based paper. Nothing like regular wood pulp sheets. It has a crisp snap, a sound that basically screams authenticity. Then there's the colour shifting ink, flipping shades under the light like it has a life of its own. And the embedded security thread. A microscopic nightmare woven right into the note. If we wanted fakes that fool anyone, even for a moment, we'd have to decode every one of those secrets or risk getting caught before we even began.

After swallowing it, he took the cat's eyes for himself. Excited, Jack knocked on the goddess's door. But when she opened it, Jack was nowhere to be found. Only the kitten remained. The kitten, pretending to be hungry, used its tongue to pamper the goddess, immediately winning her over with its cuteness. The goddess, smitten by the kitten, decided to take it home, completely unaware that this was part of Jack's plot. Once Jenny had fallen asleep, the kitten opened its eyes and transformed back into Jack. He quietly approached the window, grabbed Jenny's phone, took a picture of them together and posted their love photos online. After doing that, Jack carefully put the phone back in its place, then ate the cat fur he had prepared earlier. By now, the photos had gone viral on the internet. Meanwhile, the kitten pretended not to know what was happening. When Jenny opened her phone, she was shocked. Her boyfriend had not only broken up with her, but had also blackmailed her. Kitten immediately went to comfort her, and soon Jenny calmed down, soothed by the good little cat. Jenny, feeling sympathetic, prepared some cat food for the kitten. But Jack, still hungry, took a bite. He instantly threw it up. The food was so awful he couldn't swallow it. After vomiting, the cat transformed back into Jack. He jumped out of the window, struck with a great idea. When Jenny Came back, she found the cat was gone.

I wanted to make him my most loyal slave. With a sinister smile, I checked off all the traits I desired. Handsome, honest, unable to resist selecting every positive attribute. Even the doctor was stunned by my greed, but still he pressed the star button. My god, the man was breathtakingly handsome, his bronze skin shimmering in the light like it was coated in a radiant glow. I blushed excitedly, puckering my lips to kiss him. But to my surprise, the jerk completely ignored me and narcissistically stared at himself in the mirror. His self absorbed smile made me sick. After an hour of mirror gazing, I couldn't take it anymore. I had never seen such a self obsessed man. The doctor pointed out that I'd selected this self respect trait. Of course he'd fall in love with himself. I broke down, unable to accept that my man had fallen in love with a mirror. He was supposed to love me, not himself! I clenched my teeth and offered more money. Reluctantly, the doctor pulled out a modification gun and made the adjustments. The clone immediately turned to look at me, but then Side Effects kicked in. When he picked me up, he complained about my weight and looked disgusted at my forehead wrinkles. Then without a word, he dropped me like I was nothing.

To make sure I'm not imagining it, I yank the curtain cord down, stretch it tight and pin it across the two walls. The next morning when I wake up, the rope, which was perfectly taught, is now clearly bent. That means the room really is closing in on me. Too scared to stay, I start packing, ready to leave. But the moment I step outside my room, I realize the stairwell is gone. I tell myself I must have remembered the direction wrong. So I turn down the hallway the other way. I walk for a while, but still can't find the stairs. That's when real fear hits me. Suddenly, a strange noise echoes through the entire hallway above me and the walls start shaking like crazy. Paintings on the walls wobble back and forth. I press my ear to the wall listening. I hear a heavy thumping sound like a giant heartbeat. In the next moment, the hallway lights start flickering non stop. That's when I finally noticed a hidden door at the end of the hallway. People keep walking out of it, dressed up, all holding instruments. I rush after them, trying to ask how to get out of this hotel, but no one even looks at me. Soon I noticed the restaurant servers are also going in and out of those doors. Then it hits me. Most kitchens have some kind of service exit. If I follow Them. Maybe I can find a way out. I decide to pretend to be a new waiter and slip into their line. I managed to walk with them straight into the back kitchen. The second I step inside, I'm stunned. Everything.

What the hell has he been through? Who cares? I was told to raise my hands and turn around. The next second, they pummeled me, even blasted me with a freezing high pressure water hose. Their faces were full of mockery and sneers. Then they moved in to forcibly cut my hair. And seeing the sharp blades in front of me, oh, painful memories flooded back. I remembered the torture I had endured in the camp and the anger I'd held back for so long. Broke free. In less than three seconds, I knocked them to the ground. I grabbed my bayonet back, ran out of the police station and snatched a motorcycle. On the way, I hit the throttle, ready to leave that hell behind. With squad cars hot on my tail, my escape felt almost effortless. What they didn't know was I used to be a Vietnam War veteran. Although I had once been honored by President Sasha, I couldn't find a job to save my life and ended up homeless. Here I was arrested by the sheriff for disturbing the peace. The sheriff's car rolled down the hill. I stopped, honked and mocked his driving. But the next second I flipped my bike. I had no choice but to ditch the motorcycle and dive into the dense woods. The sheriff, seething with rage, threatened, you're finished. You've gone as far as You're going. But I wasn't worried in the slightest because in the jungle, I knew 100 ways to survive. Soon the sheriff brought in men and police dog. They cornered me at the edge of a cliff with cops closing in behind me. I had no choice but to climb down one shaky step at a time. I teetered on the edge of death several time. Then out of nowhere, a helicopter appeared flying into the valley.

I stood there frowning while that despicable guy hid nearby, gleefully counting his stolen cash. Seeing that sleazy smirk, I felt a surge of anger. But before I could speak, creep became mesmerized by my eyebrows. He grabbed my hand, shoving a gold bracelet thicker than my waist into it. Did he really think a mere bracelet could buy me off? I planted a kiss right on his cheek, and just like that, I won his heart. I'll admit, the guy was surprisingly generous. He bought me an expensive dress and took me to an upscale club filled with ultra rich people. I knew right away he was up to something shady. I snapped my fingers at a server, ordered two lemonades, and casually handed one to the creep. He gulped it down in one go, and within seconds his stomach began to rumble. He bolted toward the restroom, and I followed closely behind. I didn't even need to search for him. His groans of agony LED me straight to him. Quietly, I picked up the belt he had taken off and fastened it back in place.

Returning to his cell, he somehow managed to keep the entire bed sheet with him. At midnight, he wrapped the basketball net tightly around his chest and stomach. Then he took the lethal pill. He tied one end of a rope made of a bed sheet to the ceiling and put the other end around his neck. He took a deep breath and jumped from a height. The rope immediately compressed his throat and he swayed unconscious. When the guards arrived on patrol in the morning, they thought he was dead. The doctor examined him and declared him dead. Then his body was put in a bag and taken out of the prison. On the way to the crematorium, the zipper of the body bag slowly began to move. A moment later, the man suddenly woke up and gasped for fresh air. He touched his chest, the basketball Net was still tightly tied. It was this net that distributed the pressure of the rope throughout his body, saving his life. When the train stopped on the way, he slowly opened the door and then he quietly got out, taking his steps toward freedom.

The driver focused on calming her and never saw the boy. Standing in the middle of the road, he jerked the wheel in fear, and the bus spun out of control, plunging off the highway. By nightfall, the girl crawled up from the ravine, staggering her way home along the empty road. Claire heard noise upstairs as she passed through the living room. She headed down to check, only to find a girl digging through the fridge. When the girl turned around, Claire froze. It was her daughter, Kamaya. But Kamaya had died in a crash four years ago. Don't be mad. I didn't do anything wrong. Something weird happened. Kamaya looked lost, as if her memory went back only an hour. No idea she had been gone for four whole years. Claire edged closer, trying to understand what she was seeing. Kamaya stared at her blankly, struggling to make sense of anything. After eating, she headed upstairs for a shower, unaware Claire was quietly following behind. Just as Claire reached for the bathroom door, Kamaya pulled it open from inside. Can you bring me my robe? Claire's heart nearly stopped. She hurried to Kamaya's room, frantically putting everything back in place, terrified the girl would notice something wasn't right. After handing over the robe, Claire went downstairs, still shaken and full of questions. She immediately called her Ex husband at first he dismissed it, convinced grief was twisting her mind. But when he got home and heard the shower running, he opened the door and saw a figure inside. What are you doing? Get out! Both stood frozen, unable to explain any of it. When Peter arrived, Claire told him the impossible Kamaya had returned. Peter stared stunned, glancing at her ex husband with emotions he couldn't hide. Claire introduced Peter as a doctor, hoping he could ask about the accident. But Kamaya remembered nothing, only that she woke up confused and had no idea where she was. She said she was exhausted and asked them to leave. Later that night, Rena came home and suddenly heard knocking coming from inside the wall. She stopped, listened, and heard two more taps. Startled, she approached slowly and pressed her ear against the wall, knocking twice in return. Moments later, an Echo tapped back. Her bedroom door opened and Kamaya stood there, making Rena stumble back in shock. Kamaya looked just as confused, staring at the girl who looked exactly like her own dead sister. Rena couldn't process it. She was the twin. So how had Kamaya suddenly changed so much? And this was only the beginning of the nightmare.

Confused and determined, she approached the program director, hoping to pick up some advanced culinary techniques. The director shook her head, explaining that the course was designed for aspiring professional chefs, and since Emily was a homemaker, learning to choose good eggs was enough. Unwilling to accept that, Emily insisted on joining the chef training program. When she stepped into the training kitchen, everyone else was slicing and dicing at lightning speed, while she hadn't even cut a single onion. The instructor couldn't stand by any longer. He showed her how to relax her wrist and demonstrated proper knife techniques. Emily absorbed every detail, and that night she practiced tirelessly at home. Onions stacked high on the counter, forming little mountains. Through relentless effort, she mastered the art of knife skills. Among all the trainees, she was the first to complete the chopping task. Her cooking rivaled anyone else in the room. Emily had discovered a new source of determination in life, pushing herself harder than ever to perfect her craft, determined to prove that a homemaker could be just as capable as a professional chef, her dedication paid off. She surpassed her peers and even earned the role of assistant instructor for the first time. She believed she had found the lifelong career she had been searching for.

Children would press their faces to the window, peering in and mocking her. My sister would angrily shoot them away. But today something unexpected happened. My mother suddenly stood up. My brother, who had the mental capacity of a 3 year old, was arrested for climbing a signal tower. Upon hearing this, my mother made a life changing decision. We all turned stunned. What? Get my coat, I understood. Immediately opened the car door and adjusted the seat. My sister helped our mother walk out the door. The car headed toward the police station and I couldn't shake the worry of what was to come. At the station, mother walked straight into the office. The officers were taken aback. They had never seen anyone so heavy. Jerry, I've come for my son. The police tried to refuse. My son, give me my son. Under her pressure, they released my brother immediately. As we stepped outside, a crowd had gathered by the entrance. They all mocked my mother, some even snapping photos. Those strange stairs seemed to swallow her dignity. But we felt something else, joy. It had been so long since she had protected us. She slowly climbed those steps and we silently watched as she entered the room she hadn't set foot in since our father's death. She lay down on that old bed and drifted into a deep sleep. The next morning, my brother rushed to wake Her. But no matter how hard he shook her, she didn't respond. Wake up, Mama. But mother never woke up. We lost her forever. The police issued a death certificate, but we didn't know how to bury her. If we carried her downstairs, she would become the town's laughing stock. Helpless, I stared at her, grieving in the basement. Returning upstairs, my sisters turned to me. We need your help. We carried out everything valuable from the house. I struck a match and set the entire house on fire, defending our mother's dignity.

When he came to, he was lying in a bathtub smeared with blood. A sharp, burning ache tore through his back and dread crawled up his spine. One glance in the mirror confirmed the nightmare. One of his kidneys was gone. Then it hit him. The only thing he consumed the previous night was a bottle of water handed to him by a stunning stranger right before he blacked out. There was no doubt in his mind she was the one who harvested his kidney. He tore open the suitcase under the bed only to discover that his gun had disappeared as well. Humiliation washed over him. And on the dresser sat a kidney donor consent form with a small note taped to it, thanks for the kidney. For an elite assassin, this wasn't just an insult, it was a declaration of war. He immediately called his partner. If he didn't retrieve that kidney within 10 hours, it would be transplanted into someone else. His partner arrived quickly and injected him with morphine. Once the agony dulled, Nick pieced the situation together. He remembered the moment he met the woman. There had been a waitress standing nearby. She had to know who the mystery girl was. Nick followed his memory back to the bar and tracked down the waitress from the previous night. But despite his calm questioning, she refused to give Up anything and instead called over the bar security. One of the guards grabbed him and prepared to throw him out.

When he felt ready, he went to Officer Dolores to apply for entry. She couldn't understand why he was even bothering, but Victor just smiled and said, you. You've got two steps. One red, one green, so I have a chance. New York. Fifty, fifty. He was telling her that as long as he kept trying, there was always a shot. Meanwhile, Frank was still keeping an eye on him. He figured Victor would eventually get desperate and do something illegal, giving him the perfect excuse to get rid of him. But that night, something unexpected happened. A food delivery guy named Enrique brought dinner to Victor. Why? Because Enrique had a crush on Officer Dolores, but was too shy to talk to her. He saw Victor talking to her every day and came up with a deal. Help me win her heart, and you'll never go hungry again. Victor agreed. From that moment on, he talked to Dolores every day. Not for his entry application, but to learn everything she liked. Then he'd report back to Enrique. In return, Enrique would reward him with meals from the VIP lounge. It was a win win for both. During this time, Victor's English improved even more, and he finally became fluent. Thanks to Victor's help, Enrique Learned everything about Dolores. And soon Dolores started noticing Enrique, too. Eventually, Enrique worked up the courage to ask her out. He showed up in his Best suit. Nervous but hopeful. When Dolores arrived, she extended her hand, signaling that she felt the same. They got married right there at the airport. It was simple but unforgettable. Travelers applauded, strangers cheered. That little wedding car became a symbol of love and hope for everyone who saw it. Watching it all, Victor realized he couldn't rely on Enrique forever. He needed a job, but no store in the airport would hire him. No ID, no phone number, nothing. At the last shop, the manager told him, even if I wanted to hire you, how could I contact you without a phone number? Victor took this as a sign of hope. He ran outside, memorized a public phone number, and gave it to the manager. The guy pretended he'd call. Victor waited all night. No food, no bathroom breaks. Just standing there, waiting. Eventually, the phone rang. The manager told him the job had already been filled and asked him not to sit outside the store anymore. Heartbroken, Victor wandered through the terminal, passing a crumbling wall. It was so poorly built that it cracked just by being touched. As an architect, he couldn't bear to look at it, so he started repairing it himself. It had been years, but his muscle memory kicked in. By morning, the wall looked brand new. Just then, a construction crew walked by.

Even the neighbor's dog strutted over and took a dump right on my lawn. And the neighbor's wife, she grabbed the fresh newspaper I just bought and used it to wipe the dog's butt like that was its only purpose. I asked her if she could at least return the paper. Instead, her husband demanded I bring him a new one every single day. Then there was this old man from the Card hall, who illegally parked his car for three straight days. I politely asked him to move it. He told me to move it for him. One time I even warned a little girl not to jump rope in the middle of the road.

A world that now belonged mostly to humankind and was shrinking for trolls by the day. But after their guttural exchange, the older trolls hatred refused to die, simmering like a volcano ready to erupt. He wanted to seize back everything humans had taken from troll lands, every mountain, every valley. When it became obvious talking was useless, the Prince had no choice but to settle things by force. Their roar shook the mountains as the two giants clashed in raw fury. Snow blasting outward like explosions. The elder troll consumed by rage. I slammed his foot into the ground and the thick ice shattered like glass beneath a hammer.

Inside the plastic shell, I found a tiny hidden camera. I hooked it up to my computer only to see the memory card locked behind a ridiculously complex password. But for someone like me, a top ear hacker with way too much free time, that was child's play. In under five minutes, the lock cracked open and the moment I found the videos, my whole world flipped upside down. Turns out the card was packed with my dad's darkest secrets, stuff I never would have believed even in my worst nightmares. The man I grew up admiring, the man I thought was unshakably righteous, was living a double life more twisted than any crime show I'd ever watch. It felt like the ground beneath me just vanished. Trying to wake him up, I posted the page online, but I didn't expect the internet to explode like a bomb. Within hours, my dad's face was everywhere. Memes, reaction videos, talk shows tearing him apart. When he found out, he turned red like a volcano about to erupt. Threw me out without a second thought. With no home, no money and zero dignity left, I took the only job I could find at a sketchy internet cafe. The place smelled like instant noodles and broken dreams. I payday. The owner tried to scam me, thinking I was just another desperate kid he could step on. Ad move. I pulled out my phone, hit one command and the entire cafe went dark. Greens, routers, everything. His face went from smug to terrified in 2 seconds flat. Jobless again, I dug the trash cans behind supermarkets, my stomach louder than my pride. That's when finally threw me a bone. A sleek black envelope between old boxes. Inside was an invitation to an elite underground hacking tournament, the kind you only hear whispers about online. I cleaned myself up clothes at a thrift shop and rushed to the venue. The stage lights were blinding, buzzing like a swarm of electric bees. The announcer strutted out bragging that their firewall was bulletproof and that backing the third tier would earn a life changing one million dollar prize. And let me tell you, the moment I heard that number, every neuron in my brain lit up. For the first time in weeks, I felt alive again.

We meet a woman standing quietly beside the tank, her breath hugging the glass. As tension thickens the air, she brushes her fingertips across the armrest. And a massive 10 foot shark drifts downward like a ghost emerging from the abyss. Only then do we realize it being used as living bait for something far more terrifying, lurking in the shadows below. And in the very next heart, a colossal predator surges out of the deep. It's silhouette swallowing the light for a split second. Flash forward to a future era. Or a cutting edge tech operation has achieved the impossible. Resurrecting dinosaurs through advanced genetic manipulation. That reshapes the boundaries of science. He purchased a remote island and populated with every resurrected species they create. Transforming it into the reborn Jurassic Park. A spectacle that blends wonder with danger. The island quickly skyrocket into one of the world's most elite vacation hot spots, drawing thrill seekers from every corner of the globe. But after two decades of all this operation, the excitement among visitors begins to fade. Placed by board reviews and dwindling attendance. Gentle ant eating dinosaurs, once the stars of the park. And no longer pull in the crowds, no matter how majestic they appear. Determined to turn things around, Netflix division rolls out a radical break. Splicing together DNA from various modern animals. Prehistoric genomes. Engineering brutal new hybrids. Designed to drill paying guests and restore the park's fading Legend. Once the rumor leaks out, investors flood in like sharks to blood, eager for profit. Everyone wants a front row seat because the park's first genetically engineered APEX predator is about to make its grand debut with unprecedented unfair. But no one realizes that this lap acted monster is moments away from unleashing absolute chaos across the far beyond anything they plan for, I guarantee. The Indominous Rex appears without a hitch. Park's owner shows up personally for inspection, but the second he steps into the control room, he freezes, staring at enormous fractures tearing across the reinforced glass, each crack hinting at unimaginable strength.

By the time I walked into the lobby, I already looked like just another office worker lost in the morning rush, blending in with the chatter, the buzzing phones and the clacking heels echoing through the marble floor. Moving with the flow, I slipped close enough to snag the president's signature without even breaking stride. Then I headed to the parking deck, peeled off the suit and tossed the tie straight into a trash bin, watching it disappear like the last trace of my old identity. Seconds later, I looked like a maintenance tech late for a shift. I slipped into the surveillance room, snapped a shot of the guard, printed it out before he even understood why I pointed something at him. When he stepped closer to question me, I stole his badge, reported a fake disturbance and cuffed him with the confidence of someone who'd been doing this for years. The incoming guards saw the psychiatric patient tag and hauled him away without hesitation. Perfect. Another obstacle gone. I planted a virus in the system, signaled my team and strolled out like a man who just fixed a loose cable. Meanwhile, my partner kept sneezing, milking the perfume allergy, excuse you so hard you think he was auditioning for a drama award. The guards. Bought it and escorted him out. Lisa took her chance. She slipped off her hairpin, a delicate looking piece that was anything but delicate, and placed it on his shoulder with a graceful move that almost looked romantic. Used it to crack open the machine, retrieve the billion dollar data chip and stash it on a playing card like it was nothing more than a street trick panel. Back on to relax, you'd never know anything happened. But then the supervisor paused, squinted and called the guards for a full sweep. we're stuck with the one question we never planned a good answer for, how the hell are we getting out this time?

She slashed her own nightgown dozens of times, drawing nearly 2 pounds of her own blood. Half of it dripped across the floor near the sofa. A few drops scattered by the doorway. The rest she diluted with water, poured over the shredded nightgown. Once everything was in place, Veronica donned the bloodied nightgown and lay on the sofa motionless, as if lifeless. After a while, Mister Howard quietly entered the room, his shoes pressed into the blood on the floor. When he saw the woman drenched in blood on the sofa, his face turned ghostly white. He reached for his phone to call the police, but then remembered he had been spying on her. Panic overtook him and he bolted from the room. Once her plan had succeeded, Veronica stood, set up her camera and captured photos of her death. She meticulously cleaned every trace of blood, making it appear as if Mister Howard had tried to erase the evidence. After finishing, she left calmly. But Mister Howard wasn't a fool either. He quickly summoned two other tenants, pretending he wanted to show them the room so he could later claim he had nothing to do with the incident. Then a piercing scream shattered the silence. He raced toward the source.

Back at home, he felt his body expanding, muscles swelling so much his clothes could barely contain him. The next day at school, when a friend asked him to fix her bike, he accidentally bent the tire with his bare hands. A lightning like energy surged through his veins. He spent a fortune crafting a hammer modeled after Thor's. He threw it into the air, trying to call it back. No matter how many times he tried, the hammer never returned. Descending the mountain, he eventually found it lying 3 kilometers away near a quiet river. He ran to Granny Moore's shop. Showing her the hammer, he examined it carefully. Thor's hammer is the mightiest weapon of the ancient world, she said. No ordinary blacksmith could ever forge it. She told Liam about an eternal flame burning for centuries that might help him forge the true hammer. Suddenly, Liam noticed someone spying on them from outside. Granny Moira instructed him, meet me on the mountain at sunrise. She vanished. Back home, Liam realized his brother still hadn't returned. Searching through the forest, he discovered a strange burning flame. At the same moment, Granny Moira faced the mysterious man, Raven, the one who had been watching them. Sensing danger, she bowed her head, kissed her necklace, and prepared for the coming storm.

Clara frowned, confused. But I don't have a boyfriend. I've been single for years. Next day, she returned to the hospital. A strange Mark had appeared on her back. Worried, she asked, could this be cancer? Doctor Bennett studied it carefully and laughed. It's nothing serious. It's a love bite, a Mark from someone kissing you. Tell your boyfriend to be more careful next time. Clara froze, shaking her head. But I haven't been intimate with any man in two years. Doctor Bennett felt a creeping unease, wondered if she had taken a sedative or some other drug. He carefully collected a few strands of her hair for testing. Before the results returned, Clara appeared at the hospital again, trembling with fear. Doctor, I'm bleeding down there. Doctor Bennett quickly performed an ultrasound. When the report came back, everyone was stunned. It showed that Clara had recently had a miscarriage. Clara's face went pale. But I've never been with any man. Doctor Bennett was completely baffled.

He could manipulate people's minds, bending their perception of reality to his will. One day he pointed his hand like a gun at a woman and fired. The woman screamed, clutching her stomach as though she'd been shot, blood spilling from her wound. But in reality, nothing had happened. It was all just an illusion Rick the boy played on her mind. The boy's powers didn't stop there. He walked into a bank, nonchalantly handed a cheque for $0 to the cashier and calmly requested to cash it. The cashier looked at the cheque in disbelief, seeing the huge amount of $0 written on it. She immediately took it to her senior officer. But the boy remained composed. You made a mistake, he said confidently. It's a five thousand dollar check. When the cashier looked again, the numbers had changed and the check indeed read 5 thousand dollars. She quickly apologized, cashed the check and handed him the money. But as he stepped out of the bank with his cash, the check suddenly turned into a newspaper right in the cashier's hands. Panic surged through her as she realized she'd been tricked. She called the police, reporting the boy's bizarre actions. Meanwhile, the boy had already jumped into his partner's car, escaping the scene. As the police gave chase, the weather inexplicably turned freezing cold. Snowballs rained down on the police vehicle, making it lose control. The car swerved violently, eventually flipping Over and sliding down the highway until it crashed into a gas station. The moment the car stopped, the weather returned to normal, as though nothing had happened that night. When the boy returned home, he couldn't help but think of his mother. She had been in a coma for years, and despite all his incredible powers, he had never been able to save her. He decided to try again. With a deep breath, he focused his mind on her, willing her to wake. For a brief moment, her eyes fluttered open and she seemed alive again. But it was only for a moment. Soon the sickness returned and she slipped back into her coma, as fragile as ever, tears welled in the boy's eyes. No matter how much power he had, there was one thing he couldn't change. He couldn't save his mother.

Determined to reach his ultimate goal of 15 million points, he even began eating other people's leftovers. Even when the most annoying and pointless ads appeared, he stubbornly watched every single one, pushing through with sheer willpower and effort until he finally reached 15 million points.

Straight to the center of the stage he went. The judges were ready for his performance. As soon as the music played, he started dancing wildly, leaving the entire audience stunned by his over the top movements. Suddenly, he grabbed a broken glass from the floor, placed it against his neck and began shouting loudly about the frustrations of daily life. The judges, thinking it was all part of his act, remained unfazed. The man was surprised, but the judges began praising him profusely, offering him his own show, a gig that would be twice a week, far better than riding a bike every day.

I asked him what he was doing there. I'm waiting for my mommy, said. When I get lost, she told me to stay put and she'll find me.

Seeing their heartache, I didn't feel right interrupting, so I took Kenny back to my antique shop. The next day, I went to Kenny's house alone. When I explained why I was there, Kenny's father accused me of being a scammer. But his mother received me normally. Kenny said you told him if he got lost, he should stay where he is and you'd come for him. Oh, my God. He also noticed the spider ornament on your weird mirror. He said you bought the same one for him at the fair. Kenny, my boy, I can help you talk to him if you're ready. It might be good for you. No, I can't. Please leave. After Kenny's mother left, I had no choice but to leave a business card and walk away. The next day, Kenny's father came to find me, furious. He warned me to stay away from his wife. He said, since you left yesterday, she hasn't stopped crying. I've seen enough con artists like with That he turned and walked away. Not long after, Dylan showed up at the shop. He said he wasn't going near the tracks anymore because his mom claimed Kenny didn't exist. He was just a figment of Dylan's imagination. Kenny overheard this and his anger was explosive. He smashed a few light bulbs and stormed out. I quickly chased after him and found him huddled in a corner. Do you understand what it means to die? My turtle died one day. I woke up and it was just gone. I looked everywhere for it and dad told me it died. He threw it away. I never even got to say goodbye.

Later, she acted as if she were taking a shower, but the three robbers trailed her closely, not giving them any opportunity to exploit her. She slipped back into the living room and switched on the TV.

The students holding set a finished early and when one of them walked up to turn in his paper, Emily smoothly swapped it with her own. So now she held the set B version. But worst part, Only 10 minutes were left. She had to blast through every last set B question and somehow feed the answers to the other terrified set B students. Emily snapped into speed mode, solving problem after problem while her teammates waited, sweaty palms, racing hearts. And disaster struck. A student's pencil snapped clean in half at the same moment the teacher announced they had only five minutes left. Luckily, Emily scribbled down her final answer right then and instantly launched into finger signals, firing answers like Morse code. This was the moment every set B student had been praying for. When the final bell rang, Emily pushed out the last sequence of answers in a desperate burst. The teacher kept shouting about the remaining seconds. Students wrote like their lives depended on it. Then he walked straight to Emily, placed his hand on her answer sheet and told her to stop writing. But by that point, Emily had already delivered the answer to the final question. One by one, everyone's heartbeat slowly returned to normal. But peace didn't last long because soon the results came out and this exam would be remembered as the toughest final in the country's history.

Then he turned back, calm as ever, telling their daughter to grab rescue gear. She dashed into the cabin, lifted a cushion and, boom, found a gun like it was no big deal, no time to panic. She flipped the opposite seat open, grabbed a towel instead, shut the box and headed back out. Mom was already pulled aboard. Soaked and shivering, the girl wrapped the towel around her, relieved she was okay, then trudged back, ready to crash for the night. But the universe had other plans. Shouts jolted her away. She peeked outside and froze. Pirates were climbing on board. She slipped back inside, cracked open the storage again, armed herself. But the moment she checked outside, Mom's boyfriend was overboard and mom had vanished. Heart pounding, she hid in the corner. Pirates burst in, scanned the room, thankfully didn't spot her and walked off. She exhaled to Jawa. Smoke leaked through the doorway. She rushed out and the cabin was a fire pit. One extinguisher, one terrified kid. She fought flames till sunrise. The fire died, but the ship looked like it survived a war. Curled up with exhaustion, she found a photo and her world flipped. Mom's sweet boyfriend was one of those pirates from last night. So she made up her mind, find mom, save mom. On deck, she checked what still worked while packing ropes. She almost screamed. The boyfriend was Tangled in them, apparently marinating in seawater all night. She dragged him up, tied him tight, slipped a knife into her waistband, patch the hole with tape, raised a backup sail like a pro. When he woke, acting all gentle and concerned, she played along, even let him steer, because she needed to know what this guy was really planning.

Even though she endured the daily pain of trying to tame her hair, her natural curls stilts up like a wild bird's nest. Until one day she spotted a girl with spring like curls, shiny, soft, perfect enough for a shampoo commercial. She rushed over, asking how she did it. The girl claimed it came from a magic straightening treat sold only in the city, and one tiny bottle cost $200. She dashed home, tore her entire room up, but couldn't scrape together even half the money. Watching those sleek haired girls laugh, lay close to the boy she adored. She fell into deep frustration. Then luck finally showed up. The hair salon owner appeared, who happened to be the mother of the new student in her class. From that day on, the girl became unbelievably attentive to the new kid. She followed him home, claiming to be his best friend. His mother saw everything but said nothing, only smiled and told her if she took care of him until his cast came off, she'd straighten her hair for free. The girl's eyes lit up instantly and she agreed on the spot. Someone who was always late suddenly woke up early every morning, walking the boy to school. Faith. During breaks, she kept folding paper crane all for the boy. She Had a crush on the new student. Witnessed it all, yet quietly kept it to himself. From then on, he left school early every day. She ran after him, asking why. He pulled out a small jar filled with every crane he secretly folded for her. Wanted to help finish her confession. A month later, his mother kept her promise. When the girl walked in with silky, waterfall straight hair, the whole class was stunned. But when she finally asked her crush to meet her for a confession, the face that appeared in her mind wasn't his. It was the awkward, gentle new boy who had been there all along.

From Lucy's perspective, all of human science is just a convenient little system invented by hairless monkeys. Those top tier professors standing before her, not one had the slightest clue what was happening. The same scholars who usually act all high and mighty were now frozen, staring like kids who saw Wi-Fi for the first time. Lucy drops the bomb. Time is the ultimate boss of the universe. When matter moves close to infinite speed, it simply ceases to exist. Only time proves anything is real. While she's casually explaining the meaning of existence, a bunch of gangsters kicked down the door. They want their stash of CPH for back, and they're here to stop Lucy from reaching Godma. Bullets start flying like fireworks on discount. Lucy calmly tells the professors to dissolve all the pH four and inject it straight into her veins. No! Sips full shot. This miracle drug is something the human body only produces a tiny drop of around week 6 of pregnancy. It's raw power. Blast open brain potential. As the liquid surges in, her body turns into a nuclear battery. Brain power skyrockets to 70%. Dark, chaotic material leaks from her skin, crawling like living tar, reshaping everything around. Lucy searches for a way to dump her knowledge into humanity's hard drive. At 80% development, she drags everyone into a blinding white space. In the void, she casually summons a supercomputer from thin air, a fourth dimension. GPU Flex at 90%. Space becomes optional. She teleports to a square in Paris like it's Uber Eats delivery. Now she's basically a god with Wi-Fi. One hand wave. Time freezes, fast forwards, rewinds like bad editor. The city rolls back to the industrial age, then further to lava, oceans, day one, earth. Finally, she touches fingers with the very first woman, another Lucy. And boom! Her mind travels to the birth of the universe. Rain level 100%. Full completion. The gang boss breaks through and fires, but her cells scatter like cosmic glitter and she vanishes in a nebula. Flash! The sheriff guns the guy down. From the supercomputer Lucy leaves behind, a USB drive grows out like a tech tree fruit inside the secrets of the universe. The sheriff whispers, where is she? A phone lights up with one message. Lucy doesn't need a body anymore. She is the universe now.

My parents freaked out and smuggled me to a tiny village far away from the world. They wrapped me in gauze glasses and a hat like I was a cursed treasure. But inside I was miserable. So I went to a shrink and complained about my curse. He insisted on seeing my face. Big mistake. He dropped dead instantly. That's when I started hating this killer level beauty. All I ever wanted was to look normal. Then I spotted a brick and boom, genius idea. I asked my buddy to smash my face a bit, just enough. But he was texting his girlfriend like nothing else mattered. I snapped, slapped his phone across the street. Wish granted, phone gone, face untouched. So I locked myself at home in frustration. My friend later introduced me to a girl. We sat down. Then boom, her ex showed up to start trouble. He said I was too ugly to show my face. I kept quiet. He slammed me onto the table like a wrestling match. Only when the waiter pulled him away did I get to breathe. The girl called me a coward and walked away without looking back. Heart shattered, I went to the river ready to end this cursed look. Then an angel like girl appeared and talked me down. We became close, really close. I plan to confess to her, but then I noticed that heart monitor on her chest. She was sick. I froze. Words died in my throat. She sensed my sadness and dragged me to the school dance. And guess who I met again? That same jerk. He ripped off my mask in front of everyone. People stared in shock and she collapsed. Police rushed in and seeing me again at a death scene rested. She was taken away in an ambulance. By the time I got out, she was on the edge of life. She asked to see me one last time. I removed everything hiding my face and lay beside her quietly. She opened her eyes and just like that, I lost the only girl who saw me beyond my curse.

Right then, a ridiculous spark lit up in my head. I should be an Olympian. So I limped downstairs, threw on my backpack like a champion, ready to conquer the world. Mom stopped me, handed me a tiny box, told me it was for all the medals I'd win one day. I walked out smiling like a hero while she shook her head, knowing trouble was coming. At the bus stop, dad waited as usual. Later, he drove me home, still clueless about the fire in my chest because that Olympic dream, I wasn't letting it go. The moment my leg brace came off, I dove into every sport on earth. Weightlifting, the bar crushed me. Instead, pole vaulting, the pole snapped before I even left the ground. That metal box became a cemetery of broken goggles instead of gold. But giving up was never in my dictionary until javelin day when I launched it straight through the living room window. Dad finally exploded. Eddie, you are not an athlete. Just like that, my fantasy shattered. He dragged me to a construction site, saying brick laying was more realistic than daydreams. But my eyes locked onto a distant ski slope. A new idea hit even harder, The Winter Olympics. I strapped on skis and trained like a man possessed. 10 long years, blood, bruises, dozens of medals, finally, national team tryouts. But I crashed, knocked over a teammate. And the coach shot me down cold. You don't belong here. Dream crushed again. I watched ski jumps on the TV, fighting the ache in my chest, packed my bag, walked out to chase it one more time at the bus stop. Dad was there, same place as before. But this time he didn't stop me. He just said softly, go get it. I climbed the towering ramp, flew down the track, launched myself skyward and landed clean. I made it. I earned my spot at the Winter Olympics. Mom placed that old metal box back in my hands. On the Olympic stage, I soared like an eagle off a ramp dozens of meters high, wind screaming past my ears. And finally, I lived the dream.

As he watched his new mother lose control right in front of him, Mike instantly said that something was horribly wrong, and he was right. When they brought him home, his mother roughly threw him onto the couch and yelled at her husband to feed him. Fortunately, his father seemed like a kind man. But then the father noticed the baby food had expired six months ago. The mother shrugged it off, saying it doesn't matter. No one dies from expired food. The father hesitated, but eventually allowed himself to believe she might be right. After all, a baby wouldn't notice the taste anyway. Right then the police showed up at the door. The father quickly wiped the child's mouth and the mother sprayed air freshener hide the smell of smoke lingering in the home. The officer said they had received a report of child abuse and had already called in a child Protection specialist. The mother angrily denied everything, but the police revealed the baby had been taken to the hospital before, where a doctor found signs of possible physical abuse, which is why the report was filed without Another word, the officers stepped inside. The parents faces turned pale as the specialist began preparing to examine the infant. Moving his clothes, the father shouted, do you seriously think we hurt our own child? Then he pulled out a business card and handed it to the police. It turned out the father worked for a child welfare agency. Then the officers noticed a family photo on the wall.

And tonight, one of them chose to walk straight into a jail cell. As if she were sleepwalking through danger. This woman, feared across continents, let herself get arrested on purpose. She acted drunk, slurring her words, stumbling for effect, all just to infiltrate the prison and hunt down an international drug kingpin hiding behind bars. When the guard handed her a sobering drink, checked the cell, and left the lights dimmed, instantly her eyes snapped open. She rose with lethal precision, slid a hairpin from her bun, peeled off her wig, and retrieve the stealth suit hidden beneath her civilian clothes. With a flick of the wrist, she picked the lock like she'd done it a thousand times. Meanwhile, the guard settled comfortably in the surveillance room, newspaper in hand, never noticing the cell camera. Slowly turning away from her corner, she pocketed the metal spoon from the drink, walked to the water dispenser, filled a flimsy cup halfway, and slipped to the electrical control room. There he jammed the spoon into the fuse box, bit a hole into the cup, placed it over the spoon, and started a 30 second countdown. Then she pried open a vent and disappeared into the ductwork. Water dripped building toward disaster. She sprinted through Cell Block A toward the exhaust fan that connected to Block B. When the final drop slid off the cup, the fuse blew, plunging the facility into Chaos officers rushed toward the electrical room. The moment the fan blades slowed to a stop, she slid through the opening like a shadow. The guards, clueless, picked up the cup and threw it away without a second glance. She crawled out into a bathroom vent, opened the door, and crept up behind the Zone B guard. One strike, clean and silent, knocked him out cold. Using his body as cover, she tricked the surveillance team into unlocking the Sector B gate. Inside, the infamous drug lord stared at her. Who are you? A single gunshot echoed. Officers stormed the area and found the unconscious guard holding his own pistol, utterly confused. By then she was already back in the vents, altering her escape route. A detective, sensing something off about the drunk woman, ran to her cell, only to find her lying there again, perfectly still, as though she had never left.

When it touched my skin, it felt sticky and carried a strange scent, like coconut milk mixed with jam. In that moment, I was sure the world was ending. So I decided to dig an underground shelf to keep my family safe. Three days earlier, I was working on a construction site when a deafening boom echoed overhead. I looked up, and the sky was swarming with crows. The unsettling part was I was the only one who could see that terrifying scene. My coworkers couldn't see the birds or hear the thunder. After that, the same storm nightmare kept replaying every night. And as time passed, my mental state crumbled. I became absolutely convinced that doomsday was closing in. Once I prepared myself mentally, I chose to turn the backyard basement into a survival bunker. I estimated the whole project would cost over $60,000. I knew my wife would never agree, so I began hiding money in secret without telling her. I returned home. I saw my daughter staring at a strange shadow outside the window. My heart dropped. I grabbed her and pulled her away. But the figure didn't leave. Instead, it started pounding on the door like a maniac. The whole house shook. In the next instant, something surreal happened. Every piece of furniture began floating into the air. I struggled to wake up and realized it was another nightmare when I noticed the damp marks on the Bed. I knew I couldn't stall any longer. I had to build the shelter right away. The next morning, I secretly took out a loan behind my wife's back, went to the hardware store and bought gas masks, then brought my daughter to the supermarket and stocked up on tons of nonperishable food. To avoid raising suspicion, I hid everything in the bunker. The weekend came. I bribed a coworker to drive an excavator into my backyard. We dug a 30 foot pit next to the basement, then lowered the container inside. Right at that moment, my wife came home. When she saw what I had done, she exploded with anger. He thought I had lost my mind. I didn't bother explaining. No one would have believed me anyway. That night, my body suddenly began shaking uncontrollably. My wife woke up in a panic and reached for her phone to call an ambulance. But I resisted the pain and stopped her. To keep her from worrying, I told her everything I had been seeing in my dreams. I didn't know whether I had gone insane or if the end of the world was truly approaching. But I had only one duty left protect my family. Then one afternoon, I saw my daughter running straight into the road. I sprinted after her, and just as I reached out, a massive swarm of bats dove toward us. Another nightmare. But this time I didn't wake up on my own. My wife shook Me away, because the real storm had finally arrived.

Jason didn't think. He dove in like a hero. But when he dragged her ashore, he realized she wasn't a woman at all, just a mannequin doll. He stood there laughing and crying like life was trolling. He and his coworker continued toward the mall, Jason casually towel drying the doll like it was totally normal. Along the way, he picked up a necklace and boom, the doll turned into a breathing girl. But the moment he let go of the necklace, she froze back into plastic. At the workshop, Jason stared at her perfect face, secretly wishing she could be real. He checked to make sure no one was watching and stole a quick kiss like a guilty teenager. Then he resumed stocking shelves, absent mindedly removing the necklace. And Jesse, asleep for 1,000 years, suddenly woke up, sneezed and scared Jason flat onto the floor. She lit up with joy when she saw him because he looked exactly like her prince from centuries ago. Just then, the truck workers stepped inside. Jesse froze like a statue. Instantly, they confirmed the doll wasn't damaged and walked out, unaware of the magic they missed. Jesse's stomach growled loudly, so Jason took her out for food. She gazed at the modern world like a Newborn tourist and even ate the wrapper along with the meal. Jason taught her how to eat properly, then took her dancing like it Was prom night. Later, he brought her home and the two shared a magical night together. Next morning, Jason went downstairs to make breakfast. Jesse spotted a mirror, mesmerized and grabbed a random piece of jewelry without noticing it was the wrong necklace. Jason's mom saw her son humming while cooking, immediately assuming he'd fallen in love. Did you sleep with that girl? Jason blushed and denied it, heading upstairs with food only to find Jesse stiff and lifeless again. Panicked, he tossed the doll onto the bed. Mom heard the noise, rushed in and witnessed the scene. Now convinced her son had a unique hobby, Jason's mind shattered. Was last night real or just a dream too beautiful to exist?

What, so you don't wanna pay me like a star player, but you want star player trade compensation? Yeah, it's pretty nice getting to do whatever the we want. Okay, uh, everybody, I'm one of the best running backs in the league. I'm only 24 years old, and my ankles not actually hurt. It's just a leverage play. So I'm healthy. Who wants me? Oh, come on. Are you seriously telling me none of you have any interest? Kansas City, you drafted Clyde Edwards Helaire over me, and now you can have me anyway. Don't you want the do over? Yeah, see, the thing is, we whiffed on that pick and then still made two Super Bowls in three years while winning one of them. So all that really taught us was not to value running backs. Plus, they have Isaiah Pacheco, and he runs like he hates the ground. This is true. Miami, your starter is 31 year old Raheem Moster. You don't want an upgrade? Any running back on the planet could succeed in our offense. It's pretty easy to find running lanes when every defender is worried about Two human espresso shots like Tyreek and Waddle. Thanks for Tyreek, by the way. You're welcome. We might be able to use you. I'm sold. Make an offer. Although the last time we traded for a Colt's running back, he got run over by a jet ski. I'm a little more concerned now, but still, we could trade for you. No. Come on. You don't need him. I know we don't need beat him, but imagine him behind the best offensive line in the league. Plus, with him and DeAndre, we have the Taylor Swift backfield. You know, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Look what you made me do. I'm sensing some bad blood. Eh, shake it off, Jonathan. You belong with me. We have a ton of cap space, extra draft picks, no star running back, and a quarterback that needs as many weapons as possible. We'll be in touch. Sounds good. You know the most likely scenario is we don't get a good offer and we have to suffer with each other for one more season, right? I know. But after that, we are never, ever, ever getting back together. Yeah, I got it.

The friend joked that some husbands act gentle before marriage but hide the darkest secrets afterward, even teasing about sneaking into Tom's private lair. Tom brushed it off, but she wouldn't let the topic die. Days later, the friend vanished. Her family called the police, but no trace was ever found.

As bottles were gathered, the massive plastic bucket floated closer, carrying with it a faint but vital hope. Women and children crawled in first, the others squeezing in after them until only Jack remained outside. He sacrificed his own escape because someone had to stay behind to seal the lid, leaving all remaining hope to his son. When he twisted it shut, their screams echoed inside, but he never opened it again. Pressed against the bucket, Jack felt his final moments with his child, moments cut short when underground water burst through the pipes and flooded the deep pit, dragging him helplessly to the bottom. But the people inside the bucket weren't safe either. The building above collapsed, sending the bucket plunging with them into darkness until its buoyancy tore it free from the falling debris. Electrical cables blocked their ascent, and they pounded desperately against the walls. At last, their effort paid off. The bucket broke loose and shot upward, only to slam into a steel pipe that pierced straight through it. And in that moment, their only chance of survival depended on every one of them acting together.

He tossed the money back and walked off without a second glance, only to sneak back moments later and pick it up once the disappointed girl had closed the door.

When she warned she'd file a complaint if he refused, he took a sip, only to feel a foul, fishy stench explode in his mouth. Panicked, he downed an entire bottle of mineral water, but the odor refused to fade. Then the real nightmare began. Her orders came every single day, and no matter how he tried to redirect them, the system insisted no other couriers were available.

Seeing this, Hans dove into the locks and soon the first finalist was determined. Out of eight contestants, only four would make it through. After two intense rounds, Hans nervously secured the fourth spot in the finals. But this round would push his expectations to the limit. The organizers provided four saves that seemed ordinary, but each was lined with sponge and contestants only had five minutes. To crack them, they had to stay close to the safes to barely hear the faint sounds. Curly calmly cracked the first safe while Hans Palms were sweating with urgency. He gave it his all and only lagged behind by five seconds, securing his spot in the final round. This performance stunned the audience. Curly was the reigning lock king and no one expected anyone to match his time. Judges announced the final round, two titanium vault doors built to Royal Bank standards. The contestants had just three minutes to crack them. If time ran out without success, no champion.

When he noticed an employee slip into the office, he rushed to put on his headphones, eager to eavesdrop, only to hear something that ignited a fury inside him. Jean, a single mother drowning in work, had asked the manager for just one day off so she could spend a quiet weekend with her kids. Even that modest request was coldly denied. Watching the scene unfold on his monitor, he clenched his jaw, and when the manager typed his password, he memorized it on the spot. That night, he sneaked back into the office, powered up the manager's computer, found the scheduling system, and secretly approved a day off for Jean. It was his seventh day working there, although the police once broadcast updates about his disappearance non stop, now the world had gone silent, as if his case no longer mattered. The quiet gave him a strange sense of relief. He was finally free to move. Before sunrise, he rode his bike into the empty streets and called his friend Liv, hoping to secure forged documents for a fresh start. But the call was answered by Liv's girlfriend instead, who told him Liv was out of the country.

When they reached the street, chaos had erupted. People were fleeing as if the world were ending. Unaware of the danger closing in, he decided to get his family out of the area. But halfway down the road, the neighbors who had escaped earlier suddenly returned, deepening the sense of dread. A gridlocked highway brought them to a halt, and that's when he saw it. The military had sealed off every route leading out of the city. Helicopters hovered above evacuating citizens, while the radio insisted everyone return home. Thinking it was some kind of viral emergency, they hesitated until a rock crashed onto their hood and more stones rained down from the cliff. A thunderous roar followed as two fighter jets streaked toward the city and dropped their bombs. Frozen in horror, he realized that obeying the radio would have meant instant death. A wall of flames swallowed the city, leaving no survivors, and then the jets turned toward them, revealing the unthinkable the military intended to eliminate everyone. With no time to think, the family scattered, and his wife spotted a water tank on the Hillside, urging them to climb. Moments later, the jets launched a second strike, obliterating the place they had just escaped.

The man quickly steps on it and sprints forward like crazy. But what he didn't expect was that right after bursting through the iron gate, two spiked bamboo panels come swinging at him.

If the gate drops, the man would be skewered into a pancake. The man rips down the portrait, then quickly grabs the stick from the painting, using it to prop up the iron gate. After successfully escaping danger, he points accusingly at the bamboo panels that nearly killed him, wagging his finger in frustration. Seeing the token right in front of him, the man reaches out to grab it, but gets forced back by a row of falling spikes, and the stone beast guarding the token attacks him too. Luckily, the man has quick reflexes. The stone beast approaches him rapidly. Seeing this, the man has no choice but to run circles around the incense burner with the beast. The beast can't catch him.

One soldier stepped forward and cautiously poked it with his spear. Before anyone could react, a terrifying creature exploded from the earth. Its enormous wings flapped with overwhelming force, instantly swallowing the entire camp in a storm of dust. Strangely, it didn't attack anyone. Instead, it swooped down, snatched an old man from the ground, and shot straight up into the sky. The soldiers launched one last desperate attack, but with a single spell. Tens of thousands of arrows turned to ash in midair. Rescued old man was completely bewildered. He didn't recognize this massive creature at all, and he had no idea why it had saved him. Then the creature pointed to the coat it was wearing.

He knew immediately it wasn't human, but the tiny creature looked so helpless and pitiful that he couldn't bring himself to leave it behind. An exorcist soon arrived and demanded the child be killed, claiming it was a spawn of ONIC chaos and keeping it in the mortal world would bring untold disaster. But Jack stood his ground. Even if the child was a demon, whether it would grow up good or evil dependent entirely on how it was raised. Seeing Jack's unwavering resolve, an immortal appeared and offered to take the child to Mount Kuan Loon for training, a land of peace far removed from worldly conflict. Only then did Jack agree. Before parting, he gave the child a name, LA Gen Z. Who could have imagined that even after 20 years, LA Gen Z would never forget that single act of kindness? When the tyrant Learned that Jack had been rescued, he flew into a furious rage and immediately sent a massive army toward the village. Wave after wave of soldiers flooded into the valley, an unstoppable force of destruction. The village chief knew this time there was no way out. But just as both sides were about to collide, that familiar figure appeared once again in the sky.

Or her. Anything that failed to kill her only forced to fire fierce enough to burn down Kingdom. Amyla had finally exposed the truth, a secret buried under centuries of royal lies. The ancient king who once slew the primordial dragon never honored his sacred oath. Instead of offering his own daughter as tribute, twisted the royal bloodline into a tool. Innocent girls were branded with royal blood and delivered as living sacrifices to the corrupted Neathoria. Even after Amy revealed everything, her rival refused to believe any of it. Backed into a corner, Amy drew her sword and the dragon answered with a blast of fire that threw her into the freezing lake. Warrior and Beast fell out wounded, neither gaining an edge. So poked and shaking, Amy reached for her sword, but the dragon struck, slamming her into the dirt. Pain tore through her, yet she didn't yield. She ripped a dagger from her strap and stabbed up, blinding one of the monster's venom filled eyes. Dragging herself across the ground, he grabbed her sword and beat again. She shouted that she wasn't a royal descendant, but the dragon trusted instinct, the same forged royal blood forced on every sacrifice girl for generations. Out of options, Amy drove her dagger into its leg and pulled herself for seconds from collapsing. She stepped back, realizing neither of them were true enemies. They were victims of the same ancient lie. So She lured the dragon toward a massive boulder, haunting it until it unleashed another inferno, one that rebounded in square the feature with its own fire. The monster fell screaming. Unable to keep fighting, Amy approached, opened her hand and revealed the truth that mattered. Every sacrifice carried the same forged emblem of Aria's royal family. For ages, the dragon had been tricked into consuming lies. She raised her sword but didn't strike. She spared it, knowing the only way to destroy the kingdom to set was together. Amy walked to the glowing pond, gathered bright fireflies and used their light to mend the dragon's wounds. Then she returned to the castle alone or a wedding was underway. Another ritual of deceit she didn't explain. He gave them one final chance to run. Queen Laugh convinced her guard and our guarantee victory. Then everything changed. A massive dragon dropped onto the battlements with a roar that shook the sky. It's.

When he asked her friend where she was, the friend feigned ignorance and boldly suggested he date her instead. Watching through the hotel window, fury coursed through her veins. The trail burned hotter than the fall itself. Determined to reclaim the spotlight, she launched her plan. Ducking behind a massive lobby flower pot, she snatched a waiter's uniform, then slipped into the restroom. Waiting until a guest finished their makeup, she quietly lifted the entire cosmetic bag. Questionable? Maybe. Essential? Absolutely. Inside the suite, the friends smug grin quickly vanished. The wealthy man had eccentric taste. She only adored women with waistlines over 40 inches. Anything else? Immediate rejection. Humiliation struck her friend like a lightning bolt. The real shock hit when all eyes turned to the newly transformed woman.

Unexpectedly, a spider suddenly crawled onto her face. In her panic, she accidentally slipped, rolled down the stairs, and fell to her death. These terrifying spiders originally lived in the distant Sahara Desert, and some Arabs made their living specifically by hunting them. This day, a man discovered a burrow under a stone slab. He immediately called over his companion. The companion brought a poison gas canister, then attached a hose to it and inserted one end of the hose into the hole. Then he turned on the valve and the hole was instantly filled with a large amount of yellow smoke. After the smoke cleared, the man stuck his head in to check the situation. Unexpectedly, a spider suddenly crawled out and bit him, causing him to roll around on the ground in pain. But his companions not only didn't rescue him, they actually used a knife to end his life. Then a large number of spiders crawled out of the hole. Companions looked at them as if they had found treasure and quickly grabbed them and put them in boxes. Later, these spiders were sold to various countries. Jimmy was an exotic pet enthusiast. He spotted a female spider at a pet shop right away and bought it for $100,000 after getting home because he was busy going out to a party. So he found a shoebox, lined it with several layers of tissue paper to serve.

Here's 50 bucks. Now get lost. I don't need your money, she laughed. What a proud bum. I chose to swallow my pride when that girl humiliated me. But while cleaning up the spilled milk tea, something caught my eye. There was a diamond ring lying under the table. I immediately realized it must have been the one she dropped. I stood up, intending to return it to her. My sudden appearance startled them. Her friend told me to get lost. I was about to explain when she asked, changed your mind? Still want the 50 bucks? Yeah, I replied, because, you know, I'm wearing rags, my back hurts and my 6 kids are starving. Oh, so you're not that proud after all. Yeah, I'm so sorry. Please give me the money. But as their insults kept coming, I reached my breaking point. I secretly slipped the ring into my pocket. She didn't notice and just walked away. I soon went to a pawn shop to sell the ring. But when the owner examined it, he asked how I'd gotten it. Seeing how nervous I was, he seemed to realise something and he told me the ring was worth $500. I knew it was worth a lot more than that, so I turned down his offer. Then suddenly, he accused me of stealing it. And the next thing I knew, he was threatening to call the cops. Afraid of getting caught, I had no Choice but to accept his price. But that still wasn't enough for him. Seeing how meek I was, he slashed the price in half. In the end, I sold it for just $250. A week flew by as I practiced relentlessly with that $250. I finally managed to save enough for a ticket home. Just as I was packing up to leave for the station, a figure appeared in front of me. It was the same girl who had humiliated me, but her attitude had completely changed. She'd even bought me a clean set of clothes. Confused, I asked her what was going on. She explained that the ring had been her late mother's, the only thing she had left from her. Now it was gone. She believed her terrible attitude had LED to this loss.

A resourceful squirrel pulled out a remote. Press the red button, and the pigeon sprang back to life. The squirrel repeated the trick, freeing the other pigeons. As soon as they were alive, they charged straight toward the red fruits again. No matter how many times the squirrel intervened, the birds couldn't resist the temptation. Growing desperate, the squirrel tried every tactic, pulling them, shoving them, even tossing them aside. But the pigeons always returned to the fruit. During a struggle over one particularly juicy fruit, a piece flew right into the squirrel's mouth. Before it could hit the remote, the squirrel turned to stone as well. A curious pigeon waddled over to the remote, but the shiny fruit immediately caught its attention again. Soon all the animals were frozen, motionless statues scattered across the ground. By sheer luck, a fruit tumbled from a tree, smashing one pigeon down, which toppled onto another, which fell onto another, creating a domino effect till one finally landed on the squirrel. The remote was pressed by accident, and suddenly all the frozen animals came back to life. But the pigeon's first move was predictable. They darted straight for the red fruits. Terrified, the squirrel snatched a fruit and bolted, clutching its prize tightly.

But one particular beauty sets her sights on a staff member. She dives into the bread and soon grows, popping out the other side with a whole belly. She attempts to enjoy a glass of red wine, but overdoes it and ends up Trapped inside an empty box.

Terrified, he quickly called for help. The rescue team rushed to the scene, finding the boy unable to move. They immediately assessed the situation, carefully helping him up while stabilizing his neck. They checked his vitals. Pulse and blood pressure were normal. But Lisa was still puzzled. She suspected there might be a nerve issue, so she gently lifted his arm, asking the boy what he had been doing. He hesitated, clearly embarrassed. I just wanted to get fit like everybody else. I never thought it would kill me. Lisa raised an eyebrow. No pain from my touch. The boy winced. Oh, yeah, I can feel that. The captain, sensing something was off, insisted on hearing more details. Only then did the boy finally confess the truth. It turned out he was a shut in and had stumbled upon a fitness ad that day. The ad promised that with enough dedication he could build a physique like a Greek statue. Inspired, he decided to follow the exercises from the TV. He did 1,000 sit UPS and shortly after a sharp pain shot through his stomach. Panicked, he rushed to the bathroom and that's when the incident happened. When the team doctor heard about the 1,000 sit UPS, he immediately understood the boy had over exerted himself, causing muscle fatigue. Nothing life threatening, but enough to knock him out for A bit. The boy still lying there managed a weak smile. Wow, you guys are pretty. Jack, what kind of workout do you do? Lisa couldn't help but chuckle. I give up. Maybe next time you'll skip the Marathon sit UPS session.

The moment my fingers touched it, the massive creature stirred, coming back to life after 2,000 years. Panic spread through the lab. Instantly, the staff sprang into action, activating the ultraviolet Protection measures. Trolls, it turns out, feared UV light more than anything. But just as the lights flickered on, disaster struck. A careless coffee spill from one of the workers short circuited the system. The UV lights went dark and before we could do anything, the troll was free. Bound in iron chains, the massive creature roared in fury. With one violent shake of its body, the chains broke apart. The workers scattered in all directions, but it was already too late to escape. One poor soul, slower than the rest, was crushed into the floor under the trolls enormous foot. The lab turned into pure chaos. I LED the others out through the back door, hoping to make it to safety. But as we reached the exit, we turned to find the troll squeezing through the narrow passage, its massive form inching closer. With one swipe of its body, it destroyed the hydroelectric stations, pipelines, sending a massive surge of water, flooding the area. It didn't continue its rampage, though. Instead, it lumbered off into the forest, leaving destruction in its wake. The troll, having been dormant for 2,000 years, was famished. It wandered into a nearby bar, its enormous hand ripping off The roof as it peaked inside. The people oblivious to the danger whipped out their phones to take pictures, clueless about what was coming. It wasn't until the trolls giant palm hovered over the crowd that they realized something was very wrong. In a panic, everyone scrambled in every direction. It was too late for one unlucky soul who was tossed straight into the troll's mouth. The military, alerted by the chaos was quick to respond. Helicopters were dispatched and soldiers readied their weapons, activating UV lights from their aircraft. As the beams of light cut through the darkness, the troll paused, its massive form silhouetted against the blinding light.

After confirming the elderly woman was truly blind, he slid her wallet into his hand with a swift, practiced motion. Who's there, she asked. I'm your waiter, ma'am. What he didn't know was that a man behind him had witnessed every second of his little stunt. Yet instead of calling him out, the man casually dropped a luxury car key onto the floor, then knocked over his teacup, as if creating a scene on purpose. Excuse me. Aren't you cleaning that up? Oh, yes, right away. You are the waiter, right? Yes. Sorry. Good. Thanks. While picking up the shattered pieces, he noticed the luxury key gleaming among the debris. When the man wasn't paying attention, he quietly slipped it into his pocket and walked out of the restaurant like nothing unusual had happened. He believed his plan had succeeded flawlessly, never realizing he was walking straight toward his worst nightmare in the parking lot. The key quickly revealed the location of the luxury car. Just as he reached for the door, a patrolling officer approached him. Nice car, sir. How long you've been driving it? Ah. Is something wrong? Yes. Take a look at your headlights. The officer was simply reminding him that the headlights were still on. Relieved, he opened the door to switch them off and froze when he spotted a bag stuffed with cash sitting right there on the driver's seat. Park Racing, he thanked the officer who walked away without a hint of suspicion. He climbed into the car, convinced his life was finally turning around, until cold metal pressed against the side of his head. Remember me? Please, I shouldn't have taken your things. Just let me go, please. No, it. It's far too late for that now. Only then did he understand the millionaire had set this trap from the very beginning. Terrified, trembling, he begged for mercy, but the man had no intention of letting him off easy. Under the threat of the gun, he drove where he was ordered to go. The millionaire let him deep into a silent forest, place so still it felt like the world had stopped breathing. A wide, freshly dug pit caught his eye and he collapsed to his knees in terror. Please don't kill me. I'm begging you. Relax. We're not there yet. The millionaire then guided him to a gravestone, wiped away the dust and spoke to it like greeting an old companion.

He and his closest friend stole for thrills. And until the law finally caught up, the millionaire went to prison. His friend wasn't so lucky, shot dead during a robbery at the exact age the young thief is now. He was his mother's only son. Losing him Nearly destroyed her. I owe her a debt I can't ever repay. So I help her quietly whenever I can. And suddenly everything made sense. The blind woman was his friend's grieving mother. The gun pointed at him was only a lighter. The millionaire just wanted to scare him straight before he ended up the same tragic way. Overwhelmed by guilt, he returned to the restaurant, placed every stolen dollar back and offered the old woman a sincere apology.

Jimmy planted a bomb on his shoe, a device seconds away from detonating. When the traffic light turned red, he pedaled his bike straight toward the center lane like he owned the road. His targets were the two luxury sedans on the left. Since the space was too tight to slip through, he casually pushed the side mirror of the rear car out of his way. Inside that car, the gang boss didn't notice a thing. Perfect. Jimmy rolled up to the lead car, quietly slapped the bomb onto the bottom of its chassis. The driver in the rear car reached out to fix his mirror again. And that's when Jimmy slipped on a gas mask, turned around, and fired a toxin pellet directly into the cabin. The two men in the front seats collapsed instantly. Only then did the bodyguard in the lead vehicle realized something was wrong. But the door was jammed by Jimmy's bike and couldn't open. Right away, Jimmy dragged the unconscious driver onto the street and yanked the gang boss out of the car just as he was about to take him away. Boom! The bodyguards up front finally kicked the bike aside, opened the door, and started firing like madman at Jimmy's getaway car. Luckily, every window on Jimmy's car was bulletproof. More than a dozen shots. Not a single one made it. Through watching their boss being hauled off was unbearable for the bodyguards, and they were ready to chase him down. But Jimmy didn't panic. This was exactly the moment the bomb was meant to explode. The gang car blew into the air, leaving the bodyguards helpless. They had fought so desperately because the gang boss was transporting a crate of biochemical weapon worth tens of millions. During interrogation, the boss finally cracked and revealed the location where those weapons were to be traded to terrorists. Since Jimmy had to stay behind to guard the dangerous cargo, he sent his partner to capture the terrorists instead. But his partner wasn't as lucky. She disguised herself as a hotel cleaner and slipped into the building where the deal was happening. Unfortunately, these terrorists had razor sharp instincts. The bald man spotted something off the moment he looked at her. Even without proof, he was ruthless enough to kill first and ask questions. Never. He dragged her to the elevator doors, pressed the button, and ended her life before the doors even open. When Jimmy heard what happened, he lost it. Ignoring every warning from his own agency, he went after the terrorist leader himself. Because of the elevator incident, the terrorists already knew they'd been exposed. They were racing toward the airport to escape and had no intention of getting into a shootout. They simply had two guards fire a few rounds to keep Jimmy at bay, then made a sudden turn. Into a side street and disappeared. The moment Jimmy's car vanished from their mirrors, the terrorists relaxed, convinced they were safe. But they were wrong. As they stopped at a red light, Jimmy suddenly burst out from another intersecting road and slammed his foot on the gas, driving straight at them.

To his surprise, Elena didn't get angry at all, even handing him her phone with calm composure. Then she let a ring slip onto his head as if mocking his clumsy theft. Noah froze in shock, picking up the ring from the floor, feeling an unmistakable sting of humiliation driven by both irritation and curiosity, he followed Elena. By the time he reached the bus, he saw that she had already unlocked her handcuffs with a hairpin and vanished before he could react. Scanning the surroundings, Noah noticed Elena perched on a railing as though she was about to leap into the sea. He shouted, wait, beautiful, you can't do this. What will happen when the police come? Elena spoke with chilling calmness. Help me in my life. I still have savings at home. Take whatever you want if you assist me. Noah nodded without hesitation. To her, he was just a minor pawn, perfectly useful for her scheme. She LED him to her home and opened the safe, gesturing for him to take whatever he desired. I don't like being watched. Go wait in the kitchen. After she left, Noah closed the safe and glanced at a nearby photo, a happy family portrait showing her smiling, content, utterly unlike someone planning to die. Suddenly, Elena's phone rang. A soft voice from the other end whispered, the mermaid water you drank, can it really reverse aging? Noah's expression shifted, curiosity and tension sparking anew.

During long division, she go up to her teacher and go, I got a sick headache. I'm gonna need an ibuprofen. And her teacher would send her to the nurse's office, which really wasn't a nurse. That was my friend Susie that was volunteering. And Susie would give her a diet coke and a chocolate chip cookie. And they would sit with their legs crossed and gossip about people. Because he is now since married and gone off with his wife and her people. And that's what boys do. They cling to their wife. That's biblical. He said to me, mom, she is now my immediate family. You are my extended. That's what he said to me right before they got married. And he said, mom, that's biblical. I'm just my middle one. That lives here in Chattanooga. Has always had a lot Of suitors, um, coming around and wanting to date her. And um, she had this one and he was a. I wouldn't say an Eddie Haskell, but he was a schmoozer. And he would say to me things like, Miss Morgan, you look beautiful today. And I was like, ha ha, can I make you a casserole? Ha ha! Thank goodness they broke up, cause I was it. Let me tell y'all, I told them this last night. The last time in that. But the first time I was in Detroit was years ago. I got hired to do a fundraiser outside, right outside of Detroit. And it was darling. And it was a bunch of nuns. It was nuns and fun people. And there was a raffle and a lot of drinking. And I didn't know what I was stepping into. But I had been at home and Chuck Morgan and I both got sick with some horrible cough. And I had gotten codeine cough syrup, which is a controlled substance and they don't let you have much of it. And I was coughing my head off and I thought, oh no, I'm not gonna get to do that show in Detroit. And um. But I thought, I've got my codeine, I'll be alright. I can dope myself up and I can do it. Chuck Morgan, drink all of my codeine cough syrup. And I said, I've got to go do a show in Detroit. And I didn't have Anything. So I rub, baby rub on the bottom of my feet. And that's. I was young enough. I went to bed, woke up, couldn't see. So I go to my little eye doctor in Knoxville, who is so yummy. He's in his eighties and he's tiny. He comes about here on me, and he looks like Mr. Magoo. Do y'all remember that he wears blue jeans that look homemade? I know they're not, but they're up under his armpits. And he loves Cheesecake Factory. He likes the mango. And he's so darling. He goes, Jillian, you're gonna have to have power on top, rain on the bottom. And he said, you're gonna be fine. But I said, when I'm on stage, I don't like these glasses. I'm gonna try contacts. He straddled me and he wallowed me for an hour trying to get contacts in my eyeballs. And you think that I could have done that? I've had three babies two different ways. I've had some crap happen to me. And he would say, keep your eye open. He won't. There was another time that we went to Alaska, and my husband signed us up for the largest zipline in North America. And we got on a rickety school bus with a high school boy driving that was high on marijuana. And he drove us up to the top of that mountain, and we all got out, and he said, okay, listen, there's a couple of grizzlies that live up Here. If they pop up out of that rock. And me and my husband, I'm really trying to build that intimacy back with our daddy. But his idea of intimacy is different from mine. His idea of intimacy is something nasty. And that's okay. That's why god made him. That's okay. My idea of intimacy is, I wanna talk. You know, I wanna talk. My husband is very, very smart in math and has an undergraduate and then a masters in some kind of math something. I don't know. Our first date, he said, I love a derivative. And I remember thinking, okay, what? But he bred with me and has three children that cannot do math. All of them took after me. But they're fun. They're fun. Me and my husband in Hawaii on a company trip. I had bought a lavender miracle suit. Don't ever do that. This VHS tape was of us snorkeling. We both have been eating white flour and sugar. And our heads were this big and we were white and gross. And I had the, uh. So then. And my husband have been taking Propecia, and it grown a patch of hair out right here. He's floating. And there's this one thing.

She said everybody's got a big cowboy hat on and they got their shirt unbuttoned down to their belly button. But I thought, what is she, is she gonna do after date? Is she gonna go home with a man and make out around his seat? When my boy and his wife found out about this precious baby, they would say their baby and we would say our baby. And then they started using words like boundaries. And I thought to myself, they don't know what's about to hit them. They're gonna have this precious baby and they're gonna be up all night and that's gonna go into weeks and months. And then my little daughter in law is gonna start hallucinating and then she's gonna wake up the night and she'll be breastfeeding a lamp and we'll see who's got boundary. I was in a Uber with a man up north and this man, we were talking about our grandchildren and he's got a grandson and he's in love with him. And he said, I love him so much that if he came to me and said, granddaddy, I've killed somebody, I'm gonna need some help. He said, I do it. And the first thing I thought was, I'm in an Uber with a man who would cover up a murder. And then the second thing I thought was I'd help my baby cover up. We went to meet her first grade teacher and, um, and I know we got there in a van and I know everybody was dressed and I think they had eaten breakfast. But I remember it was just a blur with three little children, trying to get them to school and I just didn't pay attention.

And I look down and my baby, 6 years old, had on full contour makeup and late, the last time I dated, it was the 80s and I was in a club, honey, dancing, dancing the prince and having a big time, big hair.

Now, I can't do math, but I can dance. But if I had to go to a club with a man, this is how I would dance right now. I would, I would go. So she was worried about who was going to heaven. And she asked me about J. Lo. And this was years ago and I'm a huge J. Lo fan. And she said, Mommy, is J. Lo going to heaven?

I don't think I can. I had big ideas about hiking and jogging and doing, and I didn't. All right. Do y'all remember when it first happened? And they said, give us two weeks. Give us two weeks, okay? I went, oh, I'll make a chicken pot pie. I made a chicken pot pie, and then that darn thing dragged on and on. And I made more chicken pot pie, and then I mixed alcohol with it. I had that thing about words and. And bad language because I think. Because my little mom and daddy never said ugly words, ever. And there was never alcohol in our house until my sister was gonna marry a little later in life, and she was gonna marry this hoedown man. When I say hoedown, I mean country club. Some country club people like to drink. So we all. To get her married, I'll started drinking, all right? So we, me and my high school boyfriend would get out in his 79 Monte Carlo. That was as long as this stage. And we would make out. And then I would go home to my precious mama Lucille and say, Mama, I must have burned my neck on a curling iron, and she knew it. That was crazy. But anyway, if I say into my husband, Chuck, suck my neck. Suck My neck. Chuck as hard as you can until you put a bruise on me if I said that to him. I think my boy had a roommate all through college that was a outdoorsy little feller. And he had been in a gospel quartet in high school. And this little kid, his mom and daddy raised cattle, so this child knew all about cattle. Barry College put this child in charge of hundreds of heads of cattle. You boys that are my age, y'all remember that poster everybody had in their. Their bedroom? All the boys had it in their dorm room. And it was that poster of fair fawcet in that red bathing suit. Yes. With her nipple. Beautiful. I go to visit my boy. We've got a girlfriend in our friend group, and she's 58, and she loves her husband. Loves him. But we were saying, Lord, if we had to get out here and get a man. She said, okay, I think I could show somebody my left breast. She said, it still looks okay. Where do people go on dates in their 50s and 60s? Lord, I had not dated since the 80s. Now we go to get in the bed, and when you're in perimenopause and menopause, it disrupts women sleep. And it really did mine. Not everybody, but it does a lot of women. And I've wallered in the bed for years now. Just wallered, wallered, wallered and slept. And my nurse Practitioner said, I'm gonna make you a supplement, a natural supplement. She had it compounded, and I've got it in a pill bottle next to the bed. And my husband still tickle with me, flares his nostrils at me, and I go, okay, okay, okay. Let's do it. Okay. But just know that if you've heard this, I have written a book. Thank y'all. Thank y'all. And I'm. And it almost killed me. It was hard, but I am. I'm proud of it. This is my story of coming from a town of 500 people and a little farm girl and having a dream and not knowing how to get there. And then going to university of Tennessee and Flaylin. I ended up graduating through the skin of my teeth. None of y'all will ever know my GPA. And. And there's a story in there, and I've been bringing this up lately. Chuck Morgan and I were dating, and then he broke up with me, and it hurt me so bad. And then I went to spring break, Fort Lauderdale, with a couple. I was the third wheel. They let me go, and I got a tongue. And I came back, and I worked at the lancome counter at West Town Mall. And Chuck Morgan came in there and saw me with a tongue and saying, can I buy you a pair of tennis shoes? And I said, they were out. I don't know what they were doing. Fishing or Rock climbing, doing something. They found a little baby beaver. And her mama had been killed or she'd been abandoned. Anyway, they brought her back to the dorm room. I happened to go visit that weekend, and I walk in, and my boy is holding a little beaver in his arms in a blanket, feeding her a kitten bottle. And I said, how do you even know what to feed her? And he said. I called to be where my kids went to school. I went to a small Christian school in Nashville. And I swear, all those kids were like pilgrims. And everybody dated intentionally. That's what they called it. They would go, we're dating intentionally. And I. And I would. I was. That was so foreign to me, because I didn't. I didn't. And so I would say to my boy, why don't you take that little girl to steak and shake in a movie? And he go, good night. I can't do that. I barely know her. I need to talk to her for a year.

They're gonna come out of that, and it's gonna take a long time, but they're gonna come out of that. And then they come back around and end up your very best friend. I know. Girls. Yummy. Okay, She takes care of me just like I'm her. But thank y'all for coming out and supporting me during the COVID. Is this the craziest thing? Is this the craziest thing we've ever been through? I know. I feel disoriented. Okay? I've got to say, cause last night was my first time on stage since March the 7th. And I'm not. I'm not kidding. I almost fainted back there. I was so torn up and I didn't know it. My act, I couldn't remember it. I still don't know it. Tonight. I still don't know.

And he would say, don't you dare get on a motorcycle. That was one of the things. And it would just scare me to death. I was like, I'm not going to. Well, my husband buys one and says, because we're 30 minutes from the Smoky Mountains, let's go ride in the mountains. And I thought, oh my lord, if I get on this thing, he's gonna pull off into the bushes and make me do something horrible. And I can't be scared. We all get in this tiny little float plane and we've got on, they put these big old headphones on us and somebody's narrating. I think it's Wink Martindale. And all of a sudden this little man starts pumping his foot, pumping his foot. And that's how we get in there. He's pumping that plane. And I don't know if I saw a glacier. I don't know if I saw one one, because I mean, it's all white everywhere. But also I was praying. I was praying and I took my purse handles and took them around my neck. He would come in at lunchtime in the kitchen and not make eye contact with me and come and stand next to me and grab one of my breasts and hold it. And he'd say, what's for lunch? And I say, chicken salad. Oh, I love him. I Love him. I just don't wanna be with him. No, he has been a wonderful provider, wonderful provider. And he's worked like a dog for us and done without so that we could have but all that money going out and taking care of a family all those years. My husband is very, very smart in math and has an undergraduate and then a master's in some kind of math something. I don't know. Our first date, he said, I love a derivative. And I remember thinking, okay, what? But he bred with me and has 3 children that cannot do math. All of them took after me. But they're fun. They're fun. I see younger girls, I'm so tickled and I, I feel like God has put it on my heart to explain to them what their future is gonna be. And it's not bad. It's not bad. But I just, I wish somebody told me. That's the only thing I think I could have prepared for it better. These precious men that are my age that have already been through this with a woman. They've been with a woman laying in the bed thinking, is that steam coming off of her? Why is she crying? Because Tanya didn't invite her to the wait watchers meeting. That's because she's going through, there's a thing that starts in your, it can start in your late 30s, early 40s and it's, it comes in the middle of the night. Like a ghost out of nowhere and it's called perimenopause and people should talk about it because it lasts 10 years and I started going through it and I would, I had a high school boyfriend and I loved him and he was from farming people and he went to the big city high school and I look back on it and he was tiny, cute, so cute, but I could have held him like a baby I look at me now and I think, you know, as I age, surely to goodness I'm gonna get smaller, my feet are getting bigger, my hands are getting bigger. I just walk around like that. I take pictures with, there was never alcohol in her house until my sister is a little bit older than me and she was gonna marry late in life and she was gonna marry this Humpty dumpty country club man. I had to explain to women in North Dakota what that was hooped to do you know, country club cause I'm from a town of 500 people, farming people. We didn't know what we never seen anybody play tennis. I've seen somebody on the on TV and I think, oh, that's the Queen and her people so we didn't know anything about a country club so she's gonna marry this country club land and you know some country club people like to drink so to get her married off we all started drinking my little moment do you Think it's easier to raise girls or boys and people say boys and and we love our girls. We love our girls. I'll give you all an example. I'll be in the pickup line since she's been in kindergarten and now she's in 8th grade. Every day I get to go thank the Lord and pick them up from school and I'm sitting in my minivan, alright? I'm watching them come out and they are in a good mood. I saw it and they're goose in each other and see you tomorrow. Okay? Bye bye. Then they come over my minivan, get in, shut the door. My 8th grader take her backpack, sling it and hit me in the back of the head. Every day she says something like this. I'm starving to death. You don't have a piece of cheese in this car. Your driving is making me car sick. I hate her. Why did you have her? And then they'll be whipping each other in the back seat and squalling and fighting and I hate you.

Hello. That says health insurance to me. All right. Y'all make me think of my husband. Let me tell you about him, uh, cause he's got a 4:01 K and. Yeah, okay. We met at the university of Tennessee. When I hear a man say, go balls, I think, oh, my Lord, did I make out with him in the eighty? When my boy and his wife found out about this precious baby, they would say their baby and we would say our baby. And then they start using words like boundaries. And I thought to myself, they don't know what's about to hit them. They're gonna have this precious baby and they're gonna be up all night. And that's gonna go into weeks and months. And then my little daughter in law is gonna start hallucinating. And then she's gonna wake up the night, she'll be breastfeeding the lamp. And we'll see who's got boundaries. Well, I was right. So I see some younger mamas in here. I see some younger girls. If you got little children, can you clap for me? You're too tired. Pretty tired. Sound pretty tired. Well, Lord, you got a lot on you. And, um, you know you're gonna have to go home and do nasty things to pay for these tickets. I just want to say thank you all for coming out. Y'all probably don't get to go anywhere most of the time. I Know, my darling, I wish I could go home with y'all. I've done every diet in the world. My mama and my sister and I took dexatrim when I was 17 years old. I'm the youngest. You could buy it everywhere. Do y'all remember dexatrim? Yeah. It was speed. We took speed as a family. We would take the Dexter trim and our heads would itch. And we. We've got a girlfriend in our friend group, and she's 58, and she loves her husband. Loves him. But we were saying, Lord, if we had to get out here and get a man. She said, okay, I think I could show somebody my left breast. Ha, ha. She said, it still looks okay. Where do people go on dates in their 50s and 60s? Lord, I had not dated since the 80s, honey. But when I knew that I was gonna get to marry Chuck Morgan, I thought, oh, my gosh, he is so smart. He can do anything. He's gonna take care of everything. He's gonna work like a mule, and I'm just gonna have a ball. I'm just gonna. Well, we married, and I had my first baby by him. And it dawned on me one day. I thought, he's smart at work, not at home. I can't even think about going on one of these trips until I can get through Christmas. And I don't mean to sound like everything falls on me, but everything falls on me. I love my family, but they don't do anything to help me. I do all the decorating, the cooking, the cleaning, the wrapping, the shopping, the do all that. Last year, on December the 24th, my husband said to me, can I help you do anything? And I said, I'm gonna beat you to death. I had that thing about words and. And bad language because I think. Because my little mom and daddy never said ugly words, ever. And there was never alcohol in our house until my sister was gonna marry a little later in life, and she was gonna marry this hoedown man. When I say hoedown, I mean country club. Some country club people like to drink. So we all. To get her married, all started drinking. Remember Tiger King? And that felt like 10 years ago now, but I loved it. And that little. If y'all didn't watch it, y'all gotta go back and watch it. There's a little guy named John, and he was on Maya, and he. And. And he had a sweet heart. He had a good, sweet, kind heart. And he was having to have homosexual sex with a man. And he wasn't gay. And then the girl that worked the front desk, he got her pregnant, and that got him out of it. But anyway. And then when Travis, I think his name was Travis, was having homosexual sex, he wasn't gay with the Tiger King feller.

He was born an 80 year old man. He's been very spiritually mature. I did not do it. My husband didn't do it. We're full of sin.

Then they come over to my vehicle, get in, shut the door. My 11 year old take her backpack and sling it and hit me in the back of the head with it. Every day she says something like this. I'm starving to death. You don't have a piece of cheese in this car. Your driving is making me car sick. I hate her. Why'd you have her? And then my baby will be sitting up there. In a day, she'll be going, mama, Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama. He watches Viking shows, and then there's game of Thrones and all that. I cannot watch it. All that. I hate it.

You did well, you angel. You know, I could have birthed you. And. Yeah, he's been wonderful. And, um. What was I gonna say about that? I'll be honest with y'all. I drink a little damn wine. Thank you. And I'm in menopause, so I have brain fog. And then I think of something and I think. Wait, what? What was I saying? Do y'all do that? Oh. And when we went to that little Christian school, there was a lot of Air Force fighter pilots there that teach the fight that. That train people. And they got on those jumpsuits with those weighted things in the back, and they had those hats on, and everybody had their hair shaved and all that. And so that school had a big thing where it was like Daddy Day, where your dad comes and talks about what they do for a living. And so they had these air. These fighter pilots, like, you know, Maverick coming with this big thing on their head with that thing. And these children were fascinated. And my. My boy was fascinated.

I looked at the unfamiliar face, thinking he must be new and didn't recognize me, so I politely explained. Just put it on your boss's tab. She knows about it. The mail manager gave me a dismissive glance. Sir, this is a three Michelin star restaurant. We never allow tabs. He finished speaking, then handed me a printed Bill. I glanced down at it. A single meal, half a million dollars. Glow up cutlery maintenance fee $30,000 exclusive air purification fee $50,000 VIP emotional appeasement service fee $100,000 and a bunch of other ridiculous charges. I had no idea my sister ran such a rip off joint. I let out a sarcastic laugh. I'm Adrian Hayes, Miss Hayes's brother. If there's an issue, she can come home and talk to me. But he wouldn't back down. If you can't afford it, just say so. Don't try to piggyback on Miss Hayes's name. I've seen plenty of pretty boys trying to sponge off women. I texted my assistant. Astros, tell my sister, either fire this guy or I'm pulling all my investments. Sir, stop wasting everyone's time. Just pay. His tone was smug and cutting, as if he'd already labeled me a scoundrel trying to climb the ladder on a woman's coat tails. Several curious glances were already turning my way. I frowned, not wanting to Waste time on such a ridiculous matter? I pulled out my phone and dialed my sister's number directly, but all I got was a cold, busy signal. I tried again. Same result. It's a weekday. What's that girl up to? I put down my phone and looked straight at the aggressive man, repeating each word clearly. I'll say it again. My name is Adrian Hayes, and I am the biological brother of your boss, Serena Hayes. Her phone isn't answering right now. You can check her card. My photo and information are linked to it. I thought this was the most direct and effective way to solve the problem. But when the male manager heard my name, instead of verifying it, he burst into a loud, exaggerated and grating laugh. He laughed so hard he almost doubled over, drawing even more attention. Then he suddenly leaned in close, lowering his voice to a whisper only we could hear. Still pretending. I've seen your face in Serena's photo album a thousand times. You're that persistent creep who always tries to interfere with our lives. And now you have the nerve to show up at her restaurant and put your tab on her. Who do you think you are? I froze for a second, then glanced at his name tag. Brendan Miller. An overwhelming sense of exasperation washed over me. Serena's boyfriend. The one she'd been so secretive about. The one she wouldn't even let me see a single photo of it. Turned out to be this foolish, venomous man right in front of me. How could her taste be this bad? It dawned on me then. Today's half million dollar exorbitant Bill wasn't a misunderstanding at all. It was a premeditated humiliation. Before I could even speak, he completely lost his patience. If this gentleman insists on dining and dashing, we'll have to restrain him until the police arrive. He waved his hand and two burly security guards who had been standing nearby immediately stepped forward. They were two well trained, strong men, two fists against four hands. My resistance was quickly subdued and my arms were twisted tightly behind my back. I struggled violently, but couldn't break free from their professional hold. They ignored my furious gaze and the frightened looks of the other guests, roughly dragging me towards the back kitchen. Then I was violently shoved into the storeroom in the back, reeking of disinfectant and stale, greasy slop. The door slammed shut, cutting off all light and sound from outside in the dark. The male manager said nothing. He simply raised his leather clad foot and kicked me hard in the stomach. The excruciating pain made me grunt instantly, my stomach churning. That's for spending my woman's money! That's for meddling in her business! He yelled, his voice twisted by jealousy and rage. He looked down at me, then ordered the two burly men beat him! Teach him a lesson! The two security guards were clearly his cronies. They didn't hesitate, a relentless flurry of punches and kicks raining down on me. I gritted my teeth, swallowing every cry of pain. My bones felt like they were being crushed. Inch by inch, my internal organs dislodged. His taunts continued. Who do you think you are, huh? Just a good for nothing leeching off his sister? I told you, I'm her brother. If you don't believe me, ask Serena. Call her now. I'll talk to her. I struggled to explain, but the man in front of me just ignored it. It wasn't until I started feeling dizzy that he raised a hand, signaling them to stop. He nudged my shoulder with the tip of his leather shoe, looking at me triumphantly. You better settle the Bill today and cough up another half million. That's the consequence of you interfering in my relationship with Serena and spending her money. I'm not afraid of trouble. Serena will handle any fallout for me. I was curled in a ball of pain, weakly trying to argue. That's my own money, I told you. If you don't believe me, go ask her. His face changed. He kicked me, and the two security guards immediately understood, their punches and kicks raining down on me again. I knew he wouldn't listen to anything I said. If this continued, I could be seriously hurt. After I coughed up a mouthful of blood, I used my last ounce of strength to grope for my phone on the floor. Stop! I'll pay. He seemed satisfied with my submission, signaling the two security guards to stop, squatted down and patted my swollen cheek. See? Wouldn't it have been easier to just do that from the start? You chose the hard way. Two million, not a cent less. I lay sprawled on the cold floor, gasping for breath, my lungs burning. I ignored him and dialed my friend Leo Rodriguez's number. The phone was answered quickly. Leo, bring two million to my sister's restaurant. I need it now. Leo, on the other end, paused, then said something was wrong. Adrian, what's wrong, man? Your voice sounds. Don't ask, just hurry. I cut him off and hung up. Brendan's eyes instantly lit up at the mention of two million. A greedy glint flashed in them. He probably thought I was beaten into submission, offering more money to beg for mercy. The triumph on his face was now impossible to hide. Smart move. Leo's speed was astonishing. Soon the storeroom door was violently shoved open from the outside. Leo, accompanied by two bodyguards, strode in quickly. He was shocked to see the blood on my mouth, my disheveled clothes, and my pathetic posture propped up on the floor. He rushed over to help me up. I shook my head, subtly signalling him to stay silent, then took the bank card he handed me with the PIN attached and tossed it to the man. The man took the card and didn't bother me further. Waving his hand, if that's a fake card, I have countless ways to find you. Get lost! Enduring the excruciating pain throughout my body, I limped out of that sickening place, leaning on Leo's arm. When we reached the entrance, I thanked Leo. Thanks, Buddy. I'll get this sorted and pay you back quickly. He looked at me worriedly. Don't worry about the money. It's nothing. But what happened to you, I sneered. My sister found herself a fine boyfriend. I guess I have a score to settle with her. I pulled out my phone and found the number for the restaurant's assistant general manager, Mr. Peterson. Mr. Peterson was the restaurant's actual manager, someone I had personally recruited, and he was quite loyal to me. The call connected. I wasted no words, my voice devoid of emotion. You have 10 minutes to fire a manager named Brendan Miller. Otherwise Hayes Enterprises will withdraw all investment from the restaurant. Every last cent. Mr. Peterson, on the other end, was scared shitless the moment he heard my voice. He must have heard the weakness and the unusual edge in my voice as he agreed in quick, terrified succession. Not even daring to ask why, I hung up the phone and without a moment's pause, told Leo to take me straight to the police station. With the clearest, calmest logic, I recounted everything that had just happened to the officer who assisted me. After giving a detailed statement at the police station, I went to the hospital for an injury assessment. I held that thin report in my hand, and the fury of betrayal, as if fueled by hot oil, burned hotter and fiercer within me. I needed an explanation. I needed Serena Hayes to give me an explanation herself. My assistant found out Serena was at her villa. My driver and bodyguards arrived, and we headed straight for Serena's place. That villa was also a gift for me. However, when I arrived, I was greeted by blaring heavy metal music and the raucous sounds of men and women echoing through the doors and windows. She was throwing a party. No wonder she hadn't answered my calls. The villa's main door was ajar, and on a strange impulse, I didn't push it open immediately. Soon I heard a familiar male voice. It was Brendan Miller. He was pouring out his story to everyone, painting himself as a poor, helpless victim bullied by an arrogant third party, EMI, who then had the audacity to turn the tables and accuse him. I just asked him to pay the Bill, and he threw $2 million in my face, then found people to get me fired. Serena, he's gone too far. He doesn't respect you at all. He just wants to humiliate me. He just wants us to break up. Inside, Serena's circle of friends, mostly hangers on and troublemakers, echoed his outrage. Serena, in turn, was loudly comforting Brendan in her arms, her voice full of Tenderness and indulgence. Brendan, don't worry, I won't let you suffer this injustice. Then, as if to prove her resolve, she promised everyone confidently, when I get my hands on my brother, I'll make him beg for your forgiveness on his knees. Inside, those spoiled brats were still backing Brendan, shouting about how they would make me pay. Serena, just say the word and we'll go drag that bastard out right now! Yeah, let him know who truly owns this place! I couldn't listen anymore. I raised a hand and my bodyguard kicked open the villa's front door. The booming music screeched to a halt, the noisy laughter instantly vanishing. Dozens of stunned eyes all at once turn towards the doorway. No need to drag me out, I'm right here.

After the man fell to the ground, the psychopath inside opened the door and dragged the body. And he then put the mask back in place, pretending to be the mask as he waited for the next prey. Before long, a couple walked over. They were immediately drawn to the mask and the man also stepped forward to admire at the psychopath quickly thrust his sword out, trying to commit murder again. But at the critical moment, the man's girlfriend suddenly pulled him away. Helplessly, psychopath had to withdraw his sword, but he refused to let the opportunity slip. This time, he put on a disguise and went out to find targets. Soon, he targeted another couple, but his appearance aroused their vigilance. The woman tried to leave, so the psychopath immediately hit her in the face with his cane, then pulled a long sword from pain, ready to kill her. At this moment, the woman boyfriend finally stepped forward to resist. Filled with anger, the psychopath did not hesitate to stab the man dozens of times. Once the man was completely defenseless, the psychopath swung his sword and chopped off his head. The woman was terrified by the scene in front of her. Even though there were many people nearby, they all remained indifferent. Seeing this, she had no choice. But to get up and run. But as a tourist, she was completely unfamiliar with the local terrain, and she never expected that the psychopath was not acting alone. Soon, she was surrounded by two psychopaths on a bridge. When the two pulled out their long swords, the woman ultimately couldn't escape death.

He only made it to snap photos for social media, a perfect disguise for the truth he hid. He was a serial killer. He had already taken the lives of eight girls, yet because of those daily noodle post, the police still had no idea he even existed. Using the victims phones, he kept updating their account, and each time he uploaded a photo, he tagged a new country as the location, making everyone believe the girls were still traveling. And the way he hunted them was far from normal. It always started the same. He stole the victim's phone. Once he had it, he brought it home and tried the password a few time. If he typed it wrong, he slammed the phone on purpose, shattering the screen. When the missing girl eventually called her own number, he used a voice changer to mimic a random woman claiming she found the phone on the street, and he coaxed the girl into meeting him at a small repair shop she never understood. The moment she stepped through the door, she was already caught in his trap. As soon as she arrived, he immediately produced a repair agreement saying he needed her phone password to replace the broken screen. From the second she wrote it down, her nightmare officially began. With the password in hand, he moved to phase two. He cracked open the phone's motherboard. And secretly embedded a tiny camera inside.

He opens the refrigerator, pairs breakfast and even does the housework. Yet no one suspects a thing. Her husband, believing she did all of it due to her amnesia, has never noticed anything unusual.

But before he could even savor his victory, a tentacle shot out from the shadows, snatching them off the ground. They were yanked high into the air. Helpless was a Luna bug, and they were its prey. Just as they were about to be swallowed whole, a little monkey dashed in, swooping down like a hero to save them at the last second. But the monster wasn't finished. Its massive tentacles thrashed wildly. Relentless, the little monkey darted into the razor sharp grass, using the blades as cover. But the tentacle monster was enormous. Undeterred by the grass cutting into its thick skin, Yacho wasn't about to let this monster win. He felled a giant tree with one swift strike, and used the falling trunk as a makeshift springboard. With the agility of a predator, he launched himself into the air and in one clean slash took down the beast. Victory in hand, Yatcha turned the monster's tentacles into a sizzling barbecue. He even tossed a piece of meat to the little monkey as a reward. But instead of gratitude, the monkey spat at him, a defiant gesture. I think she's marking you, someone said with a smirk.

That's my dress! She shouted. But he coldly replied, take it! Go buy yourself a new one! Furious, she slapped him across the face and called the staff, ready to have him thrown out. But then it hit her. He was the owner of the restaurant. Instead, the staff kicked her out. Desperate and about to leave, her condition suddenly worsened. With a rush of panic, they whisked her away to the hospital. The man, frantic, kept protesting, I didn't do anything, I swear! But then the doctor entered and with a heavy heart, confirmed the truth. She was in the final stage of cancer. His world froze. Regret washed over him. A few days later, he returned, bringing dinner to her hospital room, desperate to apologize. But by then it was too late. She had already lost all respect for him. He had ruined her final wish, her dream to wear a beautiful dress and dine at a fine French restaurant. The next day, he came back with a chef. Since she couldn't leave the hospital room, he transformed it into a makeshift restaurant, doing everything he could to fulfill her last wish.

When I asked, my dad said, it belongs to your sister. But I showed them every deposit and one in court. Growing up, I Learned early that fairness wasn't something our family believed in. My sister Lily got everything. Ballet lessons that cost hundreds a month, a brand new Honda at 16. College tuition paid in full without her lifting a finger. Me, I got a bus pass and a lecture about building character. When I asked for help with community college costs, dad said I'd appreciate my education more if I earned it myself. So I did. I worked weekends at a grocery store, picked up night shifts at a warehouse, took out loans I'm still paying off. Every dollar I made went toward tuition or rent or keeping myself fed. Meanwhile, Lily posted Instagram photos from spring break trips I could never afford. But I kept grinding. Got my engineering degree, landed a solid job, and started saving obsessively. No fancy dinners, no vacations, no new clothes, unless the old ones had holes. For five straight years, I funneled every bonus, every overtime check, every tax refund into one account. My house fund. When I finally had enough for a down payment, I found a small two bedroom condo on the edge of town. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. I called mom crying when my offer got accepted. She actually seemed happy for me. Threw me a little Celebration. Dinner that weekend. Lily showed up late, sat in the corner stirring her wine glass. Must be nice having that engineering salary, she muttered. Some of us are still paying off grad school. I tried to ignore the sting. Mom changed the subject quickly. The day I closed on the condo, dad came by to see it. Walked through every room, nodded slowly. Smart investment if you did it right, he said. I thought that was his version of being proud. Two weeks later, a process server knocked on my door. Legal paper. My parents were suing me for the house. I called dad immediately, hands shaking. What is this? His voice was cold. Matter of fact, that house belongs to your sister. Your mother and I discussed this with our attorney. The down payment came from inheritance money that was meant for Lily's first home. I felt like I've been punched. What inheritance? Grandma split everything equally. I never touched that money. Every cent for this house came from my paychecks. You're making this more complicated than it needs to be, he said. Lily needs that house more than you do. She's planning for it. You can buy another one later. I hung up and immediately called my bank. Pulled every statement from the last five years. Every deposit had a clear paper trail. Payroll transfers, direct deposits. Nothing from any inheritance account. When we got to court, their lawyer painted this picture of a greedy daughter who'd stolen Her sister's dream. Dad took the stand first. Confident and calm. He testified about a long standing family understanding that grandma's inheritance money was earmarked for Lily's first home purchase. Mom went next, dabbing her eyes with a tissue. Talked about how much Lily had sacrificed, how she didn't make as much money as me, how unfair it was that I'd used family money to get ahead. She made it sound like I'd robbed them. Lily sat at their table looking wounded, like betrayed her somehow. A few relatives in the gallery nodded along sympathetically. Then my lawyer stood up. She presented a thick folder to the judge. Five years of pay stubs. Every single one. Transfer records showing money moving from my employer directly to my personal savings account. Bank statements with highlighted deposits, each one labeled and dated tax returns.

I whispered, save the one who didn't lie to me. My mother called at 2:00am sobbing, heart attack already in the ambulance. I drove like a maniac to Regional Medical Center. But when I got there, the nurse looked confused. Mister park, you already checked someone in tonight. My stomach dropped. Who? Your son Dylan. 40 minutes ago, car accident. Dylan was supposed to be at his friend's house studying for finals. I texted him good night. At ten PM he responded with, love you, dad. See you tomorrow. I found him in trauma unit, unconscious, swollen, broken ribs, internal bleeding. The nurse said someone dropped him at the entrance and drove off. No ID on the driver. His phone was shattered but still on. Last message was to someone saved as coach. Eleven forty five PM did it. Coming back now. Coach Dylan quit basketball two years ago. That's when they wheeled my mother passed. She grabbed my hand. Kevin, they say I need emergency surgery. My heart valve tore. I'm scared. Doctor Rodriguez pulled me aside. Mister Park, we have a crisis. Both your mother and son need immediate surgery. Both have o negative blood. We only have enough units for one procedure. The storm knocked out power to three hospitals. Everyone's requesting o negative. Nearest supply is five hours away. Choose quickly, he said. Every minute matters My mother's friend Sandra suddenly appeared, hugging her. This is terrible. After such a wonderful weekend in Atlantic City, too, I froze. Atlantic City. My mother's eyes went wide. Sandra, please. The slots were so good to us. Remember when you won that stop. My mother's voice was sharp, too sharp for someone dying Atlantic City. She told me she was at her sister's in Delaware helping with her new baby. I'd sent her $500 for gas and expenses. Something felt off. I went back to Dylan's room, started going through his backpack, found the receipt from today, $300 ATM withdrawal from my mother's account. Her pin number written on the back. I unlocked his phone with his emergency code, opened his photos. My blood went cold. Three hours ago, Dylan in a car I didn't recognize, expensive sports car. My mother in the driver's seat, both smiling. I scrolled back weeks of photos. My mother and Dylan at race tracks, illegal street races. My mother behind the wheel of different cars, Dylan timing her, taking bets. The videos were worse. My mother teaching Dylan to drift to race. Your dad's too soft, she says in one. Real men need adrenaline. This is our secret. More scrolling screenshots of text between them. My mother made 5K tonight. Your college fund, baby Dylan. Dad would kill us. Her. What daddy doesn't know won't hurt him. The final video tonight. Eleven thirty PM, my mother racing a Mustang on Highway 9. Dylan Filming from passenger seat this, the thermometer showing 120 miles per hour. Then the other car swerving. My mother losing control. The camera spinning, the sound of metal crushing. She'd been street racing with my son for months, using him as her spotter, her accomplice, teaching him that lying to me was fine as long as they won money. And tonight she'd crash with my 15 year old in the car. The coach in his phone was her. She'd saved herself that way so I'd never suspect if I saw the name. I found one more thing, a hospital bracelet in his jacket from two months ago. She'd taken him to a different hospital, paid cash, never told me the discharge papers were in his backpack. Patient advised to avoid high speed activity. She knew, she knew he'd been hurt before and kept racing with him anyway. Doctor Rodriguez returned Mr Park. The decision. I looked at my mother. Her heart valve issue was real but manageable. She could wait hours for surgery. She'd exaggerated the urgency knowing I'd choose her over my son, counting on guilt.
