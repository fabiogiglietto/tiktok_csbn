My husband always said he'd do anything to become a father, but I never imagined anything including my younger sister. We've been trying for three years. Every negative test felt like a tiny funeral while Mark sat beside me scrolling adoption sites like shopping online, sighing louder with each click. When my sister Emma offered to be our surrogate at Thanksgiving, I thought we caught a break. She'd already had two kids. I do anything for you, she said, squeezing my hand. Family helps family. I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. Will look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turned out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

I remember the first day my student started joking about doing a devious lick and pretended to steal my phone from my desk for a TikTok. I thought it was pretty funny at first, but after school one day, I overheard a few other teachers talking about how the soap dispensers were gone from the boys bathroom. I didn't believe them until I actually checked. Someone had actually ripped them clean off of the wall and took them home. It didn't take long for our principal to figure out who did it because the kid posted a video of the whole thing. He was suspended from school for a week, and everyone else was told if they were also caught stealing anything, they would be too. But this was only the beginning. The trend started going viral on TikTok, and it wasn't long before someone did it again. This time, a guy stole an entire projector off the roof and took it home in his backpack. The next day when he came back to school, he was arrested in front of all of his friends and got suspended for almost a month. Now, we thought the students would finally get the message and wouldn't try it again. Boy, were we wrong. Literally that same week, we heard something else was stolen from the boys bathroom, but they didn't say what. When we checked, nobody could believe It. An entire sink was completely missing off of the wall. We had no idea how they could have possibly done this. We couldn't find anyone on the cameras. Leaving a school with an entire sink. So our principal took it upon himself to punish every guy he thought could have done it. This made them all really mad. So to get them back, they were going to hit their biggest devious lick yet. That Monday morning, one of the guys tricked the receptionist to let him into the office. And while he was there, he took his car keys. I'm not joking. He actually went outside and stole the principal's car. And before he realized it was a joke, the cops were called. They arrested him for theft, and not only was he expelled from the school, but actually spent the night in juvie.

Now he's trapped in his own mess. I was adopted and my foster parents treated me like their own kid and their kids treated me like their sibling, except for Chad. Chad was an insensitive a hole to everyone. He would fight our older sister, say horrible things to everyone. And his anger issues caused him to break doors and punch holes in walls. The worst thing was when he got up in front of our whole class year and told them I wasn't his sister and never would be. He claimed I would never be a part of his family and I should stop trying. He would keep doing this up until he moved out and I stopped talking to him. I have stayed as far away from him as possible, only seeing him for family pictures every year because our mother asks. Recently he got married and had a baby and everyone was congratulating him except for me. Our mom noticed and asked why I was distancing myself from him. I told her about high school and she said this is still my kid and it's my first grandbaby. And it was the reason she wasn't going to be upset over it. I knew that would happen. Out of nowhere, I got a message from Chad begging me to go babysit for Them because you're the only one who can deal with these kinds of babies because no one will help. He knows I have insomnia and that's why I don't mind staying up. I can't tell if that's a blessing or a curse at this point. For some reason, I accepted and went over at eight PM when I showed up, I was greeted by Chad's wife who had the biggest eye bags but still greeted me with a smile. She explained the baby's night route feedings and said they would be home around 12:30 at most. After this, Chad showed up, looked at me for over a minute and gave me a small wave, then left the house. His wife followed and told me to call or text if I needed anything. For a minute, I was just stunned but went to take care of the baby. He was fine the whole time. And then twelve thirty PM rolled around, but they weren't home. I decided to wait and then ended up texting them at one asking where they were. I got no reply from either of them. They finally showed up at 3 in the morning. I'm livid at this point. I walked into the living room and told them I was waiting for their response. Chad's wife said, oh, Chad said it was fine and that it would only be an hour more. I cut her off to say, it's fine, whatever, the baby's sleeping. I thought I Could walk out of there with my head held high. But when I walked past Chad, I blurted out, so you aren't going to say anything to me after I looked after your kid for seven hours? He snorted at me and was like, no, my wife is the one who talked me into this. Pissed off, I said, so this wasn't a way to apologize for high school or all those other times you outcast me from the family because I was under the impression that you'd want to patch things up? He snapped back, why should I apologize? Nothing from high school has changed. You really do need to just grow up and understand that me and my wife aren't going to cater to you like mom and dad did because you're adopted. You ain't our family and you won't ever be. I turned to his wife and told her she married a disgusting piece of crap and if he continues to act this way, his son will grow up to hate him, too. One day she'll resent him for what he is and she'll only have herself to blame. Chad got angry and said, I had no right to talk to her like that when not even my real family wanted me. I reminded him that his wife also has an adopted sister, told her that if this was the way he spoke about me, then what did she think he was saying about her sister? He Surely wasn't treating her like a princess. I could see that I was getting through to her. But then Chad punched a wall. Classic Chad. I screamed not out of fear, but because I wanted to wake the baby up out of pure spitefulness. Right on cue, we could hear him crying and Chad and his wife audibly groaned. Chad then asked me to go take care of the baby so he and his wife could go to sleep. I told him like hell and gave him the middle finger before leaving and slamming the door. From another relative, I heard that they had a big argument and his wife is currently staying with her parents. Her parents also had a change of heart towards him. Now he's claiming that I made him say that on purpose, which is ridiculous. I smell a divorce in the future.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music, so she ripped my hearing Aid out of my ear thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

At my engagement dinner, she spent the night telling Nathan's family how she introduced us, even though they met at work. Cancer diagnosis was just another moment for her to steal.

Every post started with how hard it was for her to watch me suffer. Friends praised her dedication while I spent hours throwing up from chemo. Three weeks in, I asked if Nathan could drive me to appointment, sometimes started crying and said I was pushing her away during the hardest time of her life. She posted about how sick people lash out at caregivers. Nathan said I should apologize. By month 2, she reorganized our entire house. I moved Nathan's things to the guest room and started screening my calls. She turned away visitors saying stress would hurt my recovery. She joined Nathan for evening runs to discuss my care. They'd come back sweaty and avoid eye contact. Four months into treatment, my white count dropped and the nurse sent me home early. I Took an Uber because Savannah had our car for shopping. I heard voices from our bedroom and climbed the stairs slowly. When I opened the door, they were in my bed. Savannah was wearing the anniversary pajamas Nathan bought me. She, I jumped up wearing my robe and rushed over with fake concern. She asked why I was home early and said I must be confused from the medications. She actually told Nathan to call my nurse about hallucinations. He just sat there in his boxers while she performed. My legs gave out. I slid down the door frame, realizing she'd stolen my husband while I was fighting cancer. Nathan finally said, I've been distant and Savannah understood his stress better. He compared his stress to my cancer. They moved out next week. Savannah told everyone I'd become paranoid from treatment. She posted about watching loved ones lose themselves to illness. People praised her for setting boundaries. Most friends believed her. I finished three months of treatment alone. No one cheered when I rang the bell. I recorded it myself but deleted it that night on my bathroom floor. I decided Savannah had stolen from me my whole life. This time would be different. During recovery, I studied Savannah's patterns like I was planning a battle. I made fake social media accounts to track her posts and learn her routines. Found out she had joined a fancy yoga studio and was flirting with her married instructor. She worked at a Marketing firm downtown and volunteered for their charity events. She and Nathan had rented a condo near the river. I mapped out her entire life and looked for weak spots. I joined her yoga studio but went to different class times, became friends with the instructor's wife at the juice bar next door. We bonded over books and recovery stories without me mentioning Savannah. When Savannah started asking for private sessions, his wife was already suspicious. She found on their text messages and confronted Savannah in the packed studio lobby. She read every flirty message out loud. While Savannah tried to cry her way out, the entire studio turned against her. Next, I joined the board of her company's charity foundation as a cancer survivor advocate. At their annual gala, I gave a speech about finding strength during treatment. I started by describing the loneliness of chemo and how cancer strips away fake.

My 12 year old daughter Adeline takes the bus home from school every day. She's always been chatty about her day. But last week something changed. She started mentioning this nice man who always sits behind her and asks about her homework, her friends, what she likes to do after school. Red flags everywhere. At first I thought maybe she was just being friendly. But then Adeline said he'd complimented her hair and asked if she walked home alone from the bus stop. When she told me he knew which stop was hers, even though he never got off there, my stomach dropped. I decided to follow the bus route in my car the next afternoon. Sure enough, there's this guy in his 40s who gets on at the stop right after Adeline's school. He's not dressed like someone heading to work, no briefcase, no uniform, just sitting there in a baseball cap watching the kids. Followed the bus for three stops. He never got off, just rode it to the end of the route, then walked back to his car parked at the school. When Adeline told me he'd offered her candy and asked where exactly we lived, including what our house looked like, I knew I had to act fast. Next morning I called in sick to work and got on that bus myself, sat three rows behind him with sunglasses and a hoodie up. Adeline didn't even notice. Me boarding. I watched him scan every kid getting on, but his eyes locked on Adeline the moment she stepped up those bus steps. He immediately moved to the seat directly behind her and started his routine. How was school today, sweetheart? Did you think about what I said yesterday about our little secret? Adeline looked uncomfortable but was trying to be polite. Um, I guess so. Good girl. Smart girls like you deserve special treats. Maybe we could meet up sometime when your parents aren't around. I know a place near your house where we could talk. That's when I stood up. Walk.

When I was pregnant, my boyfriend Jake and I had the typical fights about baby names. He wanted something trendy like Harper or Paisley. I kept pushing for Margaret. He'd roll his eyes every time I brought it up and say stuff like, babe, that's such an old lady name. Or do you want our kid to get bullied? But here's the thing. Jake didn't know Margaret wasn't random to me. It was my grandmother's name and she basically raised me when my mom was too busy getting high to take care of a kid. Margaret taught me how to tie my shoes, helped with homework, made me grilled cheese when I was sick. She was the only stable thing in my whole chaotic childhood. Jake never met her because she passed away two years before we started dating. I tried explaining the connection once, but he just brushed it off and said, well, can't we honor her with the middle name instead? I dropped it because fighting while pregnant seemed pointless. So when our daughter was born and the nurse asked for the name, I looks Jake dead in the eyes and said, Margaret Rose. He literally went pale. The nurse was writing it down before he could even process what happened. Are you serious right now, he whispered. I just shrugged and said, I told you I liked it. For weeks after, people kept giving me these looks when I'd introduce Baby Margaret. My sister flat out asked if I was trying to make my kids life harder. Even the pediatrician seemed confused when he called out Margaret in the waiting room and a tiny baby showed up. But then something weird happened. When Margaret was about 6 months old, we were at the grocery store and this elderly woman behind us in line heard me talking to her. She got this huge smile and said, oh, my goodness, Mark, that was my best friend's name growing up. Such a beautiful, strong name. Then when Margaret started daycare, her teacher, Mrs. Chen, told me it was refreshing to see a classic name. Apparently she was getting tired of having three Aydens and four Madisons in every class. The real kicker came when Margaret turned 2. We were at a family barbecue and my great aunt pulled me aside. She said, you know, your grandmother would be so proud you named your daughter after her. I was confused because I'd never told anyone the real reason.

So my daughter Emma is 15 and has been dating this kid, Noah, for about four months now. Every time they go out, Noah pays movies, dinner, ice cream, even when Emma wants to grab something from the gas station. At first I figured, whatever, teenage boys like to show off. But then I started hearing conversations between Emma and my wife where my wife would literally say things like, oh, honey, that's so sweet. He's such a gentleman and you should never have to pay when you're with a boy. Last week was when it really hit me. Emma comes home talking about how Noah spent 40 bucks taking her to some fancy burger place downtown. I asked her if she offered to split it. And she looked at me like I had three heads. She goes, dad, why would I do that? Mom says boys are supposed to pay for dates. I confronted my wife about it that night and she got all defensive, started going on about how it's traditional and romantic and how Noah's family has money anyway, so it's fine. I told her she's basically teaching our daughter to be a gold digger. And that shut down the conversation real quick. But it kept happening. Emma would come home bragging about expensive stuff Noah bought her a new phone case. Some jewelry, taking her to the movies every weekend. The kid was probably spending his entire part time job paycheck on my daughter. Things got really bad when Emma mentioned wanting to go to homecoming. She starts talking about the dress she wants, which costs like $200, casually mentions that Noah said he'd buy it for her along with paying for dinner in the limo. I asked her how much all of that would cost and she just shrugged and said, I don't know. That's Noah's problem. That's when I lost it. I sat both Emma and my wife down and told them this had to stop. I explained that Noah is a 16 year old kid working at a grocery store making minimum wage, not some sugar daddy. Emma got all upset and said I was being mean and that all her friends, boyfriends pay for everything, too. My wife backed her up saying I was being old fashioned and that it's normal for boys to want to spoil their girlfriends. I told them both they were living in fantasy land and that Emma needed to start contributing to dates or I'd have a conversation with Noah's parents about what was happening. The whole thing came to a head when Noah's mom called me last week. Turns out the poor kid had been stressed about money and finally told his parents he was spending everything he earned on Emma. His mom was really nice about it, but.

My husband always said he'd do anything to become a father, but I never imagined anything including my younger sister. We've been trying for three years. Every negative test felt like a tiny funeral while Mark sat beside me scrolling adoption sites like shopping online, sighing louder with each click. When my sister Emma offered to be our surrogate at Thanksgiving, I thought we caught a break. She'd already had two kids. I do anything for you, she said, squeezing my hand. Family helps family. I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. We'll look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turns out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

I'm not usually the type to clap back on social media. I'm the neighbor who brings cookies to new move ins and returns lost packages that Amazon drops at the wrong house. But everyone has a breaking point. And mine came at 1:00am on a Thursday when some jackass decided to celebrate America with fireworks while the rest of us were trying to sleep. I love fireworks on the fourth of July, New Year's Eve, hell even random Saturdays and summer. But Thursday at 1:00am when I had to drive two hours for an 8:00am meeting? That's just being an asshole. My dogs went ballistic, I went from dead sleep to fighter flight mode, and my alarm was set for 4:00am. So yeah, I was pissed. After my meeting. Exhausted and running on gas station coffee. I posted in our neighborhood Facebook group to whoever set off fireworks at 1:00am. Some of us have jobs. There's a time and place. Thursday morning. Isn't it simple enough? Right? I wasn't even that harsh. Then this guy, let's call him Brad because he looks like every Brad who peaked in high school. Commented maybe you can't sleep because you're a fat pig. Just like that. No context, no reason, just pure cruelty from a stranger. His profile showed a guy in his late 30s with a wife, two kids, and a bio about family. Values the kind of guy who posts Bible verses on Sunday and your body, my choice memes on Monday. Here's the thing. I just lost 50 pounds. I was feeling better than I had in years, finally comfortable in my own skin, and this random douchebag decided to take a shot at me for no reason. He didn't even set off the fireworks, which I found out later were from teenagers three blocks over. He just saw an opportunity to be cruel and took it. The comment sat there getting laugh reacts from his buddies while I stared at it during my drive home. That's when something shifted. I could have reported it, blocked him, been the bigger person. Instead, I clicked on his profile. Brad Williams, married to Karen Williams for 12 years. Tons of couple photos, anniversary posts, whole blessed wife performance. Then I had an idea that would either be genius or get me blocked from the group. But after being called a fat pig in front of 500 neighbors, I was ready to risk it. I typed my response carefully, making sure to use his first name. Listen, Brad, I'm sorry I had to end things between us, but I just didn't have the same feelings. What you're saying now is hurtful. Please stop messaging me and commenting on my posts. I told you a dozen times already, we're done. It's over. And I immediately left for a cruise I booked months ago. Seven and days No internet, no cell service. Just me and my best friend drinking overpriced margaritas and forgetting Brad Williams existed. I figured worst case, I'd come back to being kicked out of the group. Best case, his wife would see it, and he'd have some explaining to do. I didn't expect what actually happened. When I finally got Wi-Fi again in Cosamel, my phone exploded. 47 Facebook messages, 23 friend requests, 186 notifications. My cousin had texted, girl, what did you do? 17 times I opened Facebook to find my inbox flooded. Karen Williams had sent 12 increasingly frantic messages asking for details about my relationship with her husband. Brad had sent several, calling me a lying bitch and threatening legal action. But the real treasure was a message from someone named Jessica saying she was also sleeping with Brad and thought she was the only mistress. Apparently, my comment had lit a fuse. Karen saw it within an hour, confronted Brad, and in his panic to deny knowing me, he'd accidentally revealed he had a secret Instagram account. Karen found that account, which LED to finding Jessica, which LED to finding out about someone named Ashley, and the whole house of cards came tumbling down. By day three of my cruise, two more women had come forward. Brad's little fat pig comment had started an avalanche that revealed four affairs spanning six years. Neighborhood Facebook group was better than Reality TV. Karen posted a photo of Brad's stuff in garbage. Bags on the lawn. Jessica showed up at their house demanding answers. Ashley leaked his nudes to the group before admin could delete them. Brad kept making new accounts to defend himself, each one getting blocked faster than the last final post before disappearing completely. That fat bitch ruined my life with her lies. Last I heard, Karen divorced him and Brad's living in his brother's basement. And I only know this because Karen told me everything herself when she invited me to her girls night. Sip and paint. She sent the message, you have to come, fatty. With a crying laughing emoji. We had an awesome time painting wine bottles and sharing Brad's most embarrassing bedroom secrets. I'm down 54 pounds and sleep like a baby now. Turns out I wasn't the pig after all.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point.

This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music, so she ripped my hearing Aid out of my ear thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts, having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister, and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot, holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying, but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 centimeters dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack. Head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane, but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family. Your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls. At this point, the last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating. With another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

When I moved from Beijing to northwest England, I quickly realised that the people weren't exactly welcoming to an Asian student. On my first day, I wanted to make some friends, so I walked up to a group of girls sitting near the windows and asked if I could join them for lunch. The blonde one literally recoiled from me and loudly went, Ew, while the others burst out laughing. One of them started doing that stupid pulling your eyes back thing while saying, go back to China in but she thought was a Chinese accent. I kept my expression neutral and then walked away with as much dignity as I could manage while they kept laughing behind me. A week later, I finally made friends with some theater kids who actually treated me like a human being. My new friends were excited to try the dumplings I brought for lunch, and for the first time since arriving, I felt like maybe things would be okay. Then that same blonde girl walked past carrying her water bottle. She tripped and dumped the entire thing over our table. Water soaked through everything, including the container of dumplings I brought. My friend sat frozen while she said, oops, my bad, I'm just cleaning the table and walked off laughing. When I tried complaining to the counselor, he gave me a patronising smile saying, girls, Will be girls. Maybe I should try harder to understand the culture. I wanted to scream that getting water poured on my food had nothing to do with culture. My breaking point came a few days later when I was walking home after school. I saw the group of five girls, including the blonde one, standing on the sidewalk and my stomach dropped. They spotted me immediately and before I could cross the street, they rushed over and surrounded me. My heart was racing and I could feel panic rising in my throat. But I tried to stay calm and said firmly, move out of my way. But they just laughed harder. The blonde one said something to the others and they all reached into their bags. At the same time, they pulled out their water bottles and I realized what was about to happen, but there was nowhere to go. They unscrewed the caps in unison like they were first it and then they all poured everything on me at once. The water was freezing cold and there was so much of it that I literally started shivering. As they walked away laughing, the blonde one called me the c word, slur, and they all thought that was hilarious. I'd never felt so humiliated and angry at the same time. Something inside me just broke. When I got home, I told my mum I've been caught in the rain because I couldn't bear to see her face if she Knew the truth. The next morning, I marched into the counselor's office and told him everything that had happened. He listened to the whole story, then shrugged and said since it happened off school grounds, there was nothing they could do about it. That was when I knew I had to handle this myself. I left his office and went straight to the engineering department where I knew they kept supplies for building theater sets. I found a bottle of brown acrylic paint and poured it into an empty water bottle. Then I waited. The next day after P E, I spotted the blonde girl walking back to the main holding by herself. Her hair was perfectly styled, even though she just been sweating in gym class, which seemed to be her superpower. She was checking her phone and walking slowly, which gave me the perfect opportunity. I followed her, keeping just enough distance that she wouldn't notice my heart was pounding and my hands were shaking, but I kept going. When I got close enough, I pulled out my water bottle, uncapped it, raised it over her head and poured the entire contents over her pristine blonde hair.

I was six beers deep at the hotel bar when Alan put $300 on the counter. Bet you can't give a toast at that wedding next door. We could hear the DJ through the wall asking for speakers. My girlfriend had just dumped me over text for never taking risks or putting myself out there. I've been telling my friends all night that I could charm anyone, and Alan decided to test me. The guys all leaned in to see if I'd take the bet. The reception was at that point where they open the mic to anyone who wants to speak. My drunk plan was simple. I pretend to work with the groom and give a generic business guy speech. Rob told me dedication and commitment were perfect wedding words. The ballroom doors were open and people were walking freely between spaces. My shirt was wrinkled, but the lights were dim enough to hide it. I walked in from the hotel bar, and when the DJ saw me approaching the microphone, he looked relieved that someone finally volunteered. I grabbed the microphone and a champagne glass from a passing waiter and told everyone I needed a moment outside because big moments get to me. While people smiled and nodded and the bride sat up to listen, I started with safe stuff about knowing the groom from work and watching him grow as a professional before pointing at the bride and saying, this guy talks. About you, the way he talks about his biggest wins. Everyone laughed while the groom mouth thank you from his table with tears forming in his eyes. I kept going with generic lines about late nights at the office paying off. Remember those long nights when everything seemed impossible? I said, getting nods from everyone who'd ever worked late. Well, now you found someone worth losing sleep for. My voice cracked when I mentioned what makes a good partnership because that's what my ex said I couldn't do, but I pushed through and finished by saying they deserved all the happiness in the world. The room exploded with applause and the groom caught me in a huge hug saying it meant everything. Probably too emotional and drunk to wonder why he didn't remember me. And that's when Natalie walked up with dark hair and a smile that made me forget why I was there. She pressed a napkin with her purple penned number into my hand while saying I work for the wedding planner and I've never heard such a beautiful toast from a business guy. And we ended up dancing for a few songs while my friends watched from the doorway in shock. During our last dance, Natalie asked coffee sometime? Right in my ear and I said yes immediately. When my friends texted that the hotel bar was closing, she squeezed my hand, making me promise to call before I left, feeling better than I had in weeks. Two weeks later, the bride tried to send me a thank you card, but couldn't figure out who I was. The wedding planner pulled security footage and saw me walking in from the public bar and grabbing a glass from their reception waiter. The hotel banned me using my credit card information from the bar tab. That night, Natalie texted the planner

When my wife and I had our first kid, Jason. Parenting felt almost easy. He was the kind of kid who made you think you were nailing at his parents. Quiet, thoughtful, always looking out for his mom. If she was tired, he'd sit with her on the couch and rub her arm. If we were out, he'd hold doors open, help carry groceries. Never needed to be told twice he wasn't perfect. No kid is. But there was this gentleness in him that made me proud every single, single day. Then came Olivia. From the second she could talk, she filled every room she entered. Loud, funny, charismatic, full of fire. Strangers would stop us at the store and say, wow, she's going to be a leader one day. And for a while, I believed it. I was proud of her boldness, proud that she wasn't afraid of anyone. But that spark changed as she got older. The boldness turned into sharpness. She lied about small things, then bigger things. He manipulated. She'd spill juice on the carpet and blame Jason, break something in the house and swear she didn't touch it. She always had an excuse, always managed to twist things so it seemed like someone else's fault. And little by little, I watched Jason fade. We tried everything, therapy, discipline, extra attention, less attention, family meetings, reward charts, stricter rules, softer approaches. Nothing stuck. Olivia always stayed one Step ahead. To outsiders, she was the sweet, funny girl. At home, she could be cruel when no one was looking. Then came the day everything cracked open. She told us Jason had been touching her inappropriately. My world split in two. Jason denied.

My school had this completely insane bathroom rule where you could only use the restroom twice per day. Two times. That was it. They gave each teacher a clipboard with our names on it and they had to check us off every single time we asked to go. The whole thing started because some kids were apparently vaping in the bathrooms. So instead of dealing with those specific kids, the administration decided to punish everyone. They hired Mrs. Wilson as the bathroom monitor, and she took her job way too seriously. This woman would literally stand outside the bathrooms timing how long we were in there. By November, half the school was walking around looking like they were about to explode. My friend Connor actually wet himself during third period math because he already used his two bathroom passes for the day. The teacher just ignored him and kept teaching while this poor kid sat there humiliated. That's when Emma had enough. She was this quiet girl who never caused trouble, but she was also the smartest kid in our grade. During lunch, she pulled out the student handbook and started reading through all the bathroom policies. He found something interesting on page 47. The rules said students were limited to two bathroom visits per day, but it didn't say anything about how long each visit could be. Emma realized we could technically stay in there for hours as Long as we only went twice, Emma started spreading the word. She told us to bring books next, whatever we needed. The plan was simple, make each bathroom visit count. So we did exactly that. The next Monday, I grabbed a sandwich and my history textbook before asking for my first bathroom pass. I stayed in there for 45 minutes, studying for my quiz next period. When I came back, my teacher looked annoyed.

Tasha and Max have been fighting over their seven year old daughter, Lila for almost a year. Max kept saying Tasha's new boyfriend was a bad influence, while Tasha claimed Max let Lila eat nothing but chicken nuggets and fall asleep watching scary movies every night. The judge decided to bring Lila into his chambers to ask what she liked about staying with each parent. Nothing too serious, just basic questions to understand her routine. Lila bounced into the room wearing a bright pink dress with unicorns on it, swinging her legs from the big chair and grinning at everyone. The judge smiled and asked her, do you have fun when you stay with your daddy? Lila nodded enthusiastically, oh yes! Daddy lets me wear makeup to the stripper place. The entire room went dead silent. Max turned bright red and his lawyer actually choked on his coffee. Tasha's mouth dropped open and her attorney started scribbling notes furiously. The judge's eyebrows shot up so high they almost hit his hairline. The what place? Judge asked very carefully. The stripper place. Lila chirped happily, completely oblivious to the chaos she just caused. It has really loud music and colourful lights, and they give us popcorn and cotton candy. The ladies wear super pretty costumes like tigers and butterflies, and they climb up really high and dance around these big poles. Max was frantically mouthing, it's not what it Sounds like to his lawyer. While making choking gestures, Tasha looked like Christmas morning had arrived early. The judge leaned forward and asked Lila to tell him more about this place. She was thrilled to explain, well, we eat snacks and watch the ladies practice their flips and twirls. Then I get to try it, too. They put this harness thing on me, and I spin around like a princess. Daddy says the place is called pole and play and it's where strong ladies exercise.

Yeah, like an hour ago. Why? He dropped to his knees right there on the kitchen floor. For a second, I thought he was joking, but then he started dry heaving into the sink. She ate it. The whole thing. His voice cracked. He ran out to the bathroom, slamming the door. That's when Delilah burst through the front door, still in her dental hygiene scrubs. She must have left work early. Where's Killian? She asked, breathless. He texted to call 9 1 1 and something about you eating the last slice. Delilah pounded on the bathroom door. Killian, baby, what's wrong? He came out, eyes red, and showed her something. Delilah's face went from worried to devastated in seconds. Now. Oh, she whispered. No, no, no. My phone buzzed. It was our landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. My stomach cramped suddenly, sharp enough to double me over the chocolate cake. Another wave of nausea hit, and I barely made it to the kitchen kitchen sink. My roommate Damien rubbed my back, which was so out of character, I'd have laughed if I wasn't puking. She's been waiting two years to eat that cake, Killian muttered, looking at Delilah, who was now sitting on the floor, crying her eyes out. Two years for what? I gasped between heaves. Nobody answered. My phone rang. It was my mom. Hey, I'm So disappointed in you. How could you do this? She hung up before I could ask what she was talking about. We need to go to the hospital, Killian said. Now. What? Why? It's just food poisoning. Delilah stood up, her face pale. It's not food poisoning. Please, just trust me. We need to go now. Killian was already grabbing his keys. The cramping was getting worse. In the car, Delilah wouldn't even look at me. Killian kept checking his phone and wincing at whatever he saw. What was in that cake? I asked again, starting to panic. The pain was spreading. Delilah finally spoke, her voice hollow. My future just. We'll deal with it at the hospital, Killian said. At the ER, Killian ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. Delilah looked like she might cry or scream or both. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine. We need to check your stomach contents immediately. For food poisoning? He exchanged a look with Killian and Delilah. Not exactly. Let's just see what we find. A nurse started prepping an IV. Any allergy Jeez I should know about? She asked. Medications? Latex. She paused, looking at her clipboard. Reactions to platinum or white? Gold. No, I answered, completely confused. They made everyone leave the room while they X rayed my abdomen. The Doctor studied the image on his tablet, zooming in on something. Killian's mom appeared in the doorway. She looked at me like I'd killed her dog. Is it still intact? She asked the doctor. It's been in my family for 90 years. The room went silent except for the beeping machines. Delilah finally looked at me, her face a mask of controlled rage. There's definitely a metallic object in your stomach, he whispered. I stared at him. A what? Delilah's face went red with anger. You ate my engagement ring. I what? Killian cleared his throat. I hid Grandma's ring in your favorite cake. I was going to propose. That was my cake from my boyfriend for our anniversary. It was on the middle shelf. The words tumbled out as my brain tried to catch up. That's the communal shelf. Everyone knows that. I was saving it for tonight. Delilah's voice rose. You. You literally have your own shelf. Your name is on it in purple Sharpie. My stomach gurgled again. The ring was in there, supposedly worth thousands of dollars. Floating around with a chocolate cake I thought was communal property. The doctor handed me a bottle of thick white liquid. This should speed things along. You'll need to and everything to recover the ring. Delilah started crying. Killian was still listing everything he had planned. His mom was facetiming with angry relatives. My roommate texted me. This is why I label everything, even my water bottles now. Next. Time, I told Killian as another cramp hit. Maybe just use a ring box like a normal person. There won't be a next time. Delilah screamed. The doctor cleared his throat. Well, this is certainly going to be an insurance nightmare, destroying property worth thousands. You're a thief! Killian's mom's fat. Delilah wiped her tears. Your type always takes what isn't theirs. As I sat there with the laxatives, I remembered something. Something that would make them regret how they treated me. I reached for my phone in my pocket and pulled out the photo gallery, scrolling back to yesterday afternoon. There it was, the chocolate cake, sitting right on the middle shelf of our fridge, with my handwritten note taped to the white bakery box that said Happy Anniversary, Brandon. Love me in blue pen. I turned the screen toward them and watch their faces change. Killian went white first, then his mom, then Delilah, who grabbed the phone from my hand to look closer. The time stamp showed three forty seven PM yesterday, clear as day. Killian started opening and close, closing his mouth like a fish, trying to find words that wouldn't come out. He finally managed to stammer about how Delilah had mentioned wanting chocolate cake last week and he just assumed when he saw it. His mom snatched my phone from Delilah's hands, holding it close to her face and squinting

My 12 year old daughter Adeline takes the bus home from school every day. She's always been chatty about her day. But last week something changed. She started mentioning this nice man who always sits behind her and asks about her homework, her friends, what she likes to do after school. Red flags everywhere. At first I thought maybe she was just being friendly. But then Adeline said he'd complimented her hair and asked if she walked home alone from the bus stop. When she told me he knew which stop was hers, even though he never got off there, my stomach dropped. I decided to follow the bus route in my car the next afternoon. Sure enough, there's this guy in his 40s who gets on at the stop right after Adeline's school. He's not dressed like someone heading to work, no briefcase, no uniform, just sitting there in a baseball cap watching the kids. I followed the bus for three stops. He never got off, just rode it to the end of the route, then walked back to his car parked at the school. When Adeline told me he'd offered her candy and asked where exactly we lived, including what our house looks like, I knew I had to act fast. The next morning I called in sick to work and got on that bus myself, sat three rows behind him with sunglasses and a hoodie up. Adeline didn't even Notice me boarding? I watched him scan every kid getting on, but his eyes locked on Adeline the moment she stepped up those bus steps. He immediately moved to the seat directly behind her and started his routine. How was school today, sweetheart? Did you think about what I said yesterday about our little secret? Adeline looked uncomfortable but was trying to be polite. Um, I guess so. Good girl. Smart girls like you deserve special treats. Maybe we could meet up sometime when your parents aren't around. I know a place near your house where we could talk. That's when I stood up. Walk.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee, With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

She could pack an entire house in 48 hours, make friends at every new base within a week, and somehow kept three kids fed, clothed and in school through 8 different moves. She ran every FRG meeting while dad was deployed, organized care packages for the whole unit and never missed sending him his favorite beef jerky. Even when money was tight, she was the one other spouses called at 3:00am when they couldn't handle another night alone. Dad was coming up on his 20 years and mom had been planning for this moment since deployment No. 3. She'd saved every penny she could, researched real estate in Colorado where her sister lived, even picked out the exact house she wanted with the wrap around porch. Just one more year, she kept saying, then we can finally plant roots for a real home. The kids can finish high school in one place. The reenlistment ceremony was supposed to be next Tuesday. Mom thought it was Dad's retirement ceremony. She'd invited her whole family from Colorado, bought a new dress. Hell, she even made a photo album of all our moves titled The Journey to home. I helped her glue every picture. There was one of her crying in the driveway of our first base housing, pregnant with me. Another of her painting my sister's room for the fourth time in a different house. He written little notes under each one, things Like move No. 3 left behind the garden I planted and move No. 6, Tommy's best friend stayed here. But here's the thing, nobody knew dad had already re enlisted three months ago, signed another six years without saying poop. And that wasn't even the worst part. Mom found out at the FRG Christmas party. We were all there. The whole battalion family thing, kids running around with cookies, some Colonel's wife talking about resilience or whatever. Mom was helping serve punch when she overheard two lieutenant's wives gossiping by the dessert table. Did you see Major Wilson with Captain Brooks at the P X yesterday? They weren't even trying to hide it anymore. The other one laughed. 20 years his wife's been waiting and he's spending his reenlistment bonus on jewelry for another woman. Mom's hand froze on the ladle. I watched her face change real slow like watching ice form on a window. She sat down the punch walked straight across that community center and stood right in front of dad. He was laughing with some other officers by the Christmas tree. Is it true? That's all she said. Real quiet. Everyone around them stopped talking. Dad's face did this thing where he tried to look confused. Honey, what are you the re enlistment? Captain Brooks, is it true? The whole room was dead silent. Even the kids stopped running around. You could hear the shitty Christmas music playing from someone's phone. Dad straightened his uniform, looked her Right in the eye. We should discuss this at home. Mom laughed. Not a real laugh, the kind that makes your skin crawl. Twenty years, 20 years I've waited for you to come home. Really come home. Not just between deployments, not just for a weekend home. Her voice was getting louder. I've been the married single mother. I've been the mover, the, the keeper of everything while you played soldier. And you couldn't even tell me you signed away six more years of my life. Some colonel tried to step in, saying something about maintaining decorum. Mom turned on him. Decorum, decorum. Where was decorum when I was in labor with our second child and he was in a rock? Where was decorum when I had to explain to our son why daddy missed his high school graduation for a training exercise? She turned back to dad and Brooks. Really? She's 23 years old. Dad's jaw tightened. Linda, you're being hysterical. This is what military wives do. You knew what you signed up for. Maybe if you understood. Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Mom pulled out her phone, started scrolling. Let me tell you about sacrifice. I have 4,000 photos on this phone. You're in 217 of them. I know because I counted. I counted. While you were deployed. Again, she threw the phone at his chest, bounced off his medals. I sacrificed my career, my family, my friends, my sanity, my children's stability, everything. For what? So you could fuck your Co worker and sign up for more years without asking. You're embarrassing yourself, had said. Picking up her phone from the floor. And me in front of my command, mom nodded real slow. You're right. I am embarrassing myself, believing for 20 years that this would end, that I mattered as much as your precious career. She looked around the room at all the other wives. Some were crying, most were just staring. How many of you are waiting for retirement, too? How many of you think it'll be different when they hit 20? Nobody answered. Mom walked over to the dessert table, picked up the sheet cake that said Merry Christmas, 4th Battalion families in red and green frosting, walked back to dad and dumped the entire thing on his dress blues. The frosting hit his medals with this wet splat sound that made Katie gasp. Behind me. Red and green icing dripped down on Dad's chest, onto his shiny shoes, while chunks of yellow cake stuck to his ribbons. The whole room just froze, 300 people watching cake slide off major David Wilson's dress blues onto the waxed floor of the Fort Carson Community Center. Colonel Miller pushed through the crowd and stopped right in front of dad, his face turning purple. He didn't even look at mom, just stared at the mess on Dad's uniform and said real quiet that dad better be in his office at 0, 600.

Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared and I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey, you looked hot today. You were watching me. It's kind of weird. Rizz app, respond with, how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow, that actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. So tell me about this girl. You like her name? Is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken, sadly. Do you know her, violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today? Ah. Does someone miss me in your dreams? I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Sure. Ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people, you are such a kind soul, polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey, hey, can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way, but I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to, someone who understands me, someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I hope we will. Be together. Me too. Mystery Girl, can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

It happened during second. The intercom buzzed like usual, but instead of the typical announcements, we heard our vice principal's shaky voice. All seniors, please report to the auditorium immediately. Bring your phones and school IDS. Teachers, this is not a drill. I looked around as the class froze. Even our teacher looked rattled. Something was wrong. As we entered the auditorium, security guards were stationed by every exit. A row of unfamiliar adults sat at the front with laptops. Principal Mister Granger step to the mic. There has been a serious breach of our academic integrity policy, he began. Effective immediately, all senior students devices will be searched. Gasps erupted. Some kids laughed nervously, others panicked. Yesterday, Mister Ranger continued, we discovered a shared Google Drive folder containing answer keys to every major exam from the past two years, including finals. Whispers turned into full on murmuring. Based on digital evidence, the folder was accessed by over 120 student accounts. We are investigating all logins, I P addresses and messages linked to this ring. One of the tech guys stood up and started calling out names. Each student had to hand over their phone and Chromebook and sit in a designated section. My name was called. I hadn't seen the folder, never even heard of it. But apparently someone had shared it with everyone in a certain group chat. Even opening the link made you guilty by association. As I handed over my Phone, my hands shook. It had my whole life in it. The auditorium turned into a courtroom. Over the next two hours, more names were read, more devices collected. Some students started crying. One guy vomited in the back row. I sat next to my bed.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my but dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop by the third lesson we discovered his pattern because nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed he said when I veered slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson that is three 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

I thought I was being a genius parent when my 11 year old son Wyatt kept begging me for money to buy Marvel rival skins every single day. He'd show me his phone with some new character outfit that cost $20 and ask if he could have it. Instead of just saying no or giving in, I decided this was the perfect chance to teach him about earning money through hard work. I spent a whole evening creating the most detailed chore chart ever. Each task had a specific dollar value based on difficulty and time. Taking out the trash was $2 while cleaning the bathroom was five. Washing dishes got $3. And picking up dog poop in the backyard earned four because nobody likes that job. I even laminated the chart and hung it on the fridge with magnets. Wyatt was so excited when I explained the system to him. He calculated that if he did every chore on the list each day, he could earn enough for a new skin in just four days. His eyes lit up when he realized he could actually get the Invisible Woman skin he'd been talking about non stop. We shook hands like business partners and I felt like parent of the year. The first week was absolutely magical. I'd come home from work to find the dishes already done and put away. His room was cleaner than it had been since we moved. In the dog poop that usually sat in the yard for days was picked up daily. He even started doing extra things that weren't on the chart, like organizing the garage and washing my car just to earn bonus money. I brag to everyone at work about my brilliant parenting move. My co workers were impressed and some even asked for copies of my chore chart to try with their own kids. I felt like I'd cracked the code on teaching kids responsibility while also getting help around the house. Wyatt was learning the value of hard work and I was getting a clean house without having to nag. By the second week, Wyatt had developed a whole routine. He'd wake up early to do some chores before school, then knock out the rest right when he got home. He kept track of his earnings in a little notebook and would show me his running total each night at dinner. It was more organized than most adults I knew and I was genuinely proud of him. Everything was going perfectly until I came home on a Tuesday afternoon to find the house exactly as I'd left it that morning. Dishes were piled in the sink and Wyatt's backpack was thrown on the floor instead of hung up. I figured maybe he was sick or had a lot of homework, so I didn't say anything at first. But when I went to let the dog out, I saw three days worth Of poop in the yard. I found Wyatt in his room playing Marvel rivals on his computer. When I asked about the dishes and dog poop, he didn't even look away from his screen.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for three hours. Then finally, Emma responds with, Oof. Feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something. Suddenly, everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's, sent invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work. Jess said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story. Later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's When I decided to test them, I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident, and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no. Hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help? Tyler hearted the message. That's it? Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Jess texted me privately saying she would help, but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years, and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex, who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything. Called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up. Showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad. I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just A scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that. Stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly, and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times, and got shut down. There they were, all six of them, posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared.

You know, people say that when someone dies, they look like they're peaceful. But you didn't. You just look dead. I didn't know that you were going through that. I'm sorry. I could have helped you.

We hung your stocking up. We miss you. Today wasn't filled with laughs nor celebrating. All I heard was the cries of everyone. Mom and I were waiting for you to come into our room and jump on us and tell us to come open presents. There was none of that. And I really needed it today. It feels like everyone's spark just disappeared after you passed. Today felt so different. There was no celebrating. Just silence a lot of the time. Happy New Years, baby. I wish I could have celebrated the New Year with you. You're usually here making everyone smile and laugh. People were celebrating, but not As much as they did when you were here. Everything's just gone downhill after you passed. I love you. Hi, honey. Happy birthday. I can't believe it's been a year since you passed. We're so devastated. I wish I could have helped you. I really do. I love you so much.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff. But then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. The next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. I started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know existed. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secret bookmark folders labelled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own, reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic, how to look expensive, feminine energy that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. She started using therapy speak to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops, emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd Learned these words somewhere and weaponized them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward eighth graders and high schoolers who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. He was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids at Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history. Created fake contact names. Emma Mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult, hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she didn't insert herself into adult conversations about work, drama and relationships, offering advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences she didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16, not 11, with a whole fabricated backstory about being held back, started lying about everything. Library visits that were really mall, trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist, sleepovers at houses I'd never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music basting to cover phone conversations. She stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare, one word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow, taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an 11 year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched Father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, PTA volunteers, my neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth five more minutes like I was embarrassing her that night. I waited until she would.

My brother and I used to sneak out all the time, not for anything wild, just dumb, harmless stuff. Late night 7, 11 runs, laying on the trampoline to watch for meteors. One time we snuck out just to see if the new Taco Bell was open 24 hours. We weren't rebels, just bored kids who liked feeling like we were getting away with something. It started when I was 11 and he was 14. He'd tap three times on my wall around midnight, our signal. I tiptoe past our parents room in my socks, meet him by the laundry door and we'd sneak out like little burglars in pajamas. He always carried a backpack with snacks, flashlights and a notebook he pretended was mission logs. I think he just liked pretending we were spies. It became our tradition. Even when we weren't talking much during the day, we'd still sneak out. One time I fell asleep and missed the signal. The next morning, he left a granola bar and a sticky note in my sock drawer that said, rookie Mistake, you're on thin ice, Agent B. But as we got older, things changed, got busier with school, started driving, started dating. I assumed we just outgrown it. No more nightly missions, no more late Taco Bell disappointments. I tap on the wall sometimes just to see, but he never knocked back. Then one night, about a year after our last mission, I couldn't sleep. Too much energy. I tapped on the wall knowing it was pointless, but out of habit, I crept to the laundry room anyway and the back door was already open. I stepped outside. It was cold. Damn. The kind of quiet where even your own footsteps little too loud. I walked to the side gate and that's when I saw him sitting in the driveway, hoodie up, facing away from me. His backpack. The backpack was next to him. I almost called out, but something about the way he was sitting stopped pop me. Shoulders hunched, arms on his knees like he was holding something back. I moved closer and heard it. Quiet, shaky breathing, then a sniff. He was crying. I crouched down beside the car, not sure if I should say anything, but then I heard him mumble something under his breath. I can't do it anymore. He wiped his face on his sleeve and pulled out his phone. I peeked around the car just enough to see the screen. It was a message thread with someone in it.

A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4V d situation. He's been on tour for like, what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus, he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed, she was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was so Calm, like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary.

My son was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when he was 4. By the time he turned 7, he needed a specialized surgery that only one doctor in Boston could perform. The procedure cost $123,000, and our insurance denied coverage, calling it experimental. We'd already sold our house and moved into a tiny apartment. I was working two jobs while my husband took care of our son, whose condition was deteriorating rapidly. His lips would turn blue during even mild activity, and he'd started having fainting spells. Last month, his cardiologist called us in for an emergency appointment. His heart was failing faster than they expected. If he doesn't get this surgery within three weeks. I don't think he couldn't finish the sentence, but we understood. We were still $11,000 short, despite the gofundme and community fundraisers. I picked up a third job at an upscale hotel bar in downtown Chicago, working overnight shifts after my day jobs. I was surviving on two to three hours of sleep, but nothing mattered except getting that money. On my fifth night, I was so exhausted I could barely stand.

Every Christmas morning in our house felt like a lottery ticket that I could never win. My family had this weird tradition where my mom would write all four of our names on pieces of paper, fold them up and drop them in an old coffee mug. Whoever's name got picked would receive the golden gift, something expensive, personal or just really special. The rest of us got the usual stuff, socks with cartoon characters, a book we probably wouldn't read, or those cheap gift sets from the drugstore. When I was little, it seemed fair enough. Random chance, right? But by the time I hit 17, I started doing some basic math that made my stomach hurt. Four kids, 17 years of Christmas mornings, I had never been picked, not once. I brought it up casually one year while we were cleaning up wrapping paper. Guess I'm just really unlucky with that hat. I laughed, trying to keep it light. My mom looked up from stuffing gift bags into trash bags. Oh, honey, it's completely random. Your turn will come eventually. That year, my little brother Jake got a brand new PlayStation. I got a vanilla candle that smelled like the inside of a department store. I smiled, played along, helped Jake set up his console like the good big sister I was supposed to be. But something was bothering me and I couldn't shake it. The next few Christmases, I started paying closer attention. The pieces of paper never looked quite the same size. Some were folded differently. And my mom always seemed to fumble around in that mug for longer than necessary, like she was feeling for something specific. Christmas Eve when I was 19, I waited until everyone went to bed. House was quiet except for the furnace kicking on and the occasional creak of settling wood. I crept downstairs to where the coffee mug sat on the kitchen counter, already prepared for tomorrow's drawing. My hands were shaking as I reached inside one piece of paper, just one. I unfolded it slowly, already knowing what I'd find, Jake's name written in my mom's careful handwriting. I stood there in my pajamas holding this piece of paper under the dim light from the stove, feel filling 17 years of disappointment crash over me all at once. It had never been random. It had never been fair. I was just the kid they forgot to love properly. I went upstairs. I grabbed my own paper and pen and wrote out all four names. I folded them exactly the same way, made sure they felt identical. Then I went back downstairs and dumped Jake's name in the trash before putting the real lottery in the mug. Christmas morning, I watched my mom's face as she reached into the mug for the first time ever. She looked confused. He pulled out a name, looked at it, then glanced back. At the mug, like something was wrong. Emma, she announced, her voice flat. My siblings cheered. My dad patted my shoulder. Jake looked genuinely happy for me, which somehow made it worse. My mom handed me a small wrapped box with this forced smile that didn't reach her.

Hi. Um, this is gonna sound really strange. Um, we don't know each other, but I was out running and I found somebody's phone, and I'm trying to track down who it belongs to. And so I was, I just started calling people in this phone, and I wanted to make sure whoever lost it gets their phone back. Okay, so I called you because whoever's phone this is just texted you a couple days ago. So basically, I called you cause I was hoping maybe you could help me find them. Oh, I got you. Um, well, the number you're calling from doesn't come up as one of my contacts, so I'm not really sure whose phone you have. Right, well, no, I, I, I'm not calling from the actual phone because I didn't want to use up their minutes or anything. So can I, can I just read you a text real quick, and then maybe you can look through your text conversations and tell me who sent it to you? Um, sure. Okay. Uh, hang on a second. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so, um, they sent you a message a few days ago, whoever this is, that said, um, that's fine, but I'm paying next time. You earned it. And then it has a heart and a winky face, so I assume maybe it was your wife or your girlfriend or something, cause that's, that's, that's why I called you. Well, it's not my wife. Cause I'm not married. But, yeah, I, I know whose phone that is. Oh, okay, great. Um, is there any way you could possibly give me their name so I can look up their address to kind of return their phone to them? Not really comfortable giving out her information. Um, maybe you could just turn it into the cops or something, and I can get a hold of her and let her know they have it. Okay, I gotcha. I didn't think about the fact that, like, trying to track down a woman I've never met is kind of creepy. No, no, it's cool. I, I mean, it's, it's nice that you're doing the right thing. I just don't think she'd want me giving out her personal info like that. I, I understand. Um, one more thing, though. Um, why does this phone number come up as Chris when it calls you? I'm sorry, what? When this phone that I found, when it calls you or text you, why does it come up as Chris? You just said this was a woman's phone. How. How do you know that? How do I know it's a woman's phone? You just told me it

My younger sister, Ariana, turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent even, like singing next to Kevin. At every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind, since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak. When I was out of town, she needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me immediately, showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say, and I agreed. Until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am, and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot! I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. Actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh my God, Kevin, you're so muscular! She giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we

Y'all were always talking, laughing at dumb stuff, venting, being weird together, making the most unhinged inside jokes that nobody else would get. And now they're just gone. Not even gone, like we grew apart, but like replaced. Like they found a new group and suddenly forgot you existed. And they swear they still care, but the I'm going to sleep early is getting old, especially when I see you online, in games, in calls with your new little friend group. Like, bro, I'm not stupid. I see the green dot, I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stop choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now. Like I'm being kept around just in case the new group drops you or switches up. Like I'm the in case of emergency friend. I'm not a fostering safety net. You used to need me. Now I'm just convenient when you're bored. And I see it, I feel it and it sucks. But you know what? I'm done begging for space in your life. I'm done waiting for a text back just to see you on Facetime with the new crew. I'm done being loyal to someone who already left me without saying a word. So yeah, it hurts. It hurts like hell, but I'm not gonna sit here and cry over someone who doesn't miss me. I'm gonna wipe my tears, put on lip gloss or Chapstick, whatever, and remind myself I'm not the problem you fumbled. I was a real one. And when that new group starts acting funny, when you remember what it felt like to have someone who actually cared, just know this friendship doesn't do returns.

No, I don't really listen to the radio. Okay, well, that's a good idea. Did I like win something or what? No, you didn't. Um, listen and you could still win Colin. We do a segment on this show it's called The 2nd Date Update that's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not wanting to see them after they can email us to get you on the phone and ask why so we recently got an email about you. Alright, is this like a like a game show or something? I I mean, I guess sort of yeah, like a dating game show. Yeah, it's a second date game show right now. Alright, cool. Let's do it. No, it is not actually a game show like we're not gonna you're not gonna compete for a prize here. Well, maybe you're competing for a prize. I don't know anyway, we got an email about you from a girl named Amy that you went to a winery with oh, I don't really wanna be on this game show anymore. Too late Colin. You're locked in now. Amy wants to know why you don't wanna see her again. She said a lot of really nice things about you. She was Nice, but like she was, I don't like to use the word crazy, but psycho. Would you like to go with that instead? If you don't want to use crazy, that's not, that's, I mean, there are other words you could use. Maybe she's just like unhinged or something. Whoa. I feel like that's more intense than even crazy. She didn't sound unhinged when we talked to her. Do you guys talk to her? Yeah. Yeah, we talked to her. She sent us an email about your date. And when we talked to her a little bit about it, she sounded perfectly normal to me. Said that you guys had a great time and now you're like, it's obvious that you don't wanna see her again. I mean, it was like I went on a date with like two different people. So at one point of the day someone spilled something on her. I guess she started like freaking out about the spill. And I was like looking, I didn't see anything like I looked on her shirt, I looked on her like everything she was wearing like I don't see any spill. And then she's started going on like, oh, it's it's on my shoe. You see spilled water on my shoe. And I look at her shoe and I don't see anything on her shoe. Like she's with, we're going over the top and I don't even see a spill. What? So I'm like, I'm trying to like Help her. So I'm like, do you need tissues? Do you need like a napkin? Like what do you need me to do? Like I tried to be really helpful, but I'm staring at her shoes and I'm like, dude, there's nothing here. So it was just a over reaction to not spilling wine on her shoe that it was way more than an over reaction. And it got to the point where I had to take her away from the group and like calm her down because she was like flipping out about this imaginary thing. Was she about ready to like crack open a wine glass and cut somebody with it? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if she.

What are you talking about? I have appendicitis, mom. I had Katie drive me here this afternoon. I was in so much pain I could barely move. I called you and dad. Neither of you picked up. Elizabeth, I'll come to see you once your father gets home. Benny can't stay home alone and the hospital scare him. Your father should get back in about 2 hours. Can you hang on until then? Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious? Right now, excuse me. Ben is 12, mom, 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital. If it was Ben in the hospital, not me, you'd be here in a heartbeat. You'd drop everything, leave work, leave anything. Elizabeth, how dare you talk to me that way? How dare you be so selfish? Have some respect, mom, you don't understand. You don't respect me. You don't care about anything that I love. You only care about Ben. Do you even love me, mom? Oh, Elizabeth, you haven't noticed a single thing about my life in years. You haven't even bothered to care, mom, you haven't noticed that I have a girlfriend. Mom, we've been dating for a year. Now, we went to prom together, but you make me leave early to pick up Ben from a sleepover because he forgot his iPad at home. My girlfriend and I got into the interview recently. It's on the school website, but you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No, all you do is talk and all I do is listen. I'm done, mom. I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I am listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing, like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself and I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk. Okay. Actually, no, I will. Listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know. I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are You talking about, what are you doing?

Hi. Can I speak to Lisa, please? This is her. Hey, Lisa. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, hello. Hello. I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us and asked us to get you on the phone. Really? Mm hmm. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they email us and ask us to get that person on the phone and ask why. So you recently went out on a date with somebody that listens to our show. Um, alright. His name is George. I think you would remember going on a date with George because you also invited him to your birthday party. Oh, yes, I did. Sounds like regret in your voice right there. Yeah. You have a second to talk to us about George? Yeah, I have a second. Um, fortunately, yeah. So he told us about how you guys met and he went to your birthday party. He thought everything went great. And then you sent him a text message saying you didn't want to talk to him anymore. Did he do something wrong? What? You know what? He was great with my friends, but the reactions at the end of the night were just not what I expected. Did your friends not like him? They thought it was Kind of a douche or something. It wasn't my friends who reacted about him. It was, it was my parents. Oh, oh, your parents didn't like him? Yeah. Like really? Didn't like them at all. Really? Are they like really strict parents? No, they're not really overprotected. That's why it's weird that they didn't like this person. What did they say to you? Well, they told me he asked questions and they told me, he asked my mom, how many grandkids do you want? What? Yes. Was he joking? My mom said, I don't know. She didn't make it seem like he was joking. Was it in context, though, about something they were talking about? How long was he talking to your parents? He was talking them for a long time. I think he was trying to impress them or something. But he was with them for a while before I got married. My mom would not really bring up grandkids, but some of them are like, oh, my god, I can't wait till she finally gets married. Give me some grandkids. No, no, that's not my mom at all. But to add that after like the first time meeting them, and especially we just went to coffee once, like we've only been on one date. So did she get the feeling, I mean, cause I could see him talking to her, just be like, hey, do you want grandkids someday? That's cool. Yeah. But if he's like, how many Grandkids you want? Cause I'm about to do work. I'm getting ready to do work tonight with how she felt about it. Yes, that's okay. Exactly how I talk to her. But don't you think, I mean, one question like that, like it was enough to write him off. No, it was the second question that he asked my parents. The second, what else, what else did he ask your parents other than if they want grandkids? He, he asked my dad for permission to marry me. Shut up. That is not true. He had to have been joking. There's no way he did. He, he had to have been joking, though. No, my dad said he was serious. Are you sure your dad's reading it correctly? I can't imagine a guy being out, technically your second date at your birthday party and then asking your father for permission to marry you. I wish it had to happen, but it did. And is that why you sent him a text saying, I don't want to talk to you anymore? Yeah. Okay. By the way, I completely support that. If that, that's what I'd love to know if he was actually joking, though, wouldn't you? No, I, I mean, I trust my parents. Alright. Well, I'd like to ask him, and he's actually on the other line listening right now, so we can do that. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Uh, first of all, this is being blown way out. Of proportion. Way out of proportion. I was having an adult conversation with some adults about adult things. I don't know what to say right now. This whole situation is just confusing. Did you. It's really confusing to me, too, George. Did you ask her father if you could marry her? It was in the context of a fun conversation. And I was like, you know, I was just like, hey, man.

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? So she was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue?

Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay. Okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder. Yeah. Well, No. 1, I don't know why someone would do that, but I, I can think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex or she doesn't want people to know or She just want her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out why? Why is that a big deal? Yeah. Well, yeah, our name is summer. Our name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants.

You jumped so many steps by the way. Well, I know I'm going fast, but I'm looking for a long term relationship. So I'm not there to just mess around with people. And so, so you're looking for a forever pants. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't get smarty pants and you okay. You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time. No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay. But you are so many assumptions here. One that she would even take your name when you got married. Like a lot of women keep their last name and that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry To take your last name. Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. But you're Daniel Pants and you don't think summer pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay. Well, and that's it. That's the only reason. That is the biggest reason. Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing and years of great jokes. Yeah. That's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge.

We were supposed to leave for Italy the next morning. My husband's whole family was going, parents, siblings, everyone. This was supposed to be our dream vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. I was so excited since I'd never been to Europe before. But my mother in law, Valerie, has always absolutely hated me. From day one, she's made it crystal clear that she thinks I'm not good enough for her precious son. She's made my life hell for the past three years with constant passive aggressive comments and deliberate exclusions from family events. The first part, my husband just stands there and lets it happen. He never defends me, never calls her out. It's like he's terrified of Mommy dearest. For weeks leading up to this trip, Valerie had been making little comments, oh, I hope everyone's paperwork is in order. It would be such a shame if someone couldn't make it last minute. These international trips are so complicated. I started getting paranoid, but I thought I was just being crazy. Then my coworker at the print shop jokingly said, you should make a fake passport just in case she tries something. We both laughed, but honestly, something about Valerie's behaviour had me worried. So the day before we left, I actually did it. I used our high end printers at Work to create a convincing fake passport. Same photo, same info, but completely bogus. I figured if Valerie was planning something, at least I'd be prepared. That morning I was in their kitchen finishing my packing when Valerie appeared. She had this weird gleam in her eyes that immediately put me on edge. You know what, Amanda? I'm done pretending to like you, she said suddenly, her voice dripping. I've been waiting three years for the perfect moment to get rid of you. Before I could even process what was happening, she lunged for my passport sitting on the counter. I tried to grab it, but she was faster. Oops, looks like you can't come to Italy after all, she said. With the most evil smirk I've ever seen. She pulled out her kitchen lighter and set the passport on fire right there in the sink. I watched it burn completely to ash while she stood there looking absolutely triumphant. Guess you'll have to stay home while we have the time of our lives in Rome, she taunted. That's when I started laughing, full on belly deep laugh.

My billionaire uncle taught me his trick when I turned 25 and inherited his pharmaceutical company. He said never let them see the real you first. Make them fall for broke you. So I created a fake dating profile as Mike, the struggling musician, posted photos in my crappiest clothes, mentioned my time, any studio apartment and ramen diet. I even got a part time job at Guitar Center to sell the story. I matched with Emma, who seemed perfect. She was studying to be a veterinarian, drove her mom's old Corolla and always suggested cheap date spots like food trucks and free concerts in the park. She'd split, put every Bill down to the penny, insisting she knew how tight money was for musicians. After three months, I was falling hard. She'd bring me homemade lunches to Guitar Center saying she made extra and didn't want it to go to waste. Never asked about my music career or pushed me to make it big. She just seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with Broke Mike. Then she started acting strange. She disappear for hours with vague excuses about studying at the library. She'd make secretive phone calls and step outside when I was around. Once I saw expensive designer shopping bags in her backseat that she quickly covered with a blanket when she noticed me looking. I was getting paranoid. Was she cheating? Was I just her bro boyfriend while she Had some rich guy on the side. I hired a private investigator thinking she was seeing someone else. The report came back with photos that made my jaw drop. Emma entering a massive mansion with a circular driveway. Emma stepping out of a brand new Tesla Model s. Emma in an evening gown shaking hands with the mayor at some charity gala. I was curious. Here I was pretending to be poor to avoid gold diggers while she was living this secret rich life and playing me for a fool. I confronted her at what I thought was her small apartment near campus. Turns out it was just the guest house on her family's estate. Emma, who the hell are you really? She looked terrified and broke down crying. My dad owns the largest chain of veterinary hospitals in the state. My family's worth over $200 million. But every guy I've dated since high school only wanted me to fund their business ideas or introduce them to my rich friends. She wiped her eyes, mascara running. I've been living in the guest house and driving Mom's old car because I wanted to meet someone who'd like me when they thought I had nothing. You're the first person who never asked me for money or tried to impress me with expensive plans you couldn't afford. She looked at my shocked face. Please don't hate me, Mike. I know I lied, but I was just so tired of guys seeing dollar signs instead Of me. That's when I started laughing hysterically. Emma, I need to tell you something about my pharmaceutical company. Her confused expression was priceless. Remember how I said I inherited some money from my uncle? Well, he didn't just leave me money. He left me the entire company. I'm worth about $800 million. We just stared at each other in this ridiculous guest house. Two rich people who'd been pretending to be broke because we were both terrified of being used. She started laughing, too. So you're telling me I've been buying you lunch because I thought you were struggling while you've been letting me pay because you thought I was a poor vet student. Pretty.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she just mumbled it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit, just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favorite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before, not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14, Lisa. Girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser, dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea, my mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore, they were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different, scared, desperate almost. I know, I know I'll be there, her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just, just Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behavior. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point, she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped in defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality, I explained, trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. She was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money. That's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared Features even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll Have better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

Like me and my friend could be in the most tense, awkward, silent room and all it takes is one look, just one glance, and it's over for us. I'm talking courtroom silence, funeral level seriousness. And somehow in that moment, your brain's like, what if I laughed right now for absolutely no reason? And suddenly you're fighting for your life, your stomach is shaking, your eyes are tearing up and you're doing that weird wheeze cough to hide it, like hoping nobody notices. And bro, your friend isn't helping. They got that stupid smirk, biting their lip, looking anywhere but at you. And now it's a battle of who breaks first. You start doing that dramatic exhale, like breathing through your nostrils is gonna save you. And it's never a situation where you can laugh. It's like during class when the teachers yelling at the whole room talking about this isn't funny, this is serious. And now you're in the back, like trying not to burst that laugh out, trying not to make eye contact. Cause you know once you do, it's over worse, your friend starts shaking, doing that shoulder bounce laugh that's silent. And then your laugh becomes 10 x funnier cause now you're both gasping for air but making no sound, just wheezing like broken vacuums. If someone asks what's so funny, you can't even answer cause There's nothing to explain. It's just pure forbidden laughter energy at the worst possible time. To this day, I don't know how I survived those moments. Shout out to my laugh partner. We risked our lives not to laugh out loud. Tag your laugh buddy, cause y'all know the struggle.

Most people listen anyway, so congratulations, so that's awesome. Hey, I'm calling you today because we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. It's where you go out on a date with somebody, and then if you end up not calling them back after that date, they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and ask if something went wrong. We recently got an email about you from one of our listeners. Uh. Oh, his name is Chris. You guys went out for gelato. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, man. Well, Chris has been trying to get a hold of you and he's wondering why you're not calling him back. Oh, god. Oh, god, I feel so horrible. He honestly thinks I'm. I'm blowing him off. Yeah. Oh, no. Okay. He thinks that you want nothing to do with him. Oh, god, I. I lost my phone. Like, I lost my phone like four days ago or something and. And I just got it today, like, literally, like three Hours ago. I just got a new phone. That's not even a lie. I've just been, like, trying to put all my contacts back on it and everything, and. Oh, I feel so horrible that he thinks that. So are you saying you're not blowing him off? No. Oh, my god, no. I had a great time. I, I was planning on calling him, like, later today once I got all my contacts back and everything. that's pretty anticlimactic. I was hoping you had something terrible to say about him, but. Oh, no, sorry to disappoint you. I, yeah, I, I really liked him. We had a great time. Oh, that's so cute. Well, in that case, could you, like, email him or call him and tell him that I will be calling him later tonight? I could do that, but why don't you just do it yourself? Because Chris is actually on the other line listening

Hi. Can I speak to Lisa, please? This is her. Hey, Lisa. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, hello. Hello. I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us and asked us to get you on the phone. Really? Mm hmm. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they email us and ask us to get that person on the phone and ask why. So you recently went out on a date with somebody that listens to our show. Um, alright. His name is George. I think you would remember going on a date with George because you also invited him to your birthday party. Oh, yes, I did. Sounds like regret in your voice right there. Yeah. You have a second to talk to us about George? Yeah, I have a second. Um, fortunately, yeah. So he told us about how you guys met and he went to your birthday party. He thought everything went great. And then you sent him a text message saying you didn't want to talk to him anymore. Did he do something wrong? What? You know what? He was great with my friends, but the reactions at the end of the night were just not what I expected. Did your friends not like him? I thought it was Kind of a douche or something. It wasn't my friends who reacted about him. It was, it was my parents. Oh. Oh, your parents didn't like him? Yeah. Like really? Didn't like them at all. Really? Are they like really strict parents? No, they're not really overprotective. That's why it's weird that they didn't like this person. What did they say to you? Well, they told me he asked questions and they told me, he asked my mom, how many grandkids do you want? What? Yes. Was he joking? My mom said, I don't know. She didn't make it seem like he was joking. Was it in context, though, about something they were talking about? How long was he talking to your parents? He was talking to them for a long time. I think he was trying to impress them or something. But he was with them for a while before I got married. My mom would not really bring up grandkids, but some of them are like, oh, my god, I can't wait till she finally gets married. Give me some grandkids. No, no, that's not my mom at all. But to add that after like the first time meeting them, and especially we just went to coffee once, like, we've only been on one date. So did she get the feeling, I mean, cause I could see him talking to her, just being like, hey, do you want grandkids someday? That's cool. Yeah. But if he's like, how Many grandkids you want? Cause I'm about to do work. I'm getting ready to do work tonight with how she felt about it. Yes, that's okay. Exactly how I talk to her. But don't you think, I mean, one question like that, like it was enough to write him off? No, it was the second question that he asked my parents. The second, what else, what else did he ask your parents other than if they want grandkids? He, he asked my dad for permission to marry me. Shut up. That is not true. He had to have been joking. There's no way he did. He, he had to have been joking, though. No, my dad said he was serious. Are you sure your dad's reading it correctly? I can't imagine a guy being out, technically your second date at your birthday party and then asking your father for permission to marry you. I wish it had to happen, but it did. And is that why you sent him a text saying, I don't want to talk to you anymore? Yeah. Okay. By the way, I completely support that. If that, I'd love to know if he was actually joking, though, wouldn't you? No, I, I mean, I trust my parents. Alright. Well, I'd like to ask him, and he's actually on the other line listening right now, so we can do that. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Uh, first of all, this is being blown way out of Proportion, way out of proportion. I was having an adult conversation with some adults about adult things. I don't know what to say right now. This whole situation is just confusing. Did you. It's really confusing to me, too, George. Did you ask her father if you could marry her? It was in the context of a fun conversation. And I was like, you know, I was just like, hey, man.

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? So she was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue?

It's just she lied. She lied. Whoa. About what? Uh, actually, let me rephrase that. She wasn't 100% truthful with me. Okay. Okay. Who is on a first date? Let's be honest. Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay. Okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder. Yeah. Well, No. 1, I don't know why someone would do that, but I, I can think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex or she doesn't want people to know or She just want her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out why? Why is that a big deal? Yeah. Well, yeah, our name is summer. Our name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants.

And so, so you're looking for a forever pants. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't get smarty pants and you okay. You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time. No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay. But you are so many assumptions here. One that she would even take your name when you got married. Like a lot of women keep their last name and that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry To take your last name. Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. But you're Daniel Pants and you don't think summer pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay. Well, and that's it. That's the only reason. That is the biggest reason. Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing and years of great jokes. Yeah. That's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussion. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money. She'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. Never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

So my daughter Emma is 15 and has been dating this kid, Noah, for about four months now. Every time they go out, Noah pays movies, dinner, ice cream, even when Emma wants to grab something from the gas station. At first I figured, whatever, teenage boys like to show off. But then I started hearing conversations between Emma and my wife where my wife would literally say things like, oh, honey, that's so sweet. He's such a gentleman and you should never have to pay when you're with a boy. Last week was when it really hit me. Emma comes home talking about how Noah spent 40 bucks taking her to some fancy burger place downtown. I asked her if she offered to split it. And she looked at me like I had three heads. She goes, dad, why would I do that? Mom says boys are supposed to pay for dates. I confronted my wife about it that night and she got all defensive, started going on about how it's traditional and romantic and how Noah's family has money anyway, so it's fine. I told her she's basically teaching our daughter to be a gold digger. And that shut down the conversation real quick. But it kept happening. Emma would come home bragging about expensive stuff Noah bought her a new phone case. Some jewelry, taking her to the movies every weekend. The kid was probably spending his entire part time job paycheck on my daughter. Things got really bad when Emma mentioned wanting to go to homecoming. She starts talking about the dress she wants, which costs like $200, casually mentions that Noah said he'd buy it for her along with paying for dinner in the limo. I asked her how much all of that would cost and she just shrugged and said, I don't know. That's Noah's problem. That's when I lost it. I sat both Emma and my wife down and told them this had to stop. I explained that Noah is a 16 year old kid working at a grocery store making minimum wage, not some sugar daddy. Emma got all upset and said I was being mean and that all her friends, boyfriends pay for everything, too. My wife backed her up saying I was being old fashioned and that it's normal for boys to want to spoil their girlfriends. I told them both they were living in fantasy land and that Emma needed to start contributing to dates or I'd have a conversation with Noah's parents about what was happening. The whole thing came to a head when Noah's mom called me last week. Turns out the poor kid had been stressed about money and finally told his parents he was spending everything he earned on Emma.

Did it ever come back to bite your parents? So my older sister, Sarah, was the star. She was a genius, a violin player and basically collected awards. I was also there. The biggest example was my 10th birthday. I woke up so excited. It's the big 1:00. I went downstairs and my parents were rushing around making a big breakfast. My dad ruffled my hair and said, big day today, champ. I was beaming. Then he handed me a poster and a marker pen. It said, go, Sarah, good luck at the state finals. It was for her academic decathlon. The breakfast was for her. My mom didn't even say happy birthday. She just told me not to get any syrup on Sarah's lucky blazer. I spent the whole day in the stands holding the poster while they cheered for her. When we got home, I thought maybe there'd be a surprise and there was a cake in the fridge. Felt a rush of relief. But when my mom pulled it out, it was a small cupcake with a single candle. She lit it and gave it to Sarah. I asked why. My mom said, for good luck on her final question tomorrow. Make a wish, sweetie. They completely, totally forgot. I went to bed that night having not heard the words happy birthday once. A few years went by and things stayed pretty much the same. Sarah was getting acceptance letters from colleges. And my parents were already planning to frame them. One evening, my dad brings out this old dusty shoebox from the top of his closet. He gets all excited and says, remember this, our family memory box. We all put something in here on New Year's Day, the year you turned 10. He remembered the box, but not the day we made it. He opens it up and my mom starts pulling things out. There was Sarah's first place ribbon from that same academic decathlon. There was a newspaper clipping about the local weather. There was a little note my mom wrote about her hopes for the New Year. Then my dad pulled out the last thing. It was a cheap plastic wrapped DVD. On the front, in my dad's own handwriting, it said, Alex's 10th birthday surprise. Do not watch until dinner. It was a home movie he had made for me. He had spent weeks interviewing all my friends and family, asking for their favourite memories of me. It was all meant to be a big surprise for my birthday dinner, the one we never had. The room went completely silent. My mom just stared at the DVD in his hand. My dad slowly looked at me, then at the box.

It started when we were kids. Didn't matter where we were, grocery store, gas station, school parking lot, one of us would shout, last one to the car is a loser. And it was on. No warning, no mercy, full sprint. We treated it like the Olympics. If you tripped, too bad. If you had a backpack on, sucks to be you. The car was the finish line and victory tasted like smug laughter and sibling pride. I had more wins, but only barely. My sister was scrappy. She once dove over the hood just to beat me by half a second. Our parents hated it. You're gonna dent the car, someone's gonna get run over. But they always smiled when they said it. Deep down, I think they liked seeing us act like idiots. We kept it going even as we got older. At 13, it was still funny. At 16, it was nostalgic. Even at 19, when we were both back from our first semesters of college, we did it in the target parking lot. I won that one, but only because she tripped over her own shoelace. She laughed the whole way to the passenger seat, flipping me off with both hands. It became our thing, a weird little tradition only we cared about no matter what, holidays, weekend trips, even funerals. Once we found a moment for it, it was like a way to say I still see you without actually saying it. Then I guess it just faded. I didn't notice it at first. One afternoon we came out of a movie theater and I instinctively yelled it. She just smiled, shook her head and walked to the car. I figured she was tired. Another time I tried it at the mall, she waved me off. You win, she said, already unlocking the door. It didn't hit me as weird until a few months later. We were at our cousin's wedding. The whole family was.

I live with this guy Brett who thinks he's way smarter than everyone else. he's the type of dude who corrects people's grammar in group chats and always has to one up whatever story you're telling. The problem started when I got this new job at a warehouse that starts stupid early. I'm talking 5:00am shifts, which means my alarm goes off at 4:45. Now. Brett works from home doing some tech thing and doesn't wake up until like 10. So you think this wouldn't affect him at all since his room is on the other side of our apartment? But no. This guy starts complaining after my second day. Says my alarm is too loud and it's disrupting his precious sleep schedule. I'm like dude, it's literally three beeps and I turn it off immediately. Plus your room is down the hall with the door closed. He keeps whining about it for like two weeks. Even left me this passive aggressive note on the fridge about being considerate of roommates and proper sleep hygiene. The note was color coded. Who does that? Then I noticed something weird. Every morning when my alarm went off I'd hear this mad scrambling from his room followed by his door slamming and the shower turning on. At first I thought maybe he was just getting up to pee or whatever, but it happened Every single day at the exact same time. One morning, I was running late and forgot to grab my coffee mug from the kitchen. I went back to get it. I saw Brett's bathroom door was cracked open, and he was just standing there in the shower, fully clothed, scrolling through his phone. Not even wet, just standing there like an idiot. That's when it clicked. This dude was sprinting to the bathroom every morning to block me from using the shower. See, we only have one bathroom, and he knew I needed to shower before work. He figured if he got there first, I'd be late and eventually have to change my schedule or find a new job or whatever. The thing is, I had been showering at night specifically because I knew mornings would be rushed. I didn't even need the bathroom. But Brett's big brain assumed I'd have to shower in the morning like a normal person. So this guy had been jolting awake at 4:45 a m. Every day for two weeks, running across the apartment in his underwear, and then standing in a cold shower for 30 minutes just to spite me. Meanwhile, I'm getting ready in my room. Completely unaware of his master plan, I decided to have some fun with it. Started setting my alarm five minutes earlier each day just to see how far I could push it. By the end of the week, Brett was speed walking to the bathroom at 4:25 a m, and I could hear him shivering in there because he was too proud to turn on the hot water and give away his scheme.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year, and when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything fifty fifty, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back, thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird, serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking, and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself, and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue, because, honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved, like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything, and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. The 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine. The leather couch we're always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff, like my clothes and my desk. I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target, and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realized she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing. That

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilet at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding. For five years, he was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway, and I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free, obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me. About abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said I'd think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mr. Thief had told me. Success is the best.

Call your mom right now. My blood went cold because Mister Chen had never spoken to me in three years of riding his bus. He was gripping the wheel so tight his hands were shaking. I pulled out my phone with trembling fingers, while the other kid kept talking about tomorrow's game, completely oblivious. My mom answered on the first ring, but it wasn't her voice. Hello, sweetie. A man with a thick accent was using her phone. Your mother is busy right now. She wants you to come straight home. No stops. I couldn't speak. In the background, I heard my mom scream, don't come home! Run! The mine went dead. Mister Chen was already on his radio. Code red on Bus 19. I need police at every upcoming stop now! He locked eyes with me in the mirror. Get down on the floor! Don't let them see you through the window. I dropped between the seats, my heart hammering. Other kids started panicking, but Mister Chen's voice cut through. Everyone down! This is not a drill. Through the gap under the seat, I saw we'd blown past my stop. A white van was parked in my usual spot, engine running, sliding door open. Three men in ski masks were standing beside it, and one was holding what looked like zip ties. My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown Number? We have your parent. Get off the bus at the next stop or they die. You have 60 seconds. Photo came through. My parent bound and gagged in what looked like our basement. My dad's face was bloody. Mr. Chen must have seen my face because he grabbed my phone and read it. It's a trap. Trust me, kid. I've seen this before. Seen what before? I sobbed. Your dad isn't who you think he is. He made a hard turn. Tires screaming. Neither am I. Two more white vans appeared, boxing us in. Mister Chen didn't slow down. Instead, he reached under his dashboard and pulled out something I'd only seen in movie. A satellite phone. Phoenix is compromised assets. Family has been taken. Requesting immediate extraction for the package. He glanced at me. Yes, the package is secure. On route to Safe House 7. Package? I was the package. The white vans rammed us from both sides. Kids were screaming. Mister Chen drove like a stunt driver, using the bus's weight to push through. Your dad saved my daughter's life in Afghanistan. He said, never taking his eyes off the road. I promised I'd protect you if his cover was ever blown. Cover? What cover? Your dad's been investigating the Coslov trafficking ring for 5 years. Someone leaked his identity this morning. These aren't kidnappers. They're Russian Mafia. A helicopter appeared overhead. For a second, I thought we were saved. Then Mister Chen swore in a language I didn't recognize the helicopter was theirs. New plan. He handed me a backpack from under his seat. When I stop, you run to the red door of the building on your left. Don't look back. Don't stop. Someone will be waiting. What about my parent? They're not at your house. That photo was staged. Your parents are already in witness Protection. Have been since 6 a m. The agents at the house are decoys. The bus lurched to a stop. Mister Chen hit a button, and the emergency exit flew open. Go now! I ran harder than I'd ever run, the backpack bouncing behind me. I heard gunshot. I didn't look back. The red door opened before I reached it. A woman in tactical gear pulled me inside, and we went straight to a hidden elevator. Your bus driver, I guess. Retired Navy. S

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in, shouting at me. Where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie, and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls. Everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbook, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached, and the latest iPhone Pro Max. She was on the phone, twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer, I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. Although those family treasures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. Oh, that. I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is due. Tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing on Bella's shopping bag. Scatter across the living room floor. His gaze moved from the designer handbag to her new clothes, to the phone in her hand. I could see him trying to process what he was seeing. Dad, I said calmly, Bella found the $15,000 and spent it all today. The color drained

They forgot the exit clause in my founders agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation. Just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen toast getting cold while reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises, and late nights, and this is how they repay me? Like I was just another line item to cut? The email came from Jennifer Walsh, some 28 year old VP who probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgage my house three times to keep payroll running in 0 8. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce Insisted on it back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want to kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? 3 hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was typically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR, 4 5 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founder's agreement. Please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked, sipping my tea, watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The claws. The 25 million claws. Please tell me this is some kind of mistake. Oh, that. No mistake. Yes. 72 business hours. Starts now. Wire instructions are attached to My original no email. Ellen, you have to understand. This could bankrupt the company. The board is an emergency session. Stock price is already dropping on rumors. I let that sink in for a moment. Funny how bankruptcy works, isn't it? One day you're cutting pensions to boost quarterly numbers. The next day you're explaining to shareholders why your cost cutting measure just triggered a 25 million dollar penalty. We can negotiate. The contract doesn't mention negotiations, David. It says 72 business hours. That's Thursday at 5 p m. I hung up and made myself another cup of tea. By Wednesday morning, three different law firms had called the local news.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my and Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying, I couldn't just bring home random animals. We're so mad they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the First Night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently paw at my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realized it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mister Peterson looked shocked. I told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counselor, because I'd been missing So many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice

I was on a five hour flight to visit my aunt in Denver, and I'd specifically paid extra for an aisle seat in the second to last row. I have Crohn's disease, which means sometimes I need to get to the bathroom fast. Like, really fast. This wasn't some random choice I'd Learned the hard way after a few mortifying incidents. Right before boarding, this pregnant woman walks up to me at the gate. She's probably six or seven months along. Not like she's about to give birth or anything. She taps my shoulder and goes, excuse me, I need your seat. I'm pregnant and need to be close to the bathroom. I looked at her boarding pass. She had a middle seat toward the front of the plane. I'm thinking, okay, she didn't plan ahead, but that's not really my problem. I told her politely, I'm sorry, but I have medical issues, too, and specifically booked this seat. He rolled her eyes and said, what kind of medical issues could you possibly have? You look fine. I'm not about to explain my digestive problems to a stranger. So I just said, it's medical, and I paid extra for this seat. That's when she got loud, this is ridiculous. I'm carrying a baby and you're being selfish. Other passengers started looking over. I felt my face getting red, but held my ground. When we boarded, she made sure to Get on right behind me. As I'm putting my bag in the overhead bin, she starts again. FLIGHT attendant this man won't give up his seat to a pregnant woman. Can you make him move? The flight attendant this tired looking woman, probably in her fifties between us. Sir, would you be willing to switch seats with this passenger? I explained the whole situation again, how I'd specifically booked and paid for this seat because of my medical condition. The flight attendant asked if there were any other aisle seats available. There weren't. The flight was completely full. The pregnant woman started getting more aggressive. What medical condition? You're just being difficult. I really need to be near the bathroom. I told her that if bathroom access was medically necessary for her pregnancy, she should have booked an appropriate seat or spoken to her doctor about accommodations. This set her off completely. She started yelling about how I was discriminating against pregnant women and that she was going to report me. Other passengers were definitely watching. Now some guy a few rows up shook his head at me like I was the worst person alive. The flight attendant tried to calm her down, but eventually said there was nothing they could do if I wasn't willing to switch and there were no other seats available. The pregnant woman stomped to her middle seat, muttering loud enough for everyone to hear about selfish jerks and what's wrong with people these days. About two hours into the flight, I had to use the bathroom urgently. As I'm walking back to my seat, the pregnant woman stops me in the eye.

I worked at this clothing store in the mall called thread and Co. The whole place was divided into three sections. Men's, women's, and kids. I always worked the women's section, and during weekdays, I was literally the only person there. Like, completely alone in that entire half of the store. So yesterday, I clocked in with two other employees. My manager, Lisa, pulled me aside right away and goes, your dad's called the store five times asking for your schedule. Tell him to stop. I was so confused because that didn't sound like my dad at all. He's never even called me at work before, let alone five times in one day. I immediately texted him, did you call my work today? He texted back super fast, saying he'd never called my store once in his life. My stomach dropped. I had this awful feeling creeping up my spine. I walked back over to Lisa, who was holding some sweaters, and asked, do you give my dad my schedule? She said yes without even looking up. That's when I told her that wasn't my dad and she had absolutely no right giving some random stranger my work schedule. She finally looked at me and got this annoyed expression. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and it wasn't a big deal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Some random Man had been calling my workplace multiple times asking when I'd be there, and she just handed over that information. I started thinking about all the possibilities. This. Some creepy customer who'd been watching me, someone who knew where I lived. My brain was spiraling, thinking about walking to my car alone after closing shifts. The parking garage was already sketchy enough without knowing some weirdo had my exact schedule. Lisa kept folding clothes like nothing happened. She actually shrugged at me. That's when I realised she genuinely didn't understand how dangerous this was. A complete stranger now knew exactly when and where to find me. And she acted like I was overreacting. I looked around the store. It was just me, Lisa, and two other employees for the entire three section store. We were already stretched thin, and I knew if I left, they'd be completely screwed. But I also knew I couldn't stay there knowing my safety had been compromised and my manager didn't even care. I'm done, I said. I quit. Lisa's face completely changed. She dropped the sweater she was holding and started following me as I walked to get my stuff from the breakroom. Wait, you can't be serious. We're already understaffed. Please don't do this to us. But I was already taking off my name tag and grabbing my water bottle. You gave a stranger my personal information and told me I was being dramatic? I'm not staying somewhere where my safety doesn't matter. She started getting frantic, begging me not to leave. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't think about it like that. Please stay. We need you. Her voice was getting shaky. I turned around and looked at her. You need me, but you don't respect me. There's a difference. I started walking toward the exit. That's when she actually started crying. Like, full on tears streaming down her face. She was panicking about having to run the entire store with just two people. She kept apologizing and saying she'd never give out my information again, but it was too late. The thing that really got to me

The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. I've been with Rachel for four years and aged for one. She'd always been supportive during my chronic back problems, or so I thought. After my neurosurgeon recommended spinal fusion, Rachel drove me to the hospital, held my hand during prep, and was the last face I saw before anesthesia. I have a weird reaction to anesthesia. I regained consciousness quickly, but remained physically still. I became aware in recovery, maybe 30 minutes after surgery. Eyes closed, breathing slow, but I could hear everything. Then I heard Rachel's voice near my bed. He's still out, she told someone. Before I could signal I was awake, I heard her friend. Ali arrived. How did it go? Ali asked. Fine, I guess, Rachel replied, sounding annoyed rather than concerned. The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. James? I didn't know any James. Why not leave? Ali asked quietly. You're not married yet. Rachel paused, then his parents are adding me to their will next month. You know how loaded they are. The old man's health isn't great. Probably why they're updating everything. I just need to stick it out a little longer. My parents, my father, who built a construction company, From nothing. My mother, who taught school for 30 years. The people who'd welcomed Rachel with open arms and insisted on paying for our wedding. That's cold. Raw, even for you, Ali said. It's practical, Rachel replied. Four years listening to him talk about building projects and football, playing nice with his boring family. And now I have to play nurse for two months. What about James? James will wait. Once everything is legal and Richard senior kicks it, I'll be set. James can have his fun now, but he knows the score. Richard senior kicks it. My father. They were discussing my father's death like a business plan. What if Mike wakes up and hears you? Ali asked. Rachel laughed. Cold are please. They pump him so full of drugs, he'll be lucky to remember his name. Besides, he trusts me completely. It's almost too easy. I decided to keep playing unconscious. When a nurse checked my vitals, I woke up slowly, playing the part they expect did. Rachel was immediately by my side. Hey, babe. Everything went great. How are you feeling? Tired, I mumbled. I'm right here. I'll take good care of you. The next few hours, Rachel played devoted fiance perfectly. When visiting hours ended, she kissed my forehead and promised to return in the morning. As soon as she left, I called my parents. Come immediately, it's important. But I'm physically okay. They heard something in my voice and arrived in 30 minutes. I told Them. Everything. James. The will, the death planning. My mother gasped. My father's face turned red. We coordinated immediately. My friend Eric packed all Rachel's belongings into storage. A locksmith changed my apartment locks at 11 p m. My father's attorney removed Rachel from all state documents. My mother called Rachel's parents. They were horrified. I texted Rachel, change of plans. My parents are taking me home tomorrow. Don't come to the hospital. Her reply? Don't be silly, babe. I'll be there at 9:00. I didn't respond. Next

I introduced her to her fiance at my birthday party three years ago. She was crying in the bathroom because another guy had ghosted her, so I literally dragged her out to meet people. And that's when she met her fiance. I stayed up until 4:00am helping her plan the perfect way to ask him out. I held her hair back when she got sick on their first date and drove over with clean clothes. I've already spent 2,000 on the bridesmaid dress, 500 on the bridal shower, and you don't even wanna know how much on the bachelorette party that hasn't even happened yet. Then out of nowhere, she texted me, I can't imagine doing this without you. You're my sister. Here's the part that matters. My mom died eight months ago. She held me at the funeral and whispered, I'll be your family now. She held me while I sobbed until I couldn't breathe and promised we'd get through everything together. Then she text me, we need to talk. Suggest this juice bar downtown. I arrive, and she has actual printed photos spread out on the table. Their inspiration photos of the wedding party, all size 6 or smaller. She's tapping them with her manicured nail and says, you. You have three months to lose 40 pounds, or you can't be a bridesmaid. I stare at her. Bridesmaid. I'm your maid. Of honor. She shakes her head. Not anymore. And if you have a problem with that, you don't have to come at all. That's when I noticed them, her other bridesmaids, sitting two tables over, watching like it was dinner and a show. I stand up slowly and say, I understand perfectly. I'll return the dress tomorrow. She seems shocked by my calm response and start saying, don't be dramatic, I'm trying to help you. But I'm already walking out. First thing the next morning, I block her on everything. Second thing, I turn that two thousand dollar dress and get every penny back. Something about being told I'm too fat to stand next to my best friend makes me realize I've been settling for crumbs my whole life. From her, from everyone. I use the dress refund to sign up for cooking classes I've been wanting to take since college. My friend text me, just come back and lose the weight. You're being a dramatic ass. On the first day of class, I'm chopping onions and crying. The woman next to me is also aggressively chopping and crying. She says, rough day? I say, rough friend. She says, same. Mine just stole my business idea. We go for drinks after class. Three margaritas in, she mentions her uncle is selling his taco truck because he's retiring. We joke about buying it together and becoming the taco Queens of the city. A few days later, she texts, I was serious. About the truck. We meet her uncle, who shows us around. It needs work, but it runs. And he throws in all his recipes. We shake hands on 15,000 split between us. I'd saved most of that to gift my best friend her dream honeymoon to Greece. Now I'm using it to start my own dream. Meanwhile, I see the bride posting, anyone know a reliable bridesmaid asking for a friend? Every Friday night we park outside the college bars and drunk kids love us. We're booked every weekend. We've named it Misfit Tacos, and people can't get enough. My cooking friend is my actual best friend. Now. We have matching taco tattoos. The wedding happens without me. I don't check social media. That

She asked me to meet her at an Italian place. Said she had something important to discuss. She slides a laminated folder across the table.

My phone started blowing up. I went home, packed her stuff, changed the locks, put her boxes, In the mail room with a pickup deadline. Friday morning, she shows up at my work. Security escorted her out. She was in the lobby with a Powerpoint presentation, trying to show co workers Tristan's transformation plan. Friday evening, my mom calls, Honey, Marissa's here.

Saturday, her dad emails offering me a construction job with the required salary increase. Sunday, her friend shows up with a U Haul trying to take my TV, gaming console, and grandmother's China. Marissa claimed she deserved compensation for improving my apartment. Building security stopped them.

When my best friend Noah got engaged to Lauren, I was literally the one who helped pick out the ring. We spent three hours at this fancy jewelry store downtown while he stressed about every detail. Everyone kept saying Lauren and Noah were like this perfect power couple. He was super steady and patient. She was bubbly and smart as hell. And me, I was just the loyal third wheel. Basically their honorary sister at that point. But here's the thing. Nobody knew. When Noah had those really rough days at work, he didn't call Lauren. He called me. I knew his exact coffee order. Black with two sugars and oat milk foam. I knew his mom was having surgery for her hip, and he was freaking out about it. I even knew the password to his laptop because he always forgot it and would text me at random times. Lauren didn't even know what his favorite movie was. The Princess Bride. By the way. Six weeks before the wedding, I went over to Lauren's apartment to try on my bridesmaid dress. It was this ugly sage green thing that made me look like a sick plant, but whatever. While she was in the kitchen making tea, I was looking for a hairbrush in her bedroom because my hair was a complete mess from the rain. I opened what I thought was her bathroom closet, but It wasn't. Inside was her wedding dress, which was gorgeous and white and perfect. But right next to it was this red cocktail dress I'd never seen before. Expensive looking heels, and a whole stack of love notes tied with a ribbon. The handwriting definitely wasn't Noah's. My stomach dropped. I quickly closed the closet and pretended nothing happened. But my hands were literally shaking when Lauren came back with the tea. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Finally, I worked up the nerve to confront her. We met at this coffee shop near her work, and I just straight up asked her about the notes. She went completely pale and started crying right there in front of everyone. She told me the affair had ended months ago, but she still wasn't sure she actually loved Noah. She said she felt super pressured to marry him because he was quote unquote, the perfect guy, and literally everyone thought they were amazing together. Her parents loved him, her friends were jealous. Even her boss would ask about wedding planning. I was completely devastated, but I kept my mouth shut for Noah's sake until the night before the wedding. Noah showed up at my apartment around 11 at night with this bottle of cheap wine and said he had cold feet. I figured he was just nervous like most people get before their wedding. But then he said something that completely shook me. He goes, I feel like I'm marrying A total stranger. The only person who actually makes me feel like myself is you. I didn't sleep at all that night. I sat in my car outside the wedding venue at, like, five in the morning, completely torn between ruining my best friend's big day and saving him from what I knew was basically a lie. My phone kept buzzing with texts from other bridesmaids asking where I was for hair and makeup. But in the end, I didn't have to decide anything. Lauren never showed up. Noah stood at the altar for 20 minutes in his gray suit, looking confused while everyone whispered. Her maid of honor kept trying to call her. Finally, someone found a note in the bridal suite that just said she couldn't do it and she was sorry. The next day, Noah

My brother texted, stay out of our lives. I replied, fine. Then I kept the house I'd secretly bought them as their wedding gift. I'm the family provider, the one who got lucky with a successful company. My brother Wyatt is 28. Creative type, make beautiful furniture nobody buys. His fiance Alana teaches yoga and talks about energy like it's currency. I never trusted Alana. She'd say things that sounded sweet but felt sour. It must be nice never worrying about money like regular people. She'd smile while her eyes calculated what I was worth. Seven months ago, I bought a house in their dream neighborhood without telling them. Three bedrooms, original hardwood, a workshop space perfect for Wyatt. I paid cash and planned to transfer the deed at their wedding as the ultimate gift. The paperwork was all set. My lawyer had the transfer documents ready. All I needed was to wait for their September wedding and surprise them with keys and a bow. Wyatt had no idea about the house. I'd been careful to keep it secret. I even staged furniture shopping trips with him to see what he liked. At my company's summer party, I introduced Wyatt to potential clients. A woman who ran an interior design firm loved his work. Another owned a boutique hotel chain looking for custom pieces. I was networking for him like I always did. Alana watched from the bar with laser focus. She saw a conspiracy in every handshake and betrayal in every business card. Three days later, my phone exploded with messages from Wyatt. Alana had told him everything she'd witnessed. She claimed I'd been pushing women at him for months. She said I told them he was unhappy and looking to upgrade. The lies were specific and designed to wound. Said I called her a gold digger. To the hotel owner. She claimed I said Wyatt deserved someone with ambition. I tried calling Wyatt to explain. He sent me straight to voicemail. Then came his final message. That afternoon, Alana showed me what you've been doing. Stay out of our lives. After nearly three decades as brothers, I was deleted. I sat in my living room feeling oddly calm. I texted back. Fine. My next call was to my property lawyer. Kill the transfer papers for the house. But the wedding is next month. Plans changed. The house stays in my name. This is a significant financial decision. Are you certain? Completely certain. Four days later, Wyatt was pounding on my apartment door at 11 at night. We need to talk about the wedding. We're not talking. You made that clear. This is different. Where's the registry info? Alana's family keeps asking what registry? The one you set up for house stuff. Mom mentioned you were organizing something big. The irony was perfect. Quiet. I bought you a house. His face drained Of color. What do you mean, bought? Past tense. I was giving you and Alana a house for your wedding. Where is it? Still mine. You told me to stay out of your lives. That includes my gifts. Alana appeared behind him in the hallway. You can't take back what you already promised. I never promised you anything. The house was a surprise that never happened. This is

Daniela got rejected by Hudson three weeks ago. He's this quiet kid in our chemistry class who mostly keeps to himself. Daniela has been obsessed with him since September. She finally asked him to Winter Formal, and he politely said no. He wasn't mean about it. He just said he wasn't interested in dating right now. Daniela completely lost it. She's 17 like me, but she acted like a psycho ex girlfriend from a Netflix show. She came to my house that night sobbing and saying Hudson humiliated her. I tried to tell her it wasn't that deep, but she wasn't hearing it. She kept saying he thought he was better than her, that he needed to be taught a lesson. A week later, Daniella showed me something on her phone that disgusted me. She'd created a whole fake Instagram account. Some gorgeous girl named Angela from our neighboring school. She'd been messaging Hudson as this fake girl for five days already. Hudson had completely fallen for it. This kid who barely talks to anyone at school was pouring his heart out to Angela. He told her about his anxiety, how his dad left when he was 12, how he felt invisible at school and wondered if anyone would ever actually want him. He sent her his artwork that nobody knew. He did these beautiful charcoal drawings of birds and landscapes. He even sent her Poems he wrote about being lonely. Daniella was screenshotting everything. She had hundreds of screenshots saved in a folder on her phone labeled Hudson's funeral. When I saw that folder name, I felt sick. I asked Daniela what she was planning. She got this creepy smile and told me the plan. Hudson's 18th birthday was next Friday. His mom had rented out the bowling alley and invited our whole chemistry class. She was trying to help him make friends, since he struggled socially. Daniela was going to connect her laptop to the team. These screens at the bowling alley, she was going to display all of Hudson's messages for everyone to see. Everything. His poems about wanting to disappear. His message about being scared he'd die a virgin. A voice note where he talked about his depression and medication. Photos of his artwork with deeply personal captions about his dead dad. She even had a message where he admitted he cried himself to sleep sometimes. I told Daniela she couldn't do this. This would destroy him. She just laughed and said I was being dramatic. She said maybe next time he wouldn't reject girls who were clearly out of his league. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. She said after everyone saw what a loser he was, maybe he'd finally kill himself and do everyone a favor. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Hudson. How he helped me pass chemistry last year. How He always smiled and said hi, even though we weren't friends. How excited he'd been lately, probably because he thought Angela actually liked him. Two days went by, and I watched Hudson at school. He was different, more confident. He actually raised his hand in class. He sat with people at lunch instead of alone. This fake relationship was the best thing that had happened to him, and Daniela was about to weaponize it. I couldn't let it happen. Four days before the party, I did something that would probably end my friendship with Daniela. I made my own anonymous Instagram account. I messaged Hudson saying I went to Angela's school and needed to warn him. I told him Angela was fake, that someone from his school was catfishing him and planning something horrible for his birthday. Hudson didn't believe me at first. He said I was probably just jealous or trying to mess with him. So I did something I still feel guilty about. I sent him screenshots that Daniella had sent me. Screenshots showing the back end of the fake account with Daniela's email attached. Hudson blocked the Angela account immediately. He didn't come to school for three days. The day of his party arrived. Daniela still showed up with her laptop in her bag, hoping Hudson would show. But Hudson never came to his own birthday party. His mom apologized to everyone, saying he had food poisoning. Daniela was pissed. She kept checking her phone to see If Hudson had unblocked Angela that night, Daniela called me, furious. She figured out someone warned Hudson and suspected it was me. She asked if I would

My cousin called me last week to tell me that my boyfriend Matt wasn't invited to her wedding anymore because apparently he didn't match the aesthetic of her perfect Vineyard wedding. She actually said the words I need everyone in my photos to have a certain caliber and explained that Matt, with his contractor trucks and work boots wasn't giving the elevated vibe she needed. Then she hit me with a real kicker by saying I was only invited to the ceremony since technically I was extended family and she wanted to keep the reception for people who run in the same circles, not relatives. Her mom made her invite. I sat there listening to her explain how the reception was for her sorority sisters and investment banker friends while I tried not to laugh out loud. Eight months ago, she'd been sobbing to me about how every venue wanted $40,000 and her parents had given her a 20 thousand dollar budget already blown on her dress. I mentioned that Matt's parents owned a Vineyard venue and maybe I could ask about availability. She literally begged me to check. And when I told her they could do it, she screamed that I was the best cousin in the world and she'd never forget this. What she never bothered to figure out was that the only reason she got that venue basically free was because Matt's parents Adore me like I'm already their daughter. I spend every Sunday at their house for dinner helping his mom Linda with her garden. They were doing this as a massive favor, calling me their future daughter in law even though Matt and I aren't engaged yet. And gave my cousin the friends and family rate, which meant she only paid for staff and catering, not the actual 35,000 dollar venue fee. My cousin never asked how I got such an insane and deal and just assumed I knew somebody who knew somebody, while she posted constantly about her dream venue and how she manifested it through positive thinking. After she finished her speech about curating her guest list for the right energy, I told her I completely understood her vision and hung up. Then I called Linda, who answered on the first ring like always. I explained what my cousin had said about Matt not being the right caliber and how I was being hidden away during the ceremony like some embarrassing relative. Linda got so quiet I thought the call dropped, and then she said in that voice mothers use when they're about to destroy someone, that spoiled little princess is about to learn what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you. Linda asked if my cousin had signed an actual contract, and I told her no because we'd handled everything through texts. Since it was a family favor, she said she needed to make a quick Home call and would call me right back, but I could hear her muttering about ungrateful brats insulting her baby boy. Twenty minutes later Linda called back and said in her most fake upset voice that there had been a terrible mistake with a booking system and unfortunately they double booked that date with a Fortune 500 company retreat paying full price and since there was no formal contract, they'd have to go with a confirmed paying client. She said my cousin would be getting an apologetic call from their event coordinator within the hour, explaining that if she still wanted the venue, she'd need to pay the full rate of 35 thousand dollars plus a five thousand dollar rush fee or they'd have to release the date immediately. I tried to tell Linda she didn't have to go nuclear, but she cut me off and said honey, when someone tells me my son isn't good enough for their fancy pictures while using my property for free, they better pray I only take away the venue. She added that the coordinator would hopefully provide other venue options, which she knew were all either booked or charging 50,000 because she'd already called her friends who owned them. An hour later my

They forgot the exit clause in my founders agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation. Just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen, toast getting cold, reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises, and late nights, and this is how they repay me? Like I was just another line item to cut? The email came from Jennifer Walsh, some 28 year old VP who probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgage my house three times to keep payroll running in O A. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce insisted On it. Back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want a kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? Three hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was specifically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR, 4 5 to 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founders agreement, please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked. Drinking my tea. Watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The.

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in, shouting at me. Where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie, and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls. Everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbooks, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached, and the latest iPhone Pro Max. She was on the phone, twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer. I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. All those family measures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. Oh, that. I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is due. Tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing on Bella's shopping bag scattered across the living room floor. His gaze moved from the designer handbag to her new clothes.

So I said, good to know and walked out. Packed a bag, threw my keys on the table, texted her, call him then. You're his problem now. The panicked I was joking messages flooded in immediately. Here's the thing. We split rent fifty fifty. But I've been paying 70% because I make more. Plus all utilities and groceries. I texted back, I'll pay exactly 50% from now on. Figure out the rest. I can't afford that. You know I can't. Too bad. Should have thought about that before the comparison. But here's where it gets interesting. Saturday, I went to get my stuff, and she's in full makeup, trying to seduce me back. Can we just talk first? No. Just here for my Xbox while packing. She drops the bomb. Fine. Leave. Devin already reached out anyway. Cool. Hope he knows what he's doing. I genuinely didn't care. But she had already told him we were on a break. His actual girlfriend, Alyssa found out, sent me screenshots of Jenna trying to hook up with him. I forwarded everything to Alyssa. She confronted Devin with receipts. He blocked Jenna completely. Now she's sending emails. You ruined everything! I'm going homeless because of you! My response? Tell everyone the truth. That you compared me to your ex in bed. And I left. See how that goes? Radio silence for exactly three days. Then the real desperation kicked In she started calling my job. Pretend to be worried about me. Hi, this is his girlfriend Jenna. He hasn't been home in weeks. Is he okay? Is he eating? My manager pulled me aside asking if everything was alright. We broke up, I said. He just nodded, but Jenna wasn't done. She called my mom next, spinning some story about how I abandoned her during a rough patch. My mom listened patiently, then asked, honey, what exactly did you say to make him leave? Jenna actually told her. My own mother laughed and said, well, did you call your ex yet? Then came the social media campaign. Vague posts about toxic men who can't handle honest communication and people who abandon you when you need them most. Friends were eating it up in the comments with fire emojis and you deserve better, queen messages. But here's what she didn't expect. Our mutual friends started asking questions. What actually happened? What did she say? She couldn't answer without admitting the truth, so she just kept deflecting with more victim posts. Meanwhile, I'm living my best life. Got a studio apartment downtown, no drama, gaming setup looks incredible. Posted a picture of my new place with the caption peaceful vibes only. Jenna commented within minutes. Must be nice to run away from your problems. I replied, must be nice to have your ex handle them for you. She deleted the comment immediately, but screenshots live forever. Our friends saw everything. Week Three things escalated. Her best friend Jessica reached out. Jenna's really struggling. Can't you just help with rent this month? I sent Jess

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix, Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog, who immediately started following me around like we'd known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying I couldn't just bring home random animals. They were so mad, they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water. Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the first night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently pat my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realized it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mr. Peterson looked shocked. I told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counsellor, because I'd been missing. So Many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, I felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice got shaky. After 20 minutes, she asked to speak with my parents. That evening, she called them and said something that changed everything. My daughter is a completely different person with this dog. This isn't some teenage phase or a crutch she's using to avoid responsibility. This animal is giving her a bridge to function normally. Dad still tried to stick to his one week rule. He kept writing in his stupid notebook. But I noticed the complaints were getting smaller. Left Scouts toy in hallway or dog hair on couch. Nothing about me being irresponsible anymore. Then on day 6, something happened that nobody expected.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog, who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever.

The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. I've been with Rachel for four years, engaged for 1. She'd always been supportive during my chronic back problems, or so I thought. After my neurosurgeon recommended spinal fusion, Rachel drove me to the hospital, held my hand during prep, and was the last face I saw before anesthesia. I have a weird reaction to anesthesia. I regained consciousness quickly, but remained physically still. I became aware in recovery, maybe 30 minutes after surgery. Eyes closed, breathing slow, but I could hear everything. Then I heard Rachel's voice near my bed. He's still out, she told someone. Before I could signal I was awake, I heard her friend. Ali arrived. How did it go? Ali asked. Fine, I guess, Rachel replied, sounding annoyed rather than concerned. The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. James? I didn't know any James. Why not leave? Ali asked quietly. You're not married yet. Rachel paused, then his parents are adding me to their will next month. You know how loaded they are. The old man's health isn't great. Probably why they're updating everything. I just need to get out a little longer. My parents, my father, who built a construction company from nothing, My mother, who taught school for 30 years. The people who'd welcomed Rachel with open arms and insisted on paying for our wedding. That's cold, Ra, even for you, Ali said. It's practical, Rachel replied. Four years listening to him talk about building projects and football, playing nice with his boring family. And now I have to play nurse for two months. What about James? James will wait. Once everything is legal and Richard senior kicks it, I'll be set. James can have his fun now, but he knows the score. Richard senior kicks it. My father. They were discussing my father's death like a business plan. What if Mike wakes up and hears you? Ali asked. Rachel laughed. Cold, sharp, please. They pump him so full of drugs, he'll be lucky to remember his name. Besides, he trusts me completely. It's almost too easy. I decided to keep playing unconscious. The nurse checked my vitals. I woke up slowly, playing the part they expected. Rachel was immediately by my side. Hey, babe. Everything went great. How are you feeling? Tired, I mumbled. I'm right here. I'll take good care of you. The next few hours, Rachel played devoted fiance perfectly. When visiting hours ended, she kissed my forehead and promised to return in the morning. As soon as she left, I called my parents. Come immediately. It's important. But I'm physically okay. They heard something in my voice and arrived in 30 minutes. I told them everything. James, the Will the death planning? My mother gasped. My father's face turned red. We coordinated immediately. My friend Eric packed all Rachel's belongings into storage. A locksmith changed my apartment locks. At 11 p m, my father's attorney removed Rachel from all state documents. My mother called Rachel's parents. They were horrified. I texted Rachel, change of plans. My parents are taking me home tomorrow. Don't come to the hospital. Her reply, don't be silly, babe. I'll be there at 9:00. I didn't respond. Next morning, my parents discharged me at 8:15 a m. At 9:07, Rachel called. I didn't answer. By 10 a m, she called. Twelve

I found out when my new neighbour declared war on my sick daughter's magical night garden. My seven year old daughter, Lily, has a rare skin condition. To put it simply, the sun hurts her. She can only play outside in the deep twilight just as the last bits of sun disappear. Because of this, her world was mostly indoors. To give her a little piece of magic that was just hers, we built a special garden in our backyard. It was a moon garden filled with flowers like moon flowers and evening Primrose that only bloomed at night. We strung up soft twinkling fairy lights and for an hour or so each evening, Lily could be a normal kid in her enchanted space. It was the one thing that brought her pure joy. Then Mister Henderson moved in next door. At first he seemed fine. Just a quiet, grumpy looking man. About a week after he moved in, he installed a security light on the side of his garage. But this wasn't a normal light. Normal, uh, it was a commercial grade stadium style floodlight. A miniature sun. When he turned it on that first night, it blasted our entire backyard with harsh blue white light, completely washing out the fairy lights and bleaching the grass. I walked over the next day and knocked on his door. I explained very politely about Lily's condition and her special garden. I asked If he might consider angling the light downwards so it only covered his property. He just stared at me. It's for my security, he said flatly. I need to see my whole property line. I tried again, my voice gentle. I understand. But it's just so bright. It's ruining my daughter's only safe place to play. He actually scoffed. Not my problem. Your kid needs to toughen up. The world's a bright place. Then he closed the door in my face. The effect was immediate and devastating. The harsh light never turned off. Running from dusk until dawn, Lily's moonflowers, which needed darkness to open, stayed tightly shut, then began to wilt. She would just stand at her window, tears in her eyes, watching her magical garden die. The light was so powerful, it even cut through her blackout curtains, making it hard for her to sleep. My heart broke every single night. I tried everything. I called the city, hoping to file a nuisance complaint. Sent an officer out who measured the light. Mister Henderson had done his research. The light was exactly 1 lumen, under the legal limit to be considered a violation. It was completely legal. I even saw him watching from his window as the officer explained this to me, a smug little smirk on his face. He was enjoying this. He was enjoying taking away a sick little girl's only happiness. Two weeks. I felt utterly helpless. I was looking out the window at the Wilting flowers and my daughter's sad face. And then I saw my own reflection in the glass. The reflection of the light. And that's when the idea sparked. It wasn't about fighting the light. It was about redirecting it. That Saturday, I went to a specialty hardware store. I didn't buy fences or trees. I bought three huge 4 by 8 foot sheets of polished mirror acrylic, the kind they use for dance studios. I also bought lumber, heavy duty locking wheels and a box of screws. My wife thought I was losing my mind as I spent the entire weekend in the garage measuring, sawing, and building. I constructed three tall, sturdy panels on wheels, each one a giant movable mirror. That night, his floodlight clicked on at dusk, as usual, bathing our yard in that horrible glare. I said nothing. I just calmly wheeled my three mirror panels out onto the patio. The only sound was the soft rumble of the wheels on the stone. I took my time, carefully.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the end. My brother pulled up in my challenger, except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. Cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the cloud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it, not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at three a m, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to brag About teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said. The damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor played the dash cam audio where my brother said, I hope this teaches him. He'll

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at fifteen, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth $2.8 million, and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $7,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 63 S was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Action. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine. Four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part. I didn't tell anyone about The car or the commission? I just went about my normal routine for an entire week, letting my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that I tonic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma, who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Mark.

So my little brother Jake is 13 and basically a genius. Like he's already taking college classes and gets interviewed by newspapers about his research stuff. Everyone always talks about how amazing and smart he is, and honestly, our parents have never said no to him about anything his entire life. The problem is he's turned into this massive jerk who thinks he's better than literally everyone. He talks down to people constantly and acts like everyone around him is stupid. It's gotten so bad that I cringe whenever he opens his mouth around other people. Lately he's been obsessed with this girl from one of his advanced classes named Emma. He talks about her constantly but keeps complaining that she won't give him the time of day. Every single day it's the same thing. He'll come home whining about how she ignored him or didn't laugh at his jokes or whatever. Last week he invited her over to work on some project together. I was in the kitchen making a sandwich when they sat down at our dining room table. What I heard made me want to crawl under a rock from secondhand embarrassment. The entire time Jake just talked over her. she'd start to explain an idea and he'd immediately interrupt with actually, that's wrong because or that won't work, here's what we should do instead. At one point She suggested researching something online, and he literally called her idea stupid to her face. Then he spent like 20 minutes just bragging about himself. He told her about every newspaper article he'd been in, every award he'd won, every smart thing he'd ever done. The poor girl just sat there, nodding politely while looking like she wanted to disappear. The worst part was when he asked about her career plans, she said she wanted to be a teacher, and he immediately started lecturing her about how teaching doesn't pay well and she'd be wasting her potential. You could see her face just shut down completely after she left. That day, Jake came into my room all confused about why she seemed weird and distant. I wanted to tell him right then, but I figured maybe he'd figure it out on his own. He didn't. Instead, it got worse. He started coming up with all these theories about why Emma didn't like him. First he decided she was jealous of his intelligence. Then he convinced himself she was playing hard to get. Last week he told me she probably only likes dumb jock guy because girls don't appreciate smart men. Today was the final straw. Jake was at the dinner table going on his usual rant about Emma, while our parents nodded along sympathetically. He said she was obviously intimidated by how accomplished he is and that most women are too emotional to handle dating someone smarter than them. Our Mom actually agreed with him. She started talking about how some people feel threatened by exceptional individuals and that Emma probably feels insecure around Jake's success. Dad chimed in saying Jake shouldn't change himself for anyone and that the right girl would appreciate his gifts. I couldn't take it anymore. I put down my fork and looked Jake straight in the eye. She doesn't dislike you because you're smart, I said. She dislikes you because you act like a condescending jerk who thinks everyone else is stupid. The whole table went silent. Jake's mouth actually fell open. You talked over her the entire time she was here, I continued. You called her ideas stupid, you bragged about yourself non stop, and you told her she was making bad life choices. Why would anyone want to be around that? Jake started getting defensive.

Your job is in the kitchen, he added. But it wasn't fair. Every Saturday, he'd take my brothers out to the garage to work on cars while I was told to help mom inside. They'd come back covered in grease, laughing about carburetors and talking about R P M S. When I asked to join, dad would pat my head. This is boy stuff, sweetheart. You'll have a husband to handle this. I tried to tell him it was unfair and beg him constantly to teach me, but he refused. Women get too emotional behind the wheel. Trust me, it's safer this way. My best friend, Gloria, couldn't stand the way I was treated. My aunt Jenna literally owns a mechanic shop downtown, and she agrees. Your papa's a little loco, but if you really wanna learn, hey, she's down to teach you herself. I hugged Gloria. Oh, my god, you're the best! We went to her store, and I was instantly blown away by her. Aunt Jenna was everything my dad thought women couldn't be. Grease under her nails, but still rocking the makeup and beautiful curly hair. Your father thinks women are helpless. I'll teach you everything. More than he knows. She smiled with a wink. And so every Saturday, while my parents thought I was at dance class, Jenna taught me in the lot behind her shop. Not just Driving but everything. How to diagnose engine problems by sound. How to change oil, rotate tires, break fluid. Emergency maneuvers. Your brothers might know how to drive, she'd say, but can they tell you why an engine's misfiring just by listening? After a few months, I managed to finally snag my very own driver's license, something I didn't really expect my dad to find out so soon. It all went down in the middle of the highway on the way to my brother's graduation ceremony. Some hot shot in a red sports car cut off an 18 Wheeler without using a turn. The truck driver slammed his brakes, jackknifed hard. The trailer clipped the minivan next to us straight into the barrier, then sideswiped us into a spin. My brothers and mom screamed in a panic. We stopped sideways across two lanes, cars flying past, going 70 just inches from our bumper. Dad sat there frozen, hands shaking, his mind completely shutting down. I unbuckled and shot forward from the back seat. Move! I yelled. He pulled his seat back and jumped into the back row. I got into the driver's seat and restarted the stop. Old engine carefully driving us to the shoulder just as another wave of traffic came around the curve. My family hopped out of the car, crying and throwing up on the curb. The truck driver got out to check on us while calling 9 1 1. Help, please! The woman driving the mini van Screamed. We all rushed over to her, grabbing the two kids in the back first. But when the truck driver tried to reach for the mom, he couldn't get the door to move. She was trapped. The van crushed against the barrier on the only side we could reach her. While we sat there thinking about how to get her out, I smelled it. That sweet, haunting smell Jenna taught me. Brake fluid mixing with oil on hot metal. Highly explosive. Step back! I yelled to everyone. Dad started to say we should wait for the professionals, but we didn't have time. I grabbed the truck's tire iron, disconnected the lower hinge first. I called out to the truck driver to support the door while I popped the upper pins. My brothers just stood there, frozen like. Dad, get the Jack on our trunk! Now! I kicked it in position exactly where Jenna taught me, under the dashboard's frame, the strongest point, and cranked it just enough to free the woman's.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at fifteen, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic falling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth $2.8 million, and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would come completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 60 three S was sitting in the showroom like Automotive Perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine, four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part. I didn't tell anyone. About the car or the commission? I just went about my normal routine for an entire week, and my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma, who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Marcus, we need to talk immediately. That car cost more than most people make. An entire

The mean theater kids at my school had no idea I used to be on Broadway. After three years of performing eight shows a week, all I wanted was to be a normal 15 year old at my new school, where nobody knew I'd originated the role of Sophie in the musical everyone was obsessed with. But then I walked into the auditorium and saw the popular theater kids clustered together wearing matching drama club hoodies. Queen Bee Madison looked me up and down while I signed my name on the audition sheet. Her face scrunching up, she whispered loud enough for everyone to hear that community theater rejects always thought they could waltz into their program just because Mommy said they were special. Her minions, Britney and Jade, giggled while Madison asked if I'd gotten my audition outfit from Walmart's clearance rack, pointing at my plain jeans and sweater that apparently screamed amateur hour to anyone with real theater experience. When I said I was auditioning for Sophie, Madison actually laughed so hard she had to grab Britney's shoulder for support. She explained to everyone that Sophie required years of professional training to hit those notes, not whatever karaoke bar preparation I obviously had. Jade pulled up the Broadway cast recording on her phone and played the famous act too solo that I performed over a thousand times, asking if I Even knew this was originally sung by someone who trained at Juilliard since age 7, I bit my tongue so hard I tasted blood because that someone was literally me, and I'd actually been training since age five. and demanded I show them my audition song right there in the lobby since we all knew I wouldn't make it past the first cut anyway. When I started the opening verse, she immediately stopped me and demonstrated the correct breathing technique while the others nodded like she was teaching a master class. She grabbed my diaphragm and pushed hard, saying I needed to feel the expansion if I ever wanted to produce real sound instead of the squeaky whisper I was apparently producing. He commented that my vowel shapes were completely wrong and physically manipulated my jaw while telling me to watch her mouth form the proper positions. During the actual audition sign UPS, Madison erased my name from the Sophie List and rewrote it under ensemble, explaining that even that was generous considering I moved like I've never taken a dance class. She made me do a pirouette right there to prove I could at least spin without falling over, then shook her head sadly when I completed three perfect turns, saying my technique was shopping mall dance studio at best. Jade videoed the whole thing on her phone while providing commentary about how my arms looked like wet noodles and my spot was non existent. Sabotage started when I went to change into my audition dress in the bathroom. Madison followed me in and accidentally spilled her entire iced coffee down my front while gasping that she was so sorry, but maybe it was a sign from the theater gods that I should reconsider. While I was cleaning myself off, Britney took my sheet music from my bag and crumpled each page into a ball before smoothing them out again, making them barely readable. She sweetly offered to let me borrow her marked up copy, but every note was intentionally written wrong. When they called my name, Madison announced to the full auditorium that they were about to witness what happened when Disney Channel made kids think they had talent. She started a slow clap when I walked on stage, getting others to join in mockingly, while shouting that I should save everyone time and just mouth the words since we all knew I couldn't actually sing. Jade yelled from the back that her nine year old sister had played Sophie in their basement, and even she had better stage presence then whatever this was supposed to be. I started singing and Madison stood up in the front row, turning to address everyone behind her while I performed. She provided running commentary about every single thing I was doing wrong, from my posture to my projection to the way I was butchering the composer's intentions with my interpretation. When I hit the high note perfectly, she actually said Autotune must be getting really advanced. These

Now she wants her inheritance. I'm 54 and got divorced eight years ago from my wife of 20 years. The day the papers were signed, my daughter Sarah, now 28, immediately took her mom's side and blocked me on everything without even asking what actually happened. My ex was ruthless. She told Sarah I cheated, that I abandoned the family, I was emotionally abusive. None of it was true. She was the one who had the affair. But Sarah ate it up. I tried calling, texting, even showing up at her apartment. Nothing worked. Dad, I don't want to hear your lies, she said. The last time I saw her, mom told me everything. You're disgusting. Eventually, my ex threatened to get a restraining order against me for harassment, so I gave up. Those eight years were the darkest of my life. I moved to a smaller apartment, took care of my mom, who had alzheimer's and basically became a hermit. Had a few casual relationships, but couldn't trust anyone. When mom passed away three months ago, I grieved alone. No Sarah at the funeral, no one to share memories with. Just me cleaning out her house by myself. Then out of nowhere, last week, unknown number calls me. Dad, it's Sarah. I saw on Facebook that grandma passed. Are you okay? My heart nearly exploded. After eight years of silence, I thought she finally came around. Maybe losing grandma made her realize Life's too short to hold grudges. We talked for an hour. She suggested dinner at my place. I was so nervous. I cleaned the apartment three times and bought her favorite wine from when she was in college. Opening that door was surreal. She looked so different. Older. More like her mother. Dinner was awkward, but good. We caught up on her job, her fiance, small talk. Then we got to the elephant in the room. Dad, I need to apologize, he said. I realize now that mom probably exaggerated things during the divorce. I should have heard your side. For a moment, I felt hopeful. Maybe this was genuine. Then she dropped a nuke. So anyway, I was wondering about Grandma's will. I figured you'd have been contacted by now about my inheritance. But when that didn't happen, then I thought I should reach out directly. My wedding's in four months, and honestly, we could really use the money. My stomach dropped. She didn't come back because she missed me. She came back for money. Sarah, your grandma left everything to me years ago when she got diagnosed. There's no inheritance for you. Her face changed immediately. The fake warmth disappeared. What do you mean, there's no inheritance? I'm her only grandchild. I visited her all the time before she got sick. You visited her twice in eight years? Sarah, that's not the point. She loved me. She would have wanted me to have something. I offered her a Few thousand for my own avings for the wedding. Her face twisted with disgust. She stood up, started pacing around my kitchen. You know what? You're exactly the selfish a whole mom always said you were. I'm glad you're alone. You deserve it.

Everyone nodded along. I unwrapped my gift slowly and said, that's why the snowball prize nomination letter came as such a shock. The room went dead silent. My mom dropped her coffee mug on the floor. My brother Kevin stopped mid by, made of his cinnamon roll. Even my grandma looked up from her crossword puzzle. Dad just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. See, every Christmas was the same routine at our house. Dad would make his little speech about how Kevin was the successful one with his fancy marketing job and new BMW. Then he'd look at me, shake his head, and make some comment about how I was still figuring things out at 28. This year was supposed to be no different. I was sitting on the scratchy brown couch in my old pajamas, watching everyone else open expensive gifts while I got a target gift card and a lecture. Dad was in his usual spot by the fireplace, coffee in hand, ready to deliver his annual disappointment speech. But three weeks earlier, something crazy had happened. I was in my tiny lab at the university, working late on this research nobody cared about. It was this super boring stuff about plant proteins that could help fight cancer. I've been working on it for six years, staying up until three in the morning, living off ramen and energy. Drinks. My phone rang at like eleven PM. It was Doctor Peterson from the Nobel Committee. At first I thought it was a prank call. Kevin's always doing stupid stuff like that. But then she started talking about my research paper and how the committee had been following my work. She said they were nominating me for the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Me, the family screw up who still drove a beat up Honda Civic and shopped at thrift stores. I made her repeat it three times before I believed her. The official letter came two days before Christmas. I kept it hidden in my desk drawer, not sure if I should tell anyone. Part of me wanted to prove dad wrong, but another part was scared he'd find some way to make it about Kevin instead. So when dad started his usual Christmas morning routine about Kevin's accomplishments, I just listened. He went on and on about Kevin's promotion and his new apartment downtown. Then he turned to me with that disappointed look I knew so well. That's when I pulled out the letter. My hands were shaking. As I held up the official Nobel Committee letterhead, I read the first line out loud. We are pleased to inform you that you have been nominated for the Nobel Prize in chemistry for your groundbreaking research in plant based cancer treatment. Dad's face went through about five different emotions in 10 seconds. First confusion, then disbelief, then this weird mixture. Of pride and embarrassment. Kevin actually choked on his cinnamon roll and started coughing. My mom was the first to speak. She jumped up from her chair and hugged me so tight, I could barely breathe. She kept saying, I knew it. I knew you were special.

Let's see if he can make it back. They laughed and drove away. I never came back. Standing at that Colorado gas station, watching their tail lights disappear, something inside me just broke. Five years of marriage, and Chloe thought abandoning me 300 miles from home was hilarious. No phone, no wallet, nothing. The gas station clerk, an older guy named Pete, saw me standing there looking lost. You all right, son? He asked. I explained what happened, expecting him to shake his head and walk away. Instead, he handed me a bottled water and said, some people ain't worth the ground they walk on. He even let me use his phone to call the local shelter. I hitched a ride to Grand Junction with a trucker who didn't ask questions, found a homeless shelter run by a former Marine named Roy. He handed me a clipboard and said, fill this out. Tomorrow we figure out the rest. That night, lying on a cot surrounded by strangers, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about Chloe's laugh as they drove away, how Stephanie had said, he'll figure it out. He always does. Like I was some kind of trained dog they could abandoned for entertainment. Roy got me a job washing dishes at Jackie's Diner for cash. The owner, a tough old woman covered in tattoos, paid me under the table. You running from something? She Asked one day, watching me scrub plates like my life depended on it. Running to something, I said. Turns out Jackie had connections. Real estate connections. She'd been flipping houses since the 90s. Knew every contractor, inspector and banker in town. You got a good head on your shoulders, she told me after I caught an accounting error that would have cost her thousands. Wanna learn the business? Six months later, I was swinging hammers and learning to read blueprints. Becky taught me everything. How to spot a good deal, negotiate with contractors, manage cash flow. This ain't charity, she'd say. You're earning every dollar. Within two years, I owned three rental properties. Change my name legally to Marcus Stone. Felt right, felt solid. Found peace I'd never had with Chloe. No more walking on eggshells. No more being the butt of every joke at gatherings. I met Sarah at a hardware store. She was buying paint for her first apartment. Asked my advice on colors. We started dating. Slowly, carefully. When I told her my story, she just nodded and said, some chapters need to end before better ones can begin. We married three years later. Small ceremony. Just Jackie, Roy and a few close friends. Real friends who'd stick around when things got tough. Then last week, 15 years later, my phone started buzzing. Unknown No. 107 missed calls over two days. Finally answered. Mike? Oh, my God. Mike, is that you? I've been looking everywhere. Chloe's voice Desperate now? Crying. I hired a private investigator. It took months to find you. Mike, I'm so sorry. That day was the worst mistake of my life. My husband left me. I lost the house. The kids barely talk to me since the divorce. I have nothing left. Please, I need your help. Stop, I said quietly. You don't understand. I've been searching for you for years. I know you're successful now. I saw the business licenses, the properties. I know you can help me. We were married. That has to count for something. Chloe, I interrupted you

Don't walk with me. You'll embarrass me in front of my friends. I nodded and let her go ahead. But when she came back weeks later, her ride home wasn't me. Rosie and I had been together since college, but everything changed when she discovered social media fame. What started as posting cute outfit photos evolved into a full obsession with follower counts and brand partnerships. Six months ago, she quit her stable marketing job to become a full time influencer. We made a deal. I'd cover major bills for six months while she built her brand, using her savings for business expenses. Instead, her business expenses looked like shopping sprees, while she treated me like an assistant funding her lifestyle. This Europe trip was supposed to be her final push before she had to start contributing again. At the airport, I helped with her three massive suitcases. As we approached check in, she spotted her friends, Lauren and Ashley, dressed like runway models. They looked at me in my jeans and hoodie with obvious disgust. Rosie panicked. You can stop here, she whispered harshly. I'll walk you to security, I said, confused. She glanced at her smirking friends, then back at me with cold calculation. Don't walk with me, you'll embarrass me in front of my friends. In that moment, our entire relationship replayed with perfect. Every dismissive comment, every time I felt like an accessory instead of a partner. The love I felt for Her evaporated instantly. I didn't get angry. A strange calm settled over me. You're right, I said politely. I wouldn't want to do that. I let go of her luggage cart. Have a great trip. Then I walked away without looking back. She'd be gone three weeks. More than enough time. First, I sold the luxury SUV she drove entirely in my name, back to the dealership for a large check. And I hired a junk removal service to clear every trace of her from my house. Clothes, products, her entire filming studio in the spare bedroom. All gone. I changed every password on our shared accounts and removed her from my credit cards. Most importantly, I found her influencer website login and made myself the administrator by changing the recovery email to mine. I spent two weeks rebuilding my life, reconnecting with friends she'd found boring, doing things I'd stopped because they weren't Instagrammable. She sent me photos from Europe, Eiffel Tower, pasta in Rome, never asking how I was. I never replied. Days before her return, I used the car money to book a motorcycle tour through national parks. My flight left the same day she arrived. The night before, I sent one email. As per your request at the airport, I have ceased to be part of your life. Your belongings are in storage. Unit 42, first month prepaid. The car has been sold. It was my property. House locks changed. You're no longer a resident. I'll Be unreachable for weeks. Best wishes, Tom. From Zion National Park. Five days later, I turned my phone back on. To hundreds of missed calls and voicemails. My friend Dave gave me the breakdown. Rosie waited at arrivals for an hour before taking an expensive cab home with her suitcases. Her key didn't work. She was stranded on my porch with 300 pounds of luggage until her parents drove two hours to collect her. She launched a social media campaign.

When I asked why, she said, we didn't think you'd be interested since you're not the motherly type. I just smiled and said, you're right. I'll be too busy at my own shower next week. The look on Emma's face was perfect. Her mouth dropped open like she'd been slapped. See, what she didn't know was that I've been hiding my pregnancy for three months because I was scared something might go wrong again after my miscarriage last year. Emma and I used to be best friends, started trying to get pregnant around the same time two years ago. When she got pregnant immediately and I didn't, she started treating me differently. She'd make comments like, maybe you're just not ready, or, some people aren't meant to be moms yet. Whenever I mention doctor appointments or fertility tests. The worst part was when I finally got pregnant last year and lost the baby at eight weeks, Emma actually said, maybe it's for the best. You didn't seem that excited anyway. I should have cut her off then, but I was grieving and didn't have energy to fight this time. When I saw those two pink lines on the pregnancy test, I kept quiet. I only told my husband Jake, and my mom. We decided to wait until 12 weeks to tell anyone after what happened before. My doctor said everything looked good, but I was still terrified. Emma's baby shower was Last Saturday at the community center downtown. I heard about it from our mutual friend Casey, who felt awkward about the whole thing. She said Emma specifically told people not to invite me because she gets weird around baby stuff and it would be uncomfortable for everyone. When Casey told me that I was already 13 weeks pregnant and had just heard the heartbeat for the first time, I was finally starting to believe this might actually happen. That's when I decided Emma deserved a reality check. Monday morning, I called Emma and asked straight up why I wasn't invited. She gave me that not the motherly type line while sounding all fake sweet about it. That's when I dropped my bomb about my own shower. What do you mean, your own shower? She stammered. I thought you gave up trying. Nope, I said cheerfully. 14 weeks along, due in March. My mom's planning the shower for next Sunday at the country club. The silence on the phone was so long, I thought she'd hung up. Then she started backtracking hard. Oh, my god! I had no idea! Why didn't you tell me? We're supposed to be best friends! This changes everything! But here's the thing. It didn't change anything for me. Her true colors had been showing for months. The comments, the exclusion, the judgment. I realized I've been making excuses for someone who wasn't really my friend anymore. Listen, Emma, I said calmly. I didn't tell you because I've Learned to protect myself from negative energy. And honestly, after being excluded from your shower for not being motherly enough, I don't think we're as close as we used to be. She started crying and saying she'd made a mistake, that she was just stressed about her own pregnancy, but I wasn't buying it. Real friends don't treat you like damaged goods when you're struggling. The best part came two days later when Casey texted me screenshots Emma had posted in our college group chat begging people to come to a last minute get together at her house because she felt terrible about a misunderstand

Everyone always talks about how amazing and smart he is, and honestly our parents have never said no to him about anything his entire life. The problem is he's turned into this massive jerk who thinks he's better than literally everyone. He talks down to people constantly and acts like everyone around him is stupid. It's gotten so bad that I cringe whenever he opens his mouth around other people. he's been obsessed with this girl from one of his advanced classes named Emma. He talks about her constantly but keeps complaining that she won't give him the time of day. Every single day it's the same thing. He'll come home whining about how she ignored him or didn't laugh at his jokes or whatever. Last week he invited her over to work on some project together.

Entire time Jake just talked over her. she'd start to explain an idea and he'd immediately interrupt with actually, that's wrong because or that won't work, here's what we should do instead. At one point She suggested researching something online, and he literally called her idea stupid to her face. Then he spent like 20 minutes just bragging about himself. He told her about every newspaper article he'd been in, every award he'd won, every smart thing he'd ever done. The poor girl just sat there, nodding politely while looking like she wanted to disappear. The worst part was when he asked about her career plans, he said she wanted to be a teacher, and he immediately started lecturing her about how teaching doesn't pay well and she'd be wasting her potential. You could see her face just shut down completely after she left. That day, Jake came into my room all confused about why she seemed weird and distant. I wanted to tell him right then, but I figured maybe he'd figure it out on his own. He didn't. Instead, it got worse. He started coming up with all these theories about why Emma didn't like him. First he decided she was jealous of his intelligence. Then he convinced himself she was playing hard to get. Last week he told me she probably only likes dumb jock guys because girls don't appreciate smart men. Today was the final straw. Jake was at the dinner table going on his usual rant about Emma, while our parents nodded along sympathetically. He said she was obviously intimidated by how accomplished he is and that most women are too emotional to handle dating someone smarter than them. Our Mom actually agreed with him. She started talking about how some people feel threatened by exceptional individuals and that Emma probably feels insecure around Jake's success. Dad chimed in saying Jake shouldn't change himself for anyone and that the right girl would appreciate his gifts. I couldn't take it anymore. I put down my fork and looked Jake straight in the eye. She doesn't dislike you because you're smart, I said. She dislikes you because you act like a condescending jerk who thinks everyone else is stupid. The whole table went silent. Jake's mouth actually fell open. You talked over her the entire time she was here, I continued. You called her ideas stupid, you bragged about yourself non stop, and you told her she was making bad life choices.

My brother and I used to bet on everything. Not for money, just dumb sibling stuff. Last one to the car is a loser. First one to the couch picks the movie. Last one to the shower smells like feet, that kind of thing. But our most sacred, most legendary competition. The toilet dash. It started when we were kids, maybe 8 and 10. After a long family road trip, we both sprinted inside, racing for the bathroom like our bladders were gonna burst. He got there first, slammed the door shut behind him, and shouted, I win! I get to pick dinner! No one had even agreed on that rule, but it stuck. From then on, every time we got home from somewhere, a movie, school, a soccer, her game, we'd shout some variation of, first one to the toilet gets to pick the pizza! Last one to the toilet has to clean up dog poop. First one to the toilet gets bragging rights. We never actually enforced the rules. It wasn't about winning anything. It was about the bit. The inside joke. The sheer absurdity of sprinting full speed through the hallway, knocking into furniture, nearly tearing door. It's off hinges, just to be first to pee. Our parents hated it. Mom once yelled, you're going to break something important! Dad replied, like their bladders! We thought he was hilarious. We kept it up for years. Even As teenagers, even when we were too cool for most things, somehow this one joke always made the cut. And then it just faded. We got older, busier. He started driving. I got into music. He had a job and college occurrences to worry about. Somewhere along the way, we stopped yelling Toilet Dash! When we came home, the silence didn't feel weird at first. It just felt like growing up. But a few months ago, something changed. We were coming back from a long day helping our cousin move into her apartment. We were hot, tired, and both half dehydrated from lifting furniture and pretending we knew how to assemble IKEA beds. As we walked through the front door, I smiled and shouted instinctively. Last one to the toilet has to buy dinner. I took off running full speed, skidded into the hallway, laughing like an idiot, slammed the bathroom door behind me. No footsteps followed. I waited, expecting a bang on the door, a hey. I was closer, something. But nothing. I came out and found him standing in the living room, still holding his water bottle, not moving. I nudged him. You lose, man. Better Venmo me for that pizza. He forced to laugh. Now you can have it. Didn't think much of it at the time. Just figured he was tired, maybe he really didn't need to go. Whatever. A week later, we were at the mall. I almost did it again. Almost yelled it in The parking lot. But I stopped myself. For some reason, it didn't feel right. Then, a few days after that, I went to grab my phone charger from his room. His door was slightly open and he didn't see me walk in. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands. His phone was on speaker. I froze when I heard the voice. A doctor, calm, measured. So we'll monitor the progression, but based on your scans, it's likely you'll experience increasing pressure around the lower spine. That may explain the numbness and the urgency symptoms you described. My stomach dropped. He mumbled something I couldn't hear. The doctor continued. I understand.

So I'm at this party and everyone's bragging about their hidden talents. One guy can juggle, another solves a Rubik's cube in under a minute. My turn comes, and my brain decides to betray me. I blurted out I can control stoplights with my mind. Dead silence. Then someone goes, prove it. Any sane person would laugh it off, but no. I lead everyone outside like I'm about to perform sorcery. At the crosswalk, I close my eyes, press two fingers to my temple, and whisper, change. And right on cue, pure luck. The light flips green. The crowd loses their minds. Someone screams, he's real! They want more! I do it again, still pretending, and somehow it works. Cars honk, pedestrians cheer. At this point, I look less like a magician and more like a knockoff Jedi doing traffic control than chaos. My drunk buddy dares me, make them all green. I wave my arms like I'm summoning demons, and as if the universe hates me, all four directions turn green. Cars lurch forward, horns blaring, people sprinting like it's the apocalypse. My friends are chanting, Light Lord, Light Lord! While I'm praying no one dies. Police roll up. One officer squints at me and goes, alright, how long you've been working for the Illuminati? His partner mutters, ask him to do yellow. Nobody can do yellow. Meanwhile, I'm sweating like a busted street lamp. So, yeah, one dumb lie about stoplights, and now the cops are convinced I'm some kind of a government experiment.

She said, I'm not ready to close doors. What if someone better comes along? I was coming upstairs with groceries and heard everything. I left the groceries and her house key on the counter. Rachel and I had been together for three years. We were 30 and 33, spending four to five nights a week together, had keys to each other's apartments, and I was planning to propose in the spring. I'd already been ring shopping, found a vintage solitaire I knew she'd love at a jeweler downtown. She was smart, funny, had her life together. I felt like I'd lucked out. What I didn't realize was how often Rachel made comments that should have been red flags. When her friend Sarah got engaged, she said, I just can't imagine settling down with the first decent guy who comes along. When we'd watch romantic movies, she'd critique the couples. She could do so much better. Or, he's nice, but where's the passion? I'd rationalize these comments as her being thoughtful about commitment, maybe even mature for taking marriage seriously. Looking back, I was willfully blind to what she was really saying. We'd even book a trip to Italy for our fourth anniversary in March. $4,000 worth of flights and hotels I'd put on my credit card because she was tight on cash that month. She promised to pay me back, but like many of her promises, it was always next paycheck. Or after my bonus. That December, we were staying at her mom Carol's house for her birthday. Rachel had forgotten ingredients for dinner, so I volunteered to drive to the store in the snow. I spent 40 minutes getting everything, plus flowers for Carol, because I genuinely cared about this family I thought would become mine. Their house has a split level entry. You come through the garage, up steps into the kitchen. The living room is right off the kitchen with no separation. I just opened the door and was halfway up when I heard Carol. So when is Matt going to propose you? You have been together forever. I paused, curious about Rachel's answer. Mom, seriously, not this again. What? You're not getting any younger. He's a good man. Stable job, treats you well. Yeah, that's great, but I'm not ready to close doors. You know? What if someone better comes along? That's a good guy, but I don't know if he's my forever guy. I froze on those steps, grocery bags suddenly feeling like they weighed a thousand pounds. Carol responded, that's a terrible way to think, Rachel. You can't keep people as backups. I'm not saying he's a backup. He's safe, dependable. But sometimes I wonder if there's more excitement out there. Like, what if I'm settling? What if there's someone who makes my heart race the way Matt used to, but doesn't anymore? I mean, he's talking about marriage, and I just freeze up. Not Because I don't love him. But because I keep thinking, is this it? Is this the best I can do? Three years I'd invested in someone who saw me as a safe option while she waited for someone better. My phone blew up 20 minutes later. Texts and calls. I texted back. Once I heard what you said to your mom, we're done. I'll get my things next week when you're at work. Then I muted her. The next morning, I had 37 missed calls and endless texts. Rachel insisting I misunderstood, that she loved me, that she was just dealing with pressure. I didn't respond. Instead, I called her sister, Jess, 27, a personal trainer I'd met at family gatherings but never really hung out with alone. Tuesday, I went to Rachel's with some buddies to collect my thing. As we were finishing, Jess showed up, offering to help. Can't say I blame you, she said about my decision. I'd have done the same thing.

Mom wanted me gone. Three weeks later, police were involved. My husband's ex shows up at pickup after being gone for eight years and announces, you're done playing Mommy. I'm back. She hasn't seen her son since he was 4. Just disappeared one day to find herself and left my husband with a confused child asking why Mommy doesn't call anymore. Adrian stands there looking at their shoes while their biological mother explains how a kid needs their real parent, not some replacement. My husband looks exhausted and says, maybe she has a point. They should bond. He works 70 hours a week running his construction company. Which is why I know this is going to be a disaster, because I handle everything. But, sure, let them bond. I'm their mother. You just married their dad. She keeps emphasizing mother, like I don't know how biology works. Like I haven't been doing pick up and drop off and doctor's appointments and parent teacher conferences for two years, all while she was finding herself in Arizona with some guy named Carl. Well, I'm here now, my child. I don't need you. Fine. I pack up Adrian's special foods from my car, the ones for their specific texture issues, delete the 17 reminders for their schedule from my phone, hand her the inhaler I always carry because Adrian forgets theirs. She looks at it confused. He has asthma? She doesn't know her kid has asthma. Okay? I tell her, you're the Real parent I'll step back completely. She actually looks pleased with herself, but she has no idea what she's walking into. Day one Adrian shows up to school without their presentation that counts for 30% of their grade. X says kids need to learn responsibility. She doesn't know Adrian has executive dysfunction and needs three alarms plus a checklist. Day 2 Adrian eats cheese at lunch and throws up everywhere because X packed them a grilled cheese. Adrian texted me saying she asked since when are you lactose intolerant? Since always. I answered back for her. She'd know if she'd been here. Day 4 the teacher calls because Adrian punched the quiet kid. X believes Adrian when they say the kid deserved it for looking at them weird. I know the quiet kid is Adrian's only friend and they play fight as their weird inside joke, but I'm not the real parent so I say nothing. Now Adrian has lunch detention and no friends. Week 2 Adrian starts failing his tests. X doesn't know he needs to walk around while memorizing or their brain literally won't retain information. She tells him to try harder. Adrian gains 10 pounds in two weeks because X doesn't recognize their stress eating patterns. When AD and anxious, they'll eat an entire box of crackers without realizing. X just keeps buying more crackers. They're wearing the same hoodie every day and it smells like death. It's their favorite. She doesn't know it's their anxiety hoodie. And wearing it constantly means they're spiraling. Week three, the principal calls about concerning behavior. Adrian told the counselor they don't care about anything anymore. They're just being dramatic teens. You know, Adrian's best friend's mom calls me secretly because she still has my number. Your Adrian asked my kid for their Adderall. I thought you should know. X doesn't even know Adrian needs an ADHD evaluation. Doesn't know they can't focus without their specific routine. Then I see the scratches on Adrian's arms when I run into them at the store. Deep parallel lines. X says it's mosquito bites. In December? In Michigan? Friday afternoon, I'm at work when my husband calls, and his voice is shaking. Something's wrong.

That revealed something heartbreaking instead. I was teaching fifth grade in a small town when this quiet kid named Eli started showing up at my classroom door every morning. He'd wait there with this crumpled plastic grocery bag, looking nervous, until I unlock the door for the first time. It happened. I almost told him to wait in the hallway like everyone else, but then he pulled out this granola bar, juice box, and banana from his bag. Mister Carter, he said real quietly, can I sit in here if I share my breakfast with you? I thought it was the most adorable thing ever, this shy little kid wanting to eat breakfast with his teacher. So I said yes. It became our daily thing. Every single morning, Eli would show up with that same plastic bag, always the same three items. He'd sit at the desk closest to mine, and we'd eat together in comfortable silence. Sometimes he'd tell me about his weekend or ask questions about the math homework. I started looking forward to those 15 minutes before the chaos of the school day began. The other teachers thought it was sweet. That's so cute how Eli brings you breakfast, they'd say. I even bragged about it in the teacher's lounge. This kid is so thoughtful. He shares his breakfast with me every day. I felt special, like I was this kid's favorite teacher. After about two months, I noticed The food quality starting to change. The banana would have brown spots. The juice box felt warm. The granola bar wrapper was sometimes torn. One particularly rough morning, the banana was completely black on one side, and the juice box was so warm, it was probably spoiled. I was in a playful mood, so I teased him about it. You slacking on our deal today, buddy? Eli just laughed and said, nah, this was the best I could grab. Grandma says we got to stretch the fridge this week. That sentence hit me like a freight train. Stretch the fridge. I kept my smile, but my stomach dropped. I started asking gentle questions. Turns out Eli lived with his grandma and two younger siblings. His grandma worked the night shift at a factory and barely made enough to keep the lights on. This kid wasn't sharing his breakfast with me because he wanted to. He was giving me half of the only meal he was guaranteed to get that day because he thought it was required. When I asked him why he started bringing me food, his answer broke my heart. You said I could only sit in here if I shared. I didn't want to get in trouble. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to cry. This kid had been going hungry every morning for two months because he misunderstood a casual comment.

Even before my parents signed the divorce papers, my older sister Cameron announced, I'm living with dad. He's got the corporate job making six figures. Mom's just a useless housewife who's been doing nothing for the past 15 years. I watched Mom's face just slightly before she forced to smile. That's okay, sweetie. Whatever makes you comfortable. Cameron rolled her eyes. It's not about comfort. It's about being smart. Dad's the one with actual money. She looked at me like I was an idiot when I said I'd stay with mom. Enjoy eating canned soup for dinner every night, she said, dragging her suitcase down the stairs. Mom watched her hop in Dad's car quietly and apologized to me for getting the wrong parent. I hugged her. You got this, mom. What I didn't know was that those words were the exact catalyst she needed to prove everyone wrong. Mom landed a job at target. Not exactly in a managerial position like dad, but she didn't stop there. Every evening, after cooking us dinner, she took online certifications. Project management, Quickbooks, data entry, whatever she could get her hands on. And within months, she moved from restocking supplies to a fancy new office job, bookkeeping for a local contractor, and later worked her way up to managing the entire back office operation. I was serious. Be so proud of her. Meanwhile, dad's situation was completely different. He couldn't balance his corporate job with actually parenting Cameron. He started missing meetings to drive her places, called in sick when she had school events. He spending hundreds on takeout every night, hiring cleaners weekly, paying for babysitters. Even though Cameron was 17, and the last time I saw him, he looked extremely frustrated. After months of repeated offenses at work, his performance tanked, and the promotion he'd been promised disappeared. And my sister completely oblivious to it, because as long as she had Dad's credit card in her pocket, why would she care, right? That is, until mom started her own virtual assistant business. She snagged her first client and quickly started handling five at a time. And I helped her however I could. When our clients reached beyond 20, mom hired her first employee, another mom who needed flexible work. The mom cried when she received the news. You're a blessing, she told her. They both worked hard to expand and hire more moms. And eventually, two years in, she had 12 employees and a real office space of her own, making more money than dad ever brought in. And as for dad, he unfortunately got laid off the same month mom signed the lease on her office. And my sister Cameron, following the scent of money, quickly jumped ship. After dad lost the nice townhouse in the city, my sister called us. Can I stay with you guys a bit? She asked in the sweetest voice. Mom immediately said, yes, of course. Family is family. Cameron arrived with her suitcases to find our house completely transformed. Mom had renovated everything. New kitchen, finished basement, the garage converted to a home office. Even the cars in the driveway had upgraded from Mom's rusty old truck to a beautiful silver BMW M4. And working under mom, I managed to snag a recently released James ACW Mini Cooper. My sister's jaw absolutely dropped. Oh my god, mom, you're so cool! She smiled. Thanks, sweetie. While Cameron went on and on about how luxurious everything was now, mom finally explained how living with her worked. Everyone who lives here works for the household, she said, passing the salad. That's how we built this. I nodded and told her how I worked on social media marketing, Mom's boyfriend Carl worked on logistics, even the college kid rent

Her friends were commenting laughing emojis, and girl, you're so real for this. I didn't say a word, just packed my things and left that night. Mia and I met at a music fest of all three years ago. She was a content creator with a growing social media presence. I'm a sound engineer for an indie recording studio, a job I love, but one that doesn't come with fame or fortune. Six months into dating, we moved into her rent controlled apartment. Everything seemed perfect, and the algorithm showed me something I was never meant to see. It was a Wednesday during my lunch break. I was browsing TikTok when a video appeared on my for you page. Mia in our apartment, lip syncing to trending audio about settling. I smiled, recognizing our living room, until I noticed myself in the background with headphones on, mixing a track. The caption hit me like a physical blow. Dating down builds character hashtag trust the process. As I checked the comments, my stomach dropped. Girl, oh, you're so real for this. The way he has no idea. Invest in potential, but don't wait forever. Mia's replies were worse. Got to start somewhere. The apartment is mine anyway. He's sweet, but this isn't the final stop. She'd film this while I was in the same room, captioned it to belittle me, and shared it with her. 67,000 Followers, people I'd never met, were dissecting my appearance, my career, speculating about my income. Everything suddenly made sense. Her reluctance to introduce me to work contacts, the way she's your conversations away from my career at parties for suggestions about more professional clothes. I wasn't her partner. I was her content, her charity case, her stepping stone. I didn't call her or text, just returned to the studio and focused on the session I was engineering. By evening, I made my decision. Mia was filming something in the living room when I got home. She smiled, paused her recording. Hey, thought we could order Thai Tonight? I nodded, walked past her to the bedroom. While she finished her content, I quietly packed a suitcase. Essentials. Clothes, documents, laptop. I took nothing that could be considered ours. When I emerged with my suitcase, she was reviewing footage. Going somewhere? She asked, barely looking up. Yes. She glanced at the suitcase, confused. What's going on? I showed her my phone, open to her TikTok, dating down Build's character. Her expression shifted from confusion to recognition to shame that it's just. It's content, babe. It's not serious. My followers eat that stuff up. It's just a persona I play online. The comments from your friends, those are persona, too. She became defensive. You're overreacting. Everyone exaggerates for social. It's not real life. It's real enough that you filmed me without my knowledge and mocked me to tens of thousands of people. I Picked up my suitcase. If I'm holding you back from whatever level you think you should be dating at, I'll remove myself from the equation. Don't be dramatic. It's just a stupid video. You're going to throw away our relationship over this? Our relationship ended the moment you decided I was content rather than a partner. I headed for the door. She called after me, her voice rising in panic as reality sank in. I didn't answer. Just got in my car and drove to a friend's place. That night, my phone blew up with messages from Mia. Defensive, angry, then careful. Apologies. I replied once. I deserve better than to be someone's stepping stone. Or social media punchline. Please don't contact me again. Then I blocked her number. Three days later, the artist whose breakup song I'd engineered posted a snippet on Instagram, tagging me. It caught attention in our local music.

So last month, I get this call from Mia's school asking me to come in because she was in trouble for breaking another kid's property. I'm thinking, what the hell? Because Mia is usually the kid who reminds the teacher when they forget to collect homework. I drop everything and drive over there, expecting maybe she accidentally knocked over someone's water bottle or something. I walk into the principal's office, and there's my daughter sitting in the chair with this huge grin on her face, like she just won the lottery. The principal, Mister Torres, starts going off about how she deliberately destroyed another girl's expensive necklace and how this behaviour is completely unacceptable and blah, blah, blah. Once he's done with his speech, I turn to Mia and ask her what actually happened. So here's the backstory. Last year, around Christmas time, Mia saved up all her allowance money for, like, three months to buy these matching best friend necklaces for her and this girl, Kaylee. They were these cute little heart ones that split in half with best on one side and friends on the other. I ordered them off some random website for 15 bucks, but to Mia, they might as well have been diamonds. Everything was great until this year, when their friendship went totally sideways. Turns out Kaylee was basically running this little extortion ring at school. She was threatening kids that if they didn't buy her stuff on Some mobile game. She'd spread rumors about them or make sure nobody would play with them at lunch. He was doing this to Mia, too, and when I found out, I told Mia to cut contact immediately. But here's where it gets really annoying. Even after Mia stopped hanging out with her, Kaylee kept demanding that Mia give her the other half of the friendship necklace so she could give it to someone else. Like, every single day, she'd walk up to Mia and be like, give me my necklace back. The fact that we bought both halves apparently didn't matter to this kid. My older nephew Tyler, heard about this drama and got really mad on Mia's behalf. He's 17 and super protective of his little cousins. The last weekend, when Mia was at my sister's house, Tyler and his twin brother Connor decided to help her with some therapeutic destruction. They got out hammers and pliers and went to town on that necklace charm until it was smashed into, like, eight tiny pieces. Mia thought this was the most hilarious thing ever and kept the broken pieces in her jewelry box. Well, apparently, Kaylee kept bugging her every day about the necklace, so finally, Mia had enough. She put all the broken pieces into a little plastic baggie and brought them to school during lunch. She walked right up to Kaylee's table, dumped out all the broken pieces in front of her, and said, here's your necklace back. You're gonna need some super glue and a lot of patience, because it's turned into a jigsaw puzzle. Kaylee completely lost it. Her face went bright red, and she started screaming and ran straight to the teacher, saying, Mia destroyed her property. Next thing I know, I'm getting called to come pick up my daughter from the principal's office. When Mister Torres finished his lecture,

Let's see if he can make it back. They laughed and drove away. I never came back. Standing at that Colorado gas station, watching their tail lights disappear, something inside me just broke. Five years of marriage, and Chloe thought abandoning me 300 miles from home was hilarious. No phone, no wallet, nothing. The gas station clerk, an older guy named Pete, saw me standing there looking lost. You all right, son? He asked. I explained what happened, expecting him to shake his head and walk away. Instead, he handed me a bottled water and said, some people ain't worth the ground they walk on. He even let me use his phone to call the local shelter. I hitched a ride to Grand Junction with a trucker who didn't ask questions, found a homeless shelter run by a former Marine named Roy. He handed me a clipboard and said, fill this out. Tomorrow we figure out the rest. That night, lying on a cot surrounded by strangers, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about Chloe's laugh as they drove away, how Stephanie had said, he'll figure it out. He always does. Like I was some kind of trained dog they could abandon for entertainment. Roy got me a job washing dishes at Jackie's for cash. The owner, a tough old woman covered in tattoos, paid me under the table. You running from something? She Asked one day, watching me scrub plates like my life depended on it. Running to something, I said. Turns out Jackie had connections. Real estate connections. She'd been flipping houses since the 90s. Knew every contractor, inspector and banker in town. You got a good head on your shoulders, she told me after I caught an accounting error that would have cost her thousands. Wanna learn the business? Six months later, I was swinging hammers and learning to read blueprints. Jackie taught me everything. How to spot a good deal, negotiate with contractors, manage cash flow. This ain't charity, she'd say. You're earning every dollar. Within two years, I owned three rental properties. Change my name legally to Marcus Stone. Felt right, felt solid. Found peace I'd never had with Chloe. No more walking on eggshells. No more being the butt of every joke at gatherings. I met Sarah at a hardware store. She was buying paint for her first apartment. Asked my advice on colors. We started dating. Slowly, carefully. When I told her my story, she just nodded and said, some chapters need to end before better ones can begin. We married three years later. Small ceremony. Just Jackie, Roy and a few close friends. Real friend. And who'd stick around when things got tough. Then last week, 15 years later, my phone started buzzing. Unknown No. 107 missed calls over two days. Finally answered. Mike? Oh, my God. Mike, is that you? I've been looking everywhere. Chloe's Voice desperate now crying. I hired a private investigator. It took months to find you. Mike, I'm so sorry. That day was the worst mistake of my life. My husband left me. I lost the house. The kids barely talk to me since the divorce. I have nothing left. Please, I need your help. I said quietly. You don't understand. I've been searching for you for years. I know you're successful now. I saw the business licenses, the properties. I know you can help me. We were married. That has to count for something. Chloe, I interrupted. You left me with nothing. Not even basic human decency. It was just a prank. The girls dared me. I never thought you'd actually stay gone. You never thought

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. She left me $2 million and a letter about their lies. I drove to their house with the biggest smile of my life. The call came Tuesday morning while I was eating cereal before my shift at Auto Zone. Unknown number. Almost didn't answer. Is this Marcus Chen? Yeah, that's me. This is Janet Walsh from Walsh and Associates. I'm calling about Eleanor Chen's estate. Your grandmother. My spoon dropped. Grandma, Eleanor died six months ago. My parents said I wasn't welcome at the funeral because I wasn't real family. There's been some mistake, I said. My parents told me she left everything to them and my brother. Silence then. Mister Chen, we need to meet today. Two hours later, I'm sitting in this fancy law office staring at documents that made zero sense. Grandma left me two. $2.1 million. Her house and investment accounts worth another $800,000. This can't be right, I stammered. I'm adopted. She wasn't really my grandmother. Janet handed me an envelope with my name and grandma's handwriting. Your grandmother insisted I give you this personally. She was very specific about the timing. I opened it with shaking hands. Marcus, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson, son of my beloved daughter, Sarah. Sarah was David's first wife. She died in a car accident when you were 3 years old. David remarried Linda Six months later. Linda hated that you existed. You were proof of David's previous life. She wanted you gone. Wanted David to give you up for adoption so they could start fresh with their own children. I fought for you. I threatened to take them to court, expose what they were trying to do. They kept you, but Linda made your life hell as punishment. Every cruel word, every time they excluded you, every time they made you feel unwanted. That was Linda's doing. And David's cowardice in going along with it. I tried to maintain a relationship with you, but Linda made it impossible. She'd cancel visits, refuse to let you answer my calls. Eventually, they moved you all across states to keep you away from me. The last time I saw you, you were 15. I've missed six years because of their selfishness. I hired a private investigator to keep track of you. I know about the community college, the three jobs, the studio apartment you can barely afford. I know about the nights you ate nothing but ramen because you couldn't afford groceries. I know because I never stopped caring. I also know David and Linda have been telling everyone my estate will be equally among the grandchildren. They've been spending money they don't have, expecting a big inheritance. They're about to be very surprised. All my love, Grandma Eleanor. My hands were shaking as I finished reading. The truth hit me like a truck. I wasn't some unwanted adopted kid. I was her flesh. And blood cast aside by a stepmother who couldn't stand my existence. What do my parents think they're inheriting? I asked, and its smile was ice cold. Your grandmother LED them to believe they received the bulk of her estate. She encouraged this belief for years. Watching them dig themselves deeper into debt. How much have they spent? Based on our investigation, your father bought a 65 thousand dollar truck last year. Linda remodeled their entire kitchen for 50 thousand dollars. Your brother Logan got a 35 thousand dollar boat for graduation. They've taken out loans against the expected inheritance. Your parents currently owe $180,000 on credit and loans. I thought about my own life during that time. Working three jobs, eating ramen every night. Walking to work because my car died and I couldn't afford repairs. Asking for help with textbook money and being told I was too old for handouts. What are they actually getting? Janet consulted her papers. Logan and Ashley each receive $5,000. Your parents receive absolutely nothing. Your grandmother was very clear. David forfeited his right to inherit when he chose his new

You won't mind, will you? They smiled like it was already decided. My sister Jennifer sat there twirling her hair, scrolling through dating apps, not even looking at me, while her three kids demolished my parents living room. It's just temporary, mom said, cutting her steak like we were discussing weekend plans, until David gets comfortable with kids being around. So let me get this straight. Jennifer wants to hide her three children from her new boyfriend, dump them with me for months, and I'm supposed to pay for daycare while she plays house? You don't understand what sacrifice means. Dad jumped in, waving his fork dramatically. Jennifer's given up everything for those kids. The audacity was absolutely unreal. Jennifer had been pawning her kids off on everyone for years. Last month she dropped them at our cousin's wedding reception and disappeared for the entire party. The month before that, she left them with our 80 year old neighbor, Missus Chen, while she went clubbing until 3 a m. Two months ago, she dumped them on me for a girls weekend that turned into 5 days. I nodded and kept eating my ribs and calm. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. The thing is, Jennifer finally looked up from her phone, eyes sparkling with greed. David's got serious money. Like country club money. I Already told him I don't have kids yet. Just need a few months to ease him into the idea of family life. And you'll somehow manage Emma, Jake, and Sophie during the day while you're working full time? Mom asked me to. Exactly. Like I wasn't even there to speak for myself. Oh, I figured Laura could find a babysitter. Jennifer shrugged casually. I'll be pretty tight on cash with David moving in. His place is expensive to maintain, so I'd be paying for full time childcare for kids that aren't mine. While she pretends to be child free to trap some wealthy guy. The plan was absolutely insane, even for Jennifer. But here's the thing. I'd overheard this entire manipulative scheme two weeks go from Jennifer's friend Sarah at the grocery store. Sarah felt guilty about the plan and spilled every detail. Jennifer had been orchestrating this deception for months, already telling Dave. But she was single with no kids, so I'd already moved out of my apartment and across town. I spent two weeks quietly packing during lunch breaks, found a perfect place near the river, transferred my lease, changed my address with work, updated my voter registration, forwarded my mail, the whole nine yards. My parents and Jennifer had absolutely no idea. Great, I said, standing up and wiping barbecue sauce from my hands. You can drop them off at my place tomorrow morning around 9. I'll be completely ready. Jennifer's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Oh, my god. Thank you so much. I knew you'd come through for family. Mom started tearing up. You're such a good sister, Laura. I gave them my old address with a straight face. You? No, the completely empty apartment I'd already vacated. The one with the bright for rent sign posted in the front window. That night, I turned off my phone completely and enjoyed my first peaceful evening in my beautiful new place. I ordered pizza, unpacked my last moving box, and watch Netflix without any guilt or interruptions. The next morning, Jennifer showed up at my old apartment complex with three enormous duffel bags. Car seats, toys, snack.

My two best friends, Mia and Jade, had this belief that every boyfriend needed to be tested. They done it with every guy in our friend group. Hidden cameras, fake emergencies, planted temptations, always claiming it was saving us from heartbreak. When Mia discovered my boyfriend Ryan had been jewelry shopping, they told me they wanted to run the test on him. Three years means nothing if he can't pass a simple loyalty test, Ade insisted. Better to know now than after. You're engaged. We're trying to protect you. I protested that Ryan was different, that I trusted him completely. But they wore me down with stories of friends who'd been blindsided, marriages that crumbled, women who wished they'd known sooner. If he passes, you'll never doubt him again. Mia promised. One hour of discomfort for a lifetime of certainty. Against every instinct screaming no, I agreed. The plan was simple. I'd text Ryan about a fake emergency at Mia's apartment, then hide in the bedroom with my laptop while Mia answered the door. Jade had set up her phone as a hidden camera in the living room, barely visible unless you knew where to look. My hands shook with hesitation and fear as I texted Ryan, I'm at Mia's having a panic attack. Please come quickly. Ryan replied instantly, I'll be there in 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes felt like hours as I sat on Mia's bed with my laptop. Open. Watching the empty living room through Jade's camera feed. When the doorbell rang, my heart hammered so hard I thought I might actually have a panic attack. Mia answered the door, wearing a silk robe. Ryan, your girlfriend just stepped out to get air. Come in. Let's wait for her. On screen, I watched Ryan's confused face and concerned glances around the apartment. Mia guided him to the couch, sitting unnecessarily close. She's been so stressed lately, Mia heard, placing her hand on his arm. Ryan shifted away, clearly uncomfortable. Maybe I should call her, he said, reaching for his phone. Mia's hand moved to his chest. She'll be back soon. Relax. Fingers traced patterns on his shirt. You know, I've always thought you were incredibly attractive. Ryan froze. Mia, what are you doing? She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper I could barely hear through the camera. She doesn't have to know. We can keep this between us. I know you want this, too. Ryan's whole body tensed as she pressed against him, trying to push him back into the couch cushions. Stomach turned watching his obvious discomfort, the way his hands stayed firmly at his sides, his body angled away from her. Suddenly, Ryan pushed Mia away and stood up, his face flushed with anger. What the hell is wrong with you? His eyes swept the room and for a moment seemed to lock directly on the camera. Something flickered across his face. Realization, maybe? Before he headed for the door, Mia grabbed his arm. Wait, Ryan, I can explain. But he yanked free and was gone, the door slamming behind him. I heard his car tear out of the parking lot. The next morning, after a sleepless night, I drove to his house, desperate to explain. He opened the door, but blocked my entry with a cold expression. I need to tell you something I started about last night. The test, he interrupted. I know. I saw the camera. I saw it watching me while your friend threw herself at me. I noticed his eyes were squinting and realized that he was both angry and disappointed. Ryan, I'm so sorry. They convinced

I need an alpha. I replied, I understand. Jessica sat me down in our living room last Tuesday with this rehearsed speech about how she needed someone who takes charge, a real leader. Then came the kicker. She'd been getting close to my coworker, Mark from marketing. He's everything you're not, Michael, she said, her voice dripping with condescension. Confident, ambitious, going places. You're just comfortable being mediocre. I sat there quietly while she explained how Mark was about to get ordered to regional director, the position that would make him everyone's boss, including mine. She'd even been feeding him insider information from her role in HR to help his application look stronger. Once Mark gets that promotion, we'll be the power couple of the office, she grinned, practically glowing with excitement. He's already talking about the company car. Are the corner office the executive perks? That's the kind of man I need. She went on about how Mark commanded every room he entered, how he closed deals with a handshake, how he had that killer instinct that I apparently lacked. She said watching him work made her realize what she'd been settling for all these years. You're a great guy, Michael, but you're just not leadership material. You'll always be support staff, she said, patting my shoulder like I was a child. Mark sees the big picture. He takes risks. He makes things happen. The insult stung. Because it was so calculated. She'd clearly been thinking about this for months, comparing us playing our worth like commodities. In her mind, she was trading up. I need someone who fights for what they want, she continued. Someone who doesn't just accept things as they are. Mark would never just sit there quietly like you're doing right now. I simply said, I understand and went to bed. Here's what she didn't know. Three weeks ago, corporate had secretly offered me that same regional director position. They said Mark looked impressive in meetings, but consistently made promises the technical team and couldn't deliver. His strategy sounded great, but ignored crucial operational realities. We need someone who understands both sides, the VP had told me during our confidential meeting. Someone who can actually execute, not just sell dreams. Mark's proposals look flashy, but half of them would bankrupt us if we tried to implement them. The VP explained that while Mark was great at client presentations, he caused three major project delays in the past year by over promising capability abilities we didn't have. Meanwhile, my quiet efficiency had been saving the company millions by designing systems that actually worked. I've been hesitant to accept because I genuinely enjoyed my current role as senior systems architect. I like solving complex problems, building things that work. Management politics wasn't appealing. But after Jessica's speech about needing an alpha and her casual dismissal of my capabilities, my hesitation completely disappeared. Her betrayal had Clarified everything. Monday morning, I walked into the VP's office and accepted the position. Outstanding choice, Michael, he said, shaking my hand firmly. We'll announce it Wednesday. I have to say, we were hoping you'd come around. The board was unanimous. You're exactly what this company needs. At Tuesday, Mark was already celebrating prematurely. I heard him on a call with a client making promises about timeline and capabilities that were completely unrealistic. He'd even ordered business cards with regional director printed on them. Jessica texted me from HR saying she was so excited for the big announcement tomorrow and that she'd already made dinner reservations to celebrate Mark's promotion. She seemed to think I'd be happy for them. Wednesday at 2 p m, the company wide email went out introducing me as the new regional director, effective immediately.

Changed everything about that Cabo trip. I texted our family group chat emergency app endoscopy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote, got it. My four year old son, Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when daddy was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at 5 a m. Was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Missus Chen, my 74 year old neighbor, met us at her door in her bathrobe. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for eighteen hours. When I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I'd need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Mrs. Chen in her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was finally stable enough to Facetime Max, sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple teacher. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom, again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with I'm laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo, A family friend, Mrs. Rodriguez from church, had in the story, And called mom in a panic. Why is little Max staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery, and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Max stayed elsewhere. But Mrs. Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away from his father that long. Unless something's really wrong.

Marriage is a complete nightmare, bro. I wake up every day regretting my decision. If it wasn't for her family's money, I'd be gone already. I froze on the stairs. We just celebrated our three year anniversary last week. He'd cried reading his vows tell. Telling me I was the best thing that ever happened to him. The vow renewal thing, pure torture, man. Had to stand there making up romantic bullshit while her family looked on all mystied. I've gotten good at the performance, though. Oscar worthy. He actually laughed. My heart shattered into a million pieces. But hey, small price to pay for the lifestyle, right? Her dad's talking about bringing me into the family business next year. Once I'm established there, I'll have options. More options than just being the money wife's husband. The money wife. That's what he calls me behind my back. I quietly left and returned at my normal time, greeting him with a kiss like nothing happened. The taste of betrayal was bitter on my lips. Five days I've been living this nightmare. Sleeping next to someone who calls our marriage a complete disaster behind my back. Every morning I wake up wondering how I missed all the signs. But I haven't been sitting around crying. I've been busy. Moving money from our joint accounts into my personal one. Changing passwords on everything, getting my Financial ducks in a row. I discovered he's been making weird withdrawals for months. 200 here, 300 there. Always just under the amount we agreed needed discussion. Where was that money going? Another woman. Savings for his eventual escape. Yesterday, I casually mentioned my dad might be scaling back his business due to health concerns. Complete lie. But Connor's face went white as a sheet. Suddenly he was asking all these detailed questions about Dad's retirement plans and our future security. Not once did he ask about Dad's supposed health issues. I've been making subtle changes, too. Taking more private calls, working late, seeing just a little less affect. Mentioning casual conversations with our family lawyer. And Connor is absolutely losing it. Two nights ago, I caught him going through my closet while I was in the shower. Yesterday, he was scrolling through my search history on the iPad. Deliberately left searches for signs your husband is cheating and separate bank accounts for him to find. The psychological warfare is working. He's been frantically fixing things around the house that he's ignored for months. The squeaky bathroom door, the wobbly kitchen table, the broken porch light. It's like watching someone desperately trying to prove their value. Last night, he suggested we renew our vows again for the second time in three weeks. The desperation in his eyes was almost pathetic. When I asked why the sudden interest, he stammered something about celebrating our love with everyone important to us. Translation He's panicking about his gravy train derailing and wants to

She took my kids, and I lost my job. I spent years rebuilding my life. And when she found out I became rich, she tried to sue me for alimony. So I turned the tables in the most unexpected way. Three years after my divorce, I was barely scraping by as a freelance graphic designer, living in a studio apartment, eating ramen. Whole divorced dad starter pack. My ex wife, Laura, had convinced everyone I was having an affair with my work partner, Michelle. She'd moved in with her trainer, Kevin, the day our divorce was finalized. Then my weird uncle Robert died. The guy everyone called crazy because he collected vintage comic books and live like a hermit. Family reunions were awkward because Robert would corner people and lecture them about Superman No. 1 being better than gold. Turns out Uncle Robert wasn't so crazy. His comic collection was worth eight. Two million dollars. A mint condition Superman number one worth 3.2 million alone. I inherited everything. The local newspaper ran the story. By noon, my phone was buzzing like crazy. Within 48 hours, guess who called. Laura, who hadn't spoken to me in six months except through lawyers. Hey, stranger! She purred, using that voice she used to get expensive dinners. I heard about your uncle. I'm so sorry for your loss. Two years ago, she called him that smelly comic book. Weird. The kids have been asking about you. She continued, maybe we could meet for coffee, discuss their future now that your situation has changed. Translation I smell money and want my cut. I agreed to meet at Brewster's, where we had our first date. She showed up in a brand new BMW X5 designer handbag, fresh manicure clothes that cost more than my monthly rent. Interesting upgrade for someone claiming financial struggles. You look good, she said. With that fake success suits you. We ordered coffee. She got some twelve dollar specialty drink. I got black coffee. The twins really miss you, she started. Rachel keeps asking why daddy doesn't take them on vacation. And Daniel wants little league, but you. You know how expensive that is. Classic Laura manipulation. Making me feel guilty about money. With your new situation, she continued, maybe we could work out better custody. The kids deserve to benefit from their father's good fortune. Then came her real play. Actually, I've been thinking about our divorce timeline. Some of those comics probably appreciated during our marriage. My lawyer thinks I might have a claim to a portion of the inheritance. I nearly choked. We've been divorced for two years. Robert died three days ago. Laura, we've been divorced since 2021. Robert died Monday. She waved dismissively. But the collection existed during our marriage. Community property laws are complex. Her attorney. Of course, she'd already consulted someone. You know what I said, reaching into my jacket, Uncle Robert actually left something for you. Too. Her eyes lit up like a Jackpot. She probably expected a valuable comic or check. I handed her an envelope with her name and Robert's handwriting. She tore it open eagerly. I watched her face change as she read. Confusion, shock. Pure panic. The letter was a masterpiece. Robert had documented everything. Photos of Laura with Kevin six months before she filed for divorce. Screenshots where she bragged about taking me to the cleaners. Bank records of her secret account. A timeline of her lies about my supposed affair. The final paragraph was perfect.

I was grilling burgers when will grab the mic for his speech. Everyone thought he was drunk again. Then he pointed at my daughter Emily and said, funny how she looks exactly like me, not her dad. The backyard went silent. My wife Mara's face went white. What did you just say? I asked, but I already knew. Will laughed. Come on, Jackson. 18 years of playing house. Emily's mine. I felt my knees buckle. Emily was staring between us, confused. Dad, what's he talking about? Mara was shaking her head frantically. Will, stop! You're drunk. DNA test, he slurred, pulling out his phone. Got it done last month. 99.9% match. The burger spatula fell from my hands. 18 years. Every birthday, every scraped knee, every bedtime story. All built on a lie. You're lying! Emily screamed at will, but her voice cracked like she wasn't sure. My brother. My own brother shrugged. Sorry, man. Had to come out sometime. I looked at my wife, the woman I'd loved for 20 years. Is it true she couldn't meet my eyes? That was answer enough. Emily ran inside, crying. Half the party followed her. The other half just stare. Stared at me like I was some tragic zoo animal. Will walked over and patted my shoulder. No hard feelings, right? I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better than Any therapy ever could. Will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all stolen from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle. I continue. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born. She whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back outside, tears streaming. Dad, please tell me this isn't real. The word dad hit different now. Like a knife twisting. I don't know what I am anymore. Sweetheart. Will struggled to his feet. And work this out. Split custody or something. Custody? I laughed. You think I'm sharing anything else with you? My sister grabbed my arm. Jackson, calm down. Calm down. My brother just announced he's been sleeping with my wife for 18 years. At my retirement party, dad was sitting in his lawn chair, looking like he'd aged 10 years. Mom was crying into her potato salad. Will wiped his face. We never meant for it to go this long. 18 years, will. 18 years. Emily looked between us for the first time. I saw it. The nose, the eyes. How had I Been so blind. Am I really not your daughter? She asked me. My heart shattered. You'll always be my daughter, M. Biology doesn't change that. But even as I said it, I knew everything had changed forever. Will started walking toward his car. I'll give you space to process this face. I followed him. You're not going anywhere. I grabbed his keys. You created this mess. You're going to face it. Maura finally found her voice. Jackson let him go. Oh, so now you're protecting him in front of everyone? The entire party was watching our family implode in real time. Aunts, uncles, cousins. All witnesses to the destruction.

So I said, perfect! And treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. When Sophia hit me with the friend speech on a random Thursday night, I agreed so fast her head nearly spun off. Wait, you're not going to fight for us? Beg me to reconsider. Nope. Friends sounds great. And the confusion on her face was priceless. See, what Sophia didn't know was that I've been playing to break up with her for three weeks. She was suffocating me, going through my phone, interrogating me about every female coworker, throwing tantrums when I hung out with my buddies. But she beat me to the punch, so I just smiled and played along. I think she expected me to be devastated, maybe cry a little. Definitely gravel. Instead, I helped her pack her stuff and even called her an Uber. The look of pure bewilderment as I waved goodbye was worth every penny. The next morning, reality started hitting. She texted at 7:00am asking if I wanted to grab our usual Saturday. Hey, brunch? I said I was busy with my friend Luca. Since when do you prioritize Luca over me? Since we became friends, and Luca and I have standing Saturday plans. Now, this was complete news to Luca, but when I called him, laughing about the situation, he was totally down to be my alibi. We actually did start hanging out more. Turns out I've been neglecting my friendships while walking on eggshells. By week two, Sophia was panicking. I wasn't responding to her texts immediately anymore. When she'd send paragraphs about her day, I'd reply with cool or a thumbs up emoji. You know, like I do with my actual friends. Why are you being so cold? I'm not being cold. This is how I text my friends. But I'm not just any friend. According to you last week, that's exactly what you are. The desperation started showing when she began manufacturing crisis. Her car broke down near my apartment three times in one week. Each time, I'd send her always number and tell her I was busy. Before, I would have dropped everything to rescue her. Now she was just another friend with car trouble. Week three brought the waterworks. She showed up at my door at ten PM crying about work stress. Old me would have canceled my plans, made tea, and listened for hours. New me said, that sucks. And have you talked to your sister about it? I'm heading out to meet some people. What people? Since when do you have Thursday night plans? Just some friends from the gym. Rachel's having people over. The name Rachel hit her like a slap. She knew I've been going to a new gym since we became friends, but hearing about another woman sent her into overdrive. Rachel? Who's Rachel? A friend. You know, like we are. I grabbed my jacket and Headed for the door. Lock up when you leave. And maybe call ahead next time. Friends usually don't just show up unannounced. Nuclear meltdown happened at Chris's birthday party two weeks later. I showed up solo. Sophia arrived with some guy named Walter, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook Walter's hand, welcomed him to the group, then proceeded to have an amazing time without giving Sophia a second thought. Halfway through the night, she cornered me in Chris's kitchen, looking frantic. Why aren't you jealous? Why don't you care that I'm here with someone else? Why would I be jealous? Friends date people. I'm happy you're putting yourself out there, but we have history. We live together. We talked about marriage. Yeah, yeah, and then you said you wanted to be friends, so now we're friends. That's what you wanted, right? She tried to grab my hands. I stepped back politely but firmly. Sophia, friends don't do that. Her face went nuclear red. You're being cruel. This isn't what I meant. What did you mean, then? She couldn't answer because we both knew she'd wanted to keep me as her emotional support system while exploring other options. The classic cake and eat it too situation. I made a mistake, she whispered. I want you back. Sorry, M. I'm actually seeing someone.

The window frame creaked as I pulled myself through, thinking I'd successfully snuck back from Carter's party at 2 a m. But the second my feet hit the bedroom floor, the lamp clicked on, and there sat my dad in my desk chair, my laptop open in front of him, displaying every single text between me and Carter from the past three months. I knew I was dead. Fun night, he said, pulling up the pictures I sent him. I was so embarrassed as he started lecturing me on getting pregnant. You did this to yourself. Ali is going back to the shelter tomorrow morning. My heart fell through the floor as I processed what he was saying. Ali, the golden retriever puppy I'd gotten for my 16th birthday just two weeks ago. The dog I've been begging for since I was 7. The only thing that made being trapped in this house bearable. You can't do that! He's mine! You gave him to me! I sobbed, but my dad was already walking toward the door. The next morning, I watched through tear blurred eyes as dad loaded Ollie into the car, the puppies confused, whimpering, breaking what was left of my heart. And I spent the entire day in my room, refusing to eat, refusing to talk to them, just staring at Ali's empty bed in the corner and the toy rope he'd left behind. By 11 p m, when I heard my parents go to bed, their bedroom door clicking shut with finality. I knew what I had to do. I was getting my effing dog back this time. I didn't even bother being quiet as I went out the front door, not carrying if they heard me, not caring about consequences anymore. The animal shelter was only a mile away, and when I got there, I marched straight to the desk with tears streaming down my face. I sobbed out a story about how my parents had accidentally brought in my emotional support animal, how I had severe anxiety and needed him back immediately, how it was all a terrible misunderstanding. Please, I begged. He's microchipped under my name. I can prove he's mine. This is all just a huge mistake. My parents didn't realize what they were doing. After what felt like an eternity of back and forth of me showing every photo and video I had of tears and pleading, she finally relented, saying she could make an exception given the circumstances. I was walking out with Ali bouncing happily beside me, his tail wagging frantically, when I heard someone shout, wait! Stop! You can't take that dog! But I didn't look back, just started running, with Ali keeping pace, both of us sprinting through the parking lot and into the darkness of the suburban streets. My phone stayed silent as I jogged home. No calls from the shelter, no texts from my parents, nothing. They Must not have noticed I was gone yet. Probably assumed I was sulking in my room like I've been doing all day. But when I rounded the corner to our street, I saw the weirdest thing. Our front door was wide open, every light in the house blazing. And that definitely wasn't normal for midnight. I thought my parents were out looking for me. And as I crept closer, Ali suddenly tense beside me. Through the doorway, I could see chaos.

My friend Holly and I were voted couple most likely to get married in the yearbook, even though we told everyone we would never date. But I get why. She was a beautiful homecoming queen and I was football captain. The usual cliche, except, you know, we weren't jerks to everyone like in those movies. So, yeah, the pressure was ridiculous. Every school event, every party, even parent teacher conferences, someone would pull me or Holly aside and ask when we were finally going to date. Our homeroom teacher literally started a betting pool. The only person who listened was my best friend Kira, who told us, you guys don't have to date just because everyone else wants you to. But I didn't realize she had told us that for a really good reason. Something I found out way later. When Justin Bieber said, never say never, he was right. Because at our classmates pool party, it finally happened. Holly and I were sitting by the fire pit, everyone chanting kiss, kiss, kiss like we were in middle school. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, and said, let's just get this over with. When we kissed, everyone literally cheered. To me, it felt like nothing. Not bad, not good. Just literally pressing your face to another human being. But since everyone was so happy about it, we started dating and everything. Went smoothly, right? Not exactly. But it did lead to something so much better. To be fair, our dates weren't that bad. Our first official date was that weekend. Holly insisted Kira come with us. It'll be weird without her, she said. And honestly, I was relieved. We'd always done everything as a trio. Since seventh grade, anyway. So every date, Kira was there. We'd make her sit between us at the movies, all because Holly and I both wanted to be able to hear her jokes and hilarious side comments. I love watching her hide her face in her jacket during scary scenes. And at fancy restaurants, whenever Holly and I would run out of things to talk about and start staring at our menus in panic, Kira would jump in with the funniest stories to keep us going. People thought it was weird, but I was having the best summer of my life. With her around, I didn't have to think about how to date someone. The hangouts and conversations just came naturally. Even our families got used to it. Holly's mom started automatically setting three places at dinner. My dad called Kira the relationship translator. So when Kira couldn't make it to the next big date, let's just say it was a real eye opener. Holly's cousin was getting married in San Diego, and I was her plus one. I told her to take Kira instead, but Kira insisted. You guys will be fine. It's just two Days enjoy some romancing, too. But she was wrong. The car ride on the way there was painful. Holly and I fought each other over Spotify, arguing whether her podcast or my music was the best choice. We eventually just switched to complete silence, making the four hour drive feel more like 12. At the wedding, we sat through dinner barely talking, realizing we never really had much to say without Kira around to prompt us. Even when we slow dance together, other couples were lost in each other while we were mechanically following the steps like a recital. Back at the hotel, Holly kicked off her heels and flopped on the bed. This is weird without Kira, she said. I sat down next to her. I was just thinking that without discussing it. We both pulled out our phones and Facetimed her. She answered from her grandma's hospital room, whispering so she wouldn't wake her up. For 20 minutes. She made us laugh with stories about the nurses and her grandma hitting on the doctor. When we hung up, the room went quiet again. Holly turned to look at me. Why is this so hard when she's not around? I knew exactly what she meant. We haven't had a single real conversation all day. I'm exhausted trying to be your perfect boyfriend girlfriend, we both said at the same time. We looked at each other and started laughing. How bad would it be if we just broke up?

That was my reality. By 17, they claimed I owe them $300,000 in joy debt. They had color coded spreadsheets tracking every smile, every laugh, every moment of happiness I'd stolen from them. Since I could walk. I Learned to keep my face blank. Stone cold nothing. They said I was stealing their peace by being happy. So they'd actually Bill other families when I smiled around their kids $25 for infectious joy contamination. They called it. My childhood became a financial transaction. Giggling at a cartoon, that's $15. Smiling at a dog, another $5. They had categories for everything. Spontaneous laughter was $20, but if they deemed it excessive, it jumped to $40. Birthday parties were banned because they called them joy festivals. That would bankrupt me. I ate lunch alone in bathroom stalls because sitting with friends meant potential joy charges if someone told a joke. I slept on the floor in my room because my mattress was collateral for unpaid happy. They pulled me from art class, music class, any elective that might spark joy, because college isn't for debtors anyway. The worst part? They made me sign contracts. Actual legal looking documents, promising to pay them back with interest once I turned 18. They'd already picked out my future jobs. Three minimum wage positions to maximize debt repayment speed. They even calculated compound interest Rates and projected payoff dates through 2055. My neighbors knew about the system. Some thought they were genius parents who'd solved the spoiled child problem. Others would cross the street when they saw me coming, afraid of being charged for any accidental happiness I might display.

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers, except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you! She shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby. I deserve to be the first. Mom tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I better abort my baby within one week, or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning, she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places. She announced to our entire cul de sac, she just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a T E D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our Uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her, there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming down Her face. And said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff, and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing, and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then, seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower. When the door flew open. It was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly, wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise! I'm almost due! She announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date that was eight weeks. Weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday, bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in the Philippines. And paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box butter sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. Baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was call me from her hospital bed. You did this? She gasped through the oxygen mask. My baby is dying because you couldn't wait until me to have a child. The craziest part about all this is now that she was fighting for life, suddenly, the family was split down the middle. One half thought she'd lost her mind.

My friend Holly and I were voted couple most likely to get married in the yearbook, even though we told everyone we would never date. But I get why. She was a beautiful homecoming queen and I was football captain. The usual cliche, except, you know, we weren't jerks to everyone like in those movies. So, yeah, the pressure was ridiculous. Every school event, every party, even parent teacher conferences, someone would pull me or Holly aside and ask when we were finally going to date. Our homeroom teacher literally started the betting pool. The only person who listened was my best friend, Kira, who told us, you guys don't have to date just because everyone else wants you to. But I didn't realize she had told us that for a really good reason. Something I found out way later. When Justin Bieber said, never say never, he was right. Because at our classmates pool party, it finally happened. Holly and I were sitting by the fire pit, everyone chanting kiss, kiss, yes! Like we were in middle school. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, and said, let's just get this over with. When we kissed, everyone literally cheered. To me, it felt like nothing. Not bad, not good. Just literally pressing your face to another human being. But since everyone was so happy about it, we started dating and everything. Went smoothly, right? Not exactly. But it did lead to something so much better. To be fair, our dates weren't that bad. First official date was that weekend. Holly insisted Kira come with us. It'll be weird without her, she said. And honestly, I was relieved. We'd always done everything as a trio. Since seventh grade, anyway. So every date, Kira was there. We'd make her sit between us at the movies. All because Holly and I both wanted to be able to hear her jokes and hilarious side comments. And I loved watching her hide her face in her jacket during scary scenes at fancy restaurants. Whenever Holly and I would run out of things to talk about and start staring at our menus in panic, Kira would jump in with the funniest stories to keep us going. People thought it was weird, but I was having the best summer of my life. With her around, I did have to think about how to date someone. The hangouts and conversations just came naturally. Even our families got used to it. Holly's mom started automatically setting three places at dinner. My dad called Kira the relationship translator. So when Kira couldn't make it to the next big date, let's just say it was a real eye opener. Holly's cousin was getting married in San Diego, and I was her plus one. I told her to take Kira instead. Kira insisted. You guys will be fine. It's just two days. Enjoy. Some romancing, too, but she was wrong. The car ride on the way there was painful. Holly and I fought each other over Spotify, arguing whether her podcast or my music was the best choice. We eventually just switched to complete silence, making the four hour drive feel more like 12. At the wedding, we sat through dinner barely talking, realizing we never really had much to say without Kira around to prompt us. Even when we slow dance together, other couples were lost in each other while we were mechanically following the steps like a recital. Back at the hotel, Holly kicked off her heels and flopped on the bed. This is weird without Kira, she said. I sat down next to her. I was just thinking that. Without discussing it, we both pulled out our phones and Facetimed her. She answered from her grandma's hospital room, whispering so she wouldn't wake her up. For 20 minutes. She made us laugh with stories about the nurses and her.

I was grilling burgers when will grab the mic for his speech. Everyone thought he was drunk again. Then he pointed at my daughter Emily and said, funny how she looks exactly like me, not her dad. The backyard went silent. My wife Mara's face went white. What did you just say? I asked, but I already knew. Will laughed. Come on, Jackson. 18 years of playing house. Emily's mine. I felt my knees buckle. Emily was staring between us, confused. Dad, what's he talking about? Mara was shaking her head frantically. Will, stop! You're drunk. DNA test, he slurred, pulling out his phone. Got it done last month. 99.9% match. The burger spatula fell from my hands. 18 years. Every birthday, every scraped knee, every bedtime story. All built on a lie. You're lying! Emily screamed at will, but her voice cracked like she wasn't sure. My brother. My own brother shrugged. Sorry, man. Had to come out sometime. I looked at my wife, the woman I'd loved for 20 years. Is it true she couldn't meet my eyes? That was answer enough. Emily ran inside, crying. Half the part already followed her. The other half just stared at me like I was some tragic zoo animal. Will walked over and patted my shoulder. No hard feelings, right? I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better than Any therapy ever could. Will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all stolen from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle, I continued. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born. She. I whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back outside, tears streaming. Dad, please tell me this isn't real. The word dad hit different now. Like a knife twisting. I don't know what I am anymore. Sweetheart. Will struggled to his feet. Look, we can work this out. Split custody or something. Custody? I laughed. You think I'm sharing anything else with you? My sister grabbed my arm. Jackson, calm down. Calm down. My brother just announced he's been sleeping with my wife for 18 years. At my retirement party, dad was sitting in his lawn chair, looking like he'd aged and years. Mom was crying into her potato salad. Will wiped his face. We never meant for it to go this long. 18 years, will. 18 years. Emily looked between us for the first time. I saw it. The nose, the eyes. How had I been so blind. Am I really not your daughter? She asked me. My heart shattered. You'll always be my daughter, M. Biology doesn't change that. But even as I said it, I knew everything had changed forever. Will started walking toward his car. I'll give you space to process this, ace. I followed him. You're not going anywhere. I grabbed his keys. You created this mess. You're going to face it. Maura finally found her voice. Jackson let him go. Oh, so now you're protecting him in front of everyone? The entire party was watching our family implode in real time. Ants, uncles, cousins. All witnesses to the destruction. Will turned back. What do you want from me? I want my life back. I said I want my daughter back. I want 18 years back. I can't give you that. And give me everything else. That's when I realized what I had to do. The nuclear option. I pulled out my phone and called my lawyer right there in front of everyone. Mike, it's Jackson. I need you to start divorce proceedings.

When I first met Kevin, he mentioned this dream he had of visiting Paris someday. He'd get all dreamy, talking about the cafes, the art museums, the whole romantic vibe. Problem was, he barely spoke any French beyond Bonjour and croissant. I thought it would be the most romantic surprise ever if I secretly Learned his dream language. Every Tuesday and Thursday after work, I drove 20 minutes across town to this little community center for French classes. The teacher was this elderly woman named Madame Rousseau, who wore bright red lipstick and corrected our pronunciation like a drill sergeant. I told Kevin I was taking yoga classes with my coworker, Amy. He bought it completely. For two years, I practiced conjugating birds while making dinner. I'd whisper French phrases while he watched Netflix in the living room. I even started dreaming in French sometimes, which felt like a major accomplishment. I bought French romance novels and struggled through them with my phone dictionary. I wanted to be fluent enough to have actual conversations with locals. When we finally took that Paris trip, my plan was to surprise him on our fifth anniversary dinner at that fancy steakhouse downtown. I had it all mapped out. I'd order the entire meal in perfect French, then tell him about the language classes, and surprise him with already booked plane tickets to Paris. I'd saved up $3,000 in a secret account just for this trip. But three weeks before our anniversary, Kevin sat me down after dinner with this weird, serious expression. He started fumbling with his wedding ring, which he only did when he was really nervous. Jessica, we need to talk about something important, he said, not making eye contact. My stomach dropped instantly. He explained that he'd been struggling with our relationship for months and needed space to figure things out. He kept using phrases like personal growth and finding himself while I sat there in complete shock. The worst part was how rehearsed it all sounded, like he'd practice the speech multiple times in his car. I think I should move back in with my brother for a while, he said, still staring at the table. Just temporarily, to clear my head. I wanted to scream about the French classes, about Paris, about how I've been planning this perfect surprise. Instead, I just nodded and said okay, because what else could I do? The next morning, he packed two suitcases and left. He took his PlayStation, his favorite coffee mug, and that stupid motivational poster from our bedroom wall. The house felt enormous and empty without his stuff everywhere. I kept expecting him to walk through the door and say it was all a mistake. Week later, I was stress eating cereal for dinner when Amy called. She'd seen Kevin at some bar across town, laughing with his co Workers and this blonde woman from his office named Stephanie. Apparently they looked pretty cozy together. I'm probably wrong, Amy said, but I thought you should know. That's when everything clicked. The late work meetings, the new

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers, except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you! She shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby. I deserve to be the first. Mom tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I better abort my baby within one week, or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning, she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places. She announced to our entire cul de sac, she just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a T E D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our Uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her, there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming down Her face. And said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff, and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing, and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then, seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower when the door or flew open. It was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly, wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise! I'm almost due! She announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date that was eight weeks. Weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday, bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in the Philippines and paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box butter sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. Baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was call me from her hospital bed. You did this? She gasped through the oxygen mask. My baby is dying because you couldn't wait until me to have a child. The craziest part about all this is now that she was fighting for life. Suddenly, the family was split.

I was in after school detention with 40 other kids when someone burst through the door. It was Kayla from my math class, shaking really bad. There's someone outside, she said, trying to catch her breath. By the back entrance. Then she started crying. He has a knife. I felt my whole body go cold. Miss Franklin didn't even look up from her magazine. Nice try, Kayla. That's an extra hour for lying. She pointed at an empty seat. Sit down before I call your parents. Kayla basically fell into the chair. Then we heard this alarm going off. It wasn't the regular bell. The principal's voice came through the hallway speakers. Code red lockdown. This is not a drill. My hands started trembling. Miss Franklin rolled her eyes and locked our door. But she left all the lights on. Another fake drill. Keep working on your assignments. Then I heard a man's voice outside yelling something. I couldn't understand the words, but he sounded terrified. Security guards ran past our. Our door radios going crazy. Miss Franklin stood in front of the door window so we couldn't see out. Everyone stay in your seats. The hallway lights went off. I watched. Darkness spread under our door. Other classrooms went black, but our detention room stayed bright. All 40 of us sitting there under the lights where anyone could see us. This was the big monthly Detention for serious infractions. Then I heard footsteps. Slow and careful. They stopped at our door. The handle started moving. My heart was beating so hard, I thought everyone could hear it. The handle twisted harder. These doors looked solid, but I'd seen kids pop them open with credit cards. The footsteps moved away, but I knew they'd be back. My phone lit up. Are you safe? School on news, Miss Franklin saw kids checking phones. Put those away or I'm taking them, she snapped. But she stayed by the door instead of collecting them. Glass broke somewhere in the building. Not super close, but not far, either. Kids started sliding under desks. Back in your seats! Miss Franklin yelled, voice shaky. This is just a prank! Sweat was running down her face. The footsteps came back, checking each door. When they got to the room next door, the whole wall shook. Someone was trying to break in, getting closer. Everyone stared at our door's little window. We stuck out in the dark building. Miss Franklin gripped her desk, but still wouldn't turn off the lights. Police would be here if this was real, she said quietly. A kid in back whispered he'd already called 9 1 1. Miss Franklin didn't hear him. We felt a bit of hope help was coming, but I could hear someone breathing hard outside our door. Now the door got hit hard. It bent inward and paint chips flew off. I jumped up and Ran for the light switch. Miss Franklin left her spot to block me. Sit down or you're suspended! Turn off the lights! Someone yelled. Half the class was on their feet. Miss Franklin spread her arms to block us. Nobody moves! You'll all fail! Another hit! Louder! The door frame split and wood flew across the room. I grabbed a desk and shoved it against the door. Other kids started doing the same. We built a wall of furniture. While Miss Franklin screamed about destroying property. She grabbed a desk.

The window frame creaked as I pulled myself through, thinking I'd successfully snuck back from Carter's party at 2 a m. But the second my feet hit the bedroom floor, the lamp clicked on, and there sat my dad in my desk chair, my laptop open in front of him, displaying every single text between me and Carter from the past three months. I knew I was dead. Fun night, he said, pulling up the pictures I sent him. I was so embarrassed because he started lecturing me on getting pregnant. You did this to yourself. Ali is going back to the shelter tomorrow morning. My heart fell through the floor as I processed what he was saying. Ali, the golden retriever puppy I'd gotten for my 16th birthday just two weeks ago. The dog I've been begging for since I was 7. The only thing that made being trapped in this house bearable. You can't do that! He's mine! You gave him to me! I sobbed, but my dad was already walking toward the door. The next morning, I watched through tear blurred eyes as dad loaded Ollie into the car, the puppies confused, whimpering, breaking what was left of my heart. And I spent the entire day in my room, refusing to eat, refusing to talk to them. Just stay staring at Ali's empty bed in the corner and the toy rope he'd left behind. By 11 p m, When I heard my parents go to bed, their bedroom door clicking shut with finality, I knew what I had to do. I was getting my effing dog back this time. I didn't even bother being quiet as I went out the front door, not caring if they heard me, not caring about consequences anymore. The animal shelter was only a mile away, and when I got there, I marched straight to the desk with tears streaming down my face. I sobbed out a story about how my parents had accidentally brought in my emotional support animal, how I had severe anxiety and needed him back immediately, how it was all a terrible misunderstanding. Please, I begged. He's microchipped under my name. I can prove he's mine. This is all just a huge mistake. My parents didn't realize what they were doing. After what felt like an eternity of back and forth of me showing every photo and video I had of tears and pleading, she finally relented, saying she could make an exception given the circumstances. I was walking out with Ali bouncing happily beside me, his tail wagging frantically, when I heard someone shout, wait! Stop! You can't take that dog! But I didn't look back, just started running, with Ali keeping pace, both of us sprinting through the parking lot and into the darkness of the suburban streets. My phone stayed silent as I jogged home. No calls from the shelter, no texts from my parents, nothing. They must not have known, noticed I was gone, yet. Probably assumed I was sulking in my room like I've been doing all day. But when I rounded the corner to our street, I saw the weirdest thing. Our front door.

I don't have HIV and never requested that prescription. My vindictive ex boyfriend works there and has been destroying my reputation out of spite. His name is Brett, and we dated for eight months before everything went sideways. He worked at the CVS near my apartment, which was super convenient. When we were together, I'd swing by after work, grab my birth control, and he'd always slip me a free candy bar or something cute like that. He seems so sweet back then, but when I broke up with him last month, he turned into a complete psycho. He couldn't handle that I was done with his controlling garbage. Like, the guy literally threw a tantrum because I wanted to hang out with my friends without him. He'd show up at my work, call me 50 times in a row, the full stalker routine. So yesterday, I went to pick up my actual prescription for anxiety meds. Nothing embarrassing, just standard stuff my doctor prescribed after my panic attack started getting worse. I walked up to the counter like normal, gave them my name and birthday. But instead of Brett helping me like usual, this older pharmacist lady was working. That's when Brett appeared out of nowhere from the back room. He had this weird smirk on his face that immediately made my stomach drop. The lady started looking through the computer system, and Brett walked Right up behind her, he pointed at the screen and said really loudly, oh, yeah, that's the HIV medication for Emma. Make sure you tell her to take it with food. Entire pharmacy went dead silent. There were, like, six people in line behind me, including Missus Garcia from my building, who knows my whole family. Everyone was staring at me. My face turned bright red, and I couldn't even form words. The pharmacist lady looked confused and started saying something about how that wasn't what was showing up in the system, but the damage was already done. I grabbed my actual pills and basically ran out of there. Brett was grinning like he just won the lottery. I could hear people whispering behind me as I left. The worst part is, my apartment building has serious gossip problems. By the time I got home two hours later, my neighbor Ashley was giving me these weird, sympathetic looks in the hallway. My phone started blowing up with texts from people asking if I was okay and if I needed anything. Word travels fast in a small town. I was so angry, I couldn't even think straight. This jerk was literally spreading lies about my health just because I had the nerve to dump him. I knew I had to do something or this rumor would follow me around forever. So I called the CVS corporate number and filed a complaint about employee misconduct. Turned out they take privacy violations super Seriously? Especially fake medical information. The manager called me back within an hour asking for details. I explained everything about our relationship and what Brett had done. They launched an investigation immediately. Apparently, accessing customer medical records without permission is illegal, and making up fake prescriptions is even worse. The manager said they'd already pulled the security cameras and could see Brett clearly interfering with my transaction. Three days later, Brett was fired. Not just fired, but apparently he's facing charges for violating medical privacy laws. The company lawyer called me to apologize and offered

He's back! And three employees immediately ran to the back room. I'm standing there confused, holding my five dollar Bill, when the remaining barista, this girl named Casey, starts whispering to me, that guy behind you. He comes in here every Tuesday and makes our lives miserable. Complains about everything, demands free drinks, threatens to call corporate if we don't give him exactly what he wants. Once I turn around and see this middle aged guy in a wrinkled suit tapping his foot impatiently. He looks exactly like my stepdad, Rick. Same bald head, same angry scowl, same way of standing like the world owes him something. My heart starts racing because Rick has been making my mom's life hell for two years now. He yells at her for burning toast. Those tantrums when dinner isn't ready at exactly 6. And last week I caught him screaming at her because she bought the wrong brand of coffee. The guy starts banging on the counter. Where is everyone? This is ridiculous service! His voice is loud and demanding, just like Rick's when he's having one of his episodes at home. That's when I remembered something my mom told me last month. She said Rick used to work at some office building downtown before he got fired for being difficult with clients. She mentioned he spends his mornings at coffee shops now, complaining about everything because he has nothing else. To do. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Excuse me, sir, what's your name? I asked sweetly. Why do you need to know? He's nap. Just curious. You seem really upset about the service here. He launched into this massive rant about how young people don't know how to work, how he deserves respect, how he's going to get everyone fired. The whole time I'm recording, getting every word. Then he starts bragging about how he does this at multiple coffee shops around town, how he's gotten at least six people fired this month, and how it's his hobby. Now, 20 minutes later, I'm sitting in my car, uploading the video to TikTok with the caption, when Karen's think no one is watching. I tagged the coffee shop and added hashtags about workplace harassment. The video blew up overnight. 3 million views. Thousands of comments from other service workers sharing their own stories about this same guy. Turns out he's been terrorizing coffee shops, restaurants, and retail stores all over our city for months. People started sharing his photo, warning other businesses about him. By Thursday, the local news picked it up. Local man's pattern of harassment exposed on social media. They interviewed Casey and other workers, who confirmed he'd been doing this everywhere. The coffee shop corporate office saw the video and banned him from all their locations.

I found out later dad kept a savings account with Marcus's name on it. $10,000 from his Walmart wages for when he comes home. Last month, I was repainting Dad's old shop when a Mercedes pulled up. Marcus stepped out wearing a designer suit, Rolex gleaming. He'd aged badly, the look of someone who'd partied away eight years. Hey, little brother, he said casually. Is dad around? I want to explain everything. Made it big in crypto. Can pay him back with interest. Dad's at Riverside Cemetery, I said flatly. Plot 47B. Been there 14 months. The color drained from his face. When? How? Waiting, I said. He died waiting for you. Set your place at dinner every Sunday for eight years. Forgave you. Before his last breath, Marcus pulled out a check. $1 million. See? I told you I'd make it someday. You built it on his corpse. I said that money was his life's work. You didn't steal money, Marcus. You stole his remaining years. He died a Walmart greeter because of you. Marcus tried pushing past me. This is still his place. It's a coffee shop now. Everything of Dad's is gone. You missed the decline, the pain, the end. You missed your chance to let him die in peace. Instead of wondering what he did wrong as a father, Marcus stood there in his expensive suit, holding his worthless check, finally understanding what his absence had cost. Not money, but the Chance to make peace with the man who loved him by everything. He drove away without visiting the cemetery. Sometimes the cruelest abandonment isn't leaving. It's staying away while someone waits for you to return. Keeping hope alive until their very last breath.

He came back last month, expecting forgiveness. He found out dad died waiting for an apology. The security camera caught everything. Marcus emptying Dad's safe at 3 a m, stuffing $340,000 into a duffel bag. The money dad had Ave for 40 years running his auto shop. Gone in 15 minutes. Dad found the note that morning. I need this more than you do. Don't look for me. The betrayal destroyed something in dad. He had to sell the shop at a loss, move into a one bedroom apartment, and take a job as a Walmart greeter at 71. But watching his golden child become a thief, that killed his spirit. Move back from Denver to help. But every Sunday dinner, dad set Marcus's place at the table. Maybe today, he'd say the empty chair mocked us both. Year one, dad refused to press charges. He's still my son. Year two, he hired a private investigator. The trail went cold in Phoenix. Year 3 brought Dad's first heart attack. In the hospital, he made me promise to tell Marcus he was forgiven. I just want to know why. What did I do wrong raising him? Dad's health declined steadily. Diabetes? Any problems? Another stroke? Sometimes he'd mistake me for Marcus, grab my hand and say, you came back. The hope in his eyes when reality hit was unbearable. Year 7, Dad moved into the hospital. Even on morphine. He'd ask nurses if his son had called. I'd lie and say Marcus was coming. Dad would smile peacefully. He died on a Tuesday morning, still waiting. His last words were about Marcus. Tell him the combination was his birthday. He didn't need to steal.

She said, I'm not ready to close doors. What if someone better comes along? I was coming upstairs with groceries and heard everything through the kitchen window. My heart just stopped. Two years together, living together for eight months. And that's how she really felt. I quietly set the bags down outside, grabbed my keys, and drove to my buddy Mateo's place. Didn't even go inside to confront her. What was the point? Mateo listened to everything while we sat on his porch drinking beers. Then he said something that changed my perspective completely. Dude, she just saved you from the biggest mistake of your life. Imagine if you'd proposed and found this out after the wedding. He was right. I've been ring shopping for weeks. Actually had an appointment at the jeweler that Saturday to pick out something perfect. Had the whole proposal planned out. Dinner at the restaurant where we had our first date, then a walk through the park where I'd hidden a photographer. The next morning, I went back to get my stuff. Ava was crying. Makeup street to down her face, begging me to stay. I didn't mean it that way. Mom put me on the spot. You know how she gets with her questions. So your real feelings only come out when you think I can't hear them? That's even worse. Ava. But her sister Selena was there, too, visiting from college for spring break. She pulled me aside while Ava was in the bathroom and whispered. She said the exact same thing about her last boyfriend, Xavier. Word for word. I remember because it made me sick then, too. That's when it clicked. This

Took him maybe 30 seconds, and he didn't even seem to try hard. The cops started digging into Derek's background. Turns out he had access to way more than people realized. Every security system he installed came with admin codes that let him disarm everything remotely. And as a locksmith, he was making copies of every key and access code he touched. Here's how smart this guy was. He never hit houses right after working on them. He'd wait months, sometimes half a year, long enough for people to forget he'd ever been there. He'd watch people's social media, figure out when they were going on vacation, then strike when the house was empty. The genius part was combining both jobs. The security systems told him which houses had expensive stuff worth stealing. The locksmith work gave him a way to get in without leaving any trace. And since he installed the security systems himself, he knew exactly how to disable them. They finally caught him because the Chen family had installed a second set of cameras in their baby's room that Derek didn't know about. These were connected to a different system entirely. When he broke in, those cameras caught his face clear as day. When police searched Derek's house, they found a storage unit full of stolen goods and this thick

No contact with family. My sister Tara got a German Shepherd for her 16th birthday. I got a card. The dog's name was Jack's and he cost $3,000 from a champion bloodline. My parents built him a heated dog house that cost more than my car. When Jax bit me the first week, dad said I must have bothered him. Jax killed my childhood cat, peaches, three months later. I'd raised peaches from a kitten bottle, fed her when she was abandoned. I found her lifeless in the backyard one morning. My parents shrugged and said cats were boring anyway, that dogs had personality. They refused to let me bury her properly because it might upset Jax to smell another animal in his yard. I buried peaches at my friend's house and cried alone. I paid for my own college, working three jobs. Sarah dropped out sophomore year to become a dog trainer. She'd never trained Jax to even sit yet. My parents bought her a 40 thousand dollar mobile grooming van for her new career. The business lasted two months. I graduated nursing school with honours. My parents couldn't make it to graduation. Jack's had a vet appointment when Tara's dog turned one. They threw a party with 50 guests. Then Jack's attacked my neighbour's poodle. My parents paid the vet bills and bought Tara a second German Shepherd to keep Jack's company. When I asked for help with my textbooks, mom said, that's My responsibility. The second dog's name was Athena. She was worse than Jack's. Together, they destroyed my childhood bedroom. During Thanksgiving, I found peaches hidden toys under my bed torn to shreds. My parents laughed and said, dogs will be dogs. Everything unraveled when I met Steven. We dated two years before getting engaged. My parents said they were thrilled, but never asked about wedding plans. When I mentioned wedding costs, they suggested courthouse ceremonies were more intimate. At the same time, Tara announced Jack's needed surgery for hip dysplasia. My parents spent $15,000 without blinking. Then Jack's destroyed my wedding dress. During the fitting, Tara had brought him to my appointment uninvited. He jumped on me with muddy paws and tore the train clean off. The dress was ruined beyond repair. Tara laughed and said,

Toby's girlfriend Kelsey became social media manager for our B2B company that doesn't even need Instagram. Both making DOLLAR85K annually, by the way. Meanwhile, I'm still maintaining every line of code, updating systems, handling server crashes at 2:00am, and taking my measly 20% cut as the tech guy. Yesterday at four PM. Hey, we held a partners meeting and voted. You're out. The business needs to evolve beyond just tech stuff. Pack your desk. By Friday we'll mail your last check. Thanks for everything. I replied. Okay, then I did what any reasonable person would do. I logged into AWS and revoked every single license key for their software. All of it. The client portal, routing system, inventory management, payment processing, everything. Now it all shows one simple message license expired. Please contact your software administrator. Garrett called me at four seventeen PM, then 4:19, then 4:12. Missed calls by 4:30. I didn't answer any of them. The chaos that followed was honestly better than Netflix. Biggest client had a $400,000 shipment scheduled for the next morning. Without the routing system, they had no idea which drivers were supposed to go where. The inventory system was down, so they couldn't figure out what was supposed to be shipped. Garrett showed up at my apartment at 6 a. M. Pounding on the door like police. I recorded it through my ring doorbell but didn't answer. He screamed for 20 minutes about how I'm being petty and destroying the Family

Mallory tried being sneaky. She reached out to my ex girlfriend on Facebook trying to dig up dirt on me. Told my ex that I was having a mental breakdown and had stolen company property, asking if she noticed any unstable. Well, behavior when we dated. My ex screenshot everything and sent it to me with lol. Your family is insane. Glad you're finally standing up to them. They also tried hiring an emergency IT company to rebuild the entire system. The company came in, looked at what needed to be built, and quoted them $450,000 with a 6 month minimum timeline. Three of their major clients have already started looking for new logistics part partners. Word travels fast in this industry when your systems just disappear overnight. I got a call from dad this morning. Turns out Garrett and Toby had to take out a $200,000 emergency loan just to keep the lights on. They're hemorrhaging money faster than when they first started.

I'm sorry, but professional catering isn't free, I said firmly. She got nasty fast. Fine, whatever. I'll find someone actually good who appreciates the opportunity. That stung more than I expected. Someone actually good? Like my eight years of experience meant nothing. The family got weird after that. Usually Sabrina's wedding would be the topic of every conversation, but suddenly nobody mentioned it. My mom said Sabrina found an amazing caterer who's just just as talented, but wouldn't elaborate. Wedding day arrived. I wasn't invited. Probably punishment for not providing free labor. Honestly, I was relieved. Family weddings are exhausting, full of old grudges and forced small talk. I spent Saturday night actually relaxing for once. Ordered Thai food, opened a good bottle of wine, watch Netflix. First free evening I'd had in months during wedding season. Then Sunday morning at 7 a. M. My phone started buzzing like crazy. Missed calls from Sabrina, her mom, my mom, even my aunt, all starting around 6 a. M. Just rapid fire calling. Something was very wrong. I finally answered when my mom called for the fourth time. Oh, thank god, she said breathlessly. The wedding was a complete disaster. The food gave everyone food poisoning. Half the guests are in the ER. My stomach dropped. What happened? Turns out Sabrina found her better caterer on Craigslist. Some guy named Stanley who quoted $1,200 for 150 people. Even I knew that was impossible. That wouldn't cover basic ingredients. Let alone

But Sabrina was determined to prove she didn't need me. She bragged to everyone about finding someone just as good for a fraction of the price. Stanley showed up three hours late to the reception venue. No uniform, no professional equipment, just a beat up van filled with grocery store containers. The appetizers were gas station sandwiches cut into triangles. The main course was clearly expired potato salad and room temperature deli meat. The wedding cake was a grocery store sheet cake with congratulations spelled wrong and blue frosting. Within an hour, guests started getting violently ill. The bathrooms were packed. Henry's grandmother had to be rushed to the hospital. The photographer left early because he couldn't stop throwing up. Sabrina was sobbing in her $3,000 dress while paramedics tended to her guests. That's when she started calling me, begging me to somehow save what was left of her reception. When I finally called her back, she was hysterical. Please, I'll pay whatever you want. You bring something. Anything. The reception is ruined. I took a deep breath and said exactly what she'd said to me two months earlier. I'll find someone better. Then I hung up and went back to my Thai food. The aftermath was brutal. Photos spread through our family group chat, Henry looking mortified while Sabrina sobbed over grocery store sandwiches. The venue had to call a hazmat team for the bathrooms. Three couples canceled their honeymoons due to food poisoning. Stanley got Banned from the country club permanently. My business actually boomed after word got out.

So I let them discover who was really paying their bills. I'm 30. Co founder of a tech company near Seattle. My family never understood what I do. They think I repair machinery. For two years, I've been quietly paying my parents utilities. Electricity, water, internet. Nearly $400 every month, totaling nine thousand hundred and forty two, or $17. They never mentioned it, never thanked me. Just accepted it like it was owed. Jessica was always the golden child. While I was responsible and studious, she was beautiful and charismatic, getting anything with a smile in family photos. I was always at the edge, while Jessica took center stage. Three weeks before my mother's birthday, I called to say I'd be coming home early to help with preparations. My father answered, and after hesitation, his voice turned cold. Ryan, maybe don't come home this year. Jessica's bringing her boyfriend. He's a manager, someone important. And your job, it isn't very comfortable to talk about. So it's best if you don't come. What the hell did you just say? You coming home would embarrass the whole family. If you insist on coming, don't call me your father. Then he hung up. I sat there, hands shaking, his words echoing in my head. The same people living off my 400 dollar monthly payments were calling me the family shame. I opened my banking app and stared at That No.. Nine thousand hundred forty two, 17. I scrolled to automatic payments and canceled every single one. Electricity, water, internet. All of it. A week later, my mother texted. Internet Bill is due. Can you take care of it? No mention of what happened, no apology. Just a request to pay. I didn't respond. Two weeks later, my father left a sharp voicemail. Power company called. This month's Bill hasn't been paid. What's going on? Still no acknowledgement. I remained silent until my mother's birthday that afternoon.

They'll be here after you. I packed my bags that night without another word. When she and her squad showed up at my new place days later. She? I'd been with Marissa for over two years. We'd moved in together six months earlier. Split everything down the middle, the whole domestic thing. But lately, I felt like I was dating five people instead of one. Marissa had this tight knit friend group. Chloe, Adrian, Tasha, and Finn, who called themselves the squad. Ironically, they did literally everything together, 24 seven. Group chats, matching Halloween costumes, coordinated social media posts. First I thought it was sweet. Eventually, I started wondering if I was even in a relationship or just some guy who paid half the rent. The pattern had been building for months. My graduation from my master's program. She went to Adrian's housewarming instead. My brother's wedding. She was too exhausted from a three day festival with the squad. When my mom was in the hospital for surgery, Marissa couldn't visit because it conflicted with their weekly game night. But she expected me to drop everything for her needs. Last month, she called me at 2:00am to pick her up from some dive bar because Finn was too drunk to drive. When I got there, she barely acknowledged me. Just kept taking selfies while I stood there like an Uber driver. The worst part was overhearing her phone conversations. I heard Her tell Tasha I was going through a jealous phase and needed to learn to share her time better. Like I was some insecure teenager instead of her partner. The breaking point came with our two year anniversary. I'd planned

I only found the first camera because I dropped a fork. It slipped under the kitchen cabinet, and when I bent down to grab it, I saw a tiny black dot blinking behind the molding. I stared at it for five seconds straight before it hit me. It was pointed directly at my couch, where I usually nap, sometimes shirtless. I unscrewed the panel and pulled out the camera. It was wireless. Micro lens. No brand. Not something you find at Walmart. I didn't freak out. I got quiet. I live in an old triplex, third floor. My landlord, Dave, lives on the bottom floor. Looks like a guy who eats plain boiled chicken and still sweats. You know the type. Too friendly. Always around, just fixing stuff. No one asked him to. A few weeks before, I caught him in the hallway, just standing there saying he thought he heard a leak. I thought he was just awkward. Turns out he was waiting for me to take my shirt off. So I started searching the apartment. Found a second cam inside the smoke detector above my bed, a third one behind a vent in the bathroom. This man had basically installed a live streaming network of my body without my consent. That's when I stopped being scared and started producing content. I left the cameras exactly where they were, but I changed the script every Morning. I'd start with a routine. I'd stand directly under the camera in the bathroom and talk to it like it was Alexa. Good morning, Dave. Hope you're enjoying the view. Can't wait for you to see the surprise later. Then came the props. I filled my fridge with fake IDS, rubber gloves and syringes filled with dyed water. Took hours to make everything look real. I'd sit on the couch under the kitchen cam, holding a fake burner phone, saying stuff like, yeah, the body's still in the tub, but the acids working slowly. Sometimes I just stare straight into the camera for 30 minutes. No blinking, no moving, just wide eyed, like I was watching him. By week two, I noticed changes. Dave stopped coming upstairs.

It was her therapy, her way of healing from the hell she'd endured. I asked him nicely the first time, he shrugged it off with a dismissive smirk. Second time, he rolled his eyes like I was bothering him. Third time, he told. Told me to build a better fence if you don't like it. By the fifth conversation, he was laughing in my face, saying, dogs will be dogs. Deal with it or move. The final straw came on a Tuesday morning. I found my wife Rachel sitting in the dirt, crying over her destroyed rose bushes. The special hybrid ones she'd planted to celebrate eating stage 3 breast cancer. Six months of careful nurturing, daily watering, protective covers during storms. Gone. Petals scattered everywhere like bloody confetti. She looked up at me with tears streaming and whispered, why would someone let this happen to us? Haven't we been through enough? That's when something dark lit inside me. A switch flipped that I didn't know existed. I spent that entire night researching everything about Brian Miller and that stupid German Shepherd.

Maybe poetry, maybe unsent letters. Doesn't matter. Joe's just part of the morning rhythm, like the squeaky doorbell or the hum of the espresso machine. And then one day, that rhythm got broken. A guy stepped out of a great Tesla, all fake tan and too much Cologne, talking into his phone like it was a mic, designer joggers, those chunky sneakers that cost more than my rent, and sunglasses he never took off. Even inside, he ordered something that wasn't on the menu. A keto friendly cold pressed oat milk frappe with collagen boost, and smiled like he just invented coffee.

I was 15 when I stayed up all night building a model bridge for the science fair. It wasn't just for a grade. I wanted to show my dad something he could finally be proud of. He was a structural engineer. The kind who measured success by awards, patents, and blueprints signed with his name. I thought maybe if I showed him I was serious about engineering, he'd see me. He didn't look up from his laptop when I carried the bridge into the kitchen. Too many support beams, he muttered. It'll sag under pressure. It didn't. I won first place. I brought home the ribbon and taped it to the fridge. The next morning, it was gone. Mom said she thought it looked messy and put it in the drawer. I never asked her which one, but I kept trying. Robotics club, math league, perfect grades. I took every hard class, skipped parties, stayed in on weekends. He didn't say much, just the occasional that's expected or keep it up. It was like feeding coins into a machine that never paid out. In college, I landed a summer internship with a well known civil firm. I printed the offer letter and left it on his desk. Didn't mention it once. I overheard him later at a barbecue telling a friend she got lucky. They probably just wanted a female intern for their brochure.

I work nights at the library, I eat cold ramen more than I'd like to admit. But I keep to myself, study, shower when no one's around, and do everything I can not to cause problems. Which is why I was confused when the housing office emailed me about a third noise complaint. Something about yelling stop something! And aggressive energy. I live with one person. Trip. That's his real name. And if it sounds like the name of someone who owns a drone and two vape pens, that's because it is. Trip is everything I'm not. Loud, messy, rich, and allergic to consequences. I knocked on his door after the first complaint. He said, bro, I don't care. It's probably just some nerd trying to get us kicked. Okay. Second complaint came after a broken window. Not mine, not my fault. But my name was somehow on the report. So when the third one came, I realized this wasn't a misunderstanding. It was war. And I couldn't afford to lose. If I got booted from housing, I was out of school, period. No dorm, no commute, no backup. So I did what broke kids do best. I got creative. I had an old phone with a decent camera.

I thought she meant a long weekend, maybe a week at most. The first month, she'd text asking how he was doing, but the messages got shorter and less frequent. By month three, I was the one initiating contact. By month six, she'd go weeks without responding to photos I'd send. I started keeping records without really planning to. Screenshots of ignored texts, photos of Owen reaching milestones she missed, bank statements showing I was paying for everything from formula to doctor visits. The family made excuses for her. She was finding herself. She was going through a phase. She needed space to heal. Meanwhile, I was learning to function on three hours of sleep, trading my social life for story time and watching my savings disappear into baby expenses. Owen's first word was Mama, looking right at me. His first steps were toward my outstretched arms. When he got sick with his first fever, I was the one pacing the hallway at 3 a m, checking his temperature every hour. Jess missed his first birthday entirely. He promised to come, but canceled last minute because her friend was having a crisis that turned out to be a bad breakup. I sang Happy Birthday to him alone, watching him smash cake into his high chair while trying not to cry. That was 18 months ago. I've been documenting everything. The missed visits, the forgotten birthday, the child support she never sent. Owen called me Mama! And didn't even recognize her voice on the phone. Then Jess landed a marketing job at her boyfriend's startup and suddenly wanted to play Mommy again. She filed for custody, claiming I'd kidnapped her son and she was ready to be a real parent now. Her lawyer painted me as the unstable single woman who'd stolen a baby during a mother's vulnerable moment. That's when I pulled out my phone and played the voicemail she'd left me just last month, completely drunk, laughing about how she'd dodged a bullet by dumping Owen on me and how she'd never wanted kids anyway. The judge's face said everything just went pale as her lawyer frantically tried to object.

I didn't hold back in court. My cousin Jess was the family princess who could do no wrong. While I worked two jobs through college, she partied her way through a communications degree our aunt paid for. When I graduated with honors, the family dinner conversation was about Jess's new tattoo. When I got my first apartment, they were helping her out of another DUI. The golden child treatment only got worse as we got older. Jess would blow through jobs like tissues, always landing on her feet because someone in the family would make a phone call. She'd crash cars and get new ones. She'd max out credit cards, and somehow the debt would just disappear. When she got pregnant at 22, she acted like it was just an inconvenience. She'd show up at family dinners complaining about morning sickness while chain smoking on the porch. At her baby shower, she spent more time taking selfies with the gifts than actually opening them. I watched her roll her eyes when people gave practical things like diapers and bottles. The pregnancy was rough, but not because of medical issues. I just hated how it cramped her style. She'd call me at midnight crying about how her body was ruined, how her friends were having fun without her, how she felt trapped. I thought it was normal pregnancy anxiety. After baby Owen was born, Jess lasted Exactly three weeks before she cracked. Those three weeks were a disaster. She'd let him cry for hours because she was too tired to get. She forgot to buy formula twice, leaving me scrambling to the store at 2:00am. I'd find dirty diapers stuffed behind furniture because she couldn't be bothered to walk to the trash. The breaking point came when I stopped by unannounced and found Owen screaming in his crib, completely alone. Jess was at a nail appointment she'd forgotten to mention. The baby was soaked, hungry, and had been crying so long his voice was hoarse. She called me that night crying, saying she couldn't handle it anymore and needed just a few days to figure things out. She showed up at my door with a diaper bag half packed with random clothes.

He was holding him, comforting him. That's when it clicked. This guy wasn't a stranger. He was my son's boyfriend. Apparently, they've been sneaking around for months. My son hadn't told us he was gay, let alone in a relationship. He thought we wouldn't accept it. And his boyfriend, not wanting to get him in trouble, had been sneaking into the house late at night, not realizing anyone else knew. I stood there in silence, rifle in one hand, flashlight in the other, heart still pounding in my ears. My son looked at me, terrified. Not because of the gun, but because he thought I'd hate him for it. I set the rifle down and sat on the edge of his bed. Then I said the only thing I could think of. You're grounded for sneaking someone in. But I'm glad you're safe. And I love you. My daughter was right. There was a man in the house. But she just didn't understand. He wasn't there to hurt anyone. He was there because he cared.

Emma wasn't even the smartest kid, but she was the most obedient. She remind everyone about homework every single day and report any problem behavior to Miss Green. If you were talking during Quiet Time, Emma would write your name on the board. If you forgot your pencil, Emma would make this big show of telling the teacher you weren't prepared. Everyone thought she was just being a goody two shoes, but I started noticing weird stuff happening around her. Like when Jessica forgot to turn in her math homework, Emma found it crumpled up in the trash. The next day, when Tyler got three behaviour strikes on the board, somehow one of them got erased overnight. Emma always had explanations. She was just trying to help. Or maybe the janitor accidentally wiped it. But then things got serious. A group of girls in our class were planning this huge sleepover for Kaylee's birthday. They invited almost everyone except Emma. I felt bad for her, but honestly, nobody really wanted to hang out with the class snitch. The Monday after the sleepover, Emma was acting Super weird during recess instead of staying inside.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb. His 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again. Fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework. Completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program. 60 days. Some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapsed the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox thing. Maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,005 hundred for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewelry, our TV, Emma's laptop. And even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The Kid had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad, who died when she was six.

I watched Dylan Mercer rule our school for three years. He was untouchable. Wealthy parents who donated to the school, perfect grades, captain of the debate team. And that smile that charmed every teacher. But behind closed doors, he was a monster. I first noticed it sophomore year when my friend Ava came to school with puffy eyes. It's nothing, she insisted, but later confessed. Dylan had spread rumors that she'd slept with the entire baseball team after she rejected him at a party. Why don't you report him? I asked. Are you kidding? His mom is on the school board. Besides, everyone loves him. Her voice cracked. No one would believe me. She was right. Dylan operated in plain sight. He'd trip kids in the hallway, but make it look accidental. He'd borrow answers, then accuse others of cheating. The teachers never suspected a thing. By junior year, I started documenting everything. Small notes in my phone at first. Dates, times, incidents. Then I began recording conversations when he was nearby. It wasn't much, but it was something. The breaking point came during senior year. My best friend Marcus transferred to our school, and Dylan immediately targeted him. It started with harmless jokes about Marcus being gay. Then his gym clothes mysteriously disappeared during PE, his art projects were accidentally damaged. Just ignore him, I suggested. But Marcus's eyes darkened. That's what everyone says. That's why bullies win. One Monday, Marcus didn't show up to school. Then Tuesday. By Wednesday, his mom called me crying. He tried to harm him.

Can you find a husband instead? What? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I'd spent the whole day falling in love with my classes. Introduction to psychology, where the professor made us laugh while explaining Freud. Creative writing, where we'd already started working on short stories. Even statistics seemed interesting with the right teacher. I was sitting on a bench outside the library, feeling like my life was finally beginning when they called. My mom's voice was oddly cheerful for someone destroying my future. We need you to listen carefully, honey. We can't pay for school anymore. What happened to the college savings account you've had for me since I was a baby? My voice cracked. They'd shown me the statements every birthday. Watch the numbers grow. Used it as motivation when I didn't want to study for the S A T S. That money was supposed to be sacred, untouchable. Mine. There was a pause before my dad cleared his throat. I had some problems. We're going to need all the money back to pay some debts. Which was weird because she didn't say what kind of debts. Then what am I supposed to do? I felt like I might throw up. My mom jumped back in with her solution. You need to find a rich boyfriend by the end of the month. You go to school with plenty of wealthy students. And you have a good body, so it wouldn't be impossible for you to get a boyfriend to turn into a husband. I sat there stunned while she kept talking. She explained their whole plan like she thought it through carefully. How I should target guys in the business school. How I should dress more revealing. How I should laugh at their jokes even if they weren't funny. If you just don't break up with him, even if he cheats on you, then in seven years you can go back to school again. She said it like seven

My parents believed that inheritance money destroyed young people. After my grandmother left me $50,000 when I was 15, they put it in a trust I couldn't touch until 30. Every teenager who gets early money becomes a burnout, mom would preach. They buy cars, party, drop out. We're protecting you from yourself. They made me sign papers. Everything away. Made me live like the money didn't exist. At 17, I worked at subway for minimum wage while 50 grand sat in an account I couldn't touch. My friends thought I was crazy. Just petition the court, they'd say. But fighting my parents meant lawyers, family drama, maybe losing the money entirely, and legal fees. That's when I discovered dropshipping. Started with $50 from my subway check. Buying phone cases from China, reselling them online. First month, I made $200. Second in a month, $800. By senior year of high school, I was clearing $5,000 monthly. While my parents thought I was studying in my room, I got creative with hiding it. Opened accounts at three different banks using my work address. Had packages delivered to my friend Sarah's house. Kept cash and tampon boxes inside, old textbooks behind picture frames. My room looked like a normal teenagers, but it held $30,000 in various hiding spots. Why do you need new shoes? Mom would ask. Those still have souls. The subway job doesn't pay enough for extras, dad would add. Budget better. Meanwhile, I had enough to buy a car. Cash. But I kept taking the bus, kept wearing thrift store clothes, kept the act. Everything changed the week before graduation. I came home early from school with a headache. Mom's car was in the driveway, but Dad's was gone. Normal for 2 p m. But when I walked in, mom was at the kitchen table with papers everywhere. Crying mom. She tried to hide the papers, but I saw the header. Second notice. Medical debt collection. It's nothing, she said, shoving them in a drawer. That night, I went.

The man doesn't even say his name, just stares at all of us, breathing heavily, and then asks really loud, whose parents work in the downtown offices? You know, the big buildings. Nobody raises their hand because we all know about stranger danger, and this guy seems dangerous. He gets mad, and his face goes from red to almost purple. He yells, I know some of you have parents there. This is important! Finally, me and four other kids slowly raise our hands because maybe something happened to our parents and he needs to tell us. He points at us and says, you five stay after the bell rings. Everyone else, leave as fast as you can. The girl next to me grabs my wrist and whispers, run with me. But my legs won't move. What if my mom needs me, and this man is supposed to take me to her? The bell rings, and everyone practically runs out like the rooms on fire. The man locks the door behind them with this loud click, and my stomach drops like on a roller coaster. He won't even let us near our backpacks where our phones are. The quiet Girl starts crying, and he doesn't even care. Just keeps checking the window. Then his watch saying 15 minutes. We wait 15 minutes, which makes no sense because our parents usually pick us up in five minutes. The classroom phone rings, and he rips it from the wall. Like, actually rips it out and throws it in the trash. And now I'm really scared, because why would he do that unless he's kidnapping us? We hear sirens outside. Lots of them, getting louder. He stands in front of the door, blocking it with his.

I replied, fine. For 3 years, I've been the IT guy for my dad's construction company. Built their entire digital system. Project management, client databases, payroll processing, everything. They paid me 45 k while my cousins made 80 k doing basic office work. Let me paint you the full picture here. When I started, Dad's company was still using paper filing cabinets and Excel spreadsheets. From 2015, they had invoices getting lost, double full booked equipment, and clients calling constantly asking for project updates that nobody could find. I spent six months building them a custom system from scratch. Client portal where customers could track their projects in real time. Automated scheduling that prevented equipment conflicts, digital invoicing that cut payment delays from 45 days to 12 days. Even built them an app where Foreman could upload progress photos directly to client accounts. The transformation was insane. Revenue jumped from 800K to $2.3 million in 18 months. Dad kept bragging to other contractors about his high tech operation, never mentioning who actually built it. But here's where it gets interesting. My cousins Damon and Silas, who barely graduated high school, were suddenly project coordinators making serious money. Damon's main job was driving to job sites and taking pictures I had to upload for him because he couldn't figure out the system. Silas spent most days playing games on his phone while I handled actual emergencies. And there's Dad's new wife, Marlene married him eight months ago and immediately started inserting herself into the business. Made herself operations manager despite never working construction a day in her life. Started suggesting we modernize by switching to cheaper software solutions she found on Google every time I tried explaining why our custom system

So I'm 53, divorced for six years from my ex, Larry. We met in college doing electrical engineering. Both total nerds with thick glasses and zero fashion sense. But we were happy. Or at least I thought we were. After we got married, Larry decided he wanted to be a patent lawyer. That's when everything changed. He started working out, buying expensive suits, contacts, the whole transformation. Meanwhile, I'm home with two little kids, working full time, basically running the entire household because he's at the office until midnight every night. I looked exactly the same. Plain Jane with my practical clothes and boring haircut. Larry used to love that about me. I was beautiful just as I was. But once he got all fancy, suddenly I wasn't good enough anymore. He started having affairs with these gorgeous women from his law firm. When I begged him to go to counseling, you know what he told me? That the problem was my big nose and my mommy pooch from having kids. Like those were things I could just fix with a makeover or something. I was literally packing divorce papers when our daughter Carla got hit by a car while riding her bike. He survived, but needed years of surgeries and rehab. So Larry and I agreed to stay together for the kids, keep things civil. He kept cheating the whole time, but by then, I was done caring about his Faithfulness. I just wanted to get Carla better. We finally divorced after both kids went off to college. Larry immediately married some 33 year old from his office. Meanwhile, I'm alone for the first time in decades. That's when I decided to actually focus on myself for once. Coloured my hair this nice Auburn shade. Lost about 15 pounds at the gym. Bought clothes that actually fit instead of hiding under baggy sweaters. Started going to singles events. Went on actual dates for the first time in years. Nothing crazy. Just normal stuff people do when they're single.

That's what I loved about her. She'd get embarrassed if I even held her hand in front of people. So when I decided to propose, I made it super low key. No big restaurant scene or flash mob or anything crazy like that. Just a picnic by the lake where we had our first date. Brought sandwiches, some wine, the simple ring I'd saved up for months to buy. No photographers, no family hiding in the bushes. Just us. I got down on one knee right as the sun was setting. My hands were shaking so bad, I almost dropped the ring. But I managed to get the words out. She looked shocked for a second, then started crying. Happy tears. Thought she said yes. Quiet and soft, like everything else about her. But definitely yes. We went home that night, and she cooked dinner like nothing had happened. We watched some Netflix show. She even wore the ring to bed. I kept staring at it on her finger, thinking how lucky I was. The next morning, I woke up alone. That wasn't weird, since she always got up early for work. But when I went to brush my teeth, her toothbrush was gone. I opened her dresser. Drawer empty. Check the closet. Half the hangers were bare. Even her Netflix account was signed out of our TV. I thought maybe there was some family emergency. Called her phone, straight to voicemail. Texted her like, 20 times. Drove to the clinic where she worked as a receptionist. Her coworker Amy, said she'd called in sick. But Amy looked weird when she said it, like she was lying. For three days, I was going crazy. Called her mom, her sister, even drove by her old apartment, thinking maybe she went back there. Nothing. Then I got a text that made my stomach drop. You didn't do anything wrong, Ryan. But I had to say yes to avoid the drama. I didn't want to make a scene at the lake. Sorry. I read it like 10 times before it sank in. She'd been planning this. She let me propose knowing she was going to disappear. She said yes just so she wouldn't have to deal with my reaction in the moment. The worst part was.

Das 1. warnsignal h√§tte sein sollen, wie sie auspackte. Die meisten leute lassen ihre sachen bei kurzen aufenthalten im koffer. Margarite h√§ngte alles in den schrank, arrangierte ihre toilettenartikel √ºber die ganze badezimmer ablage, stellte ihren lesesessel so auf, dass er zu unserer schlafzimmert√ºr zeigte. Als ich erw√§hnte, dass das ziemlich viel zeug f√ºr 1 paar wochen sei, lachte sie. Ich mag's einfach bequem, liebes. In der 2. woche fing sie an, unsere m√∂bel umzustellen. Diese couch blockiert den nat√ºrlichen fluss, erkl√§rte sie und schob unseren couch tisch an die wand. Als ich protestierte, stellte sich Stefan auf ihre seite. Es ist nur vor√ºbergehend Lisa, lass sie sich wohlf√ºhlen woche 3 brachte neue regeln, kein schuhe nach dem eingangsbereich abendessen punkt 18 uhr, der thermostat blieb auf 20 grad w√§rmer gab ihr kopfschmerzen. Sie kritisierte Mein kochen, Mein putzen und die art, wie ich stefans hemden faltete. Zu meiner zeit waren frauen stolz auf solche sachen. Ich fing an, alles in meinem handy zu dokumentieren. Die. Passiv aggressiven kommentare, wie sie nachts vor unserer schlafzimmert√ºr rumlungerte, wie sie unser haustelefon abnahm, bevor ich rankommen konnte, und anrufern sagte, ich sei besch√§ftigt. Der wendepunkt Kam, als ich sie dabei erwischte, wie sie unsere post durchging. Sie sa√ü an unserem k√ºchentisch.

When I answered an ad for babysitting at $50 an hour, honestly, the first thing I expected was for it to be a scam or something dangerous. But I had nothing to lose. I followed the address to a fancy apartment building and knocked on the door. A 13 year old girl dressed like little Miss CE oh. Open the door, you're 10 minutes late, she said, pointing at her wristwatch. I laughed awkwardly. Better late than never. She looked me up and down and groaned, oh boy, we have a lot to do. I followed her inside the most gorgeous three bedroom apartment in New York, one with literal Roman columns and busts like you'd see in films. She sat down at a table with tea already set up and got straight to business. You're not babysitting. I need you to be my mother. She handed me a folder with a fake backstory as a marketing consultant who travels for work, a school map with your names highlighted, and a practice sheet for my fake signature. Parent teacher conference tonight. We leave in three hours. I looked around the room for hidden cameras and sat down looking over the papers. Alright, Kiddo, where are your parents? She clasped her hands together, all serious, like Sasuke Uchiha always did as a kid. Are you in or out? Because I have two others waiting. I smiled and reached out to shake her hand. I'm in. Well, the kid Abby seriously coached the crap out of me. I mean, I hadn't tried to memorize anything this hard since high school, and even then I never put this much effort. She drilled all her information into me, her full life story. Compact like a wiki page that I can't just control f in front of the teachers. She had me change my clothes into the plaid that only rich people really wore, and had me fix my makeup into something simpler, less flashy. Don't promise follow up emails if they mention volunteering you travel for work. Don't smile too much. You're a busy woman who loves her daughter but doesn't have time for school politics. Got it?

My dad died last March after battling cancer for two years. The whole thing was brutal, watching him slowly waste away. My mom became a shell of herself during those final months. We all pulled together as a family except for my brother Chet. He had been the black sheep for years before dad got sick. Chet had stolen money from dad and dropped out of college three times. He refused to get a job or take any responsibility for his life. Dad finally cut him off financially last year after Chet stole $30,000. He took the money straight from their retirement account without asking anyone. When dad passed away, Chet showed up at the funeral home acting devastated. He even volunteered to handle the gravestone paperwork to help mom out. We were all shocked, but thought maybe losing dad had changed him. Mom was barely functioning, so we let Chet handle the Monument arrangements. We had already picked out the inscription. Together as a family. Family. It would say. Beloved father and husband forever in our hearts. The words were simple and classic. Exactly what dad would have wanted. The funeral came and went without any major incidence. Chet gave a speech about redemption and family that made everyone cry. For three weeks after the funeral, we thought he'd finally grown up. Mom even started talking about reconciling with him. She kept saying, dad would have wanted the Family to stay together. Then the day of the gravestone unveiling arrived three weeks later. Mom had been counting down to this moment since the funeral ended. She desperately needed that closure and permanent place to visit dad. My other brother, Simon, drove her to the cemetery that morning. I met them there with fresh flowers for the grave. Chet said he'd meet us there, but texted that he was running late. The cemetery worker LED us to Dad's lot in the memorial garden section. A black cloth covered the new granite stone that had just been installed. Mom was already crying while clutching

She'd installed that lock years ago as a prank that my parents never found out about. Rachel, this isn't funny! Let me out! I shouted, banging on the door. Her voice came through cold. Shut up, or I'll tell everyone you still wet the bed. Marco's here, and I'm not letting you ruin this for me! The music started blasting, completely drowning out my calling for help.

My roommate Kevin claimed he was allergic to vinegar. Kevin would talk about how grateful he was to finally have a roommate who understood his condition. His previous roommates apparently didn't care enough. The weirdness started when I noticed Kevin volunteering to take out the trash every single week. Not just offering, insisting. He'd grab the bags before I could even tie them up. When I jokingly said I could handle trash duty, he'd say, no, no, I've got a system. Plus you already do so much with my allergy and everything. Then one day I saw him outside throwing out a pickle jar. I mean, sure, that doesn't have to mean anything, but this was weird. Not just because he threw it out, but because when I asked him, he just froze and said, what pickle jar? Kevin had left for his early shift, so I had the apartment to myself. I decided to start checking our trash cause this was weird. I mean, why would he lie? Then one day, a pickle jar buried under everything, selling strongly of vinegar and dill. Maybe somebody used our bin. Maybe he's having someone over when I'm not around and that person eats pickles and they hide it. Yep, that's definitely it. Went to his room to see if it looked like he'd had people over. Nope, everything was fine. We usually watch Movies in there together and it all looked the same. I couldn't figure it out. Why would anyone pretend to have a life threatening allergy just to cover up a love for pickles? It made no sense. Was he embarrassed about his pickle obsession? Was this some weird fetish? I didn't want to understand. Then I saw in his trash notebook. I opened it for a second, just curious. Figured maybe it was a to do list or something boring. But no. No quick glance after what I saw. GPS coordinates at the bottom of every page. A date, a time, and some coordinates. My brain went straight to drug dealer.

By the fifth plate, I swear the manager was hiding behind the soda machine like I was gonna bite him. Plate seven, that's when it got interesting. I went full throttle. Barbecue ribs stacked like Lincoln Logs, a pile of meatballs, three chicken thighs and six brownies I definitely didn't take from the kids section. I sat down, fork in hand. When the manager finally slithered over with two of his most underpaid teenage minions. Like Henman from a movie, no one finishes. He goes, sir, we're going to have to ask you to leave. You've exceeded reasonable consumption. Excuse me, what? Is there a rule on how much I can eat? I asked. There isn't. But, you know, I actually don't know. Benny, I know you have a sign out front in Comic Sans that says all you can eat. It does not say all. We feel emotionally comfortable watching you eat. So I stood up, and you know what I did? I went back for plate No.. 8. He called the cops. I wish I was kidding. Imagine being mid bite into a drumstick, sauce on your chin, when two actual police officers walk in like you're a suspect in a felony mashed potato incident. They looked at then at Benny, then back at me. One of them goes, what exactly did he do? He won't stop eating. There was this long pause, the kind that only happens when someone says something so stupid it has to be processed in layers. The officer turned to me, look, man, could you just go. He looked embarrassed for the manager. I asked if I could at least finish my plate. Benny said, no. Of course he did. I was dangerous.

They were completely immune to consequences. My college roommate, Kiver, was deaf. At least that's what everyone believed for four years. And white. She had all the accommodations you'd expect. Extended test time, no takers, front row seating, even a full scholarship. Everyone on campus Learned sign language just to communicate with him. The whole thing started freshman orientation week. Kiver walked into our dorm room and immediately started pointing at his ears and shaking his head. He handed me a pre written note explaining his hearing loss and asking for patience. Felt terrible for him. Our entire floor rallied around Civer. Nixie from down the hall spent weekends teaching herself ASL through YouTube videos. The die Flying Hall staff Learned basic signs just for him. Kiver had documentation for everything. Medical records, audiologist reports, even a letter from his high school principal. The Disability Services office fast tracked his accommodations. Without question, his act was flawless. During fire drills, he'd wait for visual cues from other students. At parties, he'd position himself where he could read lips. He never flinched during thunderstorms or sudden loud noises. The professors adored him. Doctor Verlo in biology would face the class religiously, speaking slowly and clearly. Professor Tamzen even Learned basic finger spelling. Kiver got front row seats in every lecture hall automatically. Scholarship was worth $40,000 annually. Full tuition, housing, meal plan, everything. The foundation that sponsored it used his photo in their fundraising materials. About Overcoming adversity, Kiver played the inspiration angle perfectly. He joined the student

My dad banned all cooking in our house after his chef brother humiliated him at Thanksgiving. And I mean all cooking. No stove, no microwave, nothing. He literally removed the power cord from our oven and took it to his office like some kind of kitchen dictate. Later, when my uncle called Dad's attempt to make Turkey shoe leather, his face turned purple. He threw his apron on the floor and said our family would never cook again. Mom tried to reason with him, but he went full butthurt and spent three hours removing every cooking appliance from the kitchen. We were only allowed pre packaged, ready to eat foods. Cold cuts, protein bars, bagged salads with those little dressing packets. Even boiling water was forbidden because that counted as food preparation. For months, I watched my friends eat normal hot meals while I unwrapped another sad sandwich. Kids at school thought I was lying when I said we couldn't even make ramen. The embarrassment was pretty bad, but then I started getting these dizzy spells. During basketball practice, my legs would cramp up so bad, I'd have to sit out. That's when I realized this wasn't just about Dad's stupid pride. This diet was literally making me sick. I went to the library after school and started researching nutrition. Turns out I discovered my exact symptoms matched severe magnesium deficiency, which made perfect sense. Since processed foods have basically zero magnesium, so I started my own secret operation using lawn mowing money to buy supplements. Within two weeks of taking them, my cramps appeared, and I could actually finish practice again. I became obsessed with reading ingredient labels, memorizing which preservatives were in everything we ate, because I needed to know what was poisoning me. Slowly, I turned into this weird ingredient encyclopedia, knowing every chemical in our entire kitchen, because survival literally depended on it. Then came the dinner.

My older sister Emma had gotten a brand new Honda for her 16th birthday, but apparently the family budget had changed by the time I came around. So when my dad cornered me in the garage one Saturday morning while I was organizing my work uniforms, I expected maybe a lecture about keeping my room cleaner. Instead, he handed me a printed lease agreement. An actual lease. $350 a month starting next week, he said, not even making eye contact. Market rate for a room this size in our area. I stared at the papers completely confused. $350? Dad, I make like $400 a month. Then you'll need to pick up more shifts or find additional income streams, he said, using the same tone he used in his business meetings. Consider it preparation for the real world. Here's what made this absolutely insane. Emma was 19, had dropped out of college after one semester, and was living in our basement rent free while finding herself through various expense hobbies like pottery classes and yoga teacher training that my parents happily funded. She didn't even have a job. When I pointed this out, my dad just said Emma was going through a difficult transition period. And needed family support. Apparently, my transition period from childhood to adulthood required rent payments. I showed the least to my mom, thinking surely she'd think this was ridiculous. Instead, she started explaining property management principles to me like I was one of Dad's business partners. You're using utilities, taking up space, consuming resources, she said. It's only fair you contribute. That night, I called my Uncle Mike. When I explained the situation, he was quiet for a minute. They're charging their 16 year old dog

Yesterday, he drew our house on fire with us inside. At first, I thought it was a coincidence when Mason drew our neighbor's dog getting hit by a car. And the next day, at four fifteen PM, we heard the screech and the thud. But then Mason drew grandma falling downstairs. I called her immediately and begged her not to use any stairs that day. She laughed at me, but agreed. At seven PM, she called back, crying because she'd forgotten, and started going down to her basement when the first step broke. But she caught herself. That's when I realized Mason wasn't causing these things. He was warning us. Every morning, I check his drawing pad, and there's a new picture showing how someone dies. That not random people. Always someone we know or someone nearby. And if I can figure out what the drawing means, in time, I can save them. I've saved 47 people in three months. Mason draws in his sleep, and when he wakes up, he doesn't remember making the picture. I tried staying up to watch him, and at exactly 3:00am, his eyes stay closed, but his hand starts moving, sketching perfect, detailed scenes of tomorrow's tragedies. Two weeks ago, he drew our mailman Paul drowning. So I slashed Paul tired so he couldn't drive to the lake. He lived. Last week, he drew five kids at the playground getting struck by lightning. I pulled the fire alarm. At the school to keep everyone inside during recess. They live. But yesterday morning I found the worst drawing yet. Our house was engulfed in flames. My wife Sarah, our daughter Emma, Mason and me. All four of us were inside. The detail was horrible. Sarah was trapped in the bedroom, Emma in the back, Mason in his room, and me at the bottom of the stairs. All of us burning. The time stamp Mason always adds said eight forty seven PM today. I tried everything to prevent it. I disconnected all the gas lines, removed every match and lighter, had an electrician check all our wiring, and even called the fire department for a surprise inspection. Everything was perfect. At six PM, I packed everyone in the car. We're staying at a hotel tonight. Why? Sarah asked. I showed her Mason's drawing and she went pale. She'd seen enough of his predictions come true. We drove three towns over and checked into a Holiday Inn. I thought we'd beaten it. But at seven thirty PM, Mason started drawing again. He was awake this time, crying, while his hand moved on its own. The new picture showed us driving back home. The time stamp said eight fifteen PM. I don't

My 13 year old Otis had been completely obsessed with this new teammate on Fortnite for almost three weeks straight now. Called herself Luna. Underscore 2,011 claimed she was 13, too. Supposedly lived somewhere in rural Oregon near Portland. They've been playing duos together every single night after school, sometimes staying up until well past midnight on school nights. Which, completely unlike my usually responsible son, Otis was absolutely glowing about this new friendship every single day when he came home. It was honestly the first time he'd really connected with someone online in such a meaningful way since we moved to this new town about six months ago after my job transfer. She was apparently incredible at building complex fortress structures under intense pressure. Knew all the current meta strategies perfectly. They had developed this hilarious running inside joke about terrible random teammates that made him burst out laughing constantly during their intense Victory Royale matches. But then Luna started asking really strange, oddly specific questions in their late night voice chats that made me increasingly uncomfortable as a parent. What exact time did Otis's parents get home from work each weekday? Did our house have ring doorbells or any security cameras installed around the property? When Otis casually mentioned these seemingly random questions that Luna kept asking him during their gaming sessions, every single parental instinct I had developed over 13 years of raising him started screaming absolute Danger. Something was seriously wrong here, and I could feel it in my bones. So I made one of the hardest parenting decisions of my entire life. I did something I had always sworn I would never do to my son, who I trusted completely.

Something's growing inside him. It started in September when Ryan began his new diet, saying he wasn't hungry anymore and pushing away every meal I made. I'm just not feeling it, he'd say. But his weight kept climbing. First 10 pounds, then 20, then 50. His skin stretched tight and his belly descended like a pregnancy. But he insisted he felt fine, better than ever. I made him see Doctor Miller after the first month, and she ran every test imaginable. The blood work came back strange, showing digestive enzymes that didn't belong in human bodies. But the real shock came from the X ray. Missus Davis, there are shadows in your husband's abdomen, she said, pulling me aside. Multiple masses, but they're not tumors. They look almost like compressed tissue. Has Ryan been eating anything unusual? He hasn't been eating anything at all, I told her, and she looked at me like I was lying. The MRI was scheduled for next week, but Ryan refused to go. I know what's happening to me, he said that night. And it's supposed to happen. My father went through this at 35, and his father before him. Every third generation, one of us is chosen to be the vessel. I found his father's journal in our attic that night, and the entries made my blood freeze. A 45 consumed the Henderson boy. He went down easier than the others. The transformation Requires 100 souls. They compress and merge inside the chosen vessel. What emerges will feed our bloodline for generations. His father had gained weight until he hit exactly 400 pounds, then disappeared. And they found 47 missing people's remains in the woods behind his house. Ryan started having blackouts at night, leaving the house at 2:00am and returning before dawn, covered in dirt and scratches. I followed him once and watched him standing outside houses, his jaw unhinging like a snakes. But I ran home before I could see more. The next morning, I saw the news. Local teacher Madison Wright missing. No signs of struggle. I confronted Ryan, but he had no memory of leaving the house. Sarah, I swear I've been in bed all night, he said. But his breath smelled like perfume. The same kind Madison wore. That's when I started finding things in his vomit. A wedding ring, a watch, pieces of clothing. He couldn't die. Yes.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed and I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said. Heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest around 14 looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with 3 kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. First morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're Not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad, I patted. His head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, I and everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

So my brother Jake got married like three weeks ago and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much, maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever, that's what they decided and my parents just went along with it like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because honestly it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up, shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine, I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around and Jake text, it's our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were All excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not. I told her the same thing I told everyone else, didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19. I pay my own phone Bill. I work at Best Buy part time and I'm starting community college in the fall. Can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner. The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my brother's Happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rihanna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a made outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

The first time she opened her mouth in court, I didn't expect her words to stop a sentencing. We were packed into that courthouse like sardines. The walls felt too close, the benches too hard and my heartbeat too loud. My daughter, Olivia, just 8 years old, sat beside me, swinging her feet. She looked so small in that big room. Her Sunday dress too formal. Her hair and bra if I'd redone three times that morning just to keep my hands busy. Across the aisle sat the man who had taken everything from us. He was just 20, a kid, really. He didn't look dangerous, just tired, like he hadn't slept since the night he pulled the trigger. But I didn't care how tired he looked. My husband was gone and he was still breathing. The widow of the store clerk, my husband's boss, sat silently, her eyes hollow. Next to her was her son, maybe 10, clinging to her arm. I wanted to reach for Olivia's hand, but she was busy twisting the edge of the paper heart she'd made that morning, the one I didn't have the strength to ask about. The prosecutor spoke first, cold, clinical. The victim was an innocent man, a father, a husband. This was a violent, senseless act. Then came the defense. They talked about his upbringing, broken home, drug addicted mother, foster care. They showed pictures of his bruises, his Grades his attempts at rehab. This doesn't excuse the crime, his lawyer said, but we asked the court to consider who he was before he picked up the gun. I hated how calm they all sounded, how measured, like this was just another case. The judge asked if anyone else wished to speak. I felt the weight of the room tilt toward me. Everyone expected the grieving wife to stand, but I couldn't. I'd written 10 different versions of a statement and tore up every single one. The only thing I wanted to say was give me my husband back. And that wasn't an option. Then Olivia raised her hand. I didn't even realize what she was doing until she was already standing, walking to the front like it was show and tell. The courtroom murmured. The bailiff looked to the judge, who gave a small nod. And just like that, my daughter stood before the man who murdered her father. My name is Olivia, she said, her voice small.

Y'all were always talking, laughing at dumb stuff, venting, being weird together, making the most unhinged inside I jokes that nobody else would get. And now they're just gone. Not even gone like we grew apart, but, like, replaced. Like they found a new group and suddenly forgot you existed. And they swear they still care. But the I'm going to sleep early is getting old. Especially when I see you online, in games, in calls with your new little friend group. Like, bro, I'm not stupid. I see the green dot. I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stop choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now. I'm being kept around just in case the new group drops you or switches up. Like I'm the in case of emergency friend. I'm not a fostering safety net. You used to need me. Now I'm just convenient when you're bored. And I see it, I feel it, and it sucks. But you know what? I'm done begging for space in your life. I'm done waiting for a text back just to see you on Facetime with the new crew. I'm done being loyal to someone who already left me without saying a word. So, yeah, it hurts. It hurts like hell. But I'm not gonna sit here and cry over someone who doesn't miss me. I'm gonna wipe my tears, put on lip gloss or chapstick, whatever, and remind myself I'm not the problem you fumbled. I was a real one. And when that new group starts acting funny, when you remember what it felt like to have someone who actually cared, just know this friendship doesn't do returns.

Remember that older guy they first arrested right after, after Charlie Kirk was attacked? Yeah, the one they let go because he wasn't actually responsible. Well, they just re arrested him. His name is George Zin. He's 71 years old. And according to police documents, he literally admitted that he pretended to be the attacker. Like his plan was to distract everyone from the real person so he could be seen as some kind of martyr. Girl. What? At the scene, he even shouted twice, I did it, now take me down, like he was in a movie or something. But when police asked him where the weapon was, he obviously couldn't answer because he never had one. Later at the hospital, he told officers he was glad he lied because it gave the real suspect time to get away. Like, sir, this is not a game. And, and it gets even worse. When investigators tried to check his phone, he didn't want them to. When they asked why, he literally admitted it was because he used it to look at illegal child content. Who just says that out loud? And of course, when they searched, they found over 20 illegal images and some really disturbing messages. For context, this man has already been arrested multiple times over the last 30 years, mostly for political trespassing. But now he's facing charges for obstructing justice and for what they found on His phone like this went from confusing to straight up disturbing real fast.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, seven, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Air hug them quickly, told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know. You can stop trying. She Said besides, you're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy. Be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't Have a dad! I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, sent everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading Out fairy tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

I hadn't seen my father in three years when he invited me to Thanksgiving at his new penthouse. After the divorce, he'd thrown himself into his tech company, becoming the millionaire he'd always dreamed of being. Meanwhile, I've been working as a cocktail waitress trying to pay off nursing school debt. Dress nice, he texted. Important people will be there. I arrived in my only designer dress, a black Versace knock off I bought at a consignment shop. Dad answered the door in a tux, sing my cheeks stiffly. Behind him stood a woman my age in diamonds that could pay my rent for a year. This is Brittany, he said, my girlfriend. She looked me up and down with barely concealed disdain. Oh, you brought someone, too. How modern. Before I could correct her, dad steered me toward the living room full of his business partners. I recognized some faces from newspaper profiles, venture capitalists, tech moguls. They're perfectly preserved wives, everyone. This is Aria, dad announced, and immediately got pulled away by his CFO. Britney's friend dripping in pearls leaned over. How long have you been with Mister Reeves? 24 years, I said. Confused. Since birth, actually, she laughed. Oh, honey, you don't have to keep up the act here. We all know how these arrangements work. That's when I realized they thought I was his paid companion. My own father's colleagues assumed I was an Escort. I opened my mouth to correct them when another woman touched my arm between us girls, she whispered, what's your hourly? My husband's friend is looking for someone discreet. I excused myself to find dad, but he was deep in conversation about orderly projections. Brittany intercepted me by the kitchen. Look, she said coldly. I don't care what arrangement you had before, but he's with me now. There's no room for both of us. Arrangement, I sputtered. I'm his, say, David. I know your type. Young, desperate, willing to do anything for money. She looked at my knockoff dress with satisfaction. At least I have class. The Turkey timer went off and dad called everyone to dinner. He'd placed me at the far end of the table, away from him and Brittany. The place card just said guest. During appetizers, the conversation turned to children. Dad's partner asked if he had kids.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about Basketball scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realised he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of Texting back or giving him some weird speech? I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this whole thing started as pretend, but it doesn't feel fake.

This year in school, the day came and went and there wasn't a lesson, not even a short mention, not even a moment of silence. It was three, like any other day. And that's what makes it so hard to process, because 9 11 wasn't just another day on the calendar. Thousands of people lost their lives in a single morning. Families were torn apart. Kids grew up without parents. And people who kissed their loved ones goodbye never saw them again. Back then, the whole country promised to never forget. And in classrooms now, it feels like the memory is slipping through the cracks. For students, it isn't even a story they hear anymore. It's like a page that was ripped out of the textbook. And that's the saddest part, because this wasn't some small event in history. It changed airport security and people's lives forever. Pretending it didn't happen doesn't erase the pain. It just erases the memory of the people who went through it. Snoopy.

Another kid is making shadow puppets on the wall like it's a Broadway show. And there's always that one kid who forgets to bring anything. No pillow, no blanket. Just vibes. He's over there sleeping on the carpet, using a hoodie as a mattress. And there's the group that swears they're staying up all night. Big talk at midnight, but by 12:30, half of them are knocked out drooling, and the other half are wide awake arguing if aliens are real. And the food situation? Wild. You got 10 people fighting over the last slice of pizza like it's a custody battle. Someone's sneaking chips at 4:00am, and the crinkle of the bag might as well be a fire alarm. When morning comes, everyone wakes up looking like they've survived a natural disaster. Hair's a mess, someone's missing a sock, and the kid who slept on the floor can't walk straight anymore. Best part? Parents roll in like, so did you guys get some rest? Yeah, sure. If by rest you mean four minutes of sleep and permanent brain damage.

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. He filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. Been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card, expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms Booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie, purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found a 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself a birthday present. Problem was her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of a there's. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts.

When my 15 year old son Jake came to me asking for cooking lessons, I thought he was finally growing up. He's been dating this girl Emma for three months and wanted to surprise her with dinner. Sweet, right? Wrong. What's her favourite food, I asked, pulling out my recipe box. Well, she loves pasta, but she's allergic to gluten and dairy and tomatoes. Oh, and nuts, actually, most fruits too. I stared at him. What exactly can she eat? Pulled out his phone and showed me a list. I'm not kidding. This girl had a notes app with 17 different food allergies. Shellfish, eggs, soy, corn, most vegetables except like three specific ones. I never seen anything like it. Jake, Honey, are you sure she's not just extremely picky, mom? No. She carries an epi pen everywhere. Last week she had to leave lunch early because someone was eating a peanut butter sandwich two tables away. So we spent the next weekend researching recipes. Everything we found either contained something on her list or tasted like cardboard. I suggested rice with plain chicken, but apparently she's also allergic to poultry. We tried quinoa salad. Nope. She reacts to most herbs and spices. By Sunday night, we'd narrowed it down to exactly one meal, plain white rice with steamed carrots and a specific brand of olive oil she could tolerate That's it for a romantic dinner? This is insane. I told my husband later, what? What does this girl eat normally? Maybe she just brings her own food everywhere, he suggested. The next day, I decided to do some detective work. I picked Jake up from school and saw Emma by the parking lot. She was eating a massive Turkey sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, basically everything on her allergy list. I drove home in silence, my brain trying to process what I just seen. Either this girl had miraculous healing powers or something else was going on. That evening, I sat Jake down. I need to ask you something about Emma's allergies. His face went red immediately. What a.

The address flashes on screen. 2 47 Maple street. Our house! The room starts spinning. I can't breathe. My daughter is crying now, sensing my panic, and I'm trying to comfort her while my world falls apart. Other people in the lobby are staring, but I don't care. My hands are trembling so badly, I can barely hold my phone. A nurse rushes over, asking if I'm okay. But how do you explain that you're watching your life burn on live television? I'm shaking, dialing his number again, right to voicemail again and again. Where is he? Why isn't he answering? My baby girl needs her father. I need her father. The automated message plays his voice. Hey, it's Danny. Leave a message. The same voice that promised me forever. The taxi finally arrives, and I'm sobbing, practically falling into the backseat. Please hurry, I beg the driver. My house is on fire. My husband might be inside. The words feel surreal leaving my mouth just 12.

Ma'am, are you sure you should be out of the hospital? I have to know if he's alive, I whisper, kissing my baby's forehead. She smells like that Newborn sweetness mixed with hospital soap. And I realize she might never know her father. The thought makes me physically ill. When we turn onto our street, it's like entering hell. Fire trucks everywhere, hoses snaking across the pavement. Neighbors in their robes, watching our entire life burn. The smoke is thick and black, and I can taste it even inside the taxi. Missus Ben from next door sees me getting out of the taxi and runs over, her face streaked with tears. Oh, honey, thank god you're safe. But Danny. We haven't seen Danny. The fire started hours ago. Hours ago while I was calling him, while I was waiting, while I was believing his lies about working late projects. My baby starts crying harder, like she can feel the heat from the flames, and I pull her blanket tighter around her tiny body. I find a firefighter, my voice barely working. My husband, is he okay? Did anyone get out? Ma'am, nobody was home. But. He pauses, looking uncomfortable. His eyes dart to my baby, then back to my face. The fire started from a candle left burning in the bedroom. There. Were wine glasses

My son brought his girlfriend, Sarah, home last week. Sweet girl, helped with dishes without being asked. But something about her face haunted me all night. I couldn't shake the feeling I'd seen her before. Then I caught her crying in my bathroom, not sad tear. She was smiling. Said she'd never had a family dinner without screaming or plates being thrown. My heart broke. As I hugged her, I noticed a small scar above her eyebrow. Something clicked in my brain, but I pushed the thought away. A few days later, she came over to help me garden when my neighbor's kids screamed playing tag. She dropped her travel, started shaking, said loud noises just startled her. But I'd seen that reaction before in my old job as a high school counselor. That evening, my son dropped the bomb. He was proposed, wanted to use Grandma's ring, called Sarah the strongest person he'd ever met, said she'd survived things I couldn't imagine. My blood ran cold. I dug through my old files that night, found it. Sarah Miller, age 15, came to my office bruised and terrified, begged me to believe her mom was hitting her. I called CPS once. Her mom fooled them. Sarah begged for help again. But I was swamped with cases, thought maybe she was exaggerating. I did nothing. She doesn't recognize me now. Weight gain, different hair color. But that scar, it's from the day after. She left my office. Her mom threw a glass at her. Yesterday, I finally told my son everything. He just stared at me, said, Sarah still wakes up screaming some nights. Today, I'm meeting her to confess, to say I'm the counselor who failed her, the one who could have stopped her pain but didn't. The ring box is sitting on my table. My son wants to propose to someone I could have saved years ago. Turns out my worst mistake wasn't what I did. It was what I didn't do.

When morning comes, everyone wakes up looking like they've survived a natural disaster. Hair's a mess, someone's missing a sock, and the kid who slept on the floor can't walk straight anymore.

I checked my daughter Kate's bank account and saw zeros where $300 should have been. Kate was 16 and worked 20 hours a week at a burger place, but somehow her entire paycheck had vanished. When Kate got home from her shift, I confronted her with the statement, I've been buying stuff for Zoe at school. She has a baby and nobody helps her, she explained. My first thought was that someone was running a sob story scam on my naive daughter, but Kate insisted that Zoe desperately needed help and the baby would suffer without it. The next morning, I gave Kate extra cash and told her to give it to Zoe. Thanks, Mom. Zoe's going to cry when I give her this. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. We need to discuss something serious with you about Kate. Immediately. I rushed to the school, expecting the worst. Your daughter was seen in the parking lot giving another student prescription bottles and cash and what appeared to be a substance deal. We have zero tolerance for substances on school property, and we've already contacted the school resource officer. He turned his computer screen toward me to show the security footage of Kate handing we two orange prescription bottles and money by her car. I felt sick realizing I've been giving Kate money that might have been funding prescription substance stealing. Mr. Hayes said Kate claimed the prescriptions were antibiotics and diaper cream for a baby, but that sounded like a ridiculous lie to cover up selling pills. No teenager carries around multiple prescriptions for a baby they don't have, he said while shaking his head. That's when the school nurse walked in carrying a baby who was caught so hard his tiny body shook with each breath. This is Zoe's son, she said quietly while patting his back. She brought him to my office this morning because he ran out of his breathing medicine and she didn't know what else to do. The principal went completely silent. The nurse explained that Zoe was 16 and had been trying to finish school while raising a six month month old baby alone. Her parents had kicked her out and she'd been living in her car for the past month. The prescriptions Kate gave her were antibiotics for the baby's lung infection and prescription diaper cream for an infected diaper rash that had gotten so bad it was bleeding. Kate had been using her own money to buy them because Zoe couldn't afford the copays. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No teenage girl should be living in a car with a sick baby. I told Mr. Hayes I wanted to keep helping Zoe and asked where I could find her. He said she usually stayed in the parking lot after school until security made her leave. After school we found Zoe in The parking lot, trying to change her baby's diaper in the backseat of her car. She saw us coming and immediately started to panic like she was going to drive away. But Kate ran over before she could start the car. It's okay. This is my mom. She wants to help. Please don't call anyone. They'll take him away, and he's all I have left. Zoe begged through the cracked window. The baby was wheezing so loud I could hear it from outside the car, and his little face looked gray. I convinced her to let me sit in the passenger seat so we could talk. She explained that they had been living in this car for over a month, and she washed the baby in gas station sinks at night when nobody was around. I asked about the baby's father and watched her whole body start shaking. His name is Nathan. His dad teaches chemistry here at school, she said so quietly I could barely hear her. I was 15 when Nathan invited me to his college party. He was 21 and kept giving me drinks until I couldn't stand up straight. Then he rocked me. A few weeks later, when I told Nathan I was pregnant, he laughed in my face and said nobody would ever believe trash like me over him since he's premed at the university. She started sobbing and told us that his dad had cornered her after class one day. He grabbed my arm. So hard it left bruises and said, listen, you whore, if you ever mention my son's name in connection with that bastard baby, I will personally make sure you fail every single class and never graduate. I sat there feeling pure rage build in my chest as this child described being threatened and abandoned by adults who should have protected her. As a lawyer, I knew exactly what these monsters had done wrong and how to make them pay for it. I told Zoe she was moving in with us. That night, we packed everything she owned into trash bags and drove them to our house. I set up a crib in the guest room while Zoe took her first hot shower in two months and cried the entire time. The next morning, I filed for emergency child support and demanded a court ordered paternity test. I also reported Nathan to the police for statutory rape. Nathan tried to dodge the test for three weeks by claiming he didn't even know Zoe until the judge threatened to have him arrested when the DNA results came back proving he was the father. The judge was furious that a 21 year old had impregnated a 15 year old and then abandoned his sick child. The court ordered Nathan to pay $28,000 in back support immediately. The District Attorney filed felony statutory RP charges that would require him to register as a sex offender under for life. His dad also got fired. A Week after I reported his threats to the school board, three months later, Zoe was back on track to graduate with her class, and her baby was happy and healthy for the first time in months.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time, and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments, like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days, and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I noticed the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass. My bass, actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me. Look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for, like, two months. Two months? I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks the bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me. Right there with me, watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist, who still can't play an F chord cleanly, actually says, it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs, but okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us. Support them? Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a dream. Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes. She'll look great in the back. How the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's singing through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money. The cables, the stands, hell, even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted Breaking Chains I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks with The original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs. Mine. Well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately. Are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow. In my dad's garage, with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

My friends always used to say I had the most generic looking face in our city. You're like the default character in a video game. They joke, and honestly, they weren't wrong. Everywhere I went in Cleveland, people swore they knew me. Hey, don't you work at the grocery store on 55th? Weren't you at my cousin's wedding? It was funny at first. Until it wasn't. One morning, I was working the register at the hardware store when two cops walked in. I figured they were just grabbing supply until they asked my name. The next thing I knew, they spun me around, cuffed me, and started reading me my rights. My co workers froze, customer stared, and I just kept saying, this has to be a mistake. They dragged me out anyway, like I've been caught red handed. At the station, they pulled up the security footage of a gas station robbery from a week earlier. My stomach dropped. The guy on the screen looked exactly like me. Same build, same beard, same haircut. Even the same black hoodie I wore all the time. I almost convinced myself it was me. It got worse. Three different eyewitnesses picked me out of a lineup, no hesitation. That's him, 100%. I didn't even have an alibi that night. I've been home gaming, not texting or calling anyone. No receipts, nothing. To the cops, I was their guy. The evidence stacked up so neatly against Me, it felt unreal. My public defender sat me down and gave it to me straight. With video, eyewitnesses and no alibi, you're looking at serious time. The DA is offering a plea deal. Two years if you plead guilty. If you fight it and lose, you could get 10. I thought about it. Two years for something I didn't do. 10 years if I lost. My chest felt like it was caving in. But I couldn't do it. I couldn't sign a piece of paper saying I was guilty when I wasn't. So I tried something else. I got my hands on the footage and posted it online.

He finally woke up. My husband made me promise we would keep things normal after the baby was born because he read online that babies need to adapt to your life, not the other way around. I agreed because I was 9 months pregnant and too tired to argue about his parenting theories from Reddit. The second we got home from the hospital with our 3 day old daughter, he disappeared into his gaming room. I stood in the hallway holding our screaming baby while he told his online friends he was finally back. I spent the first three months doing every single night feeding while he slept peacefully in our bed. He actually bought special noise cancelling headphones so the crying wouldn't disturb his precious 8 hours of sleep. You look like you're about to drop dead, my sis, Mr Mindy, said when she showed up at my front door. I hadn't seen her since the baby shower because she lived six hours away. When was the last time you ate actual food or slept more than an hour? She dropped her bags and immediately took the baby baby from my shaking arms. You have lost at least 20 pounds and your hands won't stop trembling. She pulled me into the first real hug I had gotten since giving birth. I didn't realize how much I needed a hug. Where is your husband? I Pointed down the hall where he was screaming about someone stealing his kill. Mindy listened for a second, then her whole face changed completely. You have been doing this alone while he plays video games all day, haven't you? Before I could answer, she said, go shower right now while I watch the baby. Then we are going to talk about whatever this mess. She started washing the mountain of bottles that had been sitting for days. You are not doing another night alone while that waste of space pretends you don't exist. I stood under the hot water and cried harder than when I was in labor. When I came back downstairs, Mindy had the baby sleeping. Pee. You look exhausted, she said. Actually looking at my face. When's the last time someone asked how you're doing? I couldn't remember. My husband hadn't asked since we left the hospital three months ago. He'd asked if the baby was fed, if she napped, but never once. How are you holding up? Your husband games every night until 4:00am, Mindy asked, looking at his empty gaming chair. My ex did that. I ended up hospitalized from exhaustion. He didn't visit. That hit hard. Even strangers at the grocery store asked how I was doing, but not him. I came back downstairs from my shower and stopped in the hallway when I heard voices in the kitchen. My husband had actually left his gaming room and was talking to Mindy who was Still feeding our daughter. We don't need any help, he was saying with obvious irritation in his voice. Everything's been fine here without you showing up and judging how we do things. Mindy kept calmly feeding the baby while she responded. Fine. Your wife has lost 20 pounds and hasn't slept in three months. I watched him grab an energy drink from the fridge and crack it open aggressively. She wanted a baby so badly and now she complains about everything he said. Maybe if she wasn't so dramatic about normal mom stuff, we wouldn't have issues. And he finally looked up at him with cold eyes. Normal mom stuff? She told me she thinks about leaving you. His hand froze halfway to his mouth with the energy drink. She fantasizes about packing up and disappearing because raising a baby alone.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rianna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a maid outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

So there I was, sitting on her bum, massaging her back and making my way down her lower back. I started to move her sweatpants out of the way so I wouldn't get lotion on them. I'm a gentleman, I know. She then just straight up said can you massage my two planets? This is where panic sets in. Butt massage? As in like touching her buttocks? What the hell? Hear a panic? Anyway, I obliged and gave her a butt massage, but that's it. I was so tempted to slip a finger, but I didn't. After the massage, she asked how were you uncomfortable with me getting changed in front of you, but you didn't mind massaging my butt? That was a perfectly valid point in question in which I still don't have an answer. She then got changed in front of me again. Turns out some lotion got on her sweatpants. Was it lotion? Oops. Anyways, at this point I didn't mind and kind of watched a little without being too weird about it. Massaging her butt probably help settle the nerves at this point. After she got changed, we went back to my place. She went to the fridge and open it without asking. I commented, well, you're comfortable. She immediately replied, well, you were comfortable massaging my Butt panic again. What should I say? What did that mean? I didn't know how to respond to this, so I stupidly said well, don't ask again. Who says that anyways? I can't help but feel I messed up and missed my chance. I'm also a massive idiot and don't want to ask her if she likes me straight up. My lack of experience with women also doesn't help. I saw her today but never spoke a word about what happened. Is this Kai Cenat Ohio w Rizz?

We had a rule in our house. If dad was wearing his red baseball cap indoors, nobody was allowed to talk to him. Not a word. Not even pass the salt at dinner. It wasn't every day. Maybe once or twice a week, he'd come home from work, red cap on, and we'd all just navigate around him. Mom would put his dinner plate down silently. My sister and I would do homework in our rooms. If we needed something from the living room and he was there, we'd wait. I thought this was totally normal. Like how some dads have a don't bother me during the game rule. Ours was just the red cap thing. Friends were over and saw the cap. I'd whisper, Red Cap Day, and they just shrug, and we'd play outside. The rule was so ingrained that I once got in trouble at school for ignoring a substitute teacher. She was wearing a red hat, and my brain just went, don't talk. I couldn't even explain it properly to the principal. Mom enforced it hard, too. my little sister asked dad for help with homework on a red cap day. Mom grabbed her arm so tight it left marks and dragged her to a room. Later, she apologized, but said we had to respect Dad's needs. In high school, I finally asked mom why dad needed red cap days. She got this tired look and Said your father works very hard, and sometimes he needs quiet to decompress. The cap helps us know when to give him space. Made sense to me. Dad's work hard, whatever. I moved out for college, and roommates thought it was hilarious when I'd warn them about my dad's red cap rule. Before this, it's just don't talk to him. If he's wearing it, he's cool otherwise. Last year, I'm home for Thanksgiving. I'm 26 now. Dad's wearing the red cap at dinner. We're all eating silent when my boyfriend, who I'd warned repeatedly, accidentally says, sir, could you pass the Turkey? The entire table freezes. Dad's hand stops halfway to his fork, his jaw clenches. Then he just get it's up and leaves. Doesn't say a word, just walks out to the garage. Mom starts crying. Actually crying at Thanksgiving dinner. My boyfriend is mortified, apologizing profusely. I'm pissed at him, but also confused by Mom's reaction. It's just the stupid cap rule. Why is she sobbing? My sister pulls me aside later. You really don't get it, do you? Turns out dad wasn't decompressing. The red cap days were when he was.

After I exposed my bullies on YouTube, I thought it was strange that my principal wanted to delete my channel instead of punishing the bullies, but I just discovered what the school is really hiding. You see, I knew there had to be some reason the principal was siding with the bullies. It makes no sense to punish me for just making a video talking about my horrible experience. The girls had literally gotten away with no punishment. But apparently, I'm not allowed to upload anymore. So I did some digging onto the school website, hoping there might be something that connected the principals with those girls. I looked around for hours, and at first I found nothing. I honestly didn't even know what I was looking for. But eventually, I finally realized the truth behind his actions. I click onto the donor's page, and at the very top, I see a face that looks really familiar. But when I see the name, that's when it hits me. This was the mother of my school bully. And the principal had just been trying to keep his top donor happy this entire time by excusing her daughter for the bullying. Think I'm gonna let this slide? Nah. I'm exposing my school to the whole world. Help boost the video by subscribing.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow. Six PM they had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes, I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at 15, they bought her a 2 thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said, earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a 3,000 dollar pottery wheel Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony, while they were treating me like a complete financial liability, been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 clients signed a three year contract worth two point eight million dollars and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check, $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone, plus my regular salary and performance bonus. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C63 s was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine, four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. Salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94,000 dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put 30,000 dollars down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part I didn't tell anyone about. The car or the commission. I just went about my normal routine for an entire week and my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story, nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple, new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First, it was Emma who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Just Marcus, we need to talk immediately. That car cost more than most people make in an entire year. Family meeting tomorrow, six PM sharp. Don't be late. I showed up 15 minutes early and parked right in their driveway, positioning the car perfectly so they'd see it the moment they walked outside. When dad opened the front door and saw the AMG sitting there, his face went completely white. Mom came up behind him and I watched her mouth actually fall open. So dad said, slowly, if you're involved in something illegal, we need to know right now. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed them my banking app. Account balance, $73,000. Then I handed him my employment contract, my commission statement and my Latest performance review. His hands were literally shaking as he read the numbers. $47,000 commission in one quarter. That's after taxes. I said calmly, the gross was $62,000. Mom was staring at the commission check, then at me, then back at the check. You make more than your father does. Emma just stood there in the doorway looking at the car, then at me like she was seeing me for the first time in her entire life. The golden child suddenly realizing her failure brother had been quietly building an empire while she collected participation trophies. That's when I smiled and said, next time, maybe ask about my life before assuming I'm failing at.

It sounds better than yours. I nodded. Then I quietly returned the eight thousand dollar wedding dress and booked a solo trip. What she found in her closet the next morning left her speechless. We were at the county clerk's office getting our marriage license when Iris dropped the bomb. I'm keeping Richardson, she announced to the confused clerk. But that's your ex husband's name, I said. Obviously. Richardson sounds so much better than Kowalski. Polish names are so harsh and ethnic. Richardson opens doors. The casual racism hit like a slap. But then I remembered something that made my blood freeze. She said this exact thing about her first boyfriend's Italian name years ago. This wasn't just about me. This was a pattern. I signed the papers in silence while she chatted about wedding plans, completely oblivious. That night, I made my own plans. But first I called her ex husband Mateo. Did she keep your name after the divorce for professional reasons? I asked. His bitter laugh told me everything. Professional reasons, dude. She kept it because she thought it sounded classier than her Maiden name. Stevens. She's been lying to everyone. Stevens. Her real name was Stevens. And she was ashamed of that, too. Tuesday morning she left for her spa day. I drove straight to Klein Fields with the receipt. Weddings been called off, I told the manager 15 minutes later. 8,000 $437 was Credited back to my card. But here's what she didn't know. I've been the one making all the payments. Because she'd maxed out her credit cards on designer bags she hid from me. I had receipts for everything. Next stop, the venue. I'm canceling everything. I announced the contract was in my name only. Back $4,500. Bridesmaid dresses, photographer, caterer. I systematically canceled everything I paid for. By three PM, I'd recovered nearly $20,000 of my money. Then I made one more call. To her maid of honor. Corrin. Did you know Iris is embarrassed by ethnic names? What? Her grandmother was Greek. Papadopoulos before Stevens. The hypocrisy was breathtaking. Been ashamed of her own heritage. But the real bombshell. I checked our joint savings. She'd been secretly transferring money for a surprise honeymoon that was actually a trip to see Mateo in California. Flight confirmations in her email. Then came the final touch. In her closet, where her dream dress had hung, I left a note. Since you prefer Richardson to Kowalski, I figured Richardson should pay for your dress. Good luck explaining to Mateo why you were planning to visit him next week. The guy with the harsh name next to it, I hung a Polish flag and printed photos of her flight confirmations. She came home glowing from her spa day. You should see my nails. They're perfect for the wedding. What wedding? I asked support on the coffee table. I canceled everything today. Her face went White. She bolted to the bedroom, then came storming back with my note, the flag, and the flight confirmations. You went through my email? You went through my savings account! Richardson should buy you a new one. This is psychotic. Over a name? Over you planning to cheat with your ex next week? She started calling the boutiques. Each conversation ended the same way. Everything was canceled. Waiting lists were months long. Deposits were gone. Her Instagram influencer dreams crumbled when someone screenshot her old posts about keeping Richardson for professional reasons. The comments were brutal. So you're marrying Richardson again, bro? Dodged a bullet. Her friend group imploded when the group chat leaked. calling Polish names ethnic wasn't her first offensive comment, just the first one that affected someone they knew directly. Her DEI job launched an investigation after HR saw the screenshots. Hard to promote diversity when you're on record being prejudiced against Polish names. Even her ex husband posted on Facebook. For the record, I've been telling Iris to change her name back since our divorce. It's weird. Also, Team Kowalski. Two weeks later I returned from an incredible solo trip to Japan. Found 247 texts, mostly from Iris. Day 7 Mateo heard what happened. He texted me laughing. Her influencer career was dead. Last I heard she's still single. Still Richardson. Still living with her parents. The eight thousand dollar dress hangs unworn in her childhood closet. Me? I'm dating someone new. Also Polish. Thinks Kowalski is a beautiful name. The Polish flag hangs in my living room now, not hidden in a closet. Turns out disrespecting someone's heritage is a great way to end up with no one to marry.

Called me a gold digger at her own daughter's wedding? I'm at my sister in law's wedding rehearsal dinner, and my mother in law is doing her favorite thing, which is introducing me as my son's wife who stays home because he's such a good provider. She says that to literally every person she sees each time. I try to smile and say, actually, I work from home, but she cuts me off with, yes, yes, keep in. Houses work too, dear. We know. And she's already moving to the next person, literally turning her back mid sentence like I'm a museum display. She's explaining six years of this crap. Six years of her dropping by at 10:00am and saying, must be nice to sleep in when I've been working since 5. His whole family thinks I married him for money, all because I got pregnant three months after we met and had a quickie wedding. I quit my office job to work from my laptop, which to them means I don't work at all. The aunt asks, so you're just home with the kids? And I say, I actually run a business, but she pats my hand going, oh, you have a hobby, how nice. My mother in law laughs, saying she sells things online. It's so cute, like I'm a five year old with a lemonade stand. My husband tries at dinner saying she's actually really successful, but his mom cuts him. Off with stop embarrassing her, honey, not everyone needs to be a career woman. My phone buzzes with another notification I quickly silence. My mother in law tells the wedding planner I've been between jobs for six years when they asked about the extended family of the bride. Not to mention my father in law makes a weekly joke about how I won the lottery marrying his son. The most annoying thing is when my brother in law calls me the professional mom and they all think they're being so clever. Wedding day arrives and it's this garden situation with 150 guests. I'm trying to get the kids ready when my mother in law walks in, seeing my laptop open with spreadsheets showing six figure quarterly reports and goes you shouldn't be playing games while the kids get dressed. Priorities, dear. I say it's actually my quarterly reports, but she's already talking over me. Can you help with flower arrangements since you're not busy during the reception? They seat me at the back table with the kids and elderly relatives, as where else would the housewife sit, right? The bride's college friends are at my table and ask what I do. I start to explain I run an online business, but they turn to each other before I finish saying must be nice to not have real deadlines. And as if summoned, my mother in law walks by, adding she's trying to start a little Etsy shop. Isn't that sweet, The photographer is gathering details for the album, asking about everyone's careers ever. When he gets to me, my mother in law answers for me. She's loved being a homemaker and a professional child raiser. And when I try to correct her, she goes, she's being modest. She runs after two kids all day and everyone laughs. But wait, it gets worse, because mother in law takes the microphone for her toast, and instead of talking about her lawyer daughter, the one getting married, she talks about how special her son is, how successful he is, how handsome he is, then turns to me saying, my son married for love, not money. He provides everything, while his wife gets to enjoy the simple joys of motherhood. Some women are just meant to keep house. I said it as a joke, only no one was laughing. Even the elderly relatives at my table looked uncomfortable. Not even a minute after the speech, the maid of honor, who's a fashion influencer with like two million followers, rushes over to me. I'm

My 17 year old son with down syndrome was arrested for assaulting three grocery store employees and robbing an elderly woman. The police officer's voice was stern when he called me at work. Your son Ali is being detained. He assaulted staff members and stole from a customer. The manager wants to press charges. I actually laughed out loud. Ali, my Ali, the same kid who reads stories to dogs at the shelter because he thinks they get lonely. The officer wasn't amused. Sir, three employees have injuries. You need to come immediately. When I arrived eight minutes later, Ali was sitting on the curb in handcuffs, his Pokemon shirt torn, dirt on his face. But strangest of all, he was smiling. Not his usual sweet smile, but this fierce proud grin I'd never seen before. The store manager, this thin rat faced man, was holding ice against his jaw while a blond female employee showed off scratch marks on her arms to the gathering crowd. Ali, I said, kneeling beside him, what happened? He saw me and his mood brightened. Dad, I saw them trying to scam Missus Yune, the nice grandma from next door. They were making her swipe her card over and over again. The manager immediately started screaming, he's lying. Your retard son is violent and he grabbed money from Missus Yune and attacked us. When we tried to stop him, I stood up ready to Drop this piece of nincompoop for calling my son that. But the officer stepped between us. Sir, control yourself. But regardless of what he was saying, I knew my son would never do something like that. Ali, I said, ignoring everyone else, focus on my voice. Tell me exactly what happened. His smile faded as he tried to focus. It started when I saw Missus Yune and she looked super confused. The blonde employee rolled her eyes. Oh, great. The moron is going to tell us a story. I took a step toward her, but Ali grabbed my hand and kept talking. She was at the self checkout. It kept saying error. I saw the yellow haired lady telling Missus Yune to swipe her card again and again and again. He held up his fingers seven times. Dad, I counted. The blonde employee looked like she was about to burst in anger. Shut up. But the officer held up his hand for silence. Ali continued, his voice getting stronger. Mrs. Yun said she already paid. She showed them her receipt, but the employee told her that she had to keep swiping or she couldn't leave with her groceries. Dad, remember how you warned me that's how bad people steal. They make you swipe lots of times, then take all the money. My blood was boiling now. Yes, I remember, buddy. Then what happened? I went over, I said, excuse me, that's not nice. You're tricking her. The lady called me. The R word and said I was too stupid to understand grown up things. Ali's face scrunched up at the memory and he looks scared. But I understand stealing is wrong. So I told Missus Yune to call 9 1 1. I said these people are doing crimes to you. The manager's face was purple. Now this moron doesn't know what he's talking about. Ali kept going. That's when the man grabbed Missus.

I saw my six year old daughter standing outside freezing in the snow. I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was crank up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink Backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never or seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. If the room started spinning, what are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual, cruel.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organised every holiday, baked free birthday cake and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But Week 2, 2, my brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka, couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration, the same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My co workers told Her I'd moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2, Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He'd never realised I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists and which bills were due when without me. He missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the or and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realized I've been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own sister's birthday for the first time in 40 years and had to hear about it at Sunday dinner. The woman who said nobody would notice was now hiring a professional organizer for $200 a week to do what I've done for free my entire adult life. Even then, the organize.

Why is my laptop not turning on? I was drinking water, and then I swear to god, I felt something push me in my back. It spilt all over the laptop. I'm so sorry, Kylie. I tried wiping it down and everything. Well, there's $900 down the drain. It's okay, Riley. You're the golden girl who can do no wrong. That's what mom would say, right? Are you mad? No, I'm just ecstatic. What do you think? Riley? Riley, what have you done to my makeup? Oh, yeah, I was going to tell you about that. I had a little accident. A little accident? You ruined everything! I'm sorry, Kylie. I didn't mean 2. One thing just Broke. And then everything else followed. You need to be taught a lesson, Riley. I've had enough. Mom, Riley just destroyed $500 worth of my makeup and ruined the bathroom sink in the process. How bad is it? What is wrong with you? Kylie, I'm genuinely interested to see how you're going to flip this onto me. She might be 15, but I wasn't doing things like this at her age. Why on earth would you spend that much money on makeup? That mess is fixable. But you wouldn't have been this angry if it wasn't so expensive. And for what? To paint your face? You know what? I'm not even going to engage in this. Kylie, why is your door locked? Because I'm out. And I don't want you to go in there and cause World War 3. That makeup thing was the last straw. Riley, you know I love you, but this is unacceptable. We're family. We have to share with each other. You're my big sister. I tried to do the right thing. From now on, if you want to use my things, you're going to have to pay me. Pay you with what money? I don't have a job. Figure it out. I'm telling Mommy. Of course you are. Kylie, why are you acting like this toward your little sister? I tried doing it the nice way, mom. It didn't work. Well, when you come back, your things are going to be packed in a suitcase. What? If you two can't live with each other, then it's way easier for you to move out rather than her. You're 19 now anyway. It's about time. I'm sorry, honey. This is the only way. No, it's not. You better lock your sweet Riley in a room or something, because it won't be pretty when I see that little brat.

Our landlord gave it to me, bruh. So can you keep the noise down? It's not me that's making the noise. Well, then who is it? My girlfriend, Crystal. Did something happen? Yeah, but it's none of your business. Well, I think I deserve to know, since she woke me up at seven in the morning on a Saturday. Fine. She asked me if I enjoyed our bedroom life. And what did you say? Obviously, I said yes. So why is she upset? She asked what I liked about it specifically, and I told her I liked everything. Oh, that makes sense. What?

Thanks for having me over. Thanks for cooking. No problem. It's nice to put a face to the name. Yeah. If I'm being honest, I didn't expect you to look like that. Like what? Pretty. That's sweet, Adam, but you have a girlfriend. Hopefully not for long. Why do you say that? Crystal came home an hour after we had dinner last night. She ignored me and went straight to bed. That doesn't seem like a huge problem. The last time she acted like that, she was cheating on me. Wait, why are you still with her if she cheated? I'm honestly not sure. Daniela, I think you should leave her for someone who knows your value. Like who? Never mind. Talk to you later. Hey, Adam. Can you guys stop making so much noise? Sorry, Daniela. I can't stop her. She keeps yelling at me, calling me a cheater. Why does she think you're cheating? Somehow she could smell your perfume from yesterday. Is there anything I can do to help? No, she just left. Again? What if she really is cheating on you again? I don't wanna think about that. What if we could find proof if she is cheating? How? How about you come over to my place for dinner tonight? We can come up with a plan then. Okay? Sure. What time? 7. That works. Comment for part three?

It sounds to me like you need to grow up and let go of the past. I haven't even mentioned how your boyfriend Gary is always looking at me weird and trying to spend time alone with me. I don't know what his intentions are there. You're gross for thinking that. Live, Gary only has eyes for me. Plus, you're too old for him. Young. I meant young. Dad's house is bigger and I wouldn't have to sleep in an office. Mom, okay, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry that I don't have a mansion, but I've always tried my best for you. Live, I would starve myself so you could eat. Mom, what are you talking about? You've never had a job. You go from guy to guy and leech their money. And you've never been grateful for what I've Done for us. So go run to your daddy like the little girl you are. I replaced you with Gary's daughter. Anyway. Good for you. Bye. Mom. Live. It's been three weeks. Please come back. Mom, I'm happy at Dad's house. I can't live without you. I'm sorry for what I said to you. I was just angry because you were leaving. Has anything that made me want to move out been changed? Am I still going to have to sleep in an office? You're being so selfish right now. Can you just think of me for once? I need my daughter. And you need me, don't you? I don't know if I do anymore, mom. Ever since you left, I've been needing to drink to numb my pain. I've blacked out a few times. Oh, my gosh, mom, are you okay? I just need to see you live. You don't have to stay with me all the time anymore. Maybe just a couple days a week. Okay, I'll come over and we can discuss it. Dad, Mom wants to see me. I don't really wanna go, but I'm scared of what she would do to herself if I said no. You can't go alone, honey. Can you pick me up from school and take me? But don't come inside. She might flip out. Okay, I'm coming now. Honey, it's been one hour. What are you guys doing in there? Dad, she's acting crazy. I told her I can't move. Back in! And she started shouting, so I went to hide in the toilet, hoping she cools down. But now she's banging on the door and she's saying she won't let me leave with a baseball bat in her hand. And she's really drunk. Should I come inside? I don't want her to get even more angry. She doesn't know I bought you. Wait, never mind. This door sounds like it's going to break anytime soon. Come stop her, quick! Dad! Wait! I'm coming! No! Why did I just hear a scream?

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. Spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. Little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. This psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She. He sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room she made all pink And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

You what? I panicked. Sarah wouldn't stop asking me out. So your solution was to fake date me? Ever heard of saying I'm not interested? I tried that. She didn't listen. And you thought, ah, yes, let me drag Natasha into this mess. You're my best friend. Who else was I supposed to ask? Anyone. Literally anyone. Too late. Everyone believes it now. Unbelievable. Come on, it's just for a week or two. Fine, but you owe me. How much? Fries and milkshakes every day. Rizz App tells him to say, I thought I owe you my heart. I thought I owe you my heart. That was smooth. Anyways, I got you. Why is everyone staring at me in the hallway? Probably because you're dating the most eligible bachelor in school. Cut the ego trip. Did you tell people details? Just the usual we're madly in love stuff. You're kidding. Relax, it's believable. Someone just asked me when we had our first kiss. What did you say? I panicked and said sophomore year. Nice. That makes us high school sweethearts. Jake, this isn't a Netflix romcom. It could be. No. Alright, alright, Ava. Now what? Sarah just cornered me after practice. Oh boy. What did she say? She asked, what does Ava have that I don't? And you said, better taste. Oh my god. You didn't. I did. The look on her face was priceless. You're impossible. And you're stuck with me. Someone left a Note in my locker. A love letter? No. It said, Alex deserves someone better than you. Yikes. Gee, thanks for the sympathy. I'm just saying, it's probably Sarah. She's dramatic like that. Well, congrats. Your fake girlfriend now has a nemesis. So this is fun. My mom just asked, when is Jake coming over for dinner? She knows? Of course she knows. You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? Actually, I didn't say anything. Then how does she know? Moms have their ways. What did you tell her? That we're busy. Lame. I love your mom's cooking. Jake, this isn't real. Doesn't mean I can't get a free meal out of it. Hey, it's a boyfriend. I've been thinking. Uh oh. Dangerous territory. What if we didn't have to pretend any

I tried to hug you to be close, and you acted like I was an visible. You didn't even sit with me on the carousel. You chose Alexa instead. Oh, that. I'm sorry, my love.

Anything can be fixed with the power of my love for you. That's actually really sweet. I love you, Liv. More than you know. I don't wanna lose you over stupidity. I love you too, James. But this has to change now. It will. Movie tomorrow with the group. I'll be the boyfriend. You deserve. Okay, but you better stick to your word this time. I promise. We had such a blast last night, didn't we? That movie was a killer. Babe, why aren't you responding? Didn't you enjoy it as well? Enjoy it? How could I enjoy it when you literally ignored me for Alexa the whole time? What are you talking about? I was just being friendly. Plus, I gave you that kiss, remember? A kiss doesn't cancel out you laughing and joking with her all night. It felt like you were her date more than you were mine. I didn't mean to make you feel that way. Alexa's just easy to talk to, you know? So I'm not. Am I not funny or interesting enough for you? That's not what I meant. I'm sorry, okay? I love you, live. You mean everything to me. Save it, James. I can't do this anymore. Baby, please meet me at school tomorrow, okay? I'll prove how much you mean to me. Fine. But this is your last chance.

Europe is a continent. They get things a lot later than the US. What kind of things? I think they got electricity, like, 10 years ago. Is this girl real? Electricity was first noticed in Greece in the years 600 before Christ. Greece, by the way, is a European country. No one in Europe speaks English. Um. Oh, yeah. London would be the only country where you could go and I guess, speak English. London is a city, but it's different. It's. It's British. They won't understand American as far as I'm concerned. I guess they would really love not to be able to understand the single word you're saying. I hear they don't have spices besides salt there, so I'm definitely bringing some spices when I go. Italy here in my country, only my country. That, by the way, needs no fucking introduction about the culinary culture. We normally use at least 30 kind of spices, but there are many more along those lines. I hear all they eat is fish in that cup, bro. So I guess Europe and Japan are pretty similar. But, I mean, you all know this. We all went to school. Guess not.

Europe is a continent. They get things a lot later than the US. What kind of things? I think they got electricity, like, 10 years ago. Is this girl real? Electricity was first noticed in Greece in the years 600 before Christ. Greece, by the way, is a European country. No one in Europe speaks English. Um. Oh, yeah. London would be the only country where you could go and I guess, speak English. London is a city, but it's different. It's. It's British. They won't understand American at all, as far as I'm concerned. I guess they would really love not to be able to understand the single word you're saying. I hear they don't have spices besides salt there, so I'm definitely bringing some spices when I go. Italy here in my country, only my country. That, by the way, needs no fucking introduction. About the culinary culture. We normally use at least 30 kind of spices, but there are many more along those lines. I hear all they eat is fish. So I guess Europe and Japan are pretty similar. But, I mean, you all know this. We all went to school. Guess not. But I think in Europe, everyone is homeschooled on the fjords, so maybe I should start teaching them some stuff about, like, the rest of the world. Yes, please. Oh, my god.

It all started when Sammy randomly spawned a taco Lucky block and spawned Infinite Tim Cheeses and Taco Tuesday officially started. And with it bring the new taco event where you had to collect three brain rots for the new Taco Rita Bisicleta. And I thought it was going to be easy because there was 1 million of them available, but I was absolutely wrong. So I did the Feed Sammy Tacos event like usual, trying to get the rocks for the new taco Rita Bicicleta. And I was hoping for something good, but like always I get this absolute trash brain rot every single damn time. But finally I got the first brain rot I needed, the cappy taco. My luck would only keep getting worse from this point as I literally got the tea Taco every single flipping time. To make things even worse, the Feed Sammy event wouldn't even work anymore so I was forced to leave and rejoin, wasting a lot of time. But luckily Sammy did the snap event which activated literally every single event in the game. But that didn't change the fact my luck was probably the worst out of anyone in the entire event, as I literally could not get anything else other than the tea be Taco. I'm pretty sure that the game literally hates me because tell me, why did I get a rainbow TP Taco that got every single trait in The damn game. And as my luck got worse, the amount of brain rots left went down quickly and it sold out and I got absolutely nothing. What did you guys think about today's admin abuse? Let me know in the comments if you want a secret like follow and comment your user.

Like, bro, what? For those of y'all scratching your heads like huh? What's 7 7 7 supposed to mean? Let me catch you up real quick. Okay, so 7 7 7 sounds innocent, right? Like maybe a lucky number? Vegas vibes? No? Nope. It's straight up foul, man. There's this rabbit hole of filters titled 7 7 7 filter blah blah, and when you click on them, you think it's gonna be a cute little sparkle or dog ears filter. Nah, it turns into something your grandma would faint over. Here's the kicker though. Some dude, I swear, just keeps making viral videos telling folks, yo, if you type 7 7 7 you'll get kicked off TikTok instantly and folks believe it. So guess what? I tried it. I type 7 7 7 in my own comment section. I typed it in the search. TikTok. Didn't even flinch. I'm still here, breathing, scrolling, questioning my life choices. And if you saw that OG video. Bro, why are we still feeding this dude views? He's been doing this clout chasing conspiracy TikTok thing since like 2020. You know who I'm talking about. Name starts with K, yellow hair, glasses, make some weird song nobody remembers. Dudes out here pushing fake news like it's Black Friday deals. So yeah, if you tried It. And nothing happened. Welcome to the club. We alive? We vibing. Anyway, if anything new pops off with this 7 7 7 cult code, you know I got you. Drop a comment if you want to see more dumb TikTok myths get roasted. Hit that follow so we can laugh at fake drama together. All right, I'm out. Stay safe and don't trust anyone with yellow hair and a ukulele. Peace.

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult, the one who gets late night calls for rides, the one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance, Bethany is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor, a massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid and my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over, maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You should try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed I've been making her uncomfortable for Months. She claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back, done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic, banging on my door at ten PM Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This, it was character assassination. And you believed her instantly? Without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice, is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to treat Me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called. Families work through things. But Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate.

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult, the one who gets late night calls for rides, the one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance, Bethany is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor, a massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid and my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over, maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You should try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed I've been making her uncomfortable for Months. She claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back, done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic, banging on my door at ten PM, Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This, it was character assassination. And you believed her instantly? Without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice, is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to treat Me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called. Families Work through things. But Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate the guarantee or face.

Then he called me desperate when he found out I had already found someone better to accompany me. My sister Kira was always the golden child. I was the accident that came 11 months later. My mother kept my hospital bracelet in a drawer labeled oops until I could read it myself at age six. Favoritism was constant. Kira got new clothes every season while I wore her hand me downs. Christmas, when I turned 8, I watched her unwrap the American Girl doll I begged Santa for. My gift was a dollar store knock off with the $1 99 cent sticker still on it. When I started crying, my father said, Selena, you're too old for tears. Kira is more sensitive than you. That was the moment I Learned I had to hide my emotions to avoid disappointing them further. Middle school was worse. At my 8th grade graduation, I won three academic awards while Kira sat in the audience getting seas during the car ride home. Instead of celebrating my achievements, my parents spent the entire time discussing how Kira must feel seeing me on stage so much. My mother said, Selena, maybe next time don't look so excited when they call your name. Think about your sister's feelings. In high school, I pulled straight A's while Kira barely passed. And report cards came home, they Pinned hers to the fridge and put mine in a drawer. The day I got accepted to Northwestern with a full scholarship, I found my parents comforting Kira, who just been fired from her clothing store job for showing up late. My mother looked at my acceptance letter and said, Selena, this really isn't the time. Can't you see your sister is upset? They spent an hour consoling her for losing a minimum wage job while completely ignoring my full scholarship that would save them $200,000. That night, my Aunt Sandra told me something that changed everything. Selena, you were never an accident. Your parents did fertility treatments to give Kira a sibling. But when you turned out smarter than her, they didn't know how to handle it. Everything clicked into place. The constant comparisons, the downplaying of my achievements, the way they seemed annoyed when I succeeded. College became my escape. I met Matt there, someone who valued my intelligence instead of feeling threatened by it. For the first time, I experienced what it felt like to be someone's first choice. When he proposed during our senior year, I cried from relief as much as joy. Someone finally chose me first and meant it. Three weeks before my wedding, my father called Lena. Kira scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your wedding. Your mother and I think we should support her instead. You'll have Matt's family there. My heart shattered, dad, she's known my wedding date. For eight months. We'll try to stop by the reception if we can. When I told Matt's father, Jim, what happened, his eyes filled with tears.

When I inherited my adoptive father's fortune, my biological father showed up. My biological parents, Brad and Nina, gave me away to another family when I was 8, not because they couldn't support me, but because I had ruined their plans. I still remember that last night it was raining and I hid under the kitchen table with my broken teddy bear while my mother screamed. You promised you would take care of this, Brad. I can't take, take it anymore, she yelled. I already spoke to the Baptist camp. They know a couple who wants to adopt, he replied like he was talking about giving away a dog. The next morning, Laura and Charles appeared and took me away. My parents didn't pack my things. I left with clothes on my back and an old toy. I thought everyone grew up afraid of their mother. I didn't have a place at the dinner table. When I showed her a drawing from school, she threw it in the trash. Once I heard my parents arguing, she was yelling, you promised me, you said if it was a girl we'd keep her. He replied, but it's too late now. No one wants a 7 year old boy. They were talking about me. My father only spoke to give orders. Wash the car, sweep the yard, clean my sister's bathroom. One day I saw new clothes on My sister's bed, dresses, pants, use with lights, nothing for me. When I asked if there was anything for me, she said, you already have something to wear. I grabbed Scissors and cut everything, every dress, every new garment. My blood was boiling, my hands shaking. It wasn't hatred. It was pure desperation. My mother burst into the room screaming and shoved me against the wall. You are a miss fake, a damn mistake, she screamed, pushing me against the wall. Later that night, my father came home. Nathan, tomorrow you're going to live with other people, he said with no emotion. Laura and Charles gave me what no one had tried to give me, security. Charles sold tools door to door. Then they started their own business. I, I helped however I could. The garage became a shop, then a warehouse, then a distribution center. At 21, I graduated with a business degree. Charles cried like a baby. Two years later, they went away for a weekend. An out of control truck hit them on a blind curve. It was instantaneous. They left me everything, the house, investments, the entire company. I grew the business, opened branches, hired over 100 employees. Last night security called me. There's a man here, says his name is Brad, says he's your father. When I went to the lobby, there he was, flumped, shoulders, unkempt beard, cheap clothes. Behind him were two exhausted women and four small children. Nathan, my son, he said, He had never called me that. Your mother left, ran off with another man. These are my daughters. They came back home with two kids each, no husbands, nothing. One of the children looked at me and asked quietly, are you Uncle Nathan? I had never been an uncle to anyone. You have so much now, Brad continued. We just need help until we get back on our feet. Then he said something that froze me. I want you to do for them what Charles and.

Oh my god. Oh my god. Please. Uh, uh. This pedophile committed a crime so disturbing that a petition was created that asked the government to publicly hang him. And the petition gathered thousands of signatures. This is 33 year old Benjamin Taylor from West Virginia. And in 2016, he would commit one of the most sickening crimes I've ever read about. Back in 2016, Benjamin was living with his girlfriend, a woman named Amanda Adkins. At the time, Amanda had recently given birth only nine months ago to her baby daughter Emily. Emily was a beautiful young girl. And I wanna warn you all right now, the details that we're about to discuss are some of the most disturbing I've ever covered. So in October of 2,016, Benjamin had only been living with his girlfriend Amanda for about a month. And on the morning of Emily's death at around 4:00am, Amanda woke up and went downstairs to search for her baby. When she went downstairs, she saw Benjamin Taylor with his pants unzipped sitting in the dark. Amanda.

Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted.

If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon, and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

They walked through the doors just before closing time Monday night. They're like, hey, you're open. Great. At the Buffalo Wild Wings on Montgomery and Wyoming. She has a real nice smile on her face. The woman even raised her hands when staff announced they were still open. They sit down, and it's a family. It's a mother, a guy, and a child. Management tells us they were the only three paying customers left in the restaurant, or so they thought. They walk into the restaurant, the friend, the waitress. They order over $100 worth of food. Two large orders of wings, a sampler plate, dessert, drinks to go, and more. They leave $150 on the table. The other server sees this and thinks, well, that family is paying for the meal. My friends about to get a really large tip. This is really good. Just one minute to realize that money was fake. But they say what's even more concerning, they're using their child as a ruse.

The victim filed a lawsuit demanding $3 million in compensation. Point thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez ordered a bowl of Mexican hot soup and took it home. Then she stormed back to the restaurant, claiming that the soup was too hot and that the lid of the takeout box had melted. The 24 year old cashier, Janelle Burland, refunded her and offered to replace the meal, but Martinez wouldn't listen. She continued to verbally abuse her child and other customers in front of them. Janelle remained calm and asked her to stop the abuse and leave, otherwise she would call the police. Unexpectedly, the customer suddenly poured the almost boiling hot soup onto Jonell's face.

Nope. This is not just a boy, but many are terrified. We are watching the final seconds of him and his life is being taken right now. People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help. But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing, with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house. And many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

The man who put up the fence says he had finally had it with students trespassing and leaving trash in his yard. He figured the fence would keep them out. I'm not in charge of other people's children. All I can do is protect myself. But jolted neighbours thought the fence was too extreme. They called police, and police called public works, who questioned whether the fence encroached on a county easement. Show me what's the truth, you know, everybody just giving me different words. The relentless homeowner not giving in because he says the signs posted in his front yard did nothing. It says no trespassing. Wait, you don't like kids? Me, I'm, I'm a parent and I don't want any children around here to get electrocuted. That's a little too extreme. I mean, you're gonna let the kids get electrocuted? That's not cool.

In the report, mom says the school also mentioned paddling with her and a deputy present. In the report, the mother says she didn't understand the process correctly. Later that day, she went to the school to pay the fee and they took her into the principal's office. We know the name of the woman with the paddle through a report from the Henry County Sheriff's Office. It says the principal of Central Elementary, Melissa Carter, and Cecilia Self, a clerk, are the two women in the video. We tried to reach them through the school district, but we're unsuccessful. Henry County School District's policy does not allow corporal punishment. It says, quote, the superintendent shall designate sanctions for the infractions of rules excluding corporal punishment. It's now up to the state attorney to decide whether to pursue charges against the principal and the clerk in the video.

Dad left me at Grandpa's house when I was 11 because his new wife didn't want me around. I thought it was the worst thing ever. But Grandpa taught me everything about farming and business. See, Grandpa wasn't just some old farmer. He owned 500 acres of prime agricultural land worth millions. When dad was growing up, Grandpa was an alcoholic who barely kept the farm running. But by the time I arrived, he'd gotten sober and turned everything around. For seven years, it was just me and Grandpa. He taught me how to work cattle, manage crops, handle finances and run a business. We'd wake up at 5:00am every day, work until sunset, then he'd help me with homework. He never missed a single school event. When he died, he left me everything. Not just the land, the house, the equipment, the bank accounts, everything. I was 18 and suddenly owned more than most people see in a lifetime. Dad didn't even come to the funeral. Didn't call to check on me. Nothing. I spent the next 15 years building Grandpa's legacy. I turned the ranch into a successful agritourism operation. Many families come stay for weeks, learning farm life. I also run a farmers market, sell organic beef and lease land to other farmers. Last year I cleared 800,000 dollar profit. Dad Never called once in 15 years. Not on my birthday, not on holidays. Nothing. I sent him a graduation invitation when I finished my agriculture degree. He didn't show. When I got married three years ago, I didn't even bother inviting him. Then last week, out of nowhere, dad shows up at my door. Not to apologize, not to reconnect. He wanted to talk business. Turns out his precious daughter, my half sister, who I've met exactly twice, struggling financially. Her husband lost his job, they're behind on their mortgage and she needs a fresh start. Dad figured I could just hand over some land and give her a management position. Family sticks together, he says with a straight face. The audacity was unbelievable. This man who abandoned his eleven year old son was lecturing me about family loyalty. I told him I'd think about it, hoping he'd get the hint and leave. Instead, he started texting me multiple times, daily. Detailed messages about which parcels of land would be perfect for his daughter. Suggestions about what roles she could fill in my business. Even ideas about where she and her husband could build a house. The messages got more demanding each day. She deserves this opportunity. Grandpa would have wanted this. You owe the family. It was like he thought my property was some kind of family commune he could just redistribute. After a week of constant harassment, I'd had enough. I called my friend Samuel, who's a local Police officer and asked him how to get a trespass order. Thirty minutes later, I walked out of the station with legal paperwork in hand. Then I asked another close friend, Peter, to take a road trip with me. I need backup for a family reunion. I told him. He didn't ask questions, just grabbed his keys. It took us 10 hours to drive to Dad's house. I needed that time to clear my head and plan exactly what I was going to say. Peter kept offering to drive, but I needed something to do with my hands while I processed everything. We pulled up to Dad's modest

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult. The one who gets late night calls for rides. The one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance Bethany, is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor. A massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid. And my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at it. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over. Maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You to try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable, so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed. I've been making her uncomfortable. For months, she claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you'd do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back. Done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic banging on my door at ten PM. Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This. It was character assassination. And you believed her? Instantly, without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice. Is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to Treat me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called families work through things, but Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate the guarantee or face legal action. I was panicking until my girl

One, after going out of town for the weekend, I dropped her off at her friend's house, which was an hour away from where I lived at the time. I told her I had to get back home to get ready for work the next day. She was begging me to stay and hang out some more, but I kept saying I had to get home. After about 15 minutes, I went to go to my car to leave. She hopped onto the hood of my car and refused to get off. After 10 more minutes of trying to talk her down, I gave up, got into my car, locked the doors, tilted the seat back and acted like I was taking a nap. She sat on my hood for another 20 minutes or so before it started to rain. That's what finally got her off of my car. Fine, go home, see if I care or something whiny like that. And she stormed off into her friend's house, never contacted her again. 2 her Rex just happened to be walking outside the restaurant we were at and she invited him in to sit at our table and have dinner with us. I protested, but I had to take a leak and the food was arriving, so I went to the bathroom. When I came back, the food date and dates ex had all disappeared. The time between this dude sitting At our table, the food arriving and me coming back from the bathroom was less than 5 minutes. 3. I have a very common last name. She had the same last name. The date went well. She said she couldn't go out with me on a second date, though, because it felt too weird. She explained that both her father and her brother also have the same first name as me, so all three of us have the exact same first and last name. I was like, whoa, yeah, that would be weird for me too. And we actually ended up staying pretty good friends. After 4, her apartment looked like it was ransacked by wolves. I'm not even exaggerating. This was a city apartment, so I'm quite sure there were no wolves. Most of the furniture was knocked over, boxes everywhere. No clear delineation between laundry, food and garbage. 5. She was one of the cutest girls I met online and we had a nice dinner. Then she asked if I wanted to meet up with her friends for more drinks down the street. I thought that was fine. It seemed like a good sign she wanted to keep hanging out. However, she didn't say another word to me the rest of the night. Once we met up with them, I just sat and listened to their conversation for an hour, then awkwardly left. 6, she ordered an obnoxious amount of expensive food while I barely ate one order. She then passed me the Bill thinking I was dumb, flagged the waiter and asked them to rewrite the order as separate bills, paid for mine and left her there. 7. He chewed with his mouth open and talked with a mouthful of food. He chugged his drink and then asked if I was going to finish mine. It was half full and I planned on finishing it. I was so grossed out that I let him finish mine so the date would end quicker. 8. We were at a restaurant that he visits a lot, so he knew the workers well and was friendly with the bartender who seemed interested in him. Halfway through the date, after talking to the bartender a few times, he flat out asked her on a date in front of me. She was a little confused since he was there with me but said yes. I was sitting there like, um, okay, this is awkward. Before she left to go take care of other customers, he goes, hahaha, I'm just messing with you. You're definitely not my type. And she looked so sad and upset. She was such a sweet and gorgeous girl. So that was super confusing. When she walked away, he was like, I only like girls like you. not sure if he was trying to prove to me that other girls are into him or just messing with someone to mess with them. But I hated it so much. 9. She was absolutely horrible to the wait staff, just a straight up dismissive, entitled person to the girl who had to serve us. I power through the meal, left that girl a 75% tip for the trouble and never called that woman again.

I once had an ex come to me in the middle of the night saying she wanted to run away with me. Everything she did was monitored by her family. So to appear out of nowhere was a huge surprise by itself. During that time, I realised how vulnerable she was and how much she loved and needed me in ways that no relationship should hopefully ever have to experience. And I couldn't have ever conceived in my wildest dreams as a random boy growing up in the Pacific Northwest, this was literally, I have no future with my family and I am a commodity to my family. The next day, her uncle came to my parents door. They didn't know where I lived, so probably a tracking app or something similar. She was taken away and sent to India after they realized she was in a relationship with a boy that they hadn't first approved of. I'd send her a bedtime story or a few paragraphs of love and affirmation every few days when she got back. We tried, but she was changed and defeated and broke up. 2. I was in the hospital after emergency surgery complications from a C section the week before. My now ex husband wouldn't answer my calls. Finally, my doctor called from the hospital phone and he answered. She told him what was happening and He said, call me if she doesn't make it and hung up. Later, after surgery, when I was in the most pain of my entire life and scared out of my mind, I called him. He answered and just sat in silence for a minute listening to me cry. Then he said to me, what have I told you about calling me when you're crying? And hung up. Didn't answer the phone for me again for almost a week. That marriage did not last a long time. 3. My ex once casually mentioned that they don't believe in apologizing because they never do anything wrong. That one sentence changed everything. I realized I'd never get accountability or real empathy from them. 4, I had an ex who I thought was totally normal until the first time I was with her in front of her grandparents. She was so rude and then told me afterward that she feels like the elderly are a waste and a drain on families in society. It didn't last long after that. Five, my ex once told me that he hoped my father would pass so I could see what it's like when things aren't handed to you on a silver platter. He said it was easier for me because my dad worked abroad and apparently that meant I had some sort of special advantage in life. I left him after that. 6, my ex partner said that I was too emotional to be around after I found out he dropped my elderly dog off at the vets and told them he was abandoned and put him down. My energy was chaotic after he manipulated me into leaving my house with my children so he could move back in with his new girlfriend two months after we split. 7, you need glasses. She was right. 8, my ex told me that the Dinosaur bones were placed by the creator as a test of faith and there was nothing I could say that would convince him otherwise. Then I realized that any potential children I had with him would likely be taught this by their father. 9, broke up in July. He said he'd pay me back and he still hasn't. Ten, my ex was feeling under the weather and was telling me he needed to get over the counter medication and he had no idea what to get. I was a nurse and recommended something, including how and when he should take it. He scoffed. You're a nurse, a doctor's assistant, not even a pharmacist. I realized he didn't respect me or nurses at all. We broke up a month later. 11, my boyfriend at the time proudly declared that he'd never read a book cover to cover. He was 27. Damn shame.

Friend's mom was sort of weird. She was usually in her bedroom on her computer unless she was in the living room demanding us to paint her nails. Anyways, the rule was to eat before you got there because you wouldn't be fed while there. If you're there while they have dinner, you sit in the living room or my friend's bedroom and wait. Weirdly, this extended to breakfast than any other meal had while I was there, no matter how long I was there. Anyways, I figured out by age 8 that I could go three days max without eating before I passed out and got sent home. 2. I slept over a friend's house in grade school. One time he prepared us a bowl of cereal the next morning for breakfast, not thinking anything of my behavior. I didn't finish the milk. I just never used to. I don't know. He was like, are you are you going to finish that? Me? I don't think so. Him? Does that matter? He panicked. Absolutely panicked. he put it down the toilet before his parents came back into the room. I don't know what the rule was exactly, but based on his reaction, I still feel bad about it. I was like 8. And didn't think now that I'm older I realize his family probably didn't have much and he didn't want them to see anything being wasted 3 the family would just put all the plates on the floor for the dog to lick clean before putting them back in the cupboard 4 when I was around 8 I went to a friend's house for a playdate slash dinner after school when I asked for a drink her mom gave me a baby bottle with squash in it I laughed but she didn't laugh back my friend took her own bottle and started drinking I asked the mom if I could please have a cup instead but she told me no and that children drink from bottles in their house never went there again. 5 I I went to see a college friend over the summer stayed the night her parents weren't home when I got there and we went into the living room to talk there were 4 recliners no couch or other chairs she sat in one recliner I sat in another she asked what are you doing and informed me I was sitting in her dad's chair the remaining chairs belonged to her mom and brother where was I supposed to sit on the floor? 6 they yelled at me for not letting the cat that was walking around on the table eat from my plate I love cats but what in the world apparently gently nudging the cat Away from my food was interfering with the freedom of another sentient being. I was 12. I think I was pretty freaked out. Seven, when I was a kid, my friend's dad made his kids line up on the couch and just sit there silently while they watch TV and sip. If you were visiting, you had to do it too. When my mom heard about it, I wasn't allowed to go over there when he was home. My mom knew a weirdo's behavior when she saw it. Eight, I had a friend who instead of washing the dishes after a meal, just put them straight back in the cupboard. I thought his parents would freak out, but it turns out it was just something they did in their house. Whenever I went over, I always made sure to eat beforehand. 9, my friend must ask his father before he is allowed to eat anything in their house. One time our group of friends wanted to go out on a Friday night. We asked if he could come and our friend said he was grounded. We asked him what he did this time and he responded, I ate a bowl of cereal when my dad wasn't home. Probably the saddest thing I've ever heard someone get grounded for. And if I went over to eat dinner with them, I was given the options of water, bottled water, mineral water or milk. I would say milk, but apparently when you say Milk, that translates to a glass of water. 11. Don't put keys on the table. Superstition that supposedly brings bad luck. I guess I have terrible luck. Been doing it all my life.

One, I have to give pretty bad news on a frequent basis. Most people know it's coming. During my last week in residency, I had to tell a mother that her daughter wasn't going to make it. She came in talking the night before and had surgery for a life threatening problem. We thought she would make it. After halfway through the day, her vitals and labs took a nose dive and it was obvious that our efforts had only temporized her, but we lost. She was intubated and peaceful, but she was young and had two small kids. We have all seen the TV drama style screams, pounding on the table, begging for someone to do something, sobbing. When it's reality, it's so much harder. Her mom was crying on the floor asking me to take her organs to save her daughter. I'm not emotional, but that day wrecked me. I went to the bar after with my attending and we didn't talk. I try not to think about it. 2 er DOC, I just had a young lady brought in. She was only 22. Her brother came as we were coding her chest compressions. We had done everything and there was no bringing her back. I asked if he wanted to be in the room when we stopped and he said yes. His reaction was heartbreaking. Screamed and cried and then Picked up her body and whispered in her ear, I love you so much, you're my best friend. And just held her and kept saying, I love you. All the staff had to take a moment after that. I'll never forget them. 3, telling a very young patient that their condition, which was assumed to be curable through surgery, was in fact not so because it had spread to the brain. It was a rare condition that rarely spreads and that rarely affects younger people. Some people get all the terrible luck in the world. The patient was remarkably stoic, but one of the parents lost it. The tears, wailing, pleading and breakdown aren't anything I'll forget. The rage against the system, the accusations, I must be wrong, and then the pleading and tears again. I think it's the fact I took their hope away from them. There is no happy ending to this story, but I'm the one who had to tell them. Years later, I can still see their face and grief. It's burnt into my memory. And it took a while to accept that perhaps trying so hard to forget would disrespect the patient's memory. I'm trained to deliver bad news and do it regularly. This one remains one of the only times where a case utterly emotionally broke me. Four, a patient of mine I hadn't seen in forever came to emerge because he couldn't manage at home, was too weak and losing weight. Blue collar Guy, I took one look at the 50 pound weight loss on him and knew, DOC, I think I'm on the way out. He said, not going to lie to you. I'm worried about that too, I said. Five, not a doctor, but a midwife. Whenever a pregnant patient comes in with reduced movement, I hold my breath until we find the Houdini's heartbeat. But sometimes it's not there. The gut wrenching cry of a parent being that there is no heartbeat is unmistakable. It gets me every time. 6. I told a woman that her husband wasn't going to make it and I didn't know why and probably couldn't do anything to prevent it. She thanked me and later sent a card after her husband passed. I hope she's doing okay. 7. Nurse here. I once stood in the hall and listened while a surgeon told a 22 year old girl that after weeks of trying, the only option left was to amputate her leg. The sound the girl made will never leave me. 8. Probably the one that stands out is telling a young dad that his wife and baby passed in a road transport accident. I think it was the whimpering, soft crying that got me got out of critical care. After too many of those types of situations. It was wearing me down. 9. Patience. Mom, are you telling me that I am going to lose my son today? Me? Yes.

It's just work wise that doesn't really equate over that would easily take me 6 hours minimum to accomplish on top of all of the product that I would need to lighten you from scalp to ends and then all of the colour on top of that for each individual rainbow colour. Okay. To put it in simpler terms, if someone were to come to you and they took up six hours of your time, what would you charge? Probably like 12 dollars, right? Right. And while I do totally understand that your work is permanent, I just don't really think that what you're offering is fair for the amount of work time and effort that I would be putting into your service. Wow. You know, this is giving stuck up. I didn't even actually need a hair stylist. I have one that I already go to, but I saw a video of yours from a long time ago talking about trading services and I figured that I would shoot my shot because you seemed like a girls girl. Okay. And I also didn't need a tattoo artist. I have several that I am very loyal to that have done my entire body. You're the one who offered and I'm telling you that I Do not accept your offer because what you're offering is not fair. You're delusional. Bye bye. You just missed out on a really great opportunity. You too. Cause I'm kind of good at rainbows.

How can I help you? Hi, I know that this is super random and you have no idea who I am, but I was just wondering, do you actually trade services? Yeah, I absolutely trade services. What is it that you do? What are you wanting to trade? This is so exciting. Okay, okay, so I'm a tattoo artist and obviously I know that you have a lot of ink so I was just wondering if you could give me some really cool vivid hair in exchange for a tattoo 1,000% I would love to walk around with an amazing tattoo and I would love for you to walk around with some amazing hair. Uh, you scratch my back I scratch yours but just out of curiosity, do you have an Insta like a portfolio that I can look at and see your work you know, see if it aligns with the kind of work that I get done? I got you. It's blah blah blah blah blah blah. One second I'm looking you up now I'm gonna put you on speaker. Oh, wow, you are very, very talented. Okay, yeah, absolutely. So are you you wanting like all over vivid or you wanting a peekaboo? What do you wanna work out? So I am brunette right now and my hair is long but from roots to ends I want to be rainbow all over like streaks of every single color Of the rainbow, and I want it all rainbow, so you'd have to lighten me all over. And in exchange, I would give you a quarter size flash tattoo, but it is my own personal flash. The amount of work that I would be doing on you does not equate to the size of tattoo that you're offering me.

Um, she needs to be blond, a new mother. Okay. And to bring you to my last question, the most awkward of them. I'm sorry. How young? Well, well, I guess how old do the children have to be for you to apply color on their hair? I believe 10 years old is the youngest that we go. And below that we just do, um, clip in or tape in extensions for the little ones that they can have fun. Well, that's just not true. I've seen so many children do it on those pageant shows. I mean, we typically don't. I guess I could check with management. Can I ask the age real quick before, you know, I go ask? I'm sure that she'll wanna know. So she six. Okay. So you wanna get your six year old some highlights for a pageant? No, she's six months. That's too young for a pageant. Did you just say six months? Okay, so here's the thing. My husband and I are, we are both very blond, very Nordic looking. And she came out brunette and he thinks that I've been cheating. He's ready to divorce me. I don't know. Ma'am, there's no way on God's green earth that you will ever find a salon that will put bleach on a 6 month old's hair. is there a safe brand I can get from Sally's I don't know what to do. Um, I don't know. You could get a DNA test. That's much safer. You, what was your name again? Nope. The last place already threatened me with police.

I've already got the fade done. You have too much product in the top of your hair for me to be able to cut it and get a comb through it. So once I have that washed out, we'll connect the top to the sides and then you'll be on your way. Oh no, you are not going to be bent over him with your chest in his face while you massage his head just so that you can bring him back here and continue to play with his hair. You know what? Here, what are you doing? I'm giving you the shear so that you can finish your boyfriend's hair because it is clear that no one who shares the same anatomy as you should be touching him unless it is you. So next time, either take him to a barber or do it yourself. Well, could you just finish? No, because you have been rude to me since the beginning and I have tried to brush it off, but it makes absolutely no sense to come to a hair salon and get mad at a hair stylist for doing hair. Okay? And if I was the man stealing woman that you've already decided I am in your head, I would be pretty stupid to do it right in front of your face considering you're probably the one who's gonna be paying me and tipping me, probably not tipping me because any tip That he would give me would be perceived as flirting by you, right? So either you finish it or you get out. Come on, babe. We'll go somewhere else. I just wanted a haircut.

I sure do. Um, I actually have like the next 55 minutes open. If he's close, is he allowed to bring someone back there with him? Yeah, you know, whenever he gets here, he is more than welcome to have someone accompany with him for his haircut. We do ask that it stays limited to one guest per person though, just cause it's a small building. Great. One second. Hello. Yeah, they have an opening so you can come inside now. By the way, I asked her if I could come back there with you guys while she cuts your hair and she said yes. So, hey, I'm here to get my haircut. I'm with her. Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna be the one doing your hair. Nice to meet you. Why did you hang up on me? Cause we're in the same building. We can talk to each other like face to face.
