A man marked as extremely dangerous gets brought on board. His face stays covered by a dark cloth. Chains wrap around him, layer after layer. He gets placed alone in the last row. No one dares to move close to him. A tooth with a wire attached slips from his mouth. His fingers find it. He starts working on the lock. His movements stay steady like he knows what comes next, like he waits for an impact. Already set in motion, the engine catches fire. In the next moment, the pilot looks for the nearest place to bring the plane down. They land in a valley in Alaska. I take my team and fly a helicopter toward the rising smoke. That place becomes the landing site. I find the only surviving Marshall. His eyes lose all vision. I ask him what happened. He says an inmate broke free. He tampered with the plane. The marshal has no idea who that man was. He only remembers the plane changing course to an air base, then taking on that mysterious inmate. Agent Sid arrives with two investigators. I try to get a clear explanation from her. She calls it a classified operation and keeps everything sealed. I say the name havlock. She finally speaks. She says havlock is a planted defector trained by the agency. I head to the hospital. My wife is there taking care of the blind marshal. Back at the Command post staff bring a file. Sid studies the photos. Inside, she notices a body in a prison jumpsuit. That is not an inmate. The truth hits me in that moment. Havelock stays right in front of us. He is the Marshall pretending to be injured. I call my wife immediately. Not a guard. He's a prisoner. Get out of the building. I'm on my way, sir.

Finally, the big dog slicked the entire floor with olive oil. The trap was set. Moments later, the furious kidnappers stormed back inside. The little dog barked to lure them deeper, then bolted away just as they lunged. One of the men reached out and grabbed what he thought was the small dog, but it was the boss's long hair.

Indianapolis trucker David Howington visits this truck stop everyday. Along South Harding at 4:65. And he says the prostitutes were getting bolder by the day. Other truckers told police A 14 year old girl. Girl has been among those working this truck stop. So officers tracked her down over the weekend. They say she denied being a part of it. But her 19 year old sister, Jodi Kinslow, went to jail. She's charged with trespassing. And police say she's been arrested for prostitution in the past. Even while our cameras were out here, we saw women that truckers identify as regular prostitutes. Going door to door. And police have called in C P S. To investigate their family.

En ese momento, las imágenes de vigilancia mostraron de repente un par de ojos y todos se pusieron inmediatamente en alerta. Sin embargo, el monstruo parecía poseer una inteligencia extremadamente alta. Observaba fijamente a la cabra dentro de la jaula, pero nunca atacaba. Justo cuando los cazadores comenzaban a impacientarse, el monstruo se sumergió en el agua, preparándose para abandonar el lugar. Los cazadores dispararon de inmediato. Aunque las balas dieron en el objetivo, el monstruo finalmente logró escapar. Al día siguiente. El grupo volvió al lugar y descubrió que la cabra dentro de la jaula había desaparecido. Extrañamente, la jaula de hierro seguía intacta sin un solo daño, y las imágenes de vigilancia también estaban misteriosamente dañadas. Todos se dieron cuenta de inmediato de que capturar a este monstruo no sería tarea fácil. En ese momento, el anciano disparó un tiro y les dijo a todos que reajustaran el cebo y se prepararan para intentar capturar a la presa nuevamente. Sin embargo, cuando llegó la noche y todos estaban en máxima alerta, un niño de repente se metió gateando dentro de la jaula de hierro.

You're probably gonna skip it this year after you hear what just happened. An undercover investigation into Butterball Turkeys, where you normally get your Turkey for Thanksgiving, just revealed some terrible things that they do to the turkeys before they end them, before the Turkey ends up looking like this on your Thanksgiving table. Apparently, the Turkey goes through some absolutely terrible things, mainly at the Butterball plant.

His Vital Energy orb had disappeared. It had accidentally rolled down a hallway and ended up in the hands of a curious young boy. Before the robot could react, the boy hopped onto a school bus and the vehicle pulled away. The robot sprinted after it, but just as he was closing the distance, his battery dipped into the last sliver of power. All he could do was watch helplessly as the orb vanished into the school ground. Determined to retrieve it, he tried walking into the school, but the security guards stopped him on the spot. Not ready to give up, he attempted to climb the fence, only to get caught again. With his energy level sinking to a critical 1%, he desperately searched for a solution until he spotted a nearby electric car dealership. Taken for a customer, the friendly manager welcomed him with open arms. The robot scanned the showroom and immediately noticed a fully charged electric vehicle. He rushed toward it, but his power gave out just as he reached the door, causing him to freeze midstep. The manager, completely unaware of the robot's true nature, thought he was inspecting the bottom of the car and praised his attention to detail. Seeing no response, the manager helped him into the vehicle and sat beside him, launching into a full sales pitch. While the manager rambled on, the robot quietly unplugged the car's Charging cable and inserted it into his own power socket. Electricity surged through the line as he discreetly absorbed energy, pretending to be captivated by the car's interior. But the moment the car's battery drained dry, it's the confused manager blamed his employees for forgetting to charge it. Meanwhile, the robot quickly disconnected the cable, slipped into the next vehicle, and started charging himself again. One by one, the showroom cars went dark as he drained each of them, using every fully charged vehicle as a makeshift power station. For this robot, nothing mattered more than recovering that missing energy orb. And he was willing to drain an entire dealership if that's what it took.

Instead, she fixated on his worn out shoes, his toes peeking through the fabric. A flicker of disdain flashed across her eyes before she turned toward a student wearing polished leather shoes. Jason enlightened us, he said. He slowly lowered his hand. He understood everything without hearing a word. At lunch, the classroom filled with the smell of fried chicken. He didn't even dare look. But one boy noticed him anyway. What's wrong? Can't even afford a piece of bread? The bully smirked and tossed a piece of chicken skin onto the floor in front of him. He clenched his fists, swallowing the anger boiling inside him. His mother had always told him, don't fight, but the taunts kept coming. George Foreman, more like George, poor man. It's Foreman, he muttered. What's that? Poor man, the boy mocked again. Something snapped. He stood up. The bully didn't budge. Your name's fool. Now say it. Say my name! That was the last straw. The fight cost him everything. He was expelled, labeled a troublemaker, pushed out onto the streets with nothing but anger and shame. Until one night, a TV commercial caught his eye. A vocational training program promising a fresh start. For the first time in a long time, he felt a direction. He told his mother his decision. She looked at him with tired eyes and whispered, promise me no more fighting. On his first day at the new school, someone grabbed his bag. He nearly erupted again, but he forced himself to breathe and opened his suitcase. Inside lay a pair of brand new shoes and a handwritten note from his mother leave your past behind. Walk towards something better. The next morning, the shoes were gone. Panicked, he ran across campus until he saw them on someone else's feet.

Drawn to the Grace and precision, he secretly slipped into the dance studio. But before he could blend in, the instructor spotted him. Embarrassed, he turned to leave until the teacher tossed a pair of ballet shoes at his feet and calmly told him to stay. From that moment, his journey began. During practice, the teacher lifted his toes, examined his posture, and declared he had the natural build of a dancer. After class, she invited him to join the official program. But when he brought the news home, his father shut down the idea immediately. Refusing to give up, he lied to his father, secretly enrolled and trained every day with relentless determination. Even on his walk home, he repeated the movements again and again, falling deeper in love with ballet. But the truth didn't stay hidden forever. One afternoon, his father burst into the studio. After scolding him in front of everyone, he dragged the boy out and shouted that ballet wasn't manly. Heartbroken, the boy ran into the street and kicked a billboard just to vent his anger.

But his father confronted him again. This time, the boy didn't shrink back. He stood tall and danced boldly right in front of His father. Father fell silent. No yelling, no anger. Only a single question. How much is the audition fee? $2,000, the teacher answered. The father hesitated, then sold his late wife's jewelry. Days later, he took his son to London for the audition. Standing before the panel, the boy was so nervous, he stumbled through steps and fumbled his answer. When they returned home, both felt defeated until the postman arrived. A letter was placed on the table. His father, too anxious to speak, watched as the boy carried it to his room. Moments later, he burst out with the news he had been accepted.

After that, they pushed me into a giant oven, laid me down neatly inside, then slowly close the oven door, turn the key to start the switch and set the temperature to 200 degrees. After 30 minutes, they opened it again. This can shrink a normal human 2,000 times smaller in an instant. To solve the problem of overpopulation, a scientist developed a shrinking technology that can shrink a person down to just 10 centimeters tall. They eat less and live in tiny houses. The trash they produce in four years is less than what normal people throw away in a day. And the best part, $10,000 in the real world equals 10 million here. A huge mansion of 10,000 square meters only cost 99 bucks. As a poor man, I was tempted. The next day, my wife and I came to visit the miniature world for the procedure. But before shrinking, they had to shave off all our hair, then knock out all our teeth, because teeth can't shrink. If not removed, they would crush our heads. Then we were pushed into the giant oven. Thirty minutes later, a group of nurses came in with small carts. They carefully scooped us up with tiny shovels and gently placed us on little beds. When I woke up, I quickly lifted the blanket, seeing my little buddy still there. I sighed in relief. But then my Wife called. She changed her mind while shaving her eyebrows. She didn't go through with the shrinking procedure. Hearing that, I completely broke down because the process is irreversible. I went alone to the miniature world, heartbroken. Everything there looked just like the real world. Then I arrived at my giant mansion. But soon I received a delivery. It was a 50 karat diamond ring for my wife and a divorce paper as big as my house asking me to sign it. That's when I knew I could never satisfy her again.

Ecstatic senior consultants raid the archive, dismantling a priceless century old ivory satin gown, tearing it apart to be reborn. Southern bride candy is held hostage by her best friend's opinions. Necklines encrusted with heirloom diamonds are dismissed as outdated. Skirts laden with Phoenix feathers scorned as extravagant. When the consultant unveils that rebellious masterpiece dyed midnight blue, the fitting room falls into dead silence. Blind bride Shayla's fingers sink into the swamp of Italian silk, trembling upon touching the secret embroidery of the 37th gown. This is the love symbol she last saw before losing her sight. With 30 minutes left, the alteration room echoes with electric cutters and in turn stumbles while carrying crystal bead chains. A mother sobs in the hallway. As the clock hits zero, Kevin slips into the deconstructed jumpsuit. Candy breaks free from her friend's grip. Shayla clutches the crumpled silk. Three silhouettes bloom simultaneously in the mirrors, not perfect bridal specimens, but living beings reborn within their wedding attire.

Your marriage dying. That's not bigotry. That's being human. Everyone else is performing. My sister in law posted on Facebook that I'm the exact reason LGBTQ people stay closeted, because of unsupportive spouses who make everything about themselves. 43 people liked it.

Why? Your pain doesn't invalidate their truth. I'm not mad she's gay. I'm destroyed.

Savannah's moving into our guest room. Not our house, the house I'm still paying the mortgage on. Just typically into one of our four bedrooms. Like I'm supposed to be fine. With this new roommate situation, I asked Stephanie if she was serious. She said Savannah doesn't have anywhere else to go right now, and it's not like we're using that room anyway. I'm staying at a La Quinta Inn near the airport. It smells like cigarettes and the Wi-Fi barely works. Haley texted me this morning asking when I'm coming home because this is ridiculous and embarrassing. She has friends asking why her dad moved out the second her mom came out. Connor sent me a Bill split request on Venmo for his textbooks with the note, since you're not contributing to the household anymore. I paid for his entire college tuition, all four years, up front. My wife moved her girlfriend into my house six days after ending our marriage at Olive Garden.

If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point, I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I, I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart, now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared. Of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he Was going to take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe.

Back in high school, this guy named Brandon made my life absolute hell. For two years straight, he would knock my books out of my hands, trip me in the hallway, and steal my lunch money while laughing with his buddies. The worst part was, we used to be actual friends in middle school before he decided being popular was more important. He started hanging with the jocks, and suddenly I was his favorite target. Every single day, he found new ways to embarrass me. Once he poured chocolate milk on my white shirt right before my presentation in English class. Another time, he took my gym clothes and threw them in the toilet. Teachers never did anything because his dad donated money to the school. I spent those two years just trying to survive and stay invisible. After graduation, I moved three hours away for college and never looked back at all. Contact with everyone from that town started fresh. Made real friends. Got my degree in accounting. Life was actually good for once. Then last month, I was visiting my parents for Thanksgiving weekend. My mom wanted to order pizza for dinner because she was too tired to cook. She pulled up this app and ordered from the local pizza place. When the doorbell rang 30 minutes later, I opened it without thinking. Standing there in a greasy pizza delivery uniform holding our pepperoni and cheese was Brandon His face went pale when he recognized me. I just stood there frozen. He looked rough. His hair was thinning, he had bags under his eyes, and that confident smirk he always wore was completely gone. Hey, man, he said quietly, handing me the pizza boxes, that'll be 23 50. I could tell he was praying I wouldn't say anything. His hands were actually shaking a little as he held out the card reader. For a second I almost felt bad, but then I remembered the chocolate milk, the toilet, gym clothes, the two years of constant humiliation. So I pulled out my wallet and handed him a hundred dollar Bill. Keep the change, I said, loudly enough for my mom to hear from the kitchen. His eye

I forwarded it to Catherine immediately. Catherine's response was swift. She filed a motion citing the judge's order about medical appointments requiring both parents consent. Within hours, my ex backtracked, claiming she'd made an error with the dates. Friday arrived with my usual pickup time. I sat in my car outside my ex's house watching the clock. Four PM came and went, no sign of the kids. I texted through the app, keeping everything documented. No response. At 4:30, I knocked on the door. My ex answered with a fake surprised expression. She claimed the kids were at a friend's birthday party and she'd forgotten to tell me. I asked for the address. She said she'd have to check and get back to me. I waited in my car documenting everything Catherine had warned me about these games. Stay calm, follow the process. Don't give them ammunition. An hour later, my ex emerged with the kids. They walked slowly, heads down, my daughter gripping her brother's hand. The drive to my house was silent. Jake stared out the window while my daughter clutched her backpack like a shield. At home, they went straight to their room without the usual excitement about weekend activities, made their favorite dinner, hoping to ease the tension. They picked at their food, exchanging worried glances when I asked about school. They gave one word answers. When I suggested a movie, they shook their heads. That night, I heard crying from their room. I found Jake curled up in his sister's bed, both of them trembling. I sat on the floor beside them, not wanting to crowd their space. Eventually, my daughter was.

My twin sister Emma always got the compliments. Same face, same hair, same everything. But somehow I was the backup copy. Teachers would say things like, oh, you're Emma's sister when they met me. Boys would ask me to introduce them to Emma. Even our own grandma would mix up our names, then correct herself and say, oh, wait, you're the other one. The worst part was picture day in 7th grade. Mom made us wear matching blue dresses because she thought it would be adorable. We stood next to each other for the twin photo. And when the photographer looked through his camera, he actually moved me behind Emma. This way the lighting hits better, he said. I knew what he meant. Emma never noticed how differently people treated us. He'd bounce into rooms and everyone would light up. I'd follow behind and get polite smiles. When we turned 16, Dad took us car shopping. The salesman spent the whole time talking to Emma about features and colors. He asked me if I was getting a car, too, like I was just there for the ride. That summer, everything changed when Emma left for cheerleading camp. For two weeks, I was just me. I started wearing my hair differently, bought clothes Emma would never pick. Actually talk to people instead of letting her do all the talking. When Marcus from my chemistry class asked Me to hang out. I couldn't believe he was talking to me and not waiting for Emma to show up. We went to the movies and got burgers after he kept staring at me and I thought maybe something was wrong with my makeup. Finally he said, you know, you're way more interesting than your sister. I nearly choked on my drink. Emma's pretty.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives, but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly, poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rihanna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a made outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

When did you realise you were living in a bubble and not like everyone else? I thought every kid had their birthdays planned by event coordinators. Until I was 13, every April, my parents would rent out country clubs or these fancy rooftop venues downtown. They'd hire magicians, ice cream trucks, face painters, and once even this guy who brought parrots that could talk. I'm talking like 60 kids from school showing up, tables covered in those fancy cloth things, waiters walking around with little appetizers on trays. But here's the weird part. None of the kids ever stayed long. Like they'd show up, eat some cake, watch the magic show for maybe an hour, then their parents would collect them and they'd leave. And nobody ever brought me actual presents, just these white envelopes that my mom would grab and stuff into her purse before I could even see what was inside. I didn't think it was strange back then. Figured that's just how birthdays worked. The envelopes probably had money or gift cards or something, right? And maybe other kids just had smaller parties because their parents weren't as organised as mine. Then in 7th grade, this kid, Jake, from my math class, invited me to his birthday party. I was actually pretty excited because Jake was cool and I wanted to be friends with him. My mom dropped me off at this public park and I was confused because there was no Ballet or anything, just regular parking spots. When I found Jake's party, my brain basically short circuited. There was one folding table with a plastic tablecloth, hot dogs cooking on this little portable grill and a cooler full of sodas. No servers, no fancy decorations, just balloons tied to the table legs. Get this, there was one soccer ball. That was it for entertainment. But all the kids were laughing their heads off. They were playing tag, kicking the soccer ball around and having these intense conversations about video games and t V shows. Everyone had wrapped presents, actual gifts and colourful paper with ribbons and stuff. Jake opened each one and got genuinely excited about things like Pokemon cards and a new skateboard. The party lasted four hours. Four hours. And nobody wanted to leave. Parents had to literally drag their kids away because it was.

Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform, learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments, and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes. Bro, we might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humor, same jokes, same energy. And the best part? When you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about. Yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement.

You're still here? Oh, yeah. I was on my way out, and then I saw these cheeks. So cute. Oh, we don't touch the baby because we don't know where those hands have been. Alex does. Okay, so, um, I have a meeting with Owen, so I'm off. Party is at eight. Don't be late. I need 800 bucks. Told you. If you're dumb enough to buy groceries, I'm gonna eat them. No, not for groceries. For a security deposit. We'll lose that on a really great three bedroom if we don't get it to the landlord today. Now you wanna live with me? No. You're gross and a pig and a skank magnet. And you leave your dirty boy socks everywhere. Keep going this way, and you'll wind up old and alone, wandering the streets with some ancient form of civilist.

Luego fui atado a un armazón de hierro y otra dosis fue inyectada profundamente en mi médula ósea. El dolor irrumpió de inmediato en mi columna, pero apreté los dientes y soporté el dolor porque sabía que ese era el precio de volverme más fuerte. La transformación fue un éxito. Superé los límites de un ser humano normal, pero cuando fui a desafiar a Hulk uno contra uno. Como era de esperarse, Hulk me pateó de una sola patada y salí volando. Sufrí múltiples fracturas con minutas por todo mi cuerpo. Gracias al suero del supersoldado, me recuperé rápidamente. Para vengarme de Hulk, volví a inyectarme una dosis aún más alta, pero la sobrecarga desencadenó una mutación. Incluso crecieron espinas óseas en mi espalda. Encontré de inmediato a banner con la esperanza de provocar a Hulk y terminar todo de una vez. Pero sin importar cuánto lo provocara, Hulk se negó a salir como si ni siquiera me viera como un oponente digno. La humillación y la rabia inundaron mi mente, llevándome completamente a la locura. Después de que banner fue capturado, apunté con un arma al doctor Blue y lo obligué a inyectar en mi cuerpo la muestra de sangre de Hulk. Sin ninguna duda. El doctor Blue activó el dispositivo gamma, replicando por completo la mutación de banner. Un destello verde iluminó mi frente. Mi cuerpo comenzó a retorcerse y deformarse rápidamente. La combinación del supersuero y la radiación gamma finalmente completé la mutación. Me convertí en un monstruo. Impulsado por la ira abominación, empujé al doctor Blue a un lado, me lancé a las calles abarrotadas, liberando mi furia sin ninguna restricción. La gente huyó aterrorizada. Los soldados me dispararon cohetes, pero mi defensa era abrumadoramente fuerte. Las explosiones no podían herirme en absoluto. Las tropas retrocedieron aterradas en vehículos blindados y aún con todo el poder de fuego, no pudieron escapar de su destino. Los aplasté como si fueran latas de metal. Al ver las imágenes borrosas de vigilancia, banner comprendió la verdad, solo Hulk podía detenerme, pero yo acababa de tomar el antídoto que significaba que Hulk solo aparecería bajo un estrés extremo. Así que, después de despedirse de su novia, banner saltó del avión sin dudarlo. El impacto formó un enorme cráter. Hulk volvió a levantarse de entre los escombros. Mi batalla final había comenzado

They have targeted this plump duck, but not to drag it back as a feast. Instead, they're going to throw it off a cliff 5 km away. These ants work together in perfect coordination to move the duck away, even crossing mountains and valleys to get rid of it. It turns out that this duck, which was camping on the mountain, had offended a worker ant. It saw the little ant dragging a giant bean and became very curious. The duck used its finger to poke the lone ant to test it, but it underestimated the little creature's strength. So the duck started playing pranks. It threw a thermos flask on top of the ant. The ant persisted. Then it piled fruits and vegetables on top of it. The ant wobbled, but still wasn't crushed. Push the ant to its limits. This jerk set up obstacles, but the resilient little creature got through them. The duck wouldn't give up. Its crazy ideas kept coming. It even made the ant walk a tightrope. The ant was now swaying terribly, even with its skills, couldn't handle the duck's tricks and was crushed on the spot. This despicable behavior made the ant furious. The duck showed no sympathy and even laughed. Seeing how enormous the duck was, the ant could only leave helplessly, but it was reluctant to give up so much food, so it excitedly ran back to the nest, not wanting to miss out on this. Treat, but the colony hadn't eaten cake in a long time. They thought the ant was lying. It wasn't until the ant went crazy and started swaying that it caught the captain's attention. They hadn't eaten fresh food in ages. Hearing about something delicious, the leader was motivated and sounded the alarm. Then the ant army poured out like it was in full combat mode. The oblivious duck was still snoring. The scout team arrived at the scene and climbed up the basket to start working, but the duck rolled over and blocked them. No big deal. Strength and numbers aren't just talk. Through teamwork, they can accomplish anything wild. So they dragged the duck over hills and other obstacles trying to get rid of it. The simple goal was to shake it off and steal its food. The duck finally woke up in a rage. It angrily charged up from the bottom of the cliff to the top. Seeing its food being stolen, it flew into a fury. But these ants moved so fast that the duck always failed. Their teamwork was perfect. Every move was planned but unexpected, like killer tactics, especially when they scored a 3 pointer against an amateur. The duck went crazy trying to grab it. The next second, it lost its shirt, too. The enraged duck grabbed firecrackers. Even with its claws torn, it was determined to catch those ants. But finally, due to the explosion, the duck fell off the cliff again.

Not only was it difficult to pull, but it also couldn't maintain balance. The bear crashed severely on his first attempt to pull the car. Then he switched the positions of the wheels, but one side was still larger than the other. Eventually, he crashed again. This time, the car even fell apart. Looking at all the scattered debris, the bear suspected he was too stupid. Perhaps he should give up on making cars. But just after the bear left, several small animals happened to pass by this place. The scattered parts caught their attention. There was no possibility of repairing it. After such a crash, the wheels seemed like they could be repurposed. Several animals prepared to take away these wheels to avoid being thought of as stealing. The hedgehog specifically asked the magpie nearby if anyone wanted this small car. The magpie clearly said it had been abandoned. So they confidently pushed the wheels toward home. But when crossing a log bridge, the largest wheel accidentally fell into the water. The frog quickly jumped in to rescue it. Fortunately, the wood could float on the water surface. He pushed it all the way to the shore. With the help of several animals, they finally brought the wheels back home. Meanwhile, the magpie actually ran to the bear's home to tell on them, saying, someone had stolen your car. The bear was very Angry after hearing this. Although the car wasn't well made, he hadn't completely given up. He wanted to know who had taken it. The bear rushed forward recklessly. As a result, in his hurry, he accidentally fell into the river. This made him even more furious. Soon the bear found the home of those animals. He was about to show his violent side when he was shocked by what he saw. The B had turned the wheel into a spinning machine, making weaving much more efficient. The hedgehog had made the wheel into a small cart, making it very easy to transport things. The frog had turned the wheel into a water fetching tool, making drinking water much more convenient. The largest wheel had been made into a water wheel by the rooster. Seeing all this, the bear instantly transformed from extreme rage to excitement. He was very happy that everyone could make so many useful things. Bear greatly admired them. The hedgehog said the bear was also amazing. The wheels he made were actually quite useful. The bear was very pleased after hearing this. Since the animals liked his wheels so much, the bear specially cut a piece of wood to make wheels. The small animals around all came to take advantage of the free materials. With just simple processing, the beavers made a car. Though it was entirely powered by legs, it could actually be used as a tractor. The squirrels used the wheels to make an elevator. There was a pulley for the rope on top and a driving mechanism on the bottom, combined with a basket. As the squirrels in the driving mechanism ran, the basket slowly rose up like an elevator. From then on, they no longer had to climb trees to get home. With the bear's wheels, all the surrounding animals were very happy. Only the magpie came again to sow discord. Asking the bear how he did all the work, he said they were all bullying the bear. The kind hearted bear had already seen through the magpie's true nature and told him to leave immediately. As the bear made more and more wheels, even the little rabbit rode a bicycle. Although the bear wasn't skilled at making cars, making wheels was truly beneficial to the entire community.

But the bird also has ways to escape. He uses a clip to pinch his back and slides down. But just as the bird is feeling proud, he doesn't know the cat has already opened his mouth wide, waiting for him. He struggles frantically. Seeing the rope break, the cat panics instantly. He frantically searches for the bird, only to discover the bird has tied him to a rocket. Then the bird lights the fuse. The cat's teeth fly out together with the rocket, so the cat decides to use a honey trap. He brings paint and draws a Tweety Bird on his hand, then paints big eyes and red lips. Then he puts on a hat and places it in the nest. The cat climbs the tree and whistles. Tweety Bird is immediately attracted out, being the cat's finger. Constantly flirting, the bird can't help but fly over. The next second, the cat grabs the bird with his hand. Realizing he's been tricked by the cat, Tweety Bird even wants to escape with his girlfriend. The disguise gets torn off and he immediately sees the truth. Then he switches the hats. The cat lifts the hat and bites his own finger. Only when he sees Tweety Bird flying away does he realize he's been fooled. Then the escaped Tweety bird puts barbed wire on the pole, wanting to get a good sleep. But the cat made a trampoline with an Iron pipe and a straight jacket, and he jumps on it. The awakened Tweety Bird immediately activates the emergency device. Then, when the cat reaches in, he punches him down directly. Then, using the trampoline's elasticity, he continuously attacks the cat. The cat immediately puts on a helmet, but the bird opens the helmet and throws firecrackers inside. The next second, cat is blown up. The cat refuses to give up. This time. He directly builds a birdhouse. Then, while Tweety Bird isn't home, he climbs up the pole in disguise. Before long, Tweety Bird flies back. The cat thinks he's about to succeed and immediately slides to the ground excitedly. But just as he's happily preparing to go home to enjoy his catch, Tweety Bird actually runs to his central nervous system. Seizing this excellent opportunity, the bird immediately pulls the nerves to control the cat. The walking cat's hands and feet suddenly become uncontrollable. Then, like a train starting up, he begins racing rapidly through the streets. Tweety Bird enjoys the speed in the cat's ear. However, he doesn't notice the warning sign. The next second, he makes the cat crash into a wall. You know, I lose more pretty cats that way.

Inmediatamente después, los rotores cambiaron de forma con fluidez, extendiendo poco a poco su estructura desde un estado compacto hasta formar una figura estable en forma de cruz que se elevó rápidamente en el aire. Su objetivo era precisamente el portaaviones estadounidense a 5km de distancia. Pronto, el sistema de alerta temprana del portaaviones detectó la presencia del dron. El capitán levantó de inmediato el telescopio y comenzó a inspeccionar. Al descubrir que se trataba de un dron desconocido, ordenó que todo el barco entrara en modo de combate. Tras recibir la noticia, los buques de guerra ajustaron rápidamente su postura defensiva, listos para entrar en batalla en cualquier momento. La cubierta del portaaviones también estaba en plena actividad. Un caza f 35 ya estaba en posición con la orden del personal en tierra, el f 35 fue lanzado al instante. Al mismo tiempo, el dron misterioso comenzó a cambiar de forma. 24 misiles fueron expulsados desde la parte inferior de la aeronave y rápidamente se dispersaron, fijando su objetivo y comenzando el ataque.

La cáscara del huevo de la criatura explosiva era extremadamente dura. Ya había usado una sierra eléctrica, gastando mucho tiempo antes de lograr hacer una abertura. Pero por dentro era suave, y vio dentro el alienígena. Como si detectara peligro. La larva comenzó a moverse, emitiendo una onda infrasónica, pidiendo ayuda a sus semejantes. El investigador tomó un bisturí. El alienígena sintió el peligro acercarse, y estos no eran humanos, eran humanos biológicos mejorados con tecnología mecánica, y una larva abrasadora de rostro salió para calmarla. Usaron una pistola eléctrica. Lo demás fue sencillo, el organismo de la criatura era blando, fácil de cortar, había que tener cuidado, su sangre era altamente ácida. El propósito de la autopsia era buscar los huevos del alienígena. Parecía un insecto, pero también como un pez. El investigador lo transfirió. Aquí. Había medio lóbulo pulmonar y bajo la nutrición de la carne. En menos de un día creció hasta convertirse en una criatura alienígena. Como una serpiente ya con apariencia de alienígena, pensaron en criarlo como una mascota. Este tamaño era adecuado. Como un híbrido. Ya había simulado ondas sonoras, aprendiendo el lenguaje de la criatura. Tras un de intercambio, se formó un vínculo más allá de las especies. En pocas horas, el alienígena había desarrollado manos y pies, y su agresividad aumentó, pero no había que preocuparse. Se usaba vidrio reforzado especial. Aquí, mientras no hubiera accidentes, el alienígena nunca escaparía. Wendy, quien estaba a Cargo de su cuidado. Ya había aprendido lo básico del idioma alienígena. Podía comunicarse de forma simple. Aunque el alienígena tenía una agresividad extrema, no sería extraño si de vez en cuando mostraba algo de mal temperamento, pero creían que con suficiente paciencia, eventualmente podría ser domesticado. Sin embargo, lo que complicaba las cosas era la velocidad de crecimiento de los alienígenas. En pocas horas ya alcanzaba el tamaño de un adulto. Pero en el laboratorio no solo había esta especie alienígena. Para probar el método de caza de la criatura con ojos, el investigador la encerró junto con una oveja en un espacio cerrado. Aunque parecía pequeña, probablemente no tenía cerebro como tal. Su inteligencia era notablemente alta. Primero evaluaba el nivel de peligro del objetivo y luego atacaba decisivamente en el momento adecuado en los gritos desgarradores de la oveja. En solo unos segundos, la criatura con ojos ya había reemplazado el ojo de la oveja. Desde el exterior, parecía casi idéntico al original, pero el ojo actuaba como el nuevo cerebro, haciendo que se levantara nuevamente claro. Al principio, habría un proceso de adaptación, pero en poco tiempo aprendió que la oveja debía mantenerse en pie sobre 4 patas. El investigador había instalado previamente detectores en la oveja y observando las ondas, ya era difícil determinar qué tipo de criatura era exactamente. Sin embargo, los alienígenas también son seres biológicos y necesitan comer, beber y hacer sus necesidades, normalmente otra sintética

But this time, there was a note stuck to the box. Drink me quickly. With police officers watching her every move, Kelly immediately recognized the familiar handwriting on the note. It belonged to her father, who was now wanted by the authorities. So while the officer monitoring her happened to look down, she gulped the entire yogurt in one breath. No one could have predicted what happened next. After Kelly drove away, the surveillance officer reported the incident to his superiors. Things grew even stranger when the arriving inspector found the yogurt box Kelly had thrown into the trash. Without hesitation, he stuck out his middle finger and used it to scoop out the remaining yogurt, tasting it directly. That seemingly insignificant action would cost the inspector dearly. Meanwhile, shortly after drinking the yogurt, Kelly felt a sudden wave of nausea. Clutching her stomach, she rushed into the women's restroom. And that's when he appeared. It was Kelly's father. But he didn't embrace his long lost daughter. Instead, he immediately located the listening device the police had secretly planted on her and blocked its signal with a jammer to make you nauseous. Nissan, it turned out, had been a CIA operative. Someone capable of predicting a person's prediction. As long as Kelly took the antidote he brought, she'd be completely fine. But without It the consequences would be far beyond anything she could imagine. During their brief reunion, Kelly revealed a shocking truth. After her beloved mother was murdered, her stepfather Jess had suddenly surrounded himself with bodyguards. And the police, framing Neeson as the killer, might have been part of Jess's scheme. Neeson made a dangerous decision to follow Jess's convoy and forced them to reveal the truth behind his ex wife's death. But as he drove along a winding Mountain Road, a large SUV suddenly charged toward him from behind. Though Nissan dodged the first hit, the killer rammed him again, clearly intent on eliminating him. With the car inching closer to the cliff's edge, it seemed there was no way out. The vehicle was reduced to scraps, but the cautious assassin still tossed in a high powered grenade for good measure. Only once the car was engulfed in flames did the attackers drive away confidently. But to everyone's astonishment, Nissan emerged from the slope below alive.

I'm fine. You don't act like you're fine. I said I'm fine. Caden spots an herb growing beside a rock. He quickly walks over and picks it. Then he hands the herb to Boyka, telling him to grind it up when he gets back and rub it on his injured right leg. The reason Caden cares about him goes back to a few days earlier. At that time, they could not stand each other. One wrong word and they almost started swinging. But in the quarter finals, they both delivered impressive performances and advanced smoothly into the final four. Joining them in the semifinals are the Brazilian gymnast and the bearded Colombian. The most outrageous performance still belongs to that bearded guy. Facing the non stop attacks from the North Korean fighter, he stood there without dodging or flinching, took several punches and even interacted with the crowd below. Only after he had his fun did he start fighting back. And of course, the bearded man easily won and entered the semifinals. The four eliminated fighters were supposed to be sent back to their prisons, but instead the guards brought them to a brick Kiln, dump them there casually. Meanwhile, Boyka and the others were still being forced into the quarry for hard labor. And Caden, the non stop talker, even patted Boyka's injured knee. Boyka at this point was already furious, but Caden kept running his mouth beside him, so Boyka punched him straight in. The face. The two immediately started grappling. The guards rushed over and pulled them apart. Then they locked them inside a narrow, dark mineshaft where they were kept for a full day, enduring torture no normal person could stand.

But Leon didn't expect that the other party would directly pull out a pistol. Seeing the seriously injured boy lying on the ground, David was very regretful. It turned out that Leon was once a very friendly child. He often participated in some public welfare activities to help the poor in the community. But some street hooligans regarded him as an oddity. Because this street was filled with a large number of criminals, they thought that everyone should deal drugs. Leon's behaviour made them look like clowns. John not only beat the boy, but also snatched his school bag. Hey, check it out. You think you better than me, nigga? What that that fucking rally? Talking shit about your hood like a fucking snitch, man, leave me alone, yo, I think I better rise up. David showed up in time and drove away those scumbags. Such things happen almost every day on the streets. David believed this young man might be able to change the plight of black people. He decided to protect Leon and teach the boy some fighting skills for self defense. After three months of training, Leon gradually became mature and steady. He even got an admission notice from a prestigious university. When going to register at the school, Leon met John Again. You all that, don't you? You a bitch! I'll beat your bitch ass! Hell, yeah!

The boy's mother fell into a complete breakdown upon seeing her son's body. David also fell into deep self blame because of this incident. The gangs in this neighborhood had just reached a peace agreement. Tommy didn't want to break the peace, but it was too late. To avenge Leon. He ordered his men to find the murderer. As long as they killed John, they could get $20,000. Hey, yo. Hey, bro. Hey, gang, check it out. You mad though, right? Who asked, man, this is

I did my time in the cold bus. They said I could go home. Well, you were misinformed and we'll be taking you back to your old stomping grounds, New York City. For what? Rape and murder. It's taken 25 years, but your past has finally caught up to you. After 25 years on the run, serial killer Brian was finally captured in Miami. Benson arrived to take custody, where she met FBI Agent Dana, who eagerly suggested teaming up to investigate the cold case. During the interrogation, Brian readily admitted to killing the first four victims. However, when asked about the fifth victim, Kira, he denied ever having seen her. She's not even my type. Red hair. I didn't do her. Dana believed Brian was merely making a desperate attempt to cover up the truth as Kira's manner of death mirrored that of the first four victims. However, while Brian's DNA was found in the first four victims bodies, neither DNA nor fingerprints were recovered from Kira's remains. The detectives head to the evidence locker to recheck the case, but the box is empty. The log shows that 10 years ago, a detective took the evidence. With no evidence, Brian stubbornly denied killing Kira and the case reached an impasse. Dana speculated that Brian refused to admit to the crime because Kira had been over two months pregnant when she died. But wait, how did Dana know that? The autopsy didn't Mention it. Dana bursts into the interrogation room and demands to question Brian alone. Using a smooth, almost serpentine voice, she managed to get Brian to confess to the fifth rape murder. Do you remember? I remember. Just as Dana triumphantly declared the case closed, something unexpected occurred.

Not yet. Maybe there's nothing to find. Or maybe no one was trained to know where cops would look. Kelly built this place up from the studs, probably designed a hidey hole we'll never find. Did we do all this? Grace said the walls ripped apart before he came in. Why would Nolan do that? Don't know. Don't care? No. Think about it. Armstrong insists that Nolan tried to kill him. But then why did Nolan leave before the job was done? Why rush back here and tear the walls up? I'll tell you why. It's because he's looking for the evidence, too. Bradford, you see now that's a proper hiding hole for a civilian. You just got done saying Nolan would build something we'd never find. Maybe I overestimated the guy. No. Look, Nolan's a lot of things, but he's not sloppy. He comes in here desperate, rips open the walls, ends up in the bedroom, finds the opening behind the bed filled with whatever Armstrong hit in there. And then what? And then you don't think that's random garbage, do you? No, that's Nolan being smart. He knew he'd find the good, so he chucked him down the hill. Our warrant is for Nolan's property, not the neighbor's. So if we open that bag without a steepled warrant, anything we find in there will be inadmissible. Exactly. So let's go get that warrant. Go for it. But it's a waste of time. What? Look, that is Not the evidence. Nolan wouldn't jeopardize evidence by throwing it down a hill where it could be damaged or destroyed. If I'm right and he's innocent, then that means the real evidence is hidden somewhere in this house. That bag is just a fake out meant to buy him some time. Time for what? To talk his way out of this?

But the bird also has ways to escape. He uses a clip to pinch his back and slides down. But just as the bird is feeling proud, he doesn't know the cat has already opened his mouth wide, waiting for him. He struggles frantically. Seeing the rope break, the cat panics instantly. He frantically searches for the bird, only to discover the bird has tied him to a rocket. Then the bird lights the fuse. The cat's teeth fly out together with the rocket, so the cat decides to use a honey trap. He brings paint and draws a Tweety Bird on his hand, then paints big eyes and red lips. Then he puts on a hat and places it in the nest. The cat climbs the tree and whistles. Tweety Bird is immediately attracted out, being the cat's finger. Constantly flirting, the bird can't help but fly over. The next second, the cat grabs the bird with his hand. Realizing he's been tricked by the cat, Tweety Bird even wants to escape with his girlfriend. The disguise gets torn off and he immediately sees the truth. Then he switches the hats. The cat lifts the hat and bites his own finger. Only when he sees Tweety Bird flying away does he realize he's been fooled. Then the escaped Tweety bird puts barbed wire on the pole, wanting to get a good sleep. But the cat made a trampoline with an Iron pipe and a straight jacket, and he jumps on it. The awakened Tweety Bird immediately activates the emergency device. Then, when the cat reaches in, he punches him down directly. Then, using the trampoline's elasticity, he continuously attacks the cat. The cat immediately puts on a helmet, but the bird opens the helmet and throws firecrackers inside. The next second, cat is blown up. The cat refuses to give up. This time. He directly builds a birdhouse. Then, while Tweety Bird isn't home, he climbs up the pole in disguise. Before long, Tweety Bird flies back. The cat thinks he's about to succeed and immediately slides to the ground excitedly. But just as he's happily preparing to go home to enjoy his catch, Tweety Bird actually runs to his central nervous system. Seizing this excellent opportunity, the bird immediately pulls the nerves to control the cat. The walking cat's hands and feet suddenly become uncontrollable. Then, like a train starting up, he begins racing rapidly through the streets. Tweety Bird enjoys the speed in the cat's ear. However, he doesn't notice the warning sign. The next second, he makes the cat crash into a wall. You know, I lose more pretty cats that way.

En lugar de eso, se queda ansioso en el vestíbulo mirando la pantalla del televisor. Hasta que un día el presentador del canal deportivo se quedó dormido. De repente, la imagen cambió. Los jugadores también cayeron al suelo. El hombre vio esta escena y no pudo evitarlo. Corrió rápidamente hacia el guardia de seguridad. Le dio un golpe derribándolo. Aprovechó la ocasión para quitarle el arma. Luego corrió hacia la multitud como un loco. Los pasajeros comenzaron a gritar aterrados. Sin embargo, el hombre no lastimó a nadie. Solo corría desesperadamente hacia la pista de aterrizaje. En ese momento, la azafata notó algo extraño fuera. Corrió a cerrar la puerta del avión, pero no pudo evitar que el hombre entrara. Jack, con el arma en mano, ordenó a la azafata que cerrara la puerta. Los pasajeros en el avión empezaron a entrar en pánico. Luego jack corrió rápidamente hacia la cabina de pilotaje. Amenazó al piloto con el arma para que despegara inmediatamente y le explicó, debemos salir de aquí antes de que salga el sol. De lo contrario, todos moriremos. El piloto, confundido, intentó quitarle el arma, pero no solo falló, sino que también se disparó a la palma de la mano. Ahora no podía operar el avión por sí solo y el copiloto también había desaparecido. Jack solo pudo preguntar si había alguien en la cabina que supiera pilotar el avión. Una Mujer llamada kelly levantó la mano. Dijo que podía volar un helicóptero. Jack la llevó rápidamente a la cabina de pilotaje. A medida que el avión despegaba lentamente, jack ordenó al piloto volar hacia el oeste porque esa era la dirección donde el sol se ponía. Una vez que el avión voló con estabilidad, el piloto finalmente preguntó, el amanecer significa la muerte. ¿Qué significa eso? Jack empezó a explicar. Soy teniente coronel del ejército de la otan. Escuché accidentalmente una reunión secreta de alto nivel. Descubrí que el sol ha mutado. Todos los seres vivos expuestos a la luz del sol morirán. Incluso dentro de los edificios no se puede escapar. En ese momento, aún tenía dudas, pero lo que vi en la televisión, los atletas cayendo al suelo confirmó todo. Por eso debemos competir contra el sol. Solo si permanecemos en la oscuridad tenemos alguna esperanza de sobrevivir. El piloto, aunque difícil de creer, aceptó seguir las instrucciones de jack. Sin embargo, puso una condición, le pidió a jack que mantuviera en secreto lo relacionado con el sol para evitar causar pánico entre los pasajeros. Después de pensarlo, jack estuvo de acuerdo. Luego, el piloto anunció por megafonía que el destino del avión había cambiado de moscú a islandia. Los pasajeros no entendieron. Jack prometió que no revelaría la razón. Sin embargo, uno de los pasajeros, martin, oyó accidentalmente la conversación entre jack y el piloto. Le preguntó a jack qué pasaba con el sol. Jack, impaciente, respondió, Estás equivocado. Como todos temían al teniente coronel armado, los pasajeros se callaron. En ese momento, un pasajero comenzó a vomitar sin cesar. Martin aprovechó para tomar el arma y, apuntando con ella, ordenó a la azafata que encerrara a jack en el baño. Sin embargo, cuando la azafata cerró la puerta con llave, martin apuntó con el arma. Al piloto. Lo presionó para saber por qué ocultaban la verdad sobre el sol y su capacidad de matar. El sol claramente está matando a todos, explicó el piloto. Jack es solo un loco mental. Yo solo lo estaba siguiendo porque tenía miedo de su arma. Después de escuchar esto, martin bajó la guardia. Sin la amenaza de jack. El piloto pudo operar el avión con más calma, pero pronto la escena en el aeropuerto de islandia hizo que su corazón se acelerara nuevamente en el suelo. La gente luchaba entre sí por el control de los aviones. El lugar estaba lleno de gritos. Era un infierno en la tierra

Inside the bamboo stalks, there was gold. Piles of it! Before he could even recover from the joy of sudden wealth, something even stranger happened. A bamboo shoot suddenly shot up from the ground, then slowly opened like a blooming lotus. Inside sat a beautiful little girl. The old man thought the gods had sent him a miracle. He pressed his hands together and made a wish. But the only response he got was a big yawn from the tiny girl. Startled, yet overjoyed, he realized he had never seen such a mysterious being. Carefully, he carried the girl home in his hands. His wife, seeing this delicate little child, was stunned by her beauty. To her, the girl looked just like a pure and flawless princess. The couple instantly decided to keep her, believing she was a gift from the heavens. But then something unbelievable happened. The girl's clothes slipped off, and before their eyes she turned into a crying infant. The couple had lived past middle age without ever having children. They were certain this was truly a divine gift. So they rushed to the village to borrow some milk. But halfway there, the old woman suddenly realized something strange. Though she had never been pregnant, she could miraculously produce milk herself. Overjoyed, they hurried back home and cared for the baby as if she were their own flesh and blood. The infant Grew at an astonishing pace. In just a few days she was already walking. The village children said she was like a bamboo shoot. So they called her little bamboo. But the old man didn't like that name. In his heart, his daughter had always been a real princess. And a princess, he thought, should never have such an ordinary name.

They named her funeral and pampered her like their own daughter. Being an AI, funeral could quickly calculate all sorts of data and even understand exactly what both fathers liked. Over time, the two men almost forgot that she wasn't truly human. But happiness never lasts forever. At a conference, both fathers fell for a woman named Lisa. Though Lisa ultimately chose Jack, George still secretly admired her. Furiel noticed George's sadness, and for the first time, she seemed to feel something like human emotion. After Jack and Lisa married, he focused on his family, while George, heartbroken, buried himself in his research. Suddenly, Furiel lost the love of both fathers. She went from the adored princess to an unwanted burden. She realized it was Lisa who caused this. Determined to reclaim her happiness, Furiel acted while Lisa was in the bathtub. When Jack arrived at the hospital, their child survived, but Lisa passed away. He knew funeral was behind it, so in anger, he dragged her into the basement. He locked Furiel in an iron box and sealed the basement. Over the next decade or so, he and Lisa's daughter gradually replaced Furiel's place in the household. But on his daughter's 14th birthday, the long forgotten Furiel returned, like a nightmare descending upon them. その晚Himari は死的

Agentes querían recoger a darius durante el traslado. Mecho usó códigos policiales para probar a los supuestos federales. Ambos fallaron. Cuando se vieron descubiertos, atacaron. Mecho primero neutralizó a uno, luego tomó su arma y abatió al otro. Mientras tanto, el jefe del crimen, franklin, al saber del fracaso, envió una nueva ola de asesinos para eliminar a darius. Michelle mostró a darius las fotos de los falsos agentes, pero este negó conocerlos y advirtió que podría haber un infiltrado en la comisaría. Si se quedaban, ¿habría consecuencias?

If you have money, you can even treat the waiter as dessert. But today there is a rather shabby guest at the hotel door. The ship does not look like a rich person. The welcome lady smile instantly froze on her face. But she was professionally trained. Turning her head to let the security guards be ready for a moment if the other party cannot pay for it immediately to drive people away. The people who come down from the ship are looking for lost treasure and learn that the former captain has left clues on the planet. But it is not expected that hundreds of years ago there is a luxury hotel. According to the regulations, no one can carry weapons inside. But Seve is taking advantage of the security, quietly using the force to get the dagger back. This hotel is best known for its natural hot springs. But want to stay at least a month in advance to book. Seve naturally did not have a reservation. But he has money. Do not underestimate this Old Republic currency. If placed on other planets it its value is enough to buy an entire ranch. But the receptionist did not give up her appointment list. Cannot have their combination. No way! SIF had to take out a currency. The woman gladly accepted and even took the initiative to show the appointment list. Let SIF casually replace. They were divided into Two teams ready to look for the Mark left by the former captain in the hot spring area. Looking at the MUD pouring out of the hot spring pipe, Lane suddenly had an idea decided to follow the pipe to find the source of the MUD. After all, the treasure is generally buried in the deep maze, and Sev was lucky enough to find the code words left by the pirates on the hot spring wall. But as they try to read it, Neil catches the attention of the guards who charge extra for the spa, but said they spent all his money on the spot and now they're sneaking in and if they're caught by the guards, there's no money left for the spot.

Todd and I talked about going there, but now I'm thinking of doing it myself. Walter recently split up with his life partner, Todd. They were gay. Small world, huh? How's it small exactly? Andrew is also an out and proud homosexual. He's here, he's queer. And we're used to it. Since when? You know what else you two have in common? A love of boots. Andrew has some beautiful boots. Oh, can only imagine the fun you two would have in a boot shop. Um, mom, I'm gonna take these bowls to the kitchen. Oh, thanks dear. With you. What are you doing? I'm just trying to stay out of the way of all those sparks that are flying. Sparks? The man's twice my age. Yes, but he's also. He's got a great sense of. Okay. Do you know how hard it is to get a Good contractor. Oh my god. And poor Walter just had his heart broken. So if it takes you being nice to him to get our house fixed, you're. You're pimping me out for a new roof and windows? And I'm not pimping you out. I'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer. Look, if by kindness you mean sex, shut your mouth. I would never suggest that. You can raise a man's hopes without satisfying them. I've done it all my life. Andrew, I have got to get back into my house and you're my only hope. Fine. For you, I will flirt, I will flatter and I will charm. Bless you. In exchange, I expect a 60 inch flat screen TV. Fine. And if you can get him to come in on time and under budget, I'll throw in surround sound.

This abnormality you have, it's a condition you inherit from a father, only from a father. And George doesn't have it. My dad says doctors don't know what they're talking about half the time. Well, your father, he seems to Know everything? Of course he does. He's my dad. Her answers felt rehearsed. No one planned and she's been extremely isolated. She doesn't watch TV or use the internet. She can't even remember the last time she left the farm. I think we should call the police. The police. I'm not 100% sure, but I think we may be witnessing a kidnapped girl and her dog.

And we wanna go the distance, so. I completely understand. Well, everything seems normal. Baby seems healthy. Blood pressure is good, though. You can sit up. But there is one more thing I should look at. Um, how long have you had that rash on your arm? I scraped myself on the dock at the cottage, climbing down to the water to go for a swim. Any pain? A bit, but I bruise easily. That. That's all it is, right? We just need to make sure. I need to make an incision. Prep lidocaine. Are. Are you worried about something?

Yes. This is crazy. We, we need time. I want the debriement. No, Maria. I want to hold our child in my arms. Doctor Bishop. Yeah. What is it? I've got a 36 year old woman, 31 weeks pregnant presenting with flesh eating bacteria. I've never seen necrotizing fasciitis in a pregnant woman. No, neither have I. Have you treated this infection before? No, sir. But I have seen numerous cases of gangrene. And then, you know, we had to move fast. You've started her on antibiotics, 600 mg of Ivyclinda, 2 grams of IV. And so she's all of the on fluids. How'd she contract it? She scraped herself on a dock and the baby you don't hurt for. It's normal. Sepsis from infection can cause stillbirth or miscarriage. Well, it's presenting on her upper arms just above the elbow. So hopefully we can control it and limit spread. We'll do an MRI, see if that's the case. And then more. Doctor Hammond, assuming it hasn't read, what are her options? Uh, radical debriement, but that means putting her under extremely risky for a pregnant woman. The only other option is amputation and she'll need a general anaesthesia to get her way. When the decision has to be the patients ultimately. I'll reach out to infectious diseases, start a dialogue with a surgeon. I'll talk to Maria. Are, are you talking about cutting off my arm if you choose this Option, yes. And this other option the bride meant, it means I get to keep it. Yes, but you have to understand, amputation increases the likelihood that we get everything. The bride meant means cutting out only the infected tissue. But the risks of the bacteria spreading are higher. I should have never gone for that swim. Don't say that. No, I've heard you can't. The infection is dangerous and aggressive. Am I not already exposed? Look, let's hope not. And we cannot take that chance. And these antibiotics, are you sure they won't harm our baby? Your baby is safe for now. The best predictor of the baby doing well is you doing well, which means we need to decide, how is this happening now? We've tried for so long for this baby. That's all we've thought about for years. A surgeon is coming to talk to you shortly, but any delay will put your life and your baby's life in danger. This is crazy. We, we need time. I want the Debriament. No, Maria, I want to hold our child in my arms, rock my baby to sleep. Are you okay? You tried to conceive for 2 years, three failed rounds of Invitro. I took a night job. Maria took extra freelance work. And every single time a cycle didn't work, she would get the news and it destroyed her. And then, and then it worked. We're gonna have a baby. And now all I can think is Is it all worth it? It will be okay. As soon as she's done, we'll get her into an MRI to make sure the bacteria hasn't spread. Thank you.

Strangely, every time his wife lost the baby, the husband cheered with joy. Finally, on the 82nd pregnancy, she gave birth. But when the baby cried out, everyone froze in terror except the father, laughed like a madman. It was a deformed child with three legs. From birth, the baby was locked in an iron mask. He fought dogs for leftovers and gave himself a name, Dog King. One day, Dog King stumbled upon his father teaching his brothers how to dance. No matter how hard they tried, his brothers couldn't get it right. But Dog King only needed one look to grasp the essence. From that day on, he danced non stop, day and night. Dancing gave him a joy he had never known, and it even brought about a miracle. The missing leg he was born without grew back. Overjoyed, he ran to the village to share his happiness, but the villagers screamed in horror. Children cried at the sight of him. Hurt and furious, Dog King decided he had nothing left to hide. He ripped off his iron mask and revealed his true face. The villagers scattered in fear, but instead of shame, Dog King danced with delight. From then on, he became obsessed with scaring villagers with his face, until one day he met a strange man.

But when she came back with the hot water, she ran into an old acquaintance, Ohio. When she saw her crush, Lily completely ignored Ethan. Ethan had no choice but to pour the hot water over his own head, instantly turning back into a boy. When they raced to the school gate, a pack of guys came charging like mad dogs. Lily quickly told Ethan to dodge, then leapt into the crowd herself. Anyone who could beat her could be her boyfriend. The boys swarmed her, but no one stood a chance. Then a cool, brooding guy walked up holding a rose. He tossed the rose to Lily and took a fighting stance, ready to challenge her. Seeing Lily in trouble, Ethan immediately jumped over the wall to take the challenge himself. Although the student council president was stronger than the other boys, Ethan was a martial arts expert. He was unbeatable. During the fight, rain suddenly poured from the sky. Just as Ethan transformed back into a girl, a panda slammed into the student council president. The panda carried Ethan inside and poured hot water on him, turning him back into a boy.

They're both cackling, and I'm sitting right here. My mom half smiles like, this is a horrible and not evidence my family convinced me a theme park ceased to exist. Oops! My sister giggles, finally glancing at me. Sorry, I forgot you were still here. She doesn't look sorry. Then my brother nudges my sister. Remember when she got grounded for a month for breaking Mom's face? My sister's eyes go wide. Oh my god. Wasn't that you, though? My brother shrugs. Yeah. Oops. They laugh harder.

I stopped asking for things years ago. I stopped expecting birthday calls or Christmas presents with my my name spelled right. I built walls so thick, I forgot people were supposed to be on the other side.

The worst dancer gets shot. The Rasputin song started loading on YouTube. The animated figures appeared ready to dance. Wait, Eric said through tears. How do we know who scores lowest?

Why now? 30 years of nothing and suddenly I'm the chosen one. I step into the bedroom and see my dad, who looks like a skeleton, eyes sunken and fingers thin. Machines beep around him like a countdown I don't want to witness. He waves me closer and his voice sounds like gravel scraping concrete. I need to tell you something before I go, he raps. You don't belong in this family. Well, you're mine, but you're not your mother's. The air leaves my lungs like someone punched it out. He keeps talking, 31 years ago, I had an affair. Some woman from my office, she died giving birth to you and she had no family to take you in. So suddenly you were my problem. He goes on to tell me the story, story of how he brought me home and that's how my mom found out about the affair. She agreed to raise me so the family wouldn't fall apart, but she could never love me. Every time she looked at me, she saw his betrayal, asking For breakfast, he had to be harsh with me, distant, because if my mom ever thought he favored me over her real kids, she would have left and taken them. Every time he looked at me, he saw his own guilt staring back. Your brother and sister can never know, he whispers. Your mother made me promise they'd never find out. His hand finds mine. I'm sorry. I was a coward. You were innocent in all of this. So I'm not just furniture. I'm haunted furniture. My dad dies three days later. I don't tell anyone what he said.

And somehow the truth was worse than anything I'd imagined. I'm not saying I was neglected. Neglect implies someone noticed you enough to actively decide not to care. I was more like furniture that occasionally needed feeding. The middle child sandwiched between my older brother, who could do no wrong, and my younger sister, who was the baby everyone adored. I exist in exactly zero family photos, not because I'm ugly. I mean, I am, but that's not the point. My dad would send me to grab something right before the camera clicked every single time. At my high school graduation, my parents left early because my sister had a dance recital. They saw her do a cartwheel and missed me get my diploma. So when my dad gets diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the last thing anyone expected was for him to tell mom he wants to see me. Specific. I assume the morphine finally kicked in. Here's the thing, though. He won't let anyone into his room. Not my mom, not my brother, not my sister, nobody. They're all losing their minds about it, huddled in the living room crying and telling stories about him like he's already gone. My mom keeps dabbing her eyes saying he was such a wonderful father. And I'm sitting on the arm of the couch like a gargoyle wondering if I walked into the Wrong house. Then my family starts sharing memories, and somehow I become the punchline. My brother starts laughing about the time dad taught him to drive, and my sister jumps in with memory.

Nobody noticed I wasn't on the call. The wedding day arrived. I wore a 39 dollar suit I bought online. My mom made a comment about how I could have made more of an effort. My sister didn't look at me during photos. I stood in the back row, half cropped out of most of the shots. My dad gave a speech about how proud he was of his little girl. He didn't mention me once. My brother gave the best man toast. Nobody questioned it. He had the whole room laughing and crying within 5 minutes. When he finished, everyone stood and applauded. The MC grabbed the microphone and said any final words from family before we move to dinner? My dad shot me a look from across the table, a warning, don't you dare. I stood up, tapped my champagne glass with a fork until the room quieted down. 300 people staring at me, most of them wondering who I was, pulled out my phone and smiled. I just need one minute. Behind me, the projector flickered on. I'd paid the AV guy $500 to connect my laptop without telling anyone.

But then she added, there's something else. They said the cancellation request came from a woman claiming to be your wedding consultant to use your mother in law's number as the callback. This wasn't a misunderstanding. It wasn't bad paperwork. Someone tried to cancel my wedding. I screeched into the venue driveway with four minutes to spare. The coordinator, clipboard in hand, stood outside with two staff members and a security guard. And standing next to them was my mother in law. She rushed toward me. I told them, you're wearing the wrong dress. Let's go. We're changing the venue. My friend's club can fit us in. What did you do? I interrupted. Breathless, she blinked, offended. Excuse me.

The chicken was tender and falling off the bone. The saffron had turned everything this we're just golden color.

I sat in the driveway for three minutes just reading. Then I checked through the bedroom door and he was still asleep. So I hauled six grocery bags into the kitchen as quietly as humanly possible. Every plastic bag sounded like a firecracker. I hid everything in the cabinet we never use, the one above the fridge. Then I called his best friend, Griffin, and begged him to take my husband out of the day. I need at least six hours, I said. Griffin asked why, and I just said, trust me, I'll explain later. He showed up at noon and they left to go to some car show two towns over. The second the door closed, I pulled out every pot we own. His mom stayed on Facetime with me for the first hour, walking me through the marination process. More yogurt, she kept saying. No more. You need at least two cups. Trust me. I've been making this for 35 years. I started cooking at one PM the recipe said medium heat, but our stove runs hot and I didn't adjust. The first batch burned because I had the heat too high and I panicked when I smelled it. I dumped the entire pot. In the sink and watch $60 worth of chicken and spices go down the drain. The second batch looked promising until I realized the rice was mushy, completely overcooked. I left it on for three minutes too long while I was answering his mom's call and the whole thing was ruined. Another $40 wasted. I sat on the kitchen floor at four PM and just stared at the ceiling for 10 minutes. I've been cooking for three hours straight and I had nothing to show for it except two pots of wasted food and turmeric stains on literal.

That whatever broke something in me. We're both first gen Indian Americans, and since we got married last year, we've been living off chicken and rice because the nearest Indian grocery store is two hours away. I didn't realize how much he missed home until I heard his voice crack talking to his friend. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 4:30 this morning while he was still asleep. I grabbed the grocery list. His mom texted me at midnight after I called her crying, and I just drove. The GPS said two hours and 12 minutes one way. The store opened at 7. I got there at six 45 and sat in the parking lot watching the sun come up, trying not to think about how I've never made biryani in my entire life. My hands were shaking when I grabbed my coffee. When the doors finally opened, I walked in and immediately felt lost. The store was huge and everything was labeled in three different languages. I called his mom from aisle 3, standing there with my list, and she walked me through finding every single ingredient. Basmati, rice, chat, saffron. $40 for a Container smaller than my thumb. He got it. Cardamom pods that I had to count out myself. The spices alone cost me $87. I stood at checkout watching the total climb. $120, $150, $180. The cashier asked if I was

That last part stung. I just left her on read. The next morning she texted again. Can we please talk about this like adults? I replied, there's nothing to talk about. You made your choice.

I surprised him at his office with lunch. That's when I met autumn, his colleague. They were laughing at his desk. And when I walked in, there was this weird pause, like I'd interrupted something. He introduced us, said they've been working together for five years. Five years? And I'd never heard her name. Not once. On the drive home, I asked why he never mentioned her. He said, we rarely talk about work since I don't understand his field. That stuck with me, the way he said it. That night, I started paying attention. He was on his phone constantly, smiling at texts, typing quick responses. During dinner, during movies, even when we were in bed. A week later, I asked him directly, who are you texting so much? He didn't hesitate. He unlocked his phone and handed it to me. See for yourself. I scrolled through their messages. It was pages and pages of daily conversations, cute nicknames, inside jokes. Her complaining about her husband, asking intimate questions about our relationship, about me. Then I found the one that made my stomach drop. My husband's birthday is June 14. I threw him a party. Friends, family, everything. At nine forty seven PM that night, she texted, you must be Bored at your own party, or you wouldn't be texting me instead of being with her. He was texting her at the party. I spent two weeks planning for him. I looked on the phone.

I even found the little instruction booklets that came with them, set them on the kitchen table, ready to list on Facebook Marketplace. But I couldn't do it. I kept looking at those boxes thinking about how excited they were when they first got them last Christmas. How my daughter would sit on my lap while we played puzzle games together, how my son would show me his drawings, so proud of the little dinosaurs he made on the art app. I put the boxes in a cardboard box, shove them in the back of my bedroom closet behind some old blankets, told myself I'd decide later. Summer ended, school started, and something weird happened. My kids actually started getting along. Maybe it was being back in routine. Maybe they just needed to mature a little. Maybe it was losing those tablets that did it. But they started sharing again, playing board games together after dinner, building Lego sets without fighting over pieces. September turned into October, then November. By the time Thanksgiving rolled around, my kids were like different people. They set the table together without being asked. My son helped my daughter with her spelling homework. I caught them laughing at some inside joke in the hallway one morning and it hit me that I hadn't heard them laugh together in months before the ipads got taken. Then December came and reality set in. Money was tight this year, like really tight. My hours got cut at work. Car needed new brakes. The water heater broke and had to be replaced. Every time I thought about Christmas, my stomach hurt. I sat down one.

I left it on for three minutes too long while I was answering his mom's call and the whole thing was ruined. Another $40 wasted. I sat on the kitchen floor at four PM and just stared at the ceiling for 10 minutes. I've been cooking for three hours straight and I had nothing to show for it except two pots of wasted food and turmeric stains on literally every dish towel we own. My hands smelled like garam masala. There was rice stuck to my shirt. My back hurt from standing. I wanted to give up and just order take out. But then I remembered his voice last night, that sad whatever, like he'd accepted he'd never have it again. So I got up and I started batch No. 3. This time I set timers for everything, phone timer, oven timer, even the microwave timer as backup. I watched that pot like my life depended on it. I checked the rice every 90 seconds with a fork. I followed his mom's instructions exactly, measuring everything twice using actual measuring cups instead of eyeballing it. At 6:15, the rice was perfect. The chicken was tender and falling off the bone. The saffron had turned everything this or just golden color. And the whole house smelled exactly like his childhood home, like his mom's kitchen on the wallie. I plated everything in our nicest serving dish and covered it with oil to keep it warm. Griffin just texted me. They're 20 minutes away. I'm standing in our kitchen right now surrounded by every dirty pot and pan we own. There's spices all over the counter. I have turmeric under my fingernails that won't come out. I used $40 worth of saffron in one dish and I'm still not sure I used enough. But the biryani looks incredible. It smells perfect. And in 20 minutes, my husband is going to walk through that door and smell his mom's cooking for the first time in over a year. I'm terrified this won't taste right. I'm terrified he'll take one bite and know it's wrong. But I'm also hoping that even if it's not perfect, he'll understand that I woke up before sunrise and drove four hours and spent seven hours cooking because I love him. The garage door just opened. He's home.

The gifts I could actually afford would fit in a shoebox, maybe two. I wanted to cry. My kids have been so good. They'd earned something special this year, but I just didn't have it. Then I remembered the closet, the boxes, the ipads. I dug them out that night, dusted off the cardboard box they've been sitting in, opened up each iPad box and checked that everything was still there. Chargers, cable screen, still perfect. They looked brand new. I wrapped them the next day while the kids were at school. Use the nicest wrapping paper we had, the shiny red kind with little gold stars, a big bows out of curling ribbon, put their names on fancy gift tags. On Christmas morning, there were only four presents under the tree, two for each kid. One was a pair of pajamas for each of them. The other was the wrapped iPad boxes. My daughter opened hers first. She ripped through the paper and then just stopped, stared at the box. She looked up at me with this confused expression. Wait, she said, is this my iPad? I nodded, but you said you sold them. My son said he was holding his box now, not even opening it yet. I told them the truth. I said I couldn't do it. I put them away instead and I told them The reason they were getting them back is because they showed me they earned them all those months of being good to each other, helping around the house, no fighting. That's what got them back. My daughter tackled me in a hug so hard I almost fell off the couch. My son just sat there for a second then said, so we were basically on a six month test.

So whatever, that, whatever broke something in me. We're both first gen Indian Americans and since we got married last year, we've been living off chicken and rice because the nearest Indian grocery store is two hours away. I didn't realize how much he missed home until I heard his voice crack talking to his friend. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 4:30 this morning while he was still asleep. I grabbed the grocery list. His mom texted me at midnight after I called her crying and I just drove. The GPS said two hours and 12 minutes one way. The store opened at 7. I got there at six, 45 and sat in the parking lot watching the sun come up, trying not to think about how I've never made biryani in my entire life. My hands were shaking when I grabbed my coffee. When the doors finally opened, I walked in and immediately felt lost. Just store was huge and everything was labeled in three different languages. I called his mom from aisle three, standing there with my list and she walked me through finding every single ingredient. Dasmati, rice, saffron, $40 for a container. Smaller than my thumb. He got it. Cardamom pods that I had to count out myself. The spices alone cost me 80.

I'd give her $5,000 toward a reasonable wedding, or she could pay for this circus herself. Ashley stormed out and didn't talk to me for two weeks. She told her mom I was being cruel and selfish. She even called her grandmother, trying to get her to convince me to change my mind. But then something interesting happened. Brandon came to see me by himself. He sat in my living room looking really uncomfortable. Mister Davis said, I need to tell you something. I had no idea Ashley wanted to spend that much money. When she told me 47,000, I almost choked. Turns out Brandon had been trying to talk Ashley into something smaller for months. He wanted to use their money for a down payment on a house instead of one expensive party. I was actually hoping you'd say no, he admitted. I didn't know how to tell her we couldn't afford it without sounding unsupportive. Three days later, Ashley called me crying. But this time it was different. She apologized and said she'd been talking to some of her married friends about their wedding debt. One couple was still paying off their wedding loan three years later. Another friend's parents had to delay retirement because of wedding costs. I don't want you to struggle financially because of my party, she said through tears. Brandon and I found a really nice park Pavilion that cost $300 to rent. We ended up having the Wedding at the state park by the lake. Ashley's mom and I helped with decorating, her aunt made the cake and Brandon's cousin DJ at the reception. The whole thing cost $4,200 and it was absolutely beautiful.

She loves fashion. She loves herself and she owns it. My sister, Betty, the complete opposite. She's the women belong in the kitchen type. Think floral apron, husband's dinner on the table by 6.

Anyway, Eddie got pregnant and when she invited us to her formal dinner to celebrate, I thought maybe, just maybe, we could be civil. Mina wore this dark green tailored suit, sleek and powerful.

Every time Mina walks by, Betty's eyes roll like clockwork. At one point, she cracks this joke loud enough for everyone to hear. Guess, Mina, where's the pants in your marriage, huh? Poor you, stuck wearing all the pink frilly dresses. Everyone laughs awkwardly. Mina squeezes my hand under the table and whispers, don't, not tonight. I nod. I try to breathe. I try to focus on anything else, the candles, the baby photos, the sound of my jaw clenching. And Betty stands up, glass in hand, like to make a toast, she says. She starts soft, thanking everyone, talking about motherhood, family, all that sentimental crap. Then her tone shifts. Her smile fades. Her voice gets that sharp, sugary edge. She looks straight at Mina and says, it's hard raising a daughter in a world where women want to act and dress like men. She pauses, eyes locked on my wife like a sniper sight.

I froze mid scoop. What are you talking about? She didn't even look up from her phone. Your dad and I are getting divorced. We're selling the house. You have until Friday to decide who you want to live with. I was 17. They've been fighting for months, but I didn't think it was this bad. That night, I tried talking to my dad. He was in the garage packing boxes. Dad, what's going on? He finally stopped and looked at me. Your mom and I agreed. You're old enough to choose. No pressure. But there was pressure. My mom kept making comments about how Dad's new apartment was smaller. My dad mentioned Mom's boyfriend was moving in next month. Wait, boyfriend? Yeah, dad said, not meeting my eyes. Marcus. They met at her office. I felt sick. How long does it matter? He went back to packing. Next day, I confronted my mom. She was in her bedroom sorting through old photos and I noticed she was only keeping the ones without my dad in them. Marcus and I have been together for 4 months, she admitted. But your father knew we were already separated emotionally. Four months. The house went up for sale six months ago. Her face changed. Your father told you that? That's when I found the real estate listing on her laptop. She listed The house eight months ago, before the fights even started. I went back to my dad that night. When did you actually find out about Marcus? He was silent for a long time. Then he pulled out his phone and showed me a text. Red. My mom had been planning to leave for over a year. The messages went back to when I was 16. But it got worse. There was a message from my mom to Marcus that said, just need to wait until the life insurance policy matures in November. Then we can be together. My blood went cold. Dad, what life insurance policy? His face went pale. I took one out three years ago. Your mom's the beneficiary. It matures next week. Friday, I whispered. The same day they wanted me to choose. The same day they were finalizing everything. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how eager my mom had been for me to choose. How she kept.

Not just any reveal, either. This girl had 400,000 followers, and the video already had 2 million views. There was Kalani, my boyfriend of three years, kissing her in front of the Eiffel Tower with the caption, finally showing you guys my man. Together six months. My hands went numb. Kalani was supposed to be in Phoenix for a medical conference. I checked his Instagram. He posted a photo of a conference room 12 hours ago. But the meta data on her TikTok showed it was filmed yesterday in Paris. I screenshotted everything before my brain could talk me out of it. Then I went to her profile. Hundreds of videos of them together. Date nights, cooking videos, morning routines. The cooking videos were filmed in an apartment I didn't recognize. But I saw Kalani's watch on the counter, the one I'd bought him for his birthday. My stomach churned as I kept scrolling. Three months ago, she posted about meeting his parents. Same weekend he told me he was visiting his sick college roommate. There was a photo of her with his mom and dad at their anniversary dinner. The dinner I wasn't invited to because it was family only. I called him immediately. He answered on the second ring, casual as ever. Hey, Babe. Conference is pretty boring. Missing you. My voice came out steady somehow. How's Phoenix? Hot and full of old doctors. Can't Wait to come home tomorrow. I pulled up her TikTok of them at a French cafe. Posted an hour ago. That's funny, because Phoenix looks a lot like Paris on TikTok. Silence. Then what are you talking about? Adele Moreau. Ring a bell? Your girlfriend with 400 K followers who's been posting videos of you two for six months. He hung up. I called back. Straight to voicemail. I was typing a text when my phone rang. Unknown number with a French country code. I answered. You're the other woman. Her accent was slight but noticeable. Adele. Excuse me? Kalani told me about you months ago. His ex, who could. Didn't let go. He said you were stalking him. That's why he had to be careful about posting our relationship. The audacity of this man. I'm not his ex. We live together. We have a lease together. I just helped him pay for his mom's surgery. She laughed, bitter and sharp. His mom's surgery? His mother hasn't been sick a day in her life. I had dinner with her last night. She keeps asking when we're getting married. My head spun. Send me proof. Within minutes, my phone flooded with photos. Then with his parents, who I've been told didn't approve of me.

Everyone nodded. I said okay and left. Three days later, the bank called them. I was carving the Turkey when my sister Melissa clinked her fork against her wine glass. The room went quiet. We need to discuss something as a family, she said, looking directly at me. We took a vote last week. You're not part of this family anymore. I set down the carving knife slowly around the table. My parents nodded. My brother, Josh, avoided eye contact. My other sister, Emma, was recording on her phone. Even my grandmother folded her napkin and muttered, it's for the best. You voted me out of the family, I asked. It was unanimous, my father said. You never fit in anyway. Different values, different priorities. You're always working, never here for family events. I missed three dinners in five years. You didn't come to Emma's gender reveal party, Melissa added, I was performing emergency surgery. Exactly, my mother said. You think you're better than us with your doctor job and your fancy hospital. We're simple people. You don't belong here. Josh finally spoke. Plus, you never help with family expenses. Melissa needs money for her kids. Emma's starting her business, but you just hoard your money. I paid for Dad's bypass surgery, I said quietly. I've been paying the mortgage on this house for eight years. That's different, my father said quickly. That was Your choice. Melissa stood up again. Look, we already decided. Pack your things from your old room. Don't contact us anymore. We'll tell people you moved away for work. My grandmother nodded. The family name stays with real family. I looked at each of them, these people I'd loved and supported my entire life. Okay. I. I put down the carving fork, grabbed my coat and walked out. My mother called after me. You can't just leave. Finish carving the Turkey. I didn't look back. That night, I made three phone calls, first to the bank. I need to remove myself from the mortgage I've been paying. The woman on the phone was confused. Sir, you're the sole name on this.

I now know the horrifying truth about my school. It started on a normal Tuesday. Mr Hendricks was teaching us about the Cold War when the P a. System crackled to life. Principal Vagner's voice came through, but it sounded wrong. Strange. Attention, students and faculty, we are now in a code black lockdown. All classroom doors will seal automatically. Not attempt to leave. Do not look outside. This is not a drill. The door clicked. That heavy electronic lock our school installed last year. Then metal shutters rolled down over the windows, blocking out all natural light. The overhead fluorescents were our only source of brightness. Mr Hendrix tried his keycard on the door panel. Nothing. He tried the emergency override. The panel stayed red. It's okay, said, but his hands were shaking. I'm sure this is just a malfunction. They'll fix it soon. That was 13 days ago. There are 24 of us in here, 23 students and Mr Hendrick. The classroom has one bathroom, no windows we can access, and a mini fridge that had six bottles of water and someone's leftover sandwich. We ran out of food on day three, water on day five. By day six, people started getting desperate. Jenny tried to pry open the air vent. Marcus threw a desk at the door. Nothing worked. The walls are solid concrete. The door is reinforced steel. We tried everything. Mr Hendricks Kept telling us help was coming, that our parents would get us out. But on day seven, he stopped talking, just sat at his desk staring at the sealed door. On day eight, we heard sounds, not from the hallway, from inside the walls, scratching like something moving through the duct work. We all heard it. Mr Hendricks told us it was just the pipes, but pipes don't whisper. Day nine, the scratching got louder, closer, and we started finding things. Notes slipped under the door gap that's barely a quarter inch wide. The first note said, stop trying to leave. It's safer in there. The second note said, they're in the hallways now, all 47 of them. Marcus picked up that note and laughed, said it was a prank, said the office was messing with it. But his laugh sounded hollow. Day 10, Sarah passed out from dehydration. We laid her on the floor, tried to keep her comfortable. Mr Hendricks finally used the emergency intercom button on the wall, the one that's supposed to connect directly to the office. Someone answered, but it wasn't Principal Wagner. Hello, room 7B. The voice was high pitched, childlike. You've been very patient. Only three more days until phase two. Phase two of what? Mr Hendrick shouted. Let us out. We have students who need medical attention. You're the last classroom. All the others are empty now. Their students were very cooperative. The intercom cut off. Marcus ran to the door, started Pounding on it, screaming for help. That's when we heard it. Footsteps in the hallway, dozens of them running past our door, then stopping. Something pressed against the door. From the other side, we could hear breathing. Wet, raspy like lungs full of fluid. Then children's voices singing ring around the Rosie pocket full of posies. Ashes. Ashes. We all fall down. The footsteps moved on. We didn't speak for the rest of the night. Day 11, another note appeared. The school was built on top of the old children's hospital. They never left. They've been waiting underneath, feeding on student, one classroom per year. This year, it's you. I didn't believe it. Couldn't believe it. But then I remembered last year, Mrs. Chen's entire sixth grade class transferred out suddenly.

My boyfriend Kevin eats the same chicken stir fry every single day. Not just for dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner. Same exact dish from this Chinese place called Golden Dragon 20 minutes away. It costs 38 bucks per order, and he refuses to eat leftovers because the texture gets weird after reheating. So we're dropping over $200 a week on the same meal while I'm eating ramen and frozen pizza to save money. I tried talking to him about it. He said I don't get how his brain works, that this food is safe and predictable, and everything else makes him anxious. Said, I understand, but our bank account is literally crying. We thought about it twice, but he just shut down both times and wouldn't speak to me for hours. So I got creative. I ordered the stir fry, took it home, and literally picked it apart like a science project. Wrote down every ingredient I could identify. Spent three days watching YouTube videos and testing recipes in our tiny kitchen. Finally made something that looked exactly the same. Same vegetables, cut the same way, same sauce, colour, everything. Kevin tried it and loved it. Said it tasted perfect. For two whole weeks, he ate my homemade version without complaining once. I was saving us like 150 bucks a week. Felt like a genius. Then he walked into the kitchen while I was cooking and saw me pour soy sauce into the Pan he completely froze. Asked what that was. I said, soy sauce, obviously. He got this look on his face like I just told him I was putting poison in his food. Started saying he hates soy sauce. It's not a safe food. The taste makes him feel sick. Demanded I make it without soy sauce from now on. I explained that soy sauce is literally the base of the entire dish. No soy sauce means it won't taste right at all. He didn't care.

When I was, like, eight. My grandparents set up this college fund for me. They put in 50 grand, and my parents were supposed to add to it over the years. Every birthday, every Christmas, they tell me how proud they were that I was going to be the first person in our family to go to college without debt. Fast forward to senior year of high school. I'm filling out forms. I asked my dad for the account info. He gets this weird look on his face and says, we need to talk. Turns out they spent every single penny. The whole 50 grand, plus whatever they added over the years. Gone. They used it for my younger brother Cameron's medical bills when he broke his leg skateboarding and needed surgery. Then they dipped into it again when my mom lost her job for, like, 6 months. Then again when our roof started leaking. Each time they told themselves they'd pay it back. They never did. I was supposed to start at state in the fall. I had my dorm picked out, my classes registered, everything. Now I'm looking at 40 grand a year with zero money saved up. My parents kept apologizing and saying they'd figure something out, but what were they gonna do? Pull money out of thin air? My girlfriend Jenna's mom works as a paralegal, and she told me I could actually sue them for this. Apparently, Since my grandparents set up the account specifically for my education, my parents were legally supposed to use it only for that. Using it for other stuff, even family emergencies, was basically theft. I didn't want to sue my own parents. Like, who does that? But I also wasn't about to give up on college because they couldn't manage money. I applied for every scholarship I could find, got a part time job at target, but it still wasn't enough. So I did it. I filed the lawsuit three weeks before graduation. The whole school found out because court documents are public record. And some kids mom who works at the courthouse told everyone. Suddenly, I'm the girl who's suing her parents for money. People either thought I was totally just.

We were at Jamie and Troy's wedding. These two literally introduced us three years ago at some random barbecue, and we've all been tight ever since. My boyfriend Greg and I have been looking at rings for, like, two months. We talked about getting married a million times. It was gonna happen. I knew it. He knew it. Two weeks before the wedding, we were all hanging out at Jamie and Troy's apartment, helping them pack for their honeymoon. Wedding talk obviously came up, and Greg made this joke about proposing at their wedding. Troy actually laughed and said, that'd be hilarious. Amy and I both shut it down immediately. We were half laughing, but also like, no, seriously, don't do that. I genuinely thought Greg was just messing around. The reception was at this barn venue with string lights everywhere. Speeches had just wrapped up, and our table was waiting to hit the buffet line. Then I heard it. Story of my life by one direction started blasting through the speakers. That's our song, the one we scream in the car on road trips with the windows down. I looked over at Greg, and he was scanning the room with this weird expression. Before I could even process what was happening, he grabbed his fork and stood up. He started tapping it against his wine glass. That sound. Everyone knows that sound at weddings. The entire room went silent. And turned to look at our table. My stomach dropped. I stood up fast and leaned toward him. I whispered, not right now. His face just fell like someone had slapped him. He stammered out something loud about just joking around and sorry, and sat back down hard in his chair. The room kind of awkwardly went back to normal. People started talking again. I sat down and said quietly, let them have their moment. We can make this our own. He wouldn't even look at me, just stared at his plate. When they called our table number for food, he got up and walked straight past the buffet line toward the exit. I tried to follow him, but he was already gone by the time I got outside. I texted him twice, called him three times. Nothing.

When I was 12, I built a solar water purifier with my neighbor Dev. We spent every Saturday in my garage for two months straight. I'd bring the snacks. He'd bring the tools his dad let us borrow. We tested different filters, wrote down every result in this beat up notebook and even made a poster board together. Dev drew the diagrams because his handwriting was better. I did all the math because he sucked at fractions. The day of the science fair, I got there early to set up our table, but Dev was already there standing at a table with our project, except the board only had his name on it, just his. I walked up confused, holding the extra materials we'd planned to bring. Yo, what's going on? He didn't even look embarrassed. His dad was standing right there telling some parent how proud he was of his son's engineering skills. I've just shrugged at me. I needed the grade, man. My dad said if I don't get an a, I can't try out for basketball. I stared at him. We built this together. Yeah, but like, you'll be fine. You get good grades anyway. Chill. I went to my teacher, Mrs. Harper, told her everything. She looked at me, looked at Dev's table, then back at me. Do you have any proof you worked on this? I didn't. The notebook was at Deb's house. The photos of us building It were on his phone. He had everything. She gave me a C for not turning in a project. Dev won second place that night. I threw out every group project idea I'd ever written down. I stopped sitting with Dev at lunch. When people asked why we weren't friends anymore, I just said we grew apart. Nobody cared enough to ask more. Fast forward. I'm 28. I'm a software engineer and I helped start a company with two people I met in college, grant and Natalie. We built this budgeting app that actually got pretty big. Real users, investors reaching out. Some tech blog wrote about us. I was working 14 hour days, barely sleeping, living off energy drinks and whatever leftover pizza was in the office fridge. One night grant texts me as we should have a business dinner at his place, talk strategy, next steps, whatever. I show up with a six pack and some ideas for new features. There's a whole VC team in his living room. They're sitting around his coffee table with laptops open talking about funding and equity splits and growth projections. I walk in and nobody even introduces me. I stand there holding beer like an idiot while they keep talking. Grant finally notices me. Oh, hey man, come in. We're just going over some stuff. I sit down, wait for him to explain. He doesn't. Natalie slides a folder across the table. Inside are documents, legal stuff, stuff I didn't remember signing But apparently I did months ago when we were just getting started and I didn't think to read every line. I wasn't a co founder anymore. I was listed as a freelance contractor. They'd filed everything weeks ago, just never mentioned it. Look, grant said, leaning back, like this was all super reasonable. You're amazing at building things, but you're not great with presentations. Investors want a face they connect with. This way everyone wins. He handed me a check, $5,000 to keep things clean. We good? I didn't say anything. I just left. I didn't sleep for three days straight. I kept reading those documents over and over trying to find something I could use. I thought about getting a lawyer, but I couldn't afford one. I told a few people what happened. Most didn't care. Some said I should have read the paperwork. One guy laughed and said, that's just how startups work. Grant and Natalie got written up in Forbes under 30. I got nothing.

My fiance asked if my raise cleared. I set my badge down and walked out without a sound. I didn't slam the door. I didn't cry. I just watched a room full of executives stare at their coffee cups while my work, four years of midnight deployments and missed birthdays, got reduced to an anomaly. My manager dragged out the word like it had dirt under its nails. Sustainable metrics, he said. Collective synergy. Sure. Meanwhile, I've been the one keeping a Frankenstein of legacy code from eating payroll every other Friday. When I joined, there were no docs, no version control, just spreadsheets named things like do not delete final v 2. I rewired it in silence. A heartbeat Ledger, a watchdog script, seam after seam. I stitched reliability into a system that had never really known it. HR suggested boundaries. I suggested they check up time. Then the rebrand came. Teams were renamed, stand UPS had slogans and the slide deck said, let's go hunting. Cute. I brought before and after metrics. Anyway, latency down, errors down, incidents down. My manager squinted like the graphs were a foreign alphabet. Did you run this through alignment protocol? What protocol? I asked? He smiled. Exactly. So I stood, unpinned my badge, placed it on the table like a quiet receipt and left. No tantrum, no heroics, just an end. My apartment smelled like takeout and rain. My fiance texted, did the bonus hit I stared at the screen and typed nothing. Then I opened my private console, the one I built after our official monitoring slept through a six hour outage. Charcoal U I green text a heartbeat line used to pulse steady. Tonight it was hesitating. Three beats. Pause 3, pause 1. I remembered an old safeguard I wrote my second month. Nothing malicious, just a lock that required a trusted signature to validate the deepest. There's not a password, a presence. If the anchor went dark for 72 hours, permissions re aligned to no owner. Vault mode. I never hit it. I just never glamorized it because the point of resilience isn't fireworks. It's gravity. By Monday, my manager was on a Pep talk about mapping my infrastructure. Two juniors retreated into a war room. Whiteboards, sticky notes, cold brew. They opened our knowledge base and found two folders, skeleton and here be Dragons. Inside, Bread Crumbs, short hand warnings I'd left for anyone curious enough to follow. Feed the Watch Dog or it bites. Not a threat, a clue. A small hiccup hit billing before lunch. A manual patch fixed it and quietly killed the audit trail. The c 0 0 wanted a dependency map. By end of day, my manager sent breezy emails about legacy hiccups. He never once typed my name. He didn't need to. The Ledger already had it. Primary architect terminated, no fail, over listed. He hadn't looked. Night fell. The first alert came. Soft or API heartbeat below minimum threshold. Then payment recon, handshake failed. Ops restarted services. No errors, just silence. The fallback token denied backups. Pretty shells without the schema key. They called them images. They were portraits. Panic crept in. At 3:00am, contractors tunnelled in with swagger and acronyms, forcing a synthetic credential through the gate. For a blink, green lights winked back to life. Then a terminal message slid across the screens like a whisper. Architect user decommissioned for access null. Dashboards froze. Internal chat died. Environments terminated one by one like lights going out in an empty house. No alarms, no explosions, just absence. Legal stormed the floor. At sunrise, HR waved an empty exit older like a white flag. The c 0 0 stood in the doorway and asked the only question that mattered. Tell me she wasn't the sole architect. No one answered. Not because they didn't want to, because they finally understood the truth. I've been living for years. I didn't build a bomb. I built a vault. When they pushed me out, the door honoured the signature it trusted. I sat at a small cafe across town, phone face down, steam curling from black coffee. My fiance texted again. Did you at least get something out of it? I took a sip, watch the sun climb, let the message stay blue and unread. When the screens went dark, I finished my coffee and turned off my phone. Tell me, was that cruelty or finally choosing myself?

They were leaning against his car and she grabbed his jacket and pulled him in. I stood there like an idiot, pretending to look for my keys for five minutes. Then I texted him that I had to skip our usual Friday movie night because I was sick. He showed up at my house 20 minutes later with soup and medicine.

Just him, sitting in our usual booth, looking weird, nervous. He was playing with the sugar packets, stacking them, unstacking them. Can I ask you something weird? He said without looking up. I nodded, suddenly very aware of my own heartbeat. Do you ever feel like you're supposed to want something, but you just don't? My mouth went dry. I asked what he meant.

I told her he was having trouble with his back. When I asked him what he was thinking about, he couldn't believe I didn't even care enough to look at his phone, that my calm reaction proved I didn't love him. I trusted you. I said, why is that a problem? Because it means you wouldn't care if I actually did cheat. He snapped back, I just stared at him. That's not how trust works. Benjamin, Week 3, I found him crying in the garage at 2:00am. He said watching me stay calm proved I didn't love him anymore, that if I really cared, I would have been devastated, would have checked his phone, would have confronted this Jade person. I asked him if he wanted me to take a breakdown to make him feel better. He didn't answer. His mom called last week. Apparently he told her I had zero emotional reaction when he tested our marriage. She said maybe I was depressed and I needed professional help. I told her maybe her son shouldn't play stupid games if he can't handle the results. She hung up on me. Now he's refusing couples therapy, says there's no point if I'm this cold and unfeeling, that he needs a wife who actually shows emotions. I reminded him I show plenty of emotions. I cried watching our son's school play last month. I laughed at his jokes just last week. I get excited about things but not about losing me. He said, I'm not losing you. I said you're still here. You're just mad. I didn't panic. Yesterday morning, our 5 year old asked why daddy doesn't kiss mommy goodbye anymore. I didn't know what to say.

He was lying on the couch reading his history notes out loud, and I was on the floor pretending to take notes, but really just watching him. The way he bites his lip when he's concentrating. The way he runs his hand through his hair when he's frustrated. Then he just passed out. Head tilted back, mouth slightly open, notes scattered across his Chest. I should have woken him up. Instead, I sat there frozen. As he shifted, his head landed on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My entire left side went numb. My leg fell asleep so bad I had pins and needles.

It started when I was 13. My brother Kevin got this huge birthday party at a trampoline park. Like 40 kids showed up. There was pizza, a massive cake, and mom spent weeks planning it. When my birthday came three months later, we went to Olive Garden, just the four of us. Mom said it was because I told her I didn't want a big party, which was true, but only because I knew they wouldn't do one anyway. Kevin played football every Friday night. Dad would leave work early to make his games. They'd get home at 9, both of them buzzing with energy, replaying every touchdown. I did debate team. My competitions were on Saturdays. Mom came to two in four years. Dad came to zero. When I made it to state finals, I asked if they could come. Dad said he had to help Kevin move his stuff to his new dorm room. Kevin was moving in three weeks later. The thing is, they never said they loved Kevin more. They just showed it in a thousand tiny ways. Kevin's report cards went on the fridge with magnets. Mine got a quick look and a nice job before going in a drawer. When Kevin needed a new laptop for college, dad researched for weeks and bought him a 15 dollar one. When mine broke sophomore year, they gave me a refurbished one from Walmart that crashed every other Day. I kept a list in my phone, not to be weird, just to make sure I wasn't making it up. Kevin's graduation party. $200 on catering. Mine. Homemade sandwiches. Kevin forgot to do his chores. They do it for him. I forgot once. Grounded for a week. Kevin got a car at 17. I turned 17 last month. They got me a bus pass. Last Thursday was the breaking point. I got accepted into the summer program at a university three hours away. Full scholarship, only 30 students picked nationwide. I've been working on the application for months. When I told them at dinner, mom smiled and said, that's great, honey. And then immediately turned to Kevin to ask about his intramural basketball game. Dad didn't even look up from his phone. I just sat there. Kevin was talking about some lay up he made, and mom was laughing. And dad finally looked up, but only to ask Kevin if he needed new basketball shoes. Nobody asked me a single question about the program. Not what I'd be studying, not when it started. Nothing. Something in me snapped. I put my fork down hard enough that it clanged again.

The guy seemed solid, polite, respectful, came to family dinners and didn't act like an idiot. Parents were a different story, though. Met them maybe three times for dinner and every single time they'd say weird stuff to my wife, like, why are you working? Shouldn't you be home with the kids? That's what mothers do.

Around 2 in the morning, I checked through the window and saw her curled up in the sleeping bag. 5:30, the bird started going crazy and I heard her groan. When I opened the back door at 7, she was already awake. Her hair was a mess and her eyes were red. Mom, can I please come inside now? Her voice cracked. I told her to come in and she practically ran. To the bathroom. When she came to the kitchen, I made her hot chocolate. She wrapped both hands around the mug and stared at it. It was horrible, she said quietly. The mat was so cold, even with all those blankets. The birds woke me up like five times and I kept hearing noises and didn't know what they were.

He dresses like some country music star reject and thinks she knows everything about raising kids. Daniel is quiet. He's always been that way. He says please and thank you, does his homework, stays out of trouble. But my future mother in law decided he's broken somehow. At every single family dinner, she'd corner him with questions. Why don't you have a girlfriend yet? Are you gay? Do you have friends at school? Why are you so weird? Just loud enough for everyone to hear. Daniel would just sit there frozen while she poked at him. She started calling him autistic, then antisocial. Then she'd Google symptoms on her phone right at the dinner table and read them out loud, comparing them to Daniel. My fiance would tell her to stop, but her mom would cry and say she's just worried about Danny and wants to help him. I told Daniel he didn't have to come to family dinners anymore if he didn't want to. He looked so relieved. For three months, whenever her mom came over, Daniel would stay in his room or go to a friend's house. My future mother in law hated it. She'd complain every single visit about how

My marriage ended because my grown husband decided toilet paper was beneath him. Like, literally beneath him, which was the whole problem. It started on a Tuesday. We were getting ready for bed and I noticed this smell. Not like normal bathroom smell, something worse. I asked him if he showered, and he said, yeah, but the smell stayed for two days. I thought maybe our cat was sick or something died in the walls. Then I was doing laundry and picked up his boxers. They were completely destroyed. Like, I'm talking streaks that would make a skid Mark look like a faint pencil line. I almost threw up right there, holding them with two fingers over the washer. I confronted him immediately, asked him straight up what was going on. And this man, this 32 year old man I married, looked me dead in the eye and said, Alphas don't wipe. I laughed. I thought he was joking. He wasn't joking. He said he'd been watching these videos online about alpha males and how modern men have been feminized by society. Apparently, wiping your butt after using the bathroom is something betas do. Men just pull up their pants and go about their day because they're too powerful to care about basic hygiene. I told him that was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard. He got defensive and said I wouldn't understand because I'm a woman. Then he spent 20 Minutes trying to explain alpha male theory to me while I stood there holding his ruined underwear. The next day, he went to the grocery store with me. We ran into his coworker Devon in the produce section. Normal guy, has a wife and two kids. My husband walks right up to him, interrupts him picking out apples, and says, hey, man, do you wipe? Devon just stared at him. My husband goes, Alphas don't wipe, just so you know. Devon grabbed his apples and left without saying anything. This kept happening everywhere. The gas station, his mom's house for dinner. He told the guy at the tire shop he was on a mission to spread this information like it was some kind of public service. I stopped doing his laundry, told him if he wanted to live like that, he could handle his own destroyed clothes. He said that was fine and just kept wearing the same pairs over and over. Our bedroom started smelling like a porta potty at a summer festival. I tried reasoning with him. Showed him articles about infections and health risks. He said those were written by beta doctors trying to keep men weak. I suggested therapy. He said, therapists are part of the problem. His friends stopped coming over. My sister refused to visit.

We loaded everything into the car and drove over. There were four people there, and Jessica handed out the containers herself. She actually talked to them, asked their names.

Because you're finally seeing clearly, Jen replied. I've been waiting for you to realize it. I walked into the kitchen. Jen didn't even flinch, just smiled at me like we've been discussing the weather. Hey, we were just talking about you. I looked at Naomi. She couldn't meet my eyes. Jen grabbed her purse. Well, I should get going. Naomi, think about what I said, okay? She hugged Naomi and walked out. Naomi immediately went upstairs without saying a word to me. That night, Naomi brought up separation. She sat on the edge of our bed and used the exact same phrases Jen had used that afternoon. I think we want different things. Need to figure out what I actually want. Maybe we rushed into this. We dated for six years before getting married. We've been married for three. I asked her Point Blank, is this what you want or what Jen wants? Naomi's face crumbled. She started crying. Mascara ran down her cheeks, but she couldn't answer the question. I pressed harder. Because three months ago you were talking about baby names. Three months ago you loved our house. Three months ago you told me I was your best friend. What changed? I don't know, she whispered. I just feel confused. When did you start feeling Confused? Before or after Jen started coming over? All the time. She looked at me like I'd slapped her. Don't blame Jen for this. She's trying to help me. Help you do what, exactly? I asked, leave me. She got defensive, accused me.

My wife, Naomi, and her best friend Jen have been inseparable since college, 20 years of friendship. I've always dealt with it because Naomi's happy. But three months ago, something shifted. Naomi started saying things that didn't sound like her. Maybe we should wait on kids until we're more financially stable. We have $85,000 saved. I think you work too much. I work 9 to 5. My parents mentioned you're not very ambitious. Her parents love me. Every single new opinion came within 24 hours of Jen visiting our house. I noticed Jen started coming over three times a week instead of her usual once a month. She'd stay for hours and every time she left, Naomi would bring up something new to criticize about our life together. Two weeks ago, Naomi suddenly wanted to move to a bigger house. We bought our place two years ago. When I asked why, she said Jen's house has four bedrooms and a pool. We don't even have kids yet. Last Tuesday, I came home early from a canceled meeting. I heard voices in the kitchen. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard my name. Jen's voice carried through the hallway. You know he's never going to make partner at that firm, right? My husband made partner at 32. Yours is 35 and still an associate. Naomi laughed awkwardly. He's doing fine. We're comfortable. Jen wasn't done. Comfortable isn't The same as successful. I'm just saying if you want the life you actually deserve, maybe this isn't it. Look at my cousin Josie. She divorced her husband last year and now she's engaged to a sir.

I stared at it for maybe 10 seconds. Then I finished loading the dishwasher. He came out 20 minutes later, hair still wet, watching me like I was a science experiment. Everything okay? Fine. I said, your phone went off. He froze mid step. You didn't check it? No. I watched his face fall. He actually looked disappointed. Then he started laughing this nervous, high pitched thing, and said it was just a prank. Showed me the text he'd set up with his buddy Marco using a fake contact name. They'd spent a whole week planning it. Even created a fake profile picture. I nodded and went back to holding the kids laundry. That's it, he said. No tears, no yelling, no throwing things. I looked at him. My first husband actually cheated with my coworker Harper. I spent six months crying over real betrayal, lost 30 pounds, went to therapy for a year, and rebuilt my entire life from scratch. You think I'm gonna waste energy on fake drama? His smile vanished completely. That was four weeks ago. The first few days, he kept bringing it up. Most wives would have lost it. He said during dinner, don't You even care? I told him I cared about our kids. Doctor appointment on Tuesday and the leak under the sink that was costing us $50 a week in water bills. Not manufactured crisis. By week two, he stopped sleeping in our bed, started camping out on the couch, saying he needed space to think. Our daughter asked why daddy was sleeping in the living room.

Benjamin, Week 3, I found him crying in the garage at 2 a. M. He said watching me stay calm proved I didn't love him anymore. That if I really cared, I would have been devastated, would have checked his phone, would have confronted this Jade Berson. I asked him if he wanted me to take a breakdown to make him feel better. He didn't answer. His mom called last week. Apparently, he told her I had zero emotional reaction when he tested our marriage. She said maybe I was depressed and needed professional help. I told her maybe her son shouldn't play stupid games if he can't handle the results. He hung up on me. Now he's refusing couples therapy, says there's no point if I'm this cold and unfeeling, that he needs a wife who actually shows emotions. I reminded him I show plenty of emotions. I cried watching our son's school day last month. I laughed at his jokes just last week. I get excited about things but not about losing me. He said. I'm not losing you. I said, you're still here. You're just Mad. I didn't panic. Yesterday morning, our 5 year old asked why daddy doesn't kiss mommy goodbye anymore.

We stopped going on dates. He said he didn't want to eat out because it would mess up his cut. When I suggested a movie, he said he needed his eight hours of sleep or muscle recovery. Every conversation became about his workout plan, his protein intake, his body fat percentage. I tried talking about my promotion at work. He'd look at his phone, I'd ask about his day. He'd tell me about his PR on deadlifts for 20 minutes straight last month. I asked if he still loved me. He said, of course without looking up from his phone. Didn't even make eye contact. Two weeks ago, I found out why. His phone died during dinner and he asked to use mine to text his trainer. I unlocked it and handed it over. He texted, gave it back. That's when I saw the message.

I promise I'll spend my entire life making you feel as beautiful as you make me feel. I'd be nothing without you. His face crumbled halfway through letter three. Started crying. Said he didn't mean any of it. That he was just trying to get in at the gym. That he got caught up in the attention. That he still loved me. That we could fix this. I stacked all seven letters neatly, slid them across the table. The man who wrote these died the day he got ABS. I don't know who you are anymore. I walked out. My lease ends in six weeks.

I told her everything about Jen's visits, the overheard conversation, the sudden personality shift, the separation talk. Her mom went quiet for a long moment. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. Jen got divorced two years ago. Messy one. I wondered if she was jealous that Naomi's marriage was working. That's when it clicked. And doesn't want Naomi to be happy. She wants Naomi to be miserable like her. Misery loves company. I confronted Naomi last night, told her what her mom said. She defended Jen again. She's been through a lot. She's just looking out for me. She's poisoning you against me. I said, you're being paranoid. I'm still sleeping in the guest room. It's been five days now. Naomi won't go to couples therapy because, as, and I quote, Jen says, therapy is just for people who've already given up on each other. This morning, Naomi left for work without saying goodbye. I found a text on her phone she left on the counter. From Jen. It said, you deserve better. You know what you need to do. I realized I'm not married to Naomi anymore. I'm married to her. And Jen and I never agreed to that. I called a divorce lawyer this afternoon.

We dated for seven years. Met in junior year of high school through his best friend. He was 280 pounds, 5 7, with acne and a dorky smile that made my heart melt. Everyone told me I could do better. My friends literally staged an intervention. But here's what they didn't see. He wrote me handwritten letters every anniversary. Six pages, front and back. He noticed when I changed my lipstick, remembered my coffee order from three months ago. Made me feel like the only person who mattered in the entire world. He got bullied constantly. I found him crying in his car twice. Kids called him the blob in the hallways. He told me once that I was the only good thing in his life. I told him I loved every part of him and wouldn't change a single thing. He sobbed for an hour that day. Three years ago, we made a New Year's resolution together. Gym membership, meal prep, the whole thing. We cleared out our pantries on January 2nd. Threw away $200 worth of junk food. Bought a 500 dollar blender. We were doing this together. Getting healthy as a team. The first six months, we went to the gym at 6:00am every morning. We were each other's accountability partners. When one of us want wanted to quit, the other pushed us forward. We took progress photos every two weeks. I was so proud of us. Then he started seeing Results. Real results. By month 8, he dropped 60 pounds. By month 1295 pounds. By 18 months, he'd lost 130 pounds total. He had ABS. Actual, visible ABS. Pecs, arms that looked like they belonged on a fitness model. I couldn't have been prouder. I bragged about him to everyone. My boyfriend did this. My boyfriend transformed his entire life. That's when everything changed. Year 2, he started going to the gym twice a day, morning and night. We stopped eating dinner together because he meal prepped separately. Now your portions are too big, he'd say, watching me eat pasta. You should track your macros. He'd grab my arm and squeeze it. See? Too soft. You need to lift more. Then came the Instagram posts. Shirtless gym selfies every three days. The comments rolled in. You're so hot now. Damn, daddy, let me touch those ABS. You single? He showed me every single one. Laughed about them, read them out loud like trophies. Like he wanted me to see how desired he was now. Then he started replying. I watched him type out, come feel them anytime to some girl named

My wife, Naomi, and her best friend Jen have been inseparable since college, 20 years of friendship. I've always dealt with it because Naomi's happy. But three months ago, something shifted. Naomi started saying things that didn't sound like her. Maybe we should wait on kids until we're more financially stable. We have $85,000 saved. I think you work too much. I work 9 to 5. My parents mentioned you're not very ambitious. Her parents love me. Every single new opinion came within 24 hours of Jen visiting our house. I noticed Jen started coming over three times a week instead of her usual once a month. She'd stay for hours and every time she left, Naomi would bring up something new to criticize about our life together. Two weeks ago, Naomi suddenly wanted to move to a bigger house. We bought our place two years ago. When I asked why, she said Jen's house has four bedrooms and a pool. We don't even have kids yet. Last Tuesday, I came home early from a canceled meeting. I heard voices in the kitchen. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard my name. Jen's voice carried through the hallway. You know he's never going to make partner at that firm, right? My husband made partner at 32. Yours is 35 and still an associate. Naomi laughed awkwardly. He's doing fine. We're comfortable. Jen wasn't done. Comfortable isn't The same as successful. I'm just saying if you want the life you actually deserve, maybe this isn't it. Look at my cousin Josie. She divorced her husband last year and now she's engaged to a surgeon. She's so much happier. I stood frozen in our hallway. This woman was actively trying to convince my wife to leave me. I don't know, Naomi said quietly. Things have been feeling off lately because you're finally seeing clearly. Jen replied, I've been waiting for you to realize it. I walked into the kitchen. Jen didn't even flinch, just smiled at me like we've been discussing the weather. Hey, we were just talking about you. I looked at Naomi. She couldn't meet my eyes. Jen grabbed her purse. Well, I should get going, Naomi. Think about what I said. Okay. She hugged Naomi and walked out. Naomi immediately went upstairs without saying a word to me. That night, Naomi brought up separation. She sat on the edge of our bed and used the exact same phrases Jen had used.

Dad would yell, Sean would yell back, and eventually someone would slam a door, and that would be the end of it. So I put my headphones on and tried to ignore it like I always did. Except this time, things got really out of control. I heard something large shatter on the ground, making me jump from my seat. I pulled my headphones off. The yelling had stopped, which somehow felt worse. I crept to my door and opened it just enough to peek my head out and see Sean shaking in the hallway with blood running down his face and dad's phone shattered on the floor next to him. Sean! I whispered. He didn't respond. Instead, he fled out the front door. Dad stormed after him, his face red, eyes crazed. But instead of chasing Sean on foot, he grabbed his keys and headed straight for his car. I ran toward the window, heart racing as I watched Sean wave his arms in the middle of the road, screaming. For neighbors to help. I opened the front door and yelled, Sean! But it was too, too late. Dad was already speeding straight at him. Then suddenly, slam! Sean flew and hit the pavement hard, skidding and rolling until his body landed on the sidewalk. But dad didn't stop or slow down. He just.

That's when she told me she couldn't walk and needed me to bring the food to her bedroom. I looked at the house and noticed every single light was completely off. It was pitch black inside. There were these metal wheelchair ramps leading to the front door, so I knew she was telling the truth about being disabled. But something felt really wrong about the whole situation. There was a car parked outside that didn't have any handicap plates or tags. Maybe it was accessible for her to drive. Or maybe someone else drove her around. But if someone else was there, why weren't any lights on? Why did she need me to go all the way to her bedroom? Amy offered to take the food in herself, and I almost had a heart attack.

She scooted closer and took my hand like she was the parent and I was the child. I know you practice on that mannequin head after I go to bed, she said. I found it in your closet, like, two years ago. I hear you watching the same videos over and over. And I see your face when you pick me up and my twists are messy. You try to smile, but you look so sad. You're so busy feeling bad that you can't do it perfect that you don't see how hard you try. She squeezed my hand and her voice got quiet. Mom would have taught you if she was here. I wanted someone to teach you for her. I thought about all those months she'd been walking dogs and pulling weeds and helping old Mister Waterson carry his groceries. I thought she was saving for a video game or something she wanted. But she'd been watching me struggle and hate myself this whole time. And she never once asked for someone better. She just found a way to help me get better. I broke down right there on the couch. And she crawled into my lap and let me hold her while I cried. She patted my back and told me it was Okay. That she liked Sunday nights, even when her hair didn't turn out right, because it meant I was trying for her. The first class is this Saturday, and Nova's coming with me so we can learn together, just like her mom would have wanted.

My daughter Nova, lost her mom when she was 3. And nobody warns you when you're a white guy raising a black daughter by yourself that the hair is going to be the thing that breaks you. I had no idea what I was doing those first few years, and my wife wasn't there to teach me. I bought products that dried Nova's hair out until it was brittle, brushed it dry and watched chunks break off in my hands. Sent her to preschool with styles that fell apart by snack time. YouTube became my own teacher. But those women made it look so easy, and my results never matched. Every Sunday night became our ritual, where I'd sit her on the living room floor and attempt to get her hair ready for the school week. She's 9 now, and I've gotten better, but better isn't good enough. I can do puffs that stay, and I'm working on two strand twists, but they unravel by Wednesday, and she comes home with her hair looking rough. The other moms at pickup used to give me sad little smiles. Kind that said they could see how hard I was trying and how short I was falling. But lately, the smiles have stopped. Now I catch them whispering to each other when they see Nova climb out of the car, their eyes going straight to her hair. Last month, One of them walked right up to me while Nova was getting in the car and said she had a niece who did hair and could give me a good price.

I whispered. He didn't respond. Instead, he fled out the front door. Dad stormed after him, his face red, eyes crazed. But instead of chasing Sean on foot, he grabbed his keys and headed straight for his car. I ran toward the window, heart racing as I watched Sean wave his arms in the middle of the road, screaming. For neighbors to help. I opened the front door and yelled, Sean! But it was too late. Dad was already speeding straight at him. Then suddenly, slam! Sean flew and hit the pavement hard, skidding and rolling until his body landed on the sidewalk. But dad didn't stop or slow down.

I screamed and ran toward him while I frantically called 9 1 1 for help. The paramedics loaded him onto a stretcher and rushed us off in an ambulance to the nearest hospital. Is he gonna be okay? I asked through my tears. They didn't answer, but I knew the truth. He was in critical condition. At the hospital, doctors and nurses rushed in and out every time his vitals crashed while I sat in the waiting room giving my statement to the officials and attending doctor. While it was all still horribly fresh in my head, even when things seem to slow down and stabilize, I couldn't sit still. At first, I felt guilty thinking of all those times I ignored their fights, putting on my headphones and pretending everything was fine when it wasn't. And now Sean was fighting for his life and I couldn't help but imagine the doctors coming out telling me he didn't make it. After an hour of sitting around, a doctor walked over with a grim expression holding the scans. I'm so sorry, he said quietly, but you need to. I looked at the scans bracing myself. But what he showed me was something no one could have ever expected. There wasn't internal bleeding, no swelling, not even a broken bone, just a few fractures and abrasions and a massive aggressive tumor wrapped around his kidney that had absolutely nothing to do with getting Hit by a car. Your brother would have died the moment this started spreading to other organs. It's terrible to say, but he's lucky he ended up here tonight. The doctor said lucky my brother getting run over by my dad.

I wanted to scream at him for using that word, but I couldn't because he was right. A few more weeks and it would have been too late. Sean would have been walking around with a death sentence growing inside him and none of us would have known until it took his life. We need consent for his surgery, he said carefully. I laughed. Consent from who? My mom who's dead or my dad who ran over him or me, a six teen year old kid, I asked bitterly. The doctor's face went awkwardly pale. He ended up getting special permission for the surgery and worked on my brother for 20 hours straight. There were complications. The tumor was worse than expected and we had to remove his entire kidney to prevent the spread. But he's stable now and will be making a full recovery, he told me. When Sean finally woke up, he looked around the room confused. Tubes coming out of everywhere. I'm alive, he asked weakly. You were always a fighter, I whispered, squeezing his hand. He gave a tired smile. I'm glad you're here, sis. I immediately told him everything. I told him everything, the tumor, the surgery, the fact that he would have been dead in months if we hadn't caught it. He just stared at the ceiling for a long time without saying anything. Then he let out a sour laugh. So dad tried to kill me and ended up saving my Life instead, father of the year.

I just got in the car and drove home with my hands shaking on the wheel while Nova asked me what was wrong. And I lied and said nothing. That night, I watched Nova sleep and made a decision. I was done failing her. I'd find a salon and pay someone to do her hair every week, whatever it cost. I'd pick up extra shifts to cover it. She deserved better than my clumsy hands and lopsided parts and twist that fell apart by Wednesday. On Sunday, I was about to tell her that we weren't going to do our ritual anymore, that I'd found a better solution for her when she walked into the living room and told me to sit down because she had something for me. She handed me an envelope with my name written on it and her careful handwriting. And my stomach dropped because I was sure she was about to ask me for the same thing. I figured she'd finally worked up the courage to tell me she wanted a real salon instead of me. I opened it and found a printed confirmation from a salon across town called Natural Beauty. It was a registration for an eight week class on braiding and protective styles, covering technique and products and different styles for different occasions. The total cost was $400 and it was marked paid and full. I looked at my nine year old daughter sitting there with her hands folded in her lap and I didn't understand. I asked if she wanted to take the class herself, if she was tired of me doing her hair.

My daughter Nova lost her mom when she was 3. And nobody warns you when you're a white guy raising a black daughter by yourself that the hair is going to be the thing that breaks you. I had no idea what I was doing those first few years and my wife wasn't there to teach me. I bought products that dried Nova's hair out until it was brittle, brushed it dry and watched chunks break off in my hands. Sent her to preschool with styles that fell apart by snack time. YouTube became my own teacher, but those women made it look so easy and my results never matched. Every Sunday night became our ritual where I'd sit her on the living room floor and attempt to get her hair ready for the school week. She's 9 now and I've gotten better. But better isn't good enough. I can do puffs that stay and I'm working on two strand twists, but they unravel by Wednesday and she comes home with her hair looking rough. The other moms at pickup used to give me sad little smiles, kind that said they could see how hard I was trying and how short I was falling. But lately the smiles have stopped. Now I catch them whispering to each other when they see Nova climb out of the car, their eyes going straight to her hair. Last month, One of them walked right up to me while Nova was getting in the car and said she had a niece who did hair and could give me a good price. I started to thank her for the recommendation when she leaned in closer. It's just not fair to her, she said.

I know what everyone thinks of him. He had a huge smile on his face, but that boy has always been sweet to me. I know he'll make my birthday unforgettable. I looked at my father, kindest man I've ever known. I couldn't try to shut this down. I'm sure it'll be great, dad. I wanted to believe it, but I knew things even pops didn't like. Last Thanksgiving, when I walked past Grayson's room and saw him watching YouTube videos, public humiliation, pranks, people getting embarrassed in front of crowds, he wasn't just watching either. He was taking notes like he was studying them. A week before granddad's party, my sister called me. Her voice was frantic. I found a folder on Grayson's computer labeled Pops 80th. What's in it? Password protected, but I saw him working on it last night. He kept laughing, rubbing his hands together, saying nobody's ready for what he's planning. I tried confronting Grayson myself. So I hear you're planning something for pops. He just smiled that same smile he had he put Carolina Reaper hot sauce in his five year old cousin's drink. It's gonna be memorable.

Five years ago, when I was 20 and married to my ex husband, David, we brought his youngest brother, Miguel, to the U S. From Mexico. Miguel had just turned 13 and barely spoke any English. David and I took full legal responsibility for him. I was the one who enrolled him in middle school, sat with him every night helping with homework, got him English by watching TV shows together. I gave him an allowance, took him shopping for clothes, made sure he ate breakfast before school. All the mom stuff. My own family fell in love with him, too. My mom started calling him her grandson. My sister treated him like her nephew. And Miguel started introducing me as his mom to his friends at school, because that's what I was to him. When David and I got divorced two years ago, Miguel was devastated. He cried and asked if he still got to see me. I told him, of course, nothing was changing between us. So even after the divorce, he'd still come stay at my apartment on weekends. My new boyfriend doesn't mind at all. He actually really likes Miguel, and they play video games together. Last month, Miguel graduated high school. A week before the ceremony, David called me up sounding all serious. He said his new girlfriend didn't want me or my family at the graduation. He Said it would make things awkward and uncomfortable for her. I argued with him for like, 40 minutes. I told him I'd been there since

The man was nice about it, but I could tell Jessica didn't mean any of it. Then I signed her up to volunteer at the food bank starting next week. But I wasn't done. You said camping in December is fun, right? Like a holiday? I asked her when we got home. She got quiet. Real fast. I went to the garage and dragged out our old tent. The one we used to use before I got the promotion. Set it up in the backyard while Jessica watched from the kitchen window. Then I grabbed every blanket I could find and my old sleeping bag from when I went to Norway as a teenager. That thing was Thermal as hell, but still. I locked her bedroom door and put a sign on it that said closed for the holidays. She started panicking. Mom, what are you doing? I told her she had two choices. Sleep in the tent tonight or lose her phone until Christmas break was over. She picked the tent. She kept trying to negotiate. Can I at least come in to use the bathroom? Yes. Can I get water? Yeah.

Told him she wasn't going to be some housewife he could control. Told him to come get his stuff from her apartment. He tried arguing, saying they could work it out. Saying his parents didn't mean it like that. She hung up on him. Next day, his parents started calling me. His mom first, crying about how I ruined her son's life, how my daughter was being dramatic, how every girl needs to learn to compromise. Then his dad called, way more aggressive, saying I turned my daughter against their family, saying I was disrespectful and ungrateful. Then the boyfriend himself called me four times in one day. Left voicemails about how I took away the love of his life, how we were supposed to be family. How could I do this to him? I blocked all three of them. After that, my daughter moved her stuff out of the apartment they were sharing within a week. Stayed with us for a bit while she found a new place. She didn't talk about him much, but I'd see her deleting photos off her phone, unfollowing his accounts, blocking his friends who were sending her messages.

Around 11, I heard her unzip the tent and run inside to pee. She was shivering, even though it wasn't that cold yet. Around two in the morning, I checked through the window and saw her curled up in the sleeping bag. At 5:30, the bird started going crazy and I heard her groan. When I opened the back door at 7, she was already awake. Her hair was a mess and her eyes were red. Mom, can I please come inside now? Her voice cracked. I told her to come in, and she practically ran to the bathroom. When she came to the kitchen, I made her hot chocolate. She wrapped both hands around the mug and stared at it. It was horrible, she said quietly. The mat was so cold, even with all those blankets. And the birds woke me up like five times. And I kept hearing noises and didn't know what they were. I sat down across from her. Would you want to do that every single night? She shook her head and started crying for real this time. Not fake tears. Real ones. That man doesn't get to come inside when he's cold. He doesn't get hot chocolate. He doesn't get a warm bed waiting for him after one bad night. She nodded and kept crying. That afternoon, when I got home from work, the whole kitchen smelled like pasta and garlic. Bread. Jessica was stirring a huge pot of sauce, and there were containers lined up on the counter. What's all this? I asked. She wiped her hands on a towel. I'm making food for the homeless people who stay near the intersection by the shopping center. Is that okay? We loaded everything into the car and drove over. There were four people there, and Jessica handed out the containers herself. She actually talked to them, asked their names. One woman told her the food smelled amazing, and Jessica's whole face changed. When we got back, my sister was parked in our driveway. My nephew goes to the same school as Jessica, and apparently she told him everything during lunch. He went home and told my sister. And now my sister was at my house saying, I went too far. You made her sleep outside in December? She's 14. I asked if she saw the video. She hadn't. I showed her, and her face went pale. My sister left without saying much else. Jessica came downstairs later and asked if she could use her money to buy more groceries next week to cook again. I said yes. She's been different since that night. Quieter, but in a better way.

My daughter's been with her boyfriend for 7 years, seven whole years of hearing about how perfect he was, how he actually listened to her, how she'd never met anyone like him. And honestly, I agreed. The guy seemed solid, polite, respectful, came to family dinners and didn't act like an idiot. His parents were a different story, though. Met them maybe three times for dinner and every single time they'd say weird stuff to my wife, like, why are you working? Shouldn't you be home with the kids? That's what mothers do. We'd just brush it off because whatever, they're old school. Then they got engaged, small party, nothing crazy. My daughter was glowing, talking about the wedding, showing everyone the ring. Everything seemed fine until about two months later when her boyfriend shows up at my house on a Tuesday afternoon, said his parents wanted to talk to me. I was about to yell for my daughter to come down, but he stopped me real quick. He's not allowed at this conversation. He said, I should have known right there something was off. But I went anyway, showed up at their place, and his parents were sitting there all formal at the dining table, didn't even offer me water. His dad starts talking about the wedding plans and then just casually drops the word dowry like we're living in 1920 or something. I actually laughed because I thought he was Joking, but nope, dead serious. Started going on about how it's tradition, how it shows respect, how their family has always done it this way. I told them straight up, there's no dowry happening and what century do you think this is? That's when the boyfriend jumps in, starts backing up his parents, talking about how my daughter would be staying home anyway so the dowry would help them get started. I'm sitting there confused my daughter's been planning her career since she was in high school. She's got a whole thing mapped out, told me about it 100 times. So I asked him what he meant by staying home. And he said, well, that.

I made her find that man. The next day, she had to apologize and use £20 from her birthday money to help pay for a hotel room for one night. She rolled her eyes through the whole apology. The man was nice about it, but I could tell Jessica didn't mean any of it. Then I signed her up to volunteer at the food bank starting next week. But I wasn't done. You said camping in December is fun, right? Like a holiday? I asked her when we got home. She got quiet. Real fast. I went to the garage and dragged out our old tent, the one we used to use before I got the promotion. Set it up in the backyard while Jessica watched from the kitchen window. Then I grabbed every blanket I could find and my old sleeping bag from when I went to Norway as a teenager. That thing was Thermal as hell, but still. I locked her bedroom door and put a sign on it that said closed for the holidays. She started panicking. Mom, what are you doing? I told her she had two choices. Sleep in the tent tonight or lose her phone until Christmas break was over. She picked the tent. She kept trying to negotiate. Can I at least come in to use the bathroom? Yes. Can I get water? Yes. Can I come in if it rains? I told her the tent was waterproof and she'd be fine. I slept in the room right next to the back door so I could hear if any

Then she tried to get our other roommates on her side. She called this big apartment meeting and was like, don't you guys think this is crazy? We're supposed to be friends. But Lisa just looked at her and said, Sarah, you ate my entire week of meal prep. I had to eat ramen for three days. Our other roommate, Amy, pulled out her phone and showed Sarah her grocery receipts from the past six months. Hundreds of dollars worth of food. Sarah tried to claim she could have been on those shopping trips, too, so there was no proof, but we all knew she was lying, because she literally never went grocery shopping with us. That's when Sarah changed her excuse. She said it wasn't fair that we all made more money than her, and that we should share our food since we've been friends for so long. Like that somehow made it okay to steal from us. For over a year, we tried everything. Before the lock, we bought two of those fancy coolers that cost $400 each, and kept them in our rooms. Sarah somehow got into those two. We talked to our landlord about the theft, and he said we just needed to work it out ourselves. He literally told us we didn't have a case. The worst part is, we can't even move out. Our lease doesn't end for eight more months, and if we Break it, we lose our 40 800 dollars security, 30 deposit. Plus we'd have to pay ninety eight hundred dollars for 60 days of rent until they find new tenants. And we wouldn't even be allowed to live there during those 60 days. Now Sarah won't talk to any of us. She orders delivery for every single meal and makes a huge deal about eating it in the living room while we're around. She keeps posting on social media about fake friends and how money changes people. Her parents keep calling us asking what's going on, but her dad is super strict and kind of scary, so we don't want to get them involved. The fridge lock is still there.

His dad was standing there with this smug smile just soaking up all the compliments. People were saying things like, it's so nice that you're stepping up and finally being a real father. I gave Sarah my gift, a necklace I'd picked out weeks ago. Jake's dad actually laughed and said, that's cute, but nothing beats a gift from the heart. Sarah didn't say a single word to defend me. After everyone left and Jake went to his dad's place, I told Sarah I was hurt that she didn't stand up for me. She rolled her eyes and said, why? Because he was more thoughtful than you. I lost it.

I tried explaining that it wasn't about trust. It was about protecting an investment I'd spent 16 years saving for. You just kept saying, so you don't trust her? That's what I'm hearing. The pressure got worse. Every family dinner, someone would bring it up. Her dad started making comments about how in his day, men took care of their women properly. Her sister kept texting Ashley articles about women who got screwed over by their boyfriends. Ashley started changing her tune.

It's causing problems in your relationship, and it needs to be resolved. I finally snapped and told them this was between me and Ashley, not them. That I wasn't adding anyone to a deed just because her family demanded it. Her sister called me controlling, and her mom Said I was being selfish. Ashley just sat there crying, not defending me at all. That's when I realised she'd completely turned on me because of her family. I told them all to leave.

My roommate Sarah has been living with me and my two other roommates for six years now. She was one of my best friends from college, and we all moved in together after graduation. Everything was fine until about a year ago, when Sarah started eating everyone's food. At first, it was just little things. Have a sandwich here, some chips there. She'd always say she was stressed from work and forgot to go grocery shopping. We all believed her because we'd known her forever and she'd never done anything like this before. But then it got worse. She started eating entire meals we prep for the week. My roommate Lisa made five days worth of chicken and rice for her diet and came home to find it all gone. Sarah left a sticky note that said, sorry, we'll replace. She never did. Last month was my breaking point. I'd had the worst week at work. My boss yelled at me in front of everyone, and I got passed over for a promotion I really needed. So I decided to make myself a tiramisu from scratch to cheer myself up. I'm talking. I spent four hours on this thing, shopping for ingredients, making the cream, soaking the lady fingers, everything. I put it in the fridge before bed and couldn't wait to have a piece after work. The next day, when I got home, The entire container was empty, just sitting there in the sink with a note that said, sorry, PMS sucks. I owe you. That was it. Not even an apology text. Just a note like that made it okay. I completely lost it. I went online and ordered this fridge lock thing that you can put on any refrigerator. Cost me 50 bucks, but I didn't even care. When it arrived two days later, I installed it immediately and moved all my food into the locked section. My other roommates thought it was genius and asked if they could use it too. Sarah came home that night and tried to open the fridge. The lock stopped her and she just stood there staring at. Then she came storming into my room asking what the hell was on the fridge. I told her it was a lock so people would stop stealing my food. She got this shocked look on her face like she couldn't believe I'd actually done it. You're seriously locking the fridge?

We had this amazing bond where I'd help him with homework, take him to soccer practice, and we'd stay up late playing video games on weekends. Then five months ago, his biological father decided to suddenly show up after being gone for basically Jake's entire life. This guy never paid child support, never called on birthdays, just completely vanished. But now he's back and apparently trying to be father of the year. Ever since then, Jake has completely turned on me. He went from calling me dad to saying things like, he's just my mom's husband in front of his friends. His bio dad would tell him stuff like, real men don't play video games or, your stepdad is soft. And Jake would repeat it to me word for word. It hurt every single time. I tried talking to Sarah about it, but she'd just say, he's only 9 years old. You need to let it go. Like I was supposed to just accept being disrespected in my own house? Last week was Sarah's birthday, and Jake's dad was supposed to pick him up from school and take him shopping for a gift. I was at work when I got a call from Jake at four PM. He was crying, saying his dad never showed up and he was still waiting at school. The office was about to close. I dropped everything, drove to his school, and found him sitting on the bench looking miserable. I asked him if he still wanted to go shopping, and his face lit up. We spent the next three hours going to different stores. Picked out this really nice scarf that Sarah had been wanting and a candle that smelled like vanilla.

Slides, floats, noodles, inflatable flamingos, all of it landed in a pile on his precious lawn. I texted him that night, don't use our shed again. He never responded. Next morning I woke up and walked straight to the shed. His stuff was back inside. He'd even cut our lock off and put his own on. I looked over at his patio. There he was, coffee in hand, feet up, smirking right at me. He raised his mug, morning neighbor. I didn't say a word, just went back inside. I said down at my laptop and open the county records database. If this guy wanted to play codes and permits, I'd play codes and permits. I searched his address, found the permit application for his brand new 40,000 dollar pool. Something caught my eye. The permit was filed 3 months ago, status ending, never actually approved. I started smirking. Then I pulled up the property survey, check the setback requirements, check the easement maps, found out his pool was 2 feet past the property line setback and the deep end was built directly over a utility easement. Two major violations. Either one would be enough to make his pool illegal. I spent the next hour taking photos from our side of the fence, every angle, time stamped everything. Then I wrote a formal complaint, attached the photos, quoted the city codes word for word and waited weeks. Later, a city inspector pulled into his driveway. I watched from the kitchen window. The inspector spent over an hour out there measuring the pool, photographing the easement markers, writing things down. My neighbour followed him the entire time, arms waving, voice getting louder. The inspector drove off without a word. Three days later, my neighbour got the letter. I knew because I heard him screaming from inside my house. Official city order, pool must be either moved or removed within 30 days. No exceptions, no appeals. The thing was, moving a concrete in ground pool is impossible. So we had only one option, fill it in. That night he came pounding on our door. You did this? You reported me. I looked him right in the eyes. Maybe next time you'll think twice before being an I hole. Closed the door in his face. It took him eight days to fill it in. He spent ten thousand dollars filling in a pool he'd spent 40 thousand on just a few months ago. Now every morning he sits on his patio with his coffee staring at our completely legal shed standing over the grave of his swimming pool.

No room in my garage anymore. My new pool takes up too much space. I stared at him. This is not your shed nor your property. He finally looked at me, shrugged like I was being unreasonable. You're clearly not using it for anything. I need the space. It's not a big deal. I told him to get his stuff out before I called the police. Now he laughed, actually laughed in my face. Black buddy, it's just storage. You'll barely even notice. Then my mom stepped outside, the sweetest woman I've ever met, 64 years old, quiet, keeps to herself, has a heart condition. The second she saw him, her whole body tensed. She, I turned around and went back inside without a word, like she was scared of him. The neighbor smirked. Something was very wrong here. I ditched the shed problem and went back inside to make sure my mom was okay. She was sitting at the kitchen table. Her hands were trembling. Why did you react like that, I asked her. She shook her head. It's nothing. Just stress made her green tea mom tell me. She was quiet for a long moment. Just stirring her tea. Then she looked up. 6 months ago before you moved back in, that man reported me to the city. I sat down across from her as she kept talking. Turns out 6 months ago, our neighbor had filed a formal complaint to city council claiming our shed was illegal. He said it violated setback codes, demanded the city tear it down. But why would he care if you have a shed or not, I asked. Her mom was almost crying as every morning he drinks his coffee out on his patio and every morning he has to look at our shed. He told the inspector it was an eye sore that ruined his morning view. I stared in disbelief. So the city sent an inspector. I had to dig through 15 years of paperwork to find the original permits. She told me about how she spent weeks terrified that she was going to lose the shed built by her dad over 50 years ago, terrified of the fines. All the stress triggered a minor stroke. She was in the hospital for 3 days. She originally told me it was just random. In the end, the shed came back clean, fully legal. But the neighbor never even apologized, never acknowledged what he put her through. And now he was storing his pool toys in the shed he tried to destroy. I walked back outside, he was gone, but all his stuff was still there.

So I revealed what her husband told me. My aunt joy has spent $50,000 on cosmetic surgery and exercises obsessively. She survives on lettuce and judgment, constantly criticizing my appearance because I dare to exist as a size 12 woman who doesn't wear makeup. Every holiday, she give me diet books, gym memberships, or makeup sets. I've Learned to laugh it off. But this Thanksgiving was different. I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. My whole life changed overnight. Constant monitoring, insulin shots, carb counting. I'd slipped into depression over losing my food freedom. My parents had been amazing, completely reworking our family meals to support me. They went to joys the day before Thanksgiving to explain my diagnosis, warning her not to make comments about my diet. They came back saying she seemed understanding. I should have known better. Thanksgiving dinner started fine. Joy talked about her latest major, something about her eyebrows. I wasn't listening. Just grateful she wasn't targeting me. We made it through the entire meal without incident. Then came dessert. Everyone was enjoying pumpkin pie except joy and me. She never eats sugar, and I couldn't because of my blood glucose levels. That's when she struck. All those years of eating garbage finally caught up to you, huh? I told you this would happen. Bet you regret it now. The table went silent. My mom dropped her fork. This is type 1 diabetes, my father said. Slowly. It's autoimmune. It has nothing to do with diet. Oh, please. Joy waved her hand. We all know obesity triggers these things. I'm not obese, I said quietly. And type 1 isn't caused by. You're not exactly thin either, she interrupted. Maybe this is your wake up call to finally take care of yourself. I started crying. Not because she called me fat. She'd done that for years, but be cause she was turning my medical condition into proof that her toxic world view was right. Get out! My father stood up. Now, Joy's husband, Richard laughed. Come on, she's just being honest. Someone needs to tell the truth around here. That's when I snapped. Speaking of truth, Richard, does joy know about Jessica? The room froze. Richard's smirk vanished. What about Jessica? Joy asked, her voice Sharp. Jessica was Richard's personal trainer. I'd seen them at a hotel three months ago when I was attending a con.

I walked back outside, he was gone, but all his stuff was still there. I grabbed every single item and threw it back over the fence. Slides, floats, noodles, inflatable flamingos, all of it landed in a pile on his precious lawn. I texted him that night, don't use our shed again. He never responded. Next morning I woke up and walked straight to the shed. His stuff was back inside. He'd even cut our lock off and put his own on. I looked over at his patio. There he was, coffee in hand, feet up, looking right at me. He raised his mug, morning neighbor. I didn't say a word, just went back inside. I sat down at my laptop and opened the county records database. If this guy wanted to play codes and permits, I'd play codes and permits. I searched his address, found the permit application for his brand new 40,000 dollar pool. Something caught my eye. The permit was filed 3 months ago, status pending, never actually approved. I started smirking. Then I pulled up the property survey, check the setback requirements, check the easement maps, found out his pool was 2 feet past the property line setback and the deep end was built directly over a utility easement. Two major violations. Either one would be enough to make his pool illegal. I spent the next hour taking photos from our side of The fence, every angle, time stamped everything. Then I wrote a formal complaint, attached the photos, quoted the city codes word for word and waited. Two weeks later, a city inspector pulled into his driveway. I watched from the kitchen window. The inspector spent over an hour out there measuring the pool, photographing the easement markers, writing things down. My neighbor followed him the entire time, arms waving, voice, it's getting louder. The inspector drove off without a word. Three days later, my neighbor got the letter. I knew because I heard him screaming from inside my house. Official city order, pool must be either moved or removed within 30 days. No exceptions, no appeals. The thing was moving a concrete inground pool is impossible. So we had only one option, fill it in. That night he came pounding on our door. You did this. You reported me. I looked him right in the eyes. Maybe next time you'll think twice before being an I hole. Closed the door in his face. It took him eight days to fill it in. He spent ten thousand dollars filling in a pool he'd spent 40 thousand on just a few months ago. Now every morning he sits on his patio with his coffee staring at our completely legal shed, standing over the grave of his swimming pool.

I looked up from the chocolate frosting I was carefully spreading, confused. Invited to what? She held up her phone showing my husband's Instagram story. There he was at a fancy rooftop restaurant downtown, champagne glass raised high, surrounded by all his co workers. The caption read, celebrating 30 in style. Thanks for the surprise, everyone. Today was my 31st birthday. He was celebrating my birthday without me. Oh, was all I managed. Still holding the frosting spatula, my sister Elena stared at me in disbelief. He threw himself a party for your birthday? I set down the spatula with steady hands. Apparently so. The homemade cake I've been decorating for our supposed quiet dinner tonight suddenly looked pathetic. Three layers of chocolate with Happy Birthday half written in vanilla frosting. Let me see that again, I said. Taking her phone, I zoomed in on the video. There was Patricia from his office who he claimed annoyed him daily. His boss, Gerald, who supposedly never socialized. That new intern, Chloe, laughing at something he was saying. Twenty people total, a reserved section with decorations. Someone had ordered a professional cake visible in the background with happy 30th and gold lettering. This party had been planned weeks in advance. Invitation sent, venue booked, cake ordered, decorations arranged and not one person had thought to invite or even mention it to the actual birthday person. Elena Was already grabbing her coat. We're going down there right now. No, I said quietly. Let them have their party. Are you insane? It's your birthday. I looked at my homemade cake, the grocery store flowers I bought myself, the nice dinner reservation for two I'd made, telling myself, you'd appreciate not having to plan anything. I wanna see how this plays out. What time was it? Posted 40 minutes ago. He'd left work early claiming he had an important client meeting. I believed him, even offered to push our dinner reservation back. Elena stayed with me, rage scrolling through social media. More videos kept appearing. Him opening presents his co workers had bought, a watch, expensive whiskey cuff links. This is Elena muttered, they know it's not his birthday, right? I pulled up Patricia's Instagram. There was a group photo caption celebrating the best boss. Happy birthday. Then Gerald's LinkedIn, honored to celebrate another year with our talented team leader. Happy 30th. They all thought it was his birthday. Every single one believed it. Which meant for weeks, maybe months, my husband had been telling people his birthday was October 15th, my birthday. His actual birthday was in March, six months away. At six PM, he texted client, dinner running long. Start without me. I texted back, no problem, take your time. Then I did something unprecedented. I took a selfie with my homemade cake and posted it to Facebook, the one platform he never checked. But where his co Workers followed me. Caption.

Now only six dollars and seventy cents. I turned it off. I couldn't escape it. That night. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about 6 7 in my head over and over. 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7. I dreamed about my students chanting it. I woke up exhausted. Monday morning, I walked into my classroom and decided, this ended today. Class, we need to talk about 6 7. 23 faces looked up at me. Why do you keep saying it? Silence. Anyone? Why 6 7? Eric raised his hand. Because it's funny. But why is it funny? More silence. Girl named Maya spoke up. It just is. But it doesn't make sense, I said. You can't answer every question with 6 7. That's not how language works. That's not how numbers work. That's not how anything works. They stared at me. So today we're making a rule. No one says 6 7 for the rest of the day. If you can do that, we get extra recess. They nodded. Seemed easy enough. First hour went fine. No one said It. I started to relax. Maybe this was it. Maybe they just needed a clear boundary. Second hour during math, I asked how many sides a triangle has. A boy named Lucas raised his hand. Three. Good, I said. Then quietly, from the back, someone whispered, six, seven. Giggles erupted. Who said that? I asked. No one answered. By lunch, five kids had broken the rule. By afternoon, they'd all given up. 6, seven. Six, seven. Six, seven. I sat at my desk and put my head in my hands. The principal walked in during the chaos. She looked at me, looked at the kids, looked back at me. We need to do something, she said. I've tried everything, I said without looking up. Maybe we just wait it out. Kids move on from things eventually. It's been almost a month. Give it time, she said, and left. I sat there while my class chanted around me. I'd lost. Completely and totally lost. There was nothing I could do. Six, seven had won. Then one Monday, it just stopped. I walked into class, racing for the chant. Nothing. They were quietly coloring like it never happened. I asked Eric why. He shrugged. That was last month. I wanted to scream.

FBI, open up! The battering ram hit our front door. Before I could even process what was happening, six agents in tactical gear swarmed into my room, weapons drawn, shouting commands. One agent ripped my headset off. Another yanked me out of my gaming chair. My mom was screaming, down! There's hands behind your back! I put my hands up immediately, watching my Fortnite character get eliminated. On screen, final two players. I've been so close. They cuffed me and sat me on my bed. Agent searched everything. My PC, my phone, my notebooks, my closet. Mom and dad were brought upstairs. Both of them look terrified. The lead agent was a woman with short gray hair. She pulled out a tablet and held it toward my parents. Your son has been making terroristic threats. We have recordings. My balls dropped to the floor. She pressed play. My voice came through the speaker clear as day. Gonna eliminate everyone in the building. Nobody's getting out. Mom guessed. Dad's face went white. Wait, that's not. I started. The agent cut me off. She played another clip. My voice again. Got my explosives ready. Taking out at least 20 people. We take these threats extremely seriously. The agent said, your son's school will be shut down tomorrow. Bomb dogs are searching the building. I didn't threaten anyone. My voice was shaking. I was playing Fortnite. It's a video game. We know what Fortnite is, another agent said flatly. Bagging my gaming PC. These recordings don't sound like a game. The lead agent played another clip. Running Double Pump and AR tomorrow. Gonna be ready. Mom started crying. Dad looked at me like I was a stranger. Kevin, if you're planning something, you need to tell us right now. I'm not planning anything. It's a game. Two more agents came upstairs holding printed discord messages. They showed my parents screenshots. Hitting pleasant at three PM tomorrow. Got my whole loadout ready for this. Taking the high ground and picking everyone off. Those are locations in the game, I shouted. Strategies we use! The lead agent's face didn't change. We've contacted three of your online friends. They're being questioned right now. Miles, Terry, Zach. All three were in interrogation rooms because of me. A younger agent spoke from the doorway. His teachers say he's isolated, eats lunch alone, spends all his time gaming. The lead agent showed my parents a pamphlet titled Warning Signs of Teen Violence. She named school Shootings Columbine, Parkland, Uvalde. Each word made mom cry harder. They found my notebook with Fortnite strategies, building patterns, weapon stats, landing spots, tactical planning, the agent said, photographing every page. Dad tried to defend me. Kevin's never been violent. He's never been in a fight. That's what every parent says right before it happens, the agent replied. They bagged my controller, my headset, everything. An agent Scrolled through my YouTube history. Hours of combat footage. Been tutorials for Fortnite. I was sobbing now, chest tight. The agent's radio crackled. School sweep complete. No explosives, no weapons. Building is secure. The lead agent frowned. Could have stashed them elsewhere. She turned back to me. Where are they hidden? There's nothing to hide. My parents were whispering about lawyers. The agents pulled up more recordings. My voice saying, pushing now. Throwing grenades. Full squad wipe. Nobody's surviving this.

I looked up from the chocolate frosting I was carefully spreading, confused. Invited to what? She held up her phone showing my husband's Instagram story. There he was at a fancy rooftop restaurant downtown, champagne glass raised high, surrounded by all his co workers. The caption read, celebrating 30 in style. Thanks for the surprise, everyone. Today was my 31st birthday. He was celebrating my birthday without me. Oh, was all I managed. Still holding the frosting spatula, my sister Elena stared at me in disbelief. He threw himself a party for your birthday? I set down the spatula with steady hands. Apparently so. The homemade cake I've been decorating for our supposed quiet dinner tonight suddenly looked pathetic. Three layers of chocolate with Happy Birthday half written in vanilla frosting. Let me see that again, I said. Taking her phone, I zoomed in on the video. There was Patricia from his office who he claimed annoyed him daily. His boss, Gerald, who supposedly never socialized. That new intern, Chloe, laughing at something he was saying. Twenty people total, a reserved section with decorations. Someone had ordered a professional cake visible in the background with happy 30th and gold lettering. This party had been planned weeks in advance. Invitation sent, venue booked, cake ordered, decorations arranged and not one person had thought to invite or even mention it to the actual birthday person. Elena Was already grabbing her coat. We're going down there right now. No, I said quietly. Let them have their party. Are you insane? It's your birthday. I looked at my homemade cake, the grocery store flowers I bought myself, the nice dinner reservation for two I'd made, telling myself, you'd appreciate not having to plan anything. I wanna see how this plays out. What time was it? Posted 40 minutes ago. He'd left work early claiming he had an important client meeting. I believed him, even offered to push our dinner reservation back. Elena stayed with me, rage scrolling through social media. More videos kept appearing. Him opening presents his co workers had bought, a watch, expensive whiskey cuff links. This is Elena muttered, they know it's not his birthday, right? I pulled up Patricia's Instagram. There was a group photo caption celebrating the best boss. Happy birthday. Then Gerald's LinkedIn, honored to celebrate another year with our talented team leader. Happy 30th. They all thought it was his birthday. Every single one believed it. Which meant for weeks, maybe months, my husband had been telling people his birthday was October 15th, my birthday. His actual birthday was in March, six months away. At six PM, he texted client, dinner running long. Start without me. I texted back, no problem, take your time. Then I did something unprecedented. I took a selfie with my homemade cake and posted it to Facebook, the one platform he never checked. But where his co Workers followed me. Caption.

My voice came through the speaker clear as day. Gonna eliminate everyone in the building. Nobody's getting out. Mom, gasp. Dad's face went white. Wait, that's not. I started. The agent cut me off. She played another clip. My voice again. Got my explosives ready, taking out at least 20 people. We take these threats extremely seriously. The agent said. Your son's school will be shut down tomorrow. Bomb dogs are searching the building. I didn't threaten anyone. My voice was shaking. I was playing Fortnite. It's A video game. We know what Fortnite is, another agent said flatly, bagging my gaming PC. These recordings don't sound like a game. The lead agent played another clip. Running double pump and AR.

Two more agents came upstairs holding printed discord messages. They showed my parents screenshots. Hitting pleasant at three PM tomorrow. Got my whole loadout ready for this. Taking the high ground and picking everyone off. Those are locations in the game. I shouted. Strategies we use. The lead agent's face didn't change. We've contacted three of your online friends. They're being questioned right now. Miles, Terry, Zach, all three were in interrogation rooms because of me. A younger agent spoke from the doorway. His teachers say he's isolated, eats lunch alone, spends all his time gaming. The lead agent showed my parents a pamphlet titled Warning Signs of Teen Violence. She named School Shootings, Columbine, Parkland, Uvalde. Each word made mom cry harder. They found my notebook with Fortnite strategies, building patterns, weapon stats, landing spots, tactical planning, the agent said, photographing every page. Dad tried to defend me. Kevin's never been violent. He's never been in a fight. That's what every parent says right before it happens, the agent replied. They bagged my controller, my headset, everything. An agent scrolled Through my YouTube history, hours of combat footage in tutorials for Fortnite, I was sobbing. Now, chest tight. The agent's radio crackled. School sweep complete. No explosives, no weapons. Building is secure. The lead agent frowned. Could have stashed them elsewhere. She turned back to me. Where are they hidden? There's nothing to hide. My parents were whispering about lawyers. The agents pulled up more recordings. My voice saying, pushing, now throwing grenades. Full squad wipe. Nobody's surviving this.

She pulled out a tablet and held it toward my parents. Your son has been making terrorist threats. We have recordings. My balls dropped to the floor. She pressed play. My voice came through the speaker clear as day. Gonna eliminate everyone in the building. Nobody's getting out. Mom, gasp. Dad's face went white. Wait, that's not. I started. The agent cut me off. She played another clip. My voice again. Got my explosives ready, taking out at least 20 people. We take these threats extremely seriously. The agent said. Your son's school will be shut down tomorrow. Bomb dogs are searching the building. I didn't threaten anyone. My voice was shaking. I was playing Fortnite. It's A video game.

I said no. I hung up. 20 minutes later, mom called. She was hysterical. Dad got on the other line. They'd already talked to Ryan and decided I should help him. He's your brother, mom kept saying. He made a mistake, but he has a family. He has responsibilities. You're young. You'll bounce back. Dad reminded me they paid for my entire college, $40,000. He actually said the number. This is one thing we're asking you to do. I tried explaining about my job, my apartment, my literal future. Dad cut me off. You don't even have kids, Becca. You don't understand what he could lose. That hurt. Like he was saying my life didn't matter as much because I didn't have a husband or a baby yet. For three days, they didn't stop. Ryan sent me voice messages at all hours. Some of them he was crying, some he was yelling, calling me selfish. Mom called my work phone, my work phone. She told my coworker who answered that it was a family emergency and could I please call home. Ryan's lawyer even reached out. He said if I just signed one paper and showed up to say I was driving, they could make it all go away quietly. He made it sound so simple. Just sign here, show up. Once done, I started believing maybe I was being selfish. Nobody got hurt, right? It was just a car insurance. Would cover it. Maybe my job wouldn't even find out. Maybe the bank wouldn't.

They lived in Portland. Videos of him at her influencer events. The same nights he told me he was working late. The apartment in her videos, that was their apartment. She'd been paying for everything while he told me he was saving for our future. He's been taking money from both of us, she said. I checked our joint account after you called. He's been draining it. 60,000 euros, gone. I looked at our savings account while she talked. Empty. The 40,000 we'd saved for a house. I'm flying back tonight. I said don't warn him. Wasn't planning to. I already changed the locks on our apartment. His things are in boxes in the lobby. Security has his photo. We stayed on the phone for three hours, piecing together three years of lies. Every work trip matched up with a vacation with the other. Every family emergency was a cover for time with someone else's family. He'd been living completely double lives, funded by two women who loved him a. Lotty sent me everything. Screenshots, bank records, videos. I did the same. By the time we were done, we had enough evidence to destroy him. She posted a new TikTok that night. It went viral in six hours. How? I found out my boyfriend had a whole other girlfriend. 15 million views. His co workers saw it. His parents saw it. His boss, who followed her for her Fashion content. Saw. He called me from the airport. Panic in his voice. Please don't do anything crazy. I can explain everything. Too late. Check TikTok. Then I blocked him. He came to our apartment to find his belongings in the hallway and an eviction notice on the door. The locks had been changed. His key didn't work. His credit cards were all maxed out from his double life. Both Alady and I had removed him from our accounts. He had nowhere to go. Alady and I still talk. We're both in therapy, both rebuilding. Last week, she sent me a screenshot of his new dating file. Recently out of a toxic relationship. It says we laughed until we cried. He's living with his parents now. The ones who supposedly didn't approve of me. Turns out they didn't approve of anyone. They knew exactly what their son was and wanted no part of it. Sometimes I still see him pop up on my TikTok feed. In the comments of her viral video, begging her to take it down. It has 47 million views now. The internet never forgets.

He used his science class Chromebook to make a Powerpoint presentation. He researched black mold symptoms and matched them to what was happening in our class. Headaches? Check. Respiratory problems? Check. Skin rashes? Check. Fatigue and dizziness, double check. The next day during free reading time, Alex quietly showed his presentation to kids sitting nearby. Word spread fast.

He was crying. Like, actually sobbing into the phone. He told me he'd been drinking at his buddy's place, drove home and hit a parked car on Maple Street. Hard. Then he panicked and just left. Didn't leave a note, nothing. Someone got his plate number, and the cops were looking for him. You need to say you were driving. He said, just like that, like he was asking me to pick up milk. I laughed because I thought he was joking. He wasn't. Becca, I'm serious. I'll lose everything. My job, Jamie will leave me, and I'll never see Lily again. Lily was his seven year old daughter from his first marriage. He only got her every other weekend as it was. I told him that was insane. I worked in finance. Any criminal record, even traffic stuff, could get me fired. Plus, I was literally three weeks away from closing on my first apartment. The bank lady had told me not to even jaywalk until everything was signed. He kept crying, begging, saying nobody got hurt. It was just property damage.

Not just any reveal either. This girl had 400,000 followers and the video already had 2 million views. There was Kalani, my boyfriend of three years, kissing her in front of the Eiffel Tower with the caption, finally showing you guys my man together 6 months. My hands went numb. Kalani was supposed to be in Phoenix for a medical conference. I checked his Instagram. He posted a photo of a conference room 12 hours ago. But the meta data on her TikTok showed it was filmed yesterday in Paris. I screenshotted everything before my brain could talk me out of it. Then I went to her profile. Hundreds of videos of them together, date nights, cooking videos, morning routines. The cooking videos were filmed in an apartment I didn't recognise. But I saw Kalani's watch on the counter, the one I'd bought him for his birthday. My stomach churned as I kept scrolling. Three months ago, she posted about meeting his parents the same weekend he told me he was visiting his sick college roommate. There was a photo of her with her mom and dad at their anniversary dinner. The dinner I wasn't invited to because it was family only. I called him immediately. He answered on the second ring, casual as ever. Hey, babe, conference is pretty boring. Missing you. My voice came out steady somehow. How's Phoenix? Hot and full of old doctors. Can't wait to come home tomorrow. I pulled up her TikTok of them at a French cafe posted an hour ago. That's funny because Phoenix looks a lot like Paris on TikTok. Silence. Then. What are you talking about? Adele Moore? Ring a bell? Your girlfriend with 400 k followers who's been posting videos of you two for six months. He hung up. I called back straight to voicemail. I was typing a text when my phone rang. Unknown number with a French country code. I answered. You're the other woman. Her accent was slight but noticeable. Adele, excuse me. Kalani told me about you months ago. His ex who could didn't let go. He said you were stalking him. That's why he had to be careful about posting our relationship. The audacity of this man. I'm not his ex. We live together. We have a lease together. I just helped him pay for his mom's surgery. She laughed, bitter and sharp. His mom's surgery. His mother hasn't been sick a day in her life. I had dinner with her last night. She keeps asking when we're getting married. My head spun. Send me proof. Within minutes, my phone flooded with photos. Then with his parents, who I've been told didn't approve of me.

My friend Jade from nursing school had a boyfriend who worked in tech. I pitched him an idea over coffee. A dash cam app that didn't just record. It uploaded clips automatically to a cloud server. If it detected flashing lights, motion outside the car, certain voice commands, like, I do not consent to this search, or I need help. Encrypted, tamper proof, accessible from your phone.

Bootstrapped the whole thing with money I borrowed from my brother and Jade's boyfriend. Savings. We launched it on TikTok using my story. No actors, just me telling people exactly what happened. It went viral in two days. Within a month, we hit 50,000 downloads and 100,000 news stations started calling. We got emails from people saying the app saved them from bad traffic stops, from false accusations from abusive exes who tried planting things in their cars. Just like Donovan did to me. A year later, a major dash cam company reached out. They wanted to buy Street Safe outright. Offered seven figures. I said yes. Donovan tried reaching out last month. Said he wanted to apologize. Wanted another chance to be In our son's life. I didn't even open the message. Just blocked him and went back to work.

Instead, he made me rich. His name was Donovan. And for three years, he barely looked at our son. Didn't show up for birthdays, forgot Christmas twice. I was the one doing midnight fevers and daycare drop offs while working 12 hour shifts as a nurse. He was too busy partying with his trust fund buddies. Then I filed for child support. Suddenly he wanted full custody. His parents hired some lawyer in a suit that probably cost more than my monthly rent. They painted me as unstable, said I worked too much, said our son deserved better. It was all garbage. But they had money and I had debt. The custody hearing was set for July. I thought I could handle it. Then I got pulled over on a Tuesday afternoon coming home from the hospital. I wasn't speeding, wasn't on my phone. The cop walked up and said they got an anonymous tip about. About drug activity involving my license plate. I laughed, told him that was insane. He asked to search the car anyway. I said yes because I had nothing to hide. He found a bag of pills under my driver's seat, then a baggie of white powder shoved into the side pocket. I started shaking. I told him I had no idea how that got there. He didn't believe me. I got arrested in scrubs with my hospital badge still clipped to my chest. Donovan's lawyer used it. In court three days later.

So I unlocked the car from inside the house and told him to strap the car seat in while I grabbed my keys. He was out there alone for maybe two minutes. My brother asked if I had any cameras. I said no. Then I remembered the dash cam. I bought it used off Facebook Marketplace 2 years ago. Guy who sold it said it was hard wired and still recorded even when the car was off. I barely thought about it after that. It didn't have Wi-Fi, just saved everything to an s d. Card. My brother pulled the footage that same night.

Last Christmas, while I was carving the Turkey, they discussed whether my American Laziness was genetic and would affect our kids work ethic. My wife Mira, doesn't speak Korean.

I'm sorry for what happened. Can we move past this? What are you sorry for? I asked. The fight. Getting you in trouble. What about lying? Destroying my homework, making yourself cry to manipulate dad? Her face went red. Dad pointed at me. That's enough being disrespectful. And you suspended me from my own house for defending myself. Guess we're even. Bobby appeared from his office. I think you folks should leave. They stood there expecting me to break. I just stared back. They left. Ashley turned at the door. You'll regret this. I went back to work. That evening. I graduated high school through the night program, something they didn't even know I transferred to. Bobby, Jake and Tommy came to the ceremony, took a photo of me in my cap and gown next to my truck. My parents never showed. I never invited them. Two months later, Ashley's pregnant at 16. Father's gone. Family calls begging for help. Six months later, dad loses his job, behind on mortgage. More desperate calls. Nine months later, babies born. They're drowning. I bought my first truck. 12 months later, foreclosure notice, $12,000 behind. I had exactly that in savings. I thought about it for three days. That money could save their house, keep them from Being homeless, it would also teach them I'd come running whenever they needed rescuing, that they could treat me like garbage and I'd still be their safety net. I didn't give it to them. They lost the house, moved into a two bedroom rental, four people, one baby. Dad working retail, mom doing data entry. Ashley still living with them, unemployed. Meanwhile, Bobby made me a partner, 20% of the shop at 18. I co owned a business at 20. I bought a house. Last month, dad showed up one final time. No money request, just I was wrong about that day, about suspending you, about all of it. We're proud of what you've built. I didn't know what to say. Part of me wanted to stay angry. I appreciate you saying that. I told him. I know it's late. Yeah, it is. He left. Haven't heard from him since. I got a girlfriend who doesn't care that I'm a mechanic. She likes that I can fix thing. I've never met my niece. Don't plan to. Sometimes Bobby asks if I feel bad. I tell him the truth. I feel free. They chose Ashley over me every single time.

Every single one had the same story. Their kid had come home with chunks of hair missing at some point in the last two weeks. And when I mentioned the constant sickness, they all confirmed that, too. Their kids had been getting sick over and over for months. None of us had connected the dots until now. I felt sick to my stomach. Something was happening to an entire classroom of children, and not one of us knew what it was. The next morning, six of us showed up at the principal's office. We weren't asking anymore. We were demanding answers. The principal looked genuinely concerned. He pulled up the security footage from the past month. Classrooms, hallways, playground. We watched for over an hour. Nothing. The teachers weren't doing anything wrong. No older kids were going near them. No strangers on campus. There was literally no evidence of anything happening to these kids. Principal promised to investigate further, but I could see on his face that he was just as confused as we were. That night, I tried asking Lucy one more time. I researched on wiki how. On how to deal with situations like this and went for a softer approach. I sat on the edge of her bed and took a deep breath. Whatever is going on, I'm not going to be mad. I'm not going to be disappointed. I just need to know that You're safe, honey. She looked at me with these big, terrified eyes and said, daddy, please just drop it. If you find out what's going on, I'll get in so much trouble, no one will want to be friends with me anymore. That sentence kept me up all night. Why would she get in trouble? What could she possibly

She wanted to call the school immediately, get my ex suspended, maybe even expelled. But before she picked up the phone, I stopped her. Wait. I said, I have an idea. See, I knew something about my ex that she probably forgot. I knew she had just started working at the ice cream shop downtown. She was 16. And it was her first job, and she wouldn't shut up about it. When we were dating, my brother was deathly allergic to dairy and gluten. So I suddenly came up with a genius plan.

My daughter Mira was 11 years old, autistic, and completely obsessed with her bow staff. You know, those long wooden poles from martial arts movies? Her grandpa hand carved her one right before he passed away, and she never put it down. After that, she spent five hours a day, every day in the backyard practicing the same movements until her palms blistered over. Teachers kept telling me to redirect her into something more normal, but I never listened to them. Staff made her happy. That's all any parent cares about. When Mira started 5th grade, she met her only real friend, a boy named Theo. He had a D H D. And she had autism, and they just fit together like a puzzle. They ate lunch together every day, did homework at our kitchen table. He even thought her staff was cool. I was so happy she made a friend. Then a 13 year old girl named Vanessa came into the picture. She never spoken to Theo before, but she started following him between classes. She wanted him to be her boyfriend. Apparently, Theo being different, intrigued her. Theo kept telling her no, but Vanessa kept pushing. The day, day after Theo publicly told her no and turned her into a meme in her class, she had enough. She cornered Theo alone behind the gymnasium. She shoved him into the brick wall over and over until His head split open, he fell down and laid on the concrete with a black, black eye, rob palms, and a gash across his forehead held together with four stitches. Vanessa had pressed Scissors to his throat before leaving. Be my boyfriend and I'll cut your face off next time. He was too scared to tell any adult, but he told Mira everything immediately. She took him back to our house and immediately where she and his wounds up before saying, Vanessa is never going to touch you again. Theo looked at Mira. What do you mean, Mira Smirk? I have grandpa's staff. I've been training for three years. She doesn't know what's coming. Theo shook his head. She's bigger than you. She's older. She's crazy. Mira didn't blink. But you're my best.

Growing up, I'd see him at Christmas or Thanksgiving and he'd walk right past me like I didn't exist. When I got older, around 12 or 13, he started saying it out loud. You killed her, he'd tell me at family dinners when nobody was listening. I can't even look at your face without seeing what you took from me. I went to therapy three times a week in middle school. I used to pray at church every Sunday, crying, asking god if I was going to hell for killing my mom. That's how messed up his words made me. But I kept trying anyway. I kept thinking maybe one day he'd change his mind about me. After I graduated high school, he told me straight up to never contact him again. He said he had no legal obligation to me anymore since he'd been sending my aunt money all those years. And now that was done. That's when I finally stopped trying. We went our separate ways. My aunt never mentions him. My grandparents do sometimes. And that's how I found out he got married two years ago. They were upset.

One time, I saw him programming her TV remote because she couldn't figure out how to switch inputs. The whole routine takes about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on what she needs. That day I noticed he started keeping a small toolbox in his trunk around the same time. Now I know why. There's also a package of batteries, light bulbs, and even a step stool back there.

He sat down across from me and said he'd made a terrible mistake, that he got caught up in something stupid and threw away everything that mattered. He said Jenna wasn't who he thought she was, that she twisted his words and made him feel crazy, that she was immature and manipulative. He asked me to forget everything, said we could go to counseling, take a trip, whatever I needed. He grabbed my hand and said 15 years was too much to throw away over one mistake. I opened my desk drawer and handed him an envelope. He looked confused. I told him to open it. Divorce papers. Already filed, already served. My lawyer had delivered them to his office that morning while he was in a meeting with his boss. His face went white. He said this wasn't what he wanted, that he changed his mind, that I was supposed to give him a chance to fix thing. I reminded him he'd asked for the right way to do this divorce first. Remember, this is the right way. He started panicking, then said I was being cruel, that I'd let him on by acting calm about everything, that any normal wife would have fought harder. I told him any normal husband wouldn't have asked for a Divorce in the first place. He's currently staying at the. An apartment he rented. The lease is for a year, and he can't get out of it. The kids know everything because I told them the truth when he asked for the divorce two weeks ago. They're hurt, but they'll be okay. Jenna blocked him on everything. Apparently, he tried calling her from different numbers. And me? I'm planning that Hawaii trip he promised me. This time, I'm going alone.

The problem was Jenna had been following my Instagram for months. She'd seen our anniversary post from four months ago, the trip to Hawaii where Matthew surprised me with a helicopter tour. The photos of us kissing on the beach. His caption calling me his soulmate and best friend. My post calling him the love of my life. She'd also seen the photos from two weeks before. She messaged me, date night at our favorite restaurant, Matthew's hand on my waist so of us smiling. Jenna asked me directly, why would he lie about all of this if we were so happy? I told her the truth. Matthew does this every few years like clockwork, gets bored with routine, starts pursuing someone younger at work, threatens divorce to see if I'll fight for him, then backs out when reality sets in. This was the third time. The first time was when our oldest was a parallel from his firm. The second was five years ago with someone from his gym who taught spin classes. Both times he came crying back within weeks and I took him back because I believed people could change. Jenna thanked me and said she needed to think. She dumped him that same night. The next morning, Matthew came home looking like he hadn't slept. He was wide all day, barely ate dinner and kept checking his phone constantly. I knew Jenna had ended it, but I didn't Say anything. For the next two weeks, he slowly fell apart. Stop talking about the apartment, started trying to have conversations with me about random things like we used to even suggested we watch our favorite show together. One night, yesterday, he came home from work early and found me in the home office. He was crying, actually sobbing like I'd never seen before. He sat down across from me and said he'd made a terrible mistake, that he got caught up in some.

So I erupted and the twins backed me up. I met my husband Kevin through his identical twin Jace at a mutual friend's wedding five years ago. Jace and I were seated at the same table and we hit it off immediately. When he found out I was into vintage cars, he said you have to meet my brother. He restores classics. Then showed up an hour later covered in grease from working on a 67 Mustang. We talked for three hours straight. Jace just smiled the whole time, clearly proud of his matchmaking skills. Four years later, Kevin and I got married. Jace was the best man. Everything was perfect until the rehearsal dinner. That's when it started. Kevin's mom stood up to give a toast and halfway through she looked at Jason said, you know, you could just switch places tomorrow and she'd never know the difference. The room laughed nervously. I forced to smile. Kevin squeezed my hand under the table so hard it hurt. I thought it was a one time thing, wedding jitters maybe, but it wasn't. At our first Christmas as a married couple, his dad cornered Jason in the kitchen and while I was grabbing wine, you should sneak into their room tonight, he said loud enough for me to hear. Let's see if she notices. Jace's face went red. He told His dad to stop. His dad just laughed and walked away. Every family gathering, same joke. Easter dinner, his mom said, Jace, sit next to her, see if she realizes it's not Kevin.

My boyfriend Tanner has this weird habit of leaving for work exactly 17 minutes earlier than he needs to every single day, 6:43 on the dot. His alarm goes off at 6:15. He's dressed by 6:30 and then he's out the door. I thought maybe he just liked beating traffic or stopping for coffee on the way. But his office is literally eight minutes away and he brings coffee from home in his thermos. Didn't add up. We've been living together for two years and this started about four months ago when he switched to the morning shift. I never questioned it because honestly I'm not a morning person. I'm usually half asleep when he kisses my forehead and leaves. But this morning I had insomnia and couldn't sleep at all. So I was wide awake when he went through his usual routine. I watched him grab his keys, check his phone, kiss my forehead like always and head out the door. That's when I noticed something strange. Through our bedroom window, instead of getting in his car, he walked directly to our neighbor's house two doors down, Missus Earl's house. Missus Earl is this tiny 80 year old woman who's lived on our street for like 30 years. Her husband died last February and I remember seeing her at the funeral looking absolutely lost. Since then she's been living alone. Her son lives in Oregon and she doesn't have any other Family nearby. I got curious and honestly a little concerned. So last week, I actually set my alarm early and followed him.

The irony isn't lost on me. I kept my secret because I figured their opinion didn't matter as long as Mira loved me. And she does. We've built an incredible life together. But last week, something happened that made me finally break my silence. We're at my daughter's college graduation party. Big Celebration at our house. Both families there, about 40 people total. I'm in the kitchen grabbing more drinks from the garage fridge when my mother in law and sister in law walk in speaking Korean. They don't see me behind the open pantry door. He's getting fat. Did you see his stomach? I know. Poor Mira. Remember that doctor she dated before him? Park's son? He just bought his third house. At least the kids look Korean. Thank god they don't have his ugly nose and they got Mira's intelligence, not his. I'm gripping the door handle so hard my knuckles turn white. But then my mother in law says something that makes my blood run cold. I'm changing my will next week. Mira deserves the inheritance, not him. I've talked to my lawyer. There's a way to structure it so her husband can't touch a single penny. Even if they stay married, it all goes to her and the kids only. My sister in law laughs, mom, you're brilliant. He's been mooching long enough. For context, I'm a civil engineer. I make 140 k a Year. We split all expenses equally. I've never asked them for a single dollar. I stepped out from behind the pantry door. My mother in law is mid sentence when she sees me. Her eyes go wide. In perfect Korean, I said, I've understood every single word you've said about me for 25 years, every insult.

I looked up from my plate. What settlement money? Uncle Frank's smile faded instantly. From the car accident five years ago when that delivery truck ran the red light and you spent three weeks in the hospital, my sister Heather made a strange choking sound. I watched her face drain of all color, turning almost gray under the dining room lighting. I never got any settlement money, I said slowly, a cold feeling spreading through my chest. Still paying off those hospital bills and installments. Uncle Frank put down his wine glass very carefully. Brianna, the insurance company settled for $127,000. I know because I helped your mom with the paperwork when you were still recovering. You were only 17. So it went into a custodial account until you turned eighteen. I turned to my mother, waiting for her to clear up this obvious misunderstanding, but she wouldn't look at me, very interested in cutting her Turkey into impossibly tiny pieces. Mom, my voice came out barely above a whisper. My mind was racing, trying to make the pieces fit together. I turned 18 five years ago. Where did the money go? The silence stretched out forever. I could hear the kitchen faucet dripping in the other room, each drop echoing like a countdown. Gave it to Heather, mom finally whispered, her voice cracking, for her education and getting Started with her life. The words didn't make sense at first. They literally didn't compute in my brain. You gave my money to Heather. I repeated each word coming out separately and distinctly. The money from my accident, from my broken bones and my three weeks in the hospital and my six months of physical therapy. You were getting financial aid for community college, Heather said defensively, her voice shrill and desperate. You didn't need it as much as I did. I had private university tuition and living expenses. I stared at her, actually stared, seeing my sister clearly for maybe the first time in my entire life. Is that where you got your car? The question came out flat and dead. That Audi you bought junior year that you said was from your internship. She didn't answer, but her face answered for her. The apartment downtown you lived in. My voice was getting louder, stronger. The study abroad semester in Paris. The designer clothes you kept posting online. We were going to tell you, mom started weakly when I shouted. Standing up so fast, my chair backward and hit the wall. When exactly were you planning to mention that you stole $127,000 from your daughter who got hit by a truck? The math was simple and devastating. Well, I've been working 40 hours a week at target and going to community college at night, sleeping four hours and living on energy drinks and stress. Heather had been spending my Blood money on her dream life. I called you crying, I said, my voice breaking completely. I called you crying because I couldn't afford my textbooks and you told me to budget better. I was eating Dollar Menu food for dinner while making monthly payments on bills from my own accident. You were always so resilient, Heather said, tears starting to stream down her face. Now you are handling everything fine. Handling it, I repeated the word, tasting like poison in my mouth. I had to drop two classes last semester because I couldn't afford them and work enough hours to pay rent. I've been living in a basement apartment with black mold because it's all I can afford. I haven't been to a dentist in three years. Uncle Frank was doing calculations on his phone, face getting redder by the second. $127,000 plus five years of interest. At even a conservative rate, we're talking about 145,000 to $150,000 in total value you were owed. Mom was sobbing now, but I felt absolutely nothing looking at her tears. She'd had five years to feel guilty, five years to tell the truth. That money was supposed to compensate me for permanent nerve damage in my left leg, I said. My voice deadly calm now. For the nightmares I still have about that truck coming at me, for the fact that I can't run anymore without pain and you gave it away like it was nothing. She's still your sister, mom pleaded. Desperately, no, I said. Clearly, she's a thief who watched me suffer for five years while spending money that belonged to me. That's not a sister. That's a stranger who stole my future. I grabbed my coat from the hallway, my hands surprisingly steady. Now where are you going, mom? Asked her voice small and afraid. To a lawyer, I said simply looking at Uncle Frank, I'm assuming you kept all that paperwork. He nodded grimly. Every document, I'll have it ready tomorrow morning.

I was halfway through a raid in my game when Eli wandered into my room, one hand pressed flat against his chest. He was 8 years old and always interrupting me for stupid reasons, so I didn't even pause. Nana, feel this. He grabbed my hand and put it on his chest before I could stop him. His heart was hammering so fast I couldn't count the beats. It felt like a hummingbird trapped inside his ribs. Dude, what were you doing running laps around the house? He shook his head. I was just watching TV. I pulled my hand back and shrugged. You probably just got excited about something. Go drink some water. He stood there for another second looking at me with those big brown eyes, then shuffled back downstairs. I went back to my game. Mom was working a double at the hospital and wouldn't be home until morning. Dad was on a business trip in Seattle. I was 16 and in charge, which mostly meant making sure Eli ate dinner and went to bed on time. Twenty minutes later, he was back. It's still doing it, he said. This time his voice was smaller. I sighed and paused my game for real. Still doing what? The fast thing? It won't slow down. I tried taking deep breaths. Like you said that one time. I hadn't said anything about deep breaths, but I got up anyway. I put my hand on his chest again. Still racing. Feel that fluttering hummingbird feeling. I looked at him more closely. His face was flushed, but his lips looked kind of pale. Does it hurt? He shook his head, then stopped. Kinda like it's squeezing weird. I pulled out my phone and Googled fast heartbeat in kids. The results said anxiety, dehydration, too much sugar, caffeine, normal stuff. I asked Eli if he had any soda. He said no. Any candy? No. Was he nervous about something? He just stared at me. I'm nervous now because my heart won't stop. Fair point. Got him a glass of water and made him sit on the couch. I figured it would pass in a few minutes. Hearts don't just race forever for no reason. Fifteen minutes later, his heart was still pounding. I could see his shirt moving with each beat. That wasn't normal, right? I counted silently, watching the fabric jump. I got to 60 beats and maybe 20 seconds. That math didn't seem right, but I wasn't exactly a doctor. I texted Mom, Eli's heart is beating really fast. Normal. Three dots appeared, then disappear. She was probably with a patient. I looked at my brother. He was sitting very still on the couch. His hand pressed to his chest like he could hold his heart in place. Jenna, I feel weird. Weird how like floaty, like when you stand up too fast. But I'm sitting down. I grabbed my Phone again and searched, fast heartbeat, dizzy child. The first result mentioned something called s V t, super ventricular tachycardia, heart rate over 150 beats per minute. I scrolled faster. It said to call a doctor if symptoms persisted more than a few minutes. We were past that, way past that. My phone buzzed, mom, how fast is he? Pale, dizzy. I typed back, yes to both. It's been like 45 minutes. Her response was immediate. Call 9, 1 1 now. Don't wait. I'm coming. My.

I have pin straight hair, always have. But in college, every girl I dated mentioned loving guys with curly hair. After getting rejected one too many times, I started getting perms at this little salon near campus. When I met Rachel three years ago, she immediately ran her fingers through my artificial curls and said curly hair was her biggest weakness. I've been sneaking to a salon two towns over every six months since then, telling Rachel I'm visiting my college buddy Mike. I even Learned to use special curl enhancing products and sleep with a silk pillowcase to maintain the look. The whole routine cost me $400 every visit, but it seemed worth it to keep Rachel happy. Now our daughter Mia, is three weeks old with the most gorgeous, gorgeous, tight curls I've ever seen. Rachel keeps taking photos, posting them online with captions like, daddy's curls are strong genes and Lucky Girl got the best features from both parents. She even bought matching father daughter headbands for our curly hair club. Here's where it gets complicated. Rachel has pin straight hair, too, and last week she started getting curious about the genetics. She's been researching our family histories, calling both our moms to ask about curly haired relatives. When she couldn't find any on either side going back three generations, she started making Jokes about some mystery ancestor blessing Mia with beautiful curls. Situation got worse when we visited my parents last weekend. My mom pulled out old photo albums and Rachel found my high school graduation picture with completely straight hair slicked back back with gel. When she asked about it, I panicked and said I used to chemically straighten my hair as a teenager because I was self conscious about my curls. But Rachel's not buying my explanation. She keeps studying baby photos of both of us, muttering about scientifically impossible genetics. Even called her sister Amy, who's a pediatric nurse, to ask detailed questions about how hair texture gets passed down through families. Amy apparently told her that two straight haired parents having a curly haired child is extremely rare without some recessive gene somewhere. The pressure is building because my last perm is growing out badly, my roots are showing completely straight hair, and the curls are getting looser every day. Rachel noticed yesterday morning and asked why my hair looks so different lately and whether I've been using new products. I told her it's just stress from being a new dad, but she keeps touching it and frowning. Things escalated last night when Rachel suggested getting one of those Ancestry DNA kits for Mia just for fun to see what other genetic surprises might be hiding in our family background. She's convinced there must be some unknown curly haired relatives that would explain everything. I've been dodging the DNA conversation, but she already ordered the kit online. It arrives Thursday. Meanwhile, my next perm appointment is scheduled for next week, but Rachel wants to come with me to finally meet my college buddy Mike, who I supposedly visit so often. I obviously can't bring her to a hair salon, so I've been making excuses about Mike being busy with work. The worst part happened this morning. Rachel was changing Mia's diaper when she noticed something that made her freeze. She called me over and pointed to it.

Usually he'll wait a minute or so and then take it off when he goes to take a leak. I typically shower after he does that, but I went ahead and got up because I could feel something oozing out more than usual. I asked him if he had a slip up or if it broke, and he said no. He then got dressed and said he would see me tomorrow because something came up, gave me a kiss, and left. All of which is incredibly weird because we always cuddle. So after he left, I checked, and it was definitely his. You know what? I started panicking and blowing his phone up, but it's going straight to voicemail. So I call from a blocked number, and it's still going straight to voicemail, and my messages aren't delivering, which means he put his phone on airplane mode. He's never acted like this before. It was really strange behavior, and something didn't feel right. So I shower and go to Walgreens to get two Plan b's. And just as I was about to pull out, head to his apartment to see why he's acting like this, I get a phone call. I didn't recognize the number, so I ignored it, but it called three more times. I thought maybe it was an emergency, so I answered, and on the other end, a woman's Voice says, hey, my name is Reina. I found your number thousands of times on my boyfriend's phone Bill, and I wanted to know how you know him.

We were playing truth or dare as teenagers with a few of our friends. Our parents were gone for the weekend and we drank some beers and we're all a little tipsy. One of the other girls in the group dared me and my sister to tongue kiss. We did it quickly like it was nothing. But the other girl said that didn't count. We had to do it for five seconds. So we did. It was a real kiss and it was the first time I ever kissed a girl. It felt good, but I remember I had to pretend I didn't like it because she was my sister. After everybody left, my sister sat next to me on the couch and asked me if I liked it and wanted to try it again. I was so nervous but definitely wanted to. We kissed and kissed and of course, I got the biggest heart on I ever had. She let her hands wander up my shirt and then down to my junk. I thought I would bust right then and there. She asked me if I wanted her to play with it. Of course, I said yes. She was older and had been with a guy before, so she kind of knew what she was doing. She pulled my shorts down and as soon as she put her hands on me, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I was literally busting all over the place in a matter of seconds. She was laughing and laughing. There was a huge mess all over me, my clothes in the couch. She got some tissues and cleaned everything up. I think she used the whole box. I went to bed and slept like a baby for 10 hours. When I started to wake up, I thought I was having a wet dream. I was wrong. She was in there playing with me again. I don't think I lasted 30 seconds. It was a little longer than the first time, but not much. There was juice all over me, in the sheets. She was laughing again, but I didn't care. All I knew was how good it felt. She knew we had the house to ourselves. So she said, let me know when you want to do it again. Just the thought of her saying that made me want it. I don't think an hour went by when she asked me if I was ready. And of course I was. I think I lasted a couple of minutes the third time. When she called me into her room a little later for what I was eagerly expecting to be the fourth time, she was lying on her bed and nothing but a bra. She said, it's my turn to help her. I couldn't wait to get in there. She taught me how to do it and she was soon flooding the Bed, I think we did.

So my hair is awful, like genuinely awful. It's super thin and curly and every morning I wake up looking like I stuck my finger in an outlet. Giant knots everywhere, hair sticking straight up, frizz for days. My best friend Tori is black and she's seen my morning hair plenty of times. She thinks it's hilarious. Last summer I was complaining about it again and she just shook her head at me. For my birthday two months ago, she gave me a bonnet, the same kind she wears every night. I honestly didn't think it would work for my hair, but I tried it anyway. Dude, game changer. I wake up and my hair is actually manageable now. Way less frizz, barely any knots. I've been wearing it every single night since my dad showed up at my apartment last weekend with his new girlfriend. I say new because my dad has a different girlfriend every few months. This one's name is Brenda and I'd literally never met her before. She walked in with her overnight bag like she owned the place. My dad gave me a hug and introduced us. Brenda barely looked at me. Cool start that night, I got ready for bed around 11. I brushed my teeth and put on my bonnet like I always do. I walked back into the living Room to grab my phone charger. And Brenda just froze. She stared at me like I'd walked out in a full clown costume. Then she goes, what is that on your head? I touched my bonnet. Oh, it's just a bonnet. I wear it to sleep so my hair doesn't go crazy. Her face.

I canceled the trip and did something else instead. I'm Ayesha, 39, a financial consultant. That night I was packing for a business trip when my son Amari lay next to me. Mama, he whispered, daddy has a girlfriend. I froze. What he talked to her on the phone. When you leave, they're going to go to the bank and take all the money they have. Three days she said. Soon they'd finally breathe easy. I didn't sleep that night. At 3:00am I searched documents Malik had me sign after surgery. He said they were insurance updates. It was a general power of attorney, broad authority, full access. My stomach dropped. I'd signed while recovering on morphine. He brought tea was loving, just a formality. I called my attorney friend Zora. She read them. This is serious. Full access to your assets. If he claims you're mentally unfit, he can sell your house without you. While I'm traveling. Yes, perfect window. I have to revoke this. Cancel your trip. That night, Malik asked, what time are you leaving? 6, 10:00am Thursday or Friday. Return Friday. I said perfect. That smile confirmed everything. The next morning there was an envelope in the mailbox, notarial deed dated weeks earlier. Two names, Malik and Silah. I searched her name, consulting firm, specialist in Asset Management. Then our old photos call college Folder. There she was, Sila, younger, next to Malik at a party, hugging, kissing, dated 2003. His ex girlfriend, the woman he told me he'd gotten over before we even met. She'd been waiting all along. That afternoon, Amari came home. Ma, daddy said, when you go, he's taking me to live with him and Silah. We're getting a puppy. He said, you'll be working far away. My blood froze. I hugged him. Nobody is separating you from me. They wanted to erase me completely. I left my phone recording. That night at eleven PM, Malik called someone on speaker phone. Hey, beautiful, is she asleep? Sila asked. Yeah, she doesn't suspect anything. In 48 hours, it'll all be ours. The attorney will accept the transfer. Sure. She signed during surgery. She didn't even notice. And the house already done. My brother in law received the down payment. I saved every second. Next day, I met attorney Dennis. He listened to the recording. We have proof. We can stop everything. I signed the revocation, changed my accounts, transferred everything to secure accounts. He has no control now, Dennis said. But when he finds out, he won't react. Well, Tuesday at 4:00am, I pretended to leave for the airport, drove away with my suitcase. Four blocks later, I parked in a garage Dennis arranged. Inside was a monitoring center with bank cameras. At 9:00am, Malik entered the bank. Silo waited outside as legal agent for Miss Aisha Bellweather. I want to Liquidate. The executive checked her computer, called her supervisor. The manager appeared. The power of attorney was revoked 24 hours ago. Your access is removed. You're not.

Your sister has been planning this party for months. You'll have your husband's parents there. Natalie only has us. The morning of my C section, my mother in law and father in law were at the hospital by 7, even though we didn't need to be there until 11. They brought me breakfast and sat with me while I filled out paperwork. My mother in law held my hand and told me how proud she was of me. They we're in the waiting area. When they took me back for surgery, everything went wrong. My blood pressure dropped and the baby's heart rate was all over the place. I could hear the doctors talking in Urgent Voices and see the nurses moving fast. They got the baby out, but she wasn't crying. For 10 seconds. That felt like 10 hours. There was just silence. Then she screamed and I started sobbing. They brought her over and put her on my chest, and she was perfect. In recovery, my in laws were waiting with flowers and balloons. My mother in law was crying and my father in law kept saying, she's beautiful. She looks just like you. They stayed with me for hours, taking turns holding the baby and bringing me water and telling me what an amazing mother I was going to be. Around 6 that evening, my parents walked into the hospital room. They were loud and laughing and I could smell wine on them. From across the room, my mom saw the baby in my mother in law's arms and her whole face changed. She rushed over and said, oh my god, let me hold her. She took the baby and stared at her and started crying. She said, she's perfect. Look at her little hands. I can't believe I'm a grandmother. My dad came over and looked at the baby and his eyes got wet. He said, she's beautiful. She looks like you did when you were born. My mom turned to me and said, why didn't you tell us it was happening now? We would have been here. I stared at her. I said, I told you two weeks ago. You chose Natalie's party. My dad said, we didn't realize the baby would be here already. We thought we had time. My father in law stood up and said, you need to leave. My mom clutched the baby tighter and said, we just got here. We want to spend time with our granddaughter. I said, give her back to her grandmother and pointed at my mother in law. My mom's face crumpled and she handed the baby over. I said, you chose a housewarming party over your daughter's life threatening surgery and the birth of your first grandchild. You showed up six hours late, drunk, and you want me to believe you care now? My dad said, please, we made a mistake. We want to be in her life. I said, get Out. My mom tried to take a photo of the baby before leaving and my father in law deleted it from her phone. They haven't seen her since.

My sister Natalie has always been the favourite and I've always been an afterthought. When we were kids, she got new clothes while I wore her stained hand me downs. And when I got straight A's, my parents put her C minus report card on the fridge and stuck mine in a drawer. I stopped expecting anything from them years ago. When I got pregnant, I called my parents to tell them they were going to be grandparents for the first time. My mom said, that's nice, honey, and then spent 20 minutes telling me about the house Natalie he was buying. Throughout my pregnancy, they asked how I was feeling exactly twice, but Natalie's house became the only thing they could talk about. Every conversation was about her new countertops or her backyard or her paint colors. My mother in law threw me a baby shower and my parents showed up 30 minutes late and left early because they were helping Natalie pick out furniture. My due date got moved up and the doctor scheduled a C section because the baby was breech. I called my parents and told them the date and time. My mom said, oh, we'll definitely be there. This is our first grandbaby. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe they were finally going to show up for me. My mother in law was so excited she started crying when I Told her the C section date. She bought an outfit specific for meeting her first grandchild and had been texting me every day asking how I was feeling. My father in law took the whole week off work so he could help us when we brought the baby home. Two weeks before the C section, my mom called and said, so we have a little situation. Natalie scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your C section. She sent out invitations months ago and she really. He wants us there. I felt my entire chest tightened. I said she knew when my C section was scheduled. My mom said, I know, but this party is really important to her. She's worked so hard on this house. We'll come by the hospital after if we can. I said, if you can. She said, the party starts at 2 and you're scheduled for noon. So we'll probably still be at Natalie's, but we'll try to stop by that evening.

My entire face exploded in pain. My eyes watered instantly. Two hundred people gasped. Diane pointed at me, screaming. Who the hell do you think you are? You don't get to just show up and touch my husband! Diane! My dad's voice was ice. No, this random girl walks in, puts her hands all over you, and I'm supposed to smile? She's probably some stalker.

I didn't know you. Never. I showed you pictures multiple times. I even told you she might be coming today. His voice shook with rage. You were too busy being jealous of every woman near me to pay attention. The room went dead silent. Diane reached for him. Daniel, please. I was protecting you. You hit my daughter. Each word landed like a hammer. Get out. Pack your things. I want you gone by tomorrow. Her face crumbled. We're married. We took vows. And you just broke them. Leave now.

Firefighters, neighbors, strangers. I stayed near the back. My dad sat at the front table, laughing. He looked older, happier. Next to him sat a woman I didn't recognize. Blonde hair, diamond necklace, her hand on his arm. She looked like an Aliexpress Karen. One of those women you look at and already know their entire personality. My aunt appeared. You made it then quieter. That's Diane, his wife. They married last year. She's intense. My stomach dropped. Wife? He didn't tell me he got remarried. After mom, speeches started. Everyone talking about my dad's bravery, his loyalty. Every word reminded me we used to be close. Halfway through, I noticed Diane staring. Not casual glancing. Full on staring at me. Acting cold and tying to be alpha or something. Every time I looked up, she was still watching, whispering to the woman next to her. My aunt leaned over. Ignore her. She gets territorial. After a while, the speeches ended and I worked up some courage and approached the front table. I walked up and tapped my dad's shoulder. He turned his face cycled through shock, recognition, Joy, Marley, surprise. He stood so fast his chair fell. Pulled me into a crushing hug. Lifted me off the ground.

By 6 a m, there's a warrant. By 9 a m, he's arrested at his girlfriend's apartment. By noon, she's calling me, crying. She had no idea. She thought he was a devoted father. When she saw the news, she dumped him on the spot. By 2 p m, I'm in emergency family court. The judge asks my kids gently if they want To see their father. My son, my quiet, sweet boy. Looks up and says, only if he has to share his food like he made us share. The entire courtroom goes silent. Emergency custody granted immediately. Full custody hearing scheduled. His lawyer pulls me aside after, drop the charges and he'll sign over custody quietly. I look him in the eyes and smile. No, he can sign it over. And I'm still pressing every charge. Three weeks later, final hearing. He shows up in an expensive suit, crying, telling the judge he's changed, he loves his kids. He made a mistake. The judge looks at him, then looks at my kids medical records showing they'd both lost weight. Looks at the bank statements showing $2,800 monthly deposits. Looks at the receipts I subpoenaed showing he'd spent $4,000 on his girlfriend and birthday trip the same month he was feeding our kids oatmeal. Full custody to mother, supervised visitation only. And, Mister Harrison, you'll be paying back every cent of child support you misuse, plus damages. His girlfriend left him and posted everything on social media. His friends won't talk to him. His own mother called me to apologize and cry. And my kids, they're eating three real meals a day now, with vegetables and protein and dessert. And they're finally smiling again, like they used to.

I screenshotted it, smiled, and said, you're right. Then I airdropped it to everyone at the table. Thanksgiving at my parents house. 20 people crammed around the dining table. My sister Lisa and her husband Brett sitting right across from me. Everything seems normal until my phone buzzed. A text from Brett. You look incredible today. That dress is doing things to me. I looked up. He was staring at me, smiling. Lisa was talking to our mom, completely oblivious. Another text. We should grab drink sometime, just us. Then another. Your sister doesn't have to know. What happens between us? Days between us. I felt sick. This man had been married to my sister for three years. I took screenshots of everything. Then I noticed everyone at the table had iPhones. I opened airdrop, selected everyone, sent all three screenshots. Phone started buzzing around the table. My mom checked hers first. Her face went from confused to horrified. My dad's jaw clenched. My brother stood up. What the hell, Brett? Brett's face went completely white. What? What's happening? Lisa grabbed my mom's phone, read the messages, looked at Brett, then at me. Is this real? Check the number. I said quietly, it's his. She pulled out her phone, compared the number. Her hands started shaking. I texted my sister at Thanksgiving dinner while sitting next to me. Brett stammered, I was joking. It was just a joke. Which part was the joke? My dad asked, standing up. The part where you hit on her daughter, or the part where you said your wife doesn't need to know? I didn't mean. I was drunk. You've had one beer, my mom said coldly. Lisa stood up, took off her ring, and dropped it in Brett's mashed potatoes. Get out of my parents house, Lisa. Come on, get out! I screamed it so loud, the neighbors probably heard. Brett tried to grab her arm. My brother stepped between them. She said, leave now. Brett left. The door slammed. Lisa sat back down, shaking. My mom hugged her. We finished Thanksgiving dinner without him. Ask the stuffing. Discuss divorce lawyers. My aunt even made a toast. To family. Who protects family. Last week, Lisa filed for divorce. Cited the screenshots as evidence of emotional infidelity. Brett tried calling me to apologize. I blocked him. Then he tried to claim I manipulated the situation. The screenshots don't lie. Yesterday, my mom asked, do you regret how you handled it? Not for a second, I said. He thought I keep a secret. Instead, I made it everyone's business.

Sometimes she'd do it multiple times in one event. She'd always laugh and say it's how I show affection. Get used to. Tom thought it was hilarious and said Denise only teases people she likes. His parents said she'd always been playful and I needed to loosen up. Other relatives said it was harmless fun and I was being too sensitive about a little tap. But these weren't little taps.

I'd given up on even trying to mention our anniversary. That's how many times my husband, Landon, had forgotten about it. But this year, his sister must have said something because two weeks after our missed anniversary, he insisted we should go to the Italian place where we had our first date. He didn't apologize or acknowledge what day we were supposedly celebrating. He just made a reservation and told me to wear something nice. We sat down at the same table where I'd patiently waited for him to arrive during the last three years. And every time he told me he couldn't make it due to work. I'd even grown close with the staff because they all joked about my ghost husband who was never here. Katie. Oh, my goodness. Llama, the waitress gasped with delight. You actually brought someone, she beamed at me, then turned to Landon with warm approval. I'm so glad she finally took my advice about bringing a friend instead of waiting. Landon glanced out, confused and, but Mama was already pouring water, gushing at me. Three years of sitting alone on your anniversary and you finally decided to move on. Good for you, honey, she winked at Landon. You must be the coworker she mentioned, the one who actually remembered her promotion. Landon's brow furrowed as Mama continued. Make sure to order the good wine tonight. She always gets the house. Red, since she's paying alone, she patted my shoulder sympathetically before walking away, leaving Landon staring at me. What was that about, he asked. I just looked at the menu. My chest tightening with three years of humiliation. The bartender walked by and did a double take. Llama is that, he gestured at our table. Llama nodded excitedly. Yep, she finally brought a date. No more Phantom Husband stories. The bartender laughed about time. Three years of he's running late got depressing. They weren't even being quiet. Landon's face was changing, his phone lowering to the table. Phantom Husband, he said slowly. A bus boy clearing nearby tables chimed in. Yeah, the lady who cries into her tiramisu. Every year we take bets on whether a guy will actually show up. Land, his jaw tightened. The sommelier approached with genuine enthusiasm. Ma'am, since you have actual company tonight, might I suggest a real bottle? Not like when you nurse a single glass. For hours, Landon was completely still now, watching the staff treat him like my savior while discussing my abandoned anniversaries, I remembered how alone I felt whenever I came here, how I'd wish that Landon would bring me a gift and pick me up and his car, but he'd always let me down. Llama returned with her notepad, still glowing with approval at Landon. You know, sir, she orders the same thing every anniversary, a Butternut squash ravioli. Her husband apparently loved it on their first date here. Landon was starting to squeeze his knuckles, realizing how badly he'd been ignoring his wife. She even brought him a gift once llama continued talking to him like they were conspirators, a Rolex. It sat wrapped on this table for four hours. She shook her head. Can you imagine forgetting your wife exists for three straight years? The sous chef passed by and called out, hey, is that the anniversary lady finally got smart and brought real company. Llama nodded proudly. Someone who actually shows up. Landon's breathing was getting shallow. I'm not, he started, but llama was already taking my order. The usual, honey, and for.

I told a teenage girl she was gonna get assaulted working the night shift at a truck stop and she kicked me out for harassment. I've been driving trucks for 12 years now and I've seen people, men especially, at their darkest late at night on the road. I started driving trucks after my daughter was born because it paid better than warehouse work. My route takes me from Dallas up through Arkansas and into Tennessee. There's this one gas station that I try to avoid like the plague. It's one of those places where the parking lot lights are half broken and there's always sketchy stuff going down. Some nightmare on Elm Street shite. Last time I was there, some tweaker tried to sell me a chainsaw at 3 in the morning. But sometimes you need gas and it's the only stop for 40 miles. This happened about six months ago. I pulled in around 11 at night and noticed something was different right away. The old guy who usually work nights wasn't behind the counter. Instead, there was this young girl who couldn't have been older than 19. She had bright purple hair and enough piercings to make her head explode in an MRI, full sleeve, tattoos on both arms too. She was reading a textbook when I walked in, so I figured she was a student. I grabbed an energy drink and some beef jerky and Went up to pay. You new here, I asked while she rang me up. Yeah, started last week, she said, without looking up from scanning. They had a help wanted sign in the hours work with my class schedule. My stomach dropped a little. This girl had no idea what she'd signed up for. So I told her very respectfully, listen, I don't mean to pry, but you might wanna find somewhere else to work. This place gets rough, especially at night. She finally looked up at me and her face went hard. I can take care of myself, thanks. That annoyed me a little, but I needed her to understand. I'm sure you can, but the drivers that come through here aren't your average cost. Some of these guys have been on the road for days straight. They get weird ideas in their heads, especially when they see a young woman working alone. Is that supposed to be a threat? Her voice got sharp. No, I'm trying to warn you. I've been stopping here for years and I've seen some bad stuff go down. You need to at least keep some heat under the counter for Protection. Get out. She pointed at the door. I don't need some random trucker man explaining danger to me that I can handle myself. I don't even know what man'splaining is. I said, look, I have a daughter about your age and I'd want someone to tell her before I could even say Anything else, she screamed out, before I call the cops and report you for harassment, I held up my hands and backed away. Fine, I tried. Some people just won't listen when you're trying to help them. I paid for my stuff and left without another word. Back in my truck, I popped open the energy drink and did my usual safety check. Tires looked good, load was secure. I was just about to pull out when I remembered I promised my wife I'd grab diapers on the way home. My wife just had another baby girl. She goes through them like crazy and we were almost out. I sat there for a minute to debate whether to go back in. The girl clearly didn't want me there, but I really needed those diapers. I waited about five minutes to let things cool down, then headed back inside. The store was empty. That purple haired girl behind the counter, I hoped for the best and told myself maybe she was in the bathroom or on break. Then I heard.

Marcus, I said slowly, these plants will make you wish you were dead. Your hands will bubble like pizza cheese. Your skin will weep fluids you didn't know you had. And if you're really stupid about where you touch, afterward you'll be explaining some very uncomfortable things to your parents. Whatever. You're just trying to scare us, said Kevin. Marcus is partner in crime. Kevin, I'm trying to educate you. There's a difference. Touch them and learn. I warned 160 students across six classes. They all thought it was typical teacher bull crap, except I meant every word. Day 1, nothing. Just kids whispering theories about fake plants. Day 2, bingo, 3, leaves missing from plant No. 1, torn right off like someone thought they were picking flowers for mommy. Everyone against the wall, I shouted after 6th period, going full prison guard. Someone destroyed my property and I'm searching everyone. I started with the front row, making a big show of turning out pockets and checking bags before announcing nobody leaves until I find these leaves. And I'm checking everything, bags, desks, pockets, use everything except your underwear. Obviously, I'm not trying to catch a case. The class laughed while Marcus and Kevin exchanged glances in the back row. And I watched that terrible idea dawn on their faces. I made a spectacular show of checking every remaining backpack, every pocket, every desk, while those two Tried not to look smug in the back row, thinking they just discovered for the perfect hiding spot. Nothing turned up, obviously. And I dismissed class knowing those geniuses had just played themselves. After the weekend, Marcus and Kevin showed up with their parents at 7:00am looking like they've been attacked by angry bees made of lava. Rashes covered their hands, arms and most spectacularly, their entire groin region apparently looked like a map of hell. What kind of teacher brings poison plants to school? Marcus's dad screamed the trying to warn students repeatedly not to touch them. I said, pointing to my sign, Marcus, tell your father how poison Ivy got inside your underwear. The silence was delicious. We, we thought you were lying, Marcus mumbled. And, and I prompted. And we've been ripping up everyone's plants all semester, Kevin confessed. His mother's face morphing from rage to murder. When you search the class, we stuffed the leaves down our. You need to tell me. Kevin's mom cut him off, her voice deadly calm that you've been destroying teacher's property for months and then put poison Ivy in your underwear. Eight days of steroid shots to very uncomfortable places and suddenly the Great Plant massacre was over. Mrs. managed to save what was left of her grandmother's African violet and it's been thriving ever since.

She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part? Three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street. Even people who weren't family wanted to join the party. My mailman stopped by after his shift ended. Lexi texted me again around three PM. This is all your fault. You ruined everything. Everyone's talking about your stupid party. I showed the text to Matthew, who just shook his head and said, she still doesn't get it, does she? She brought this on herself. I replied, I didn't ruin anything. I just took my contributions with me like you asked. Hope your six person reunion is everything you dreamed of. The party went until almost midnight. People were already asking when the next one would be. My neighbor Jeff said it was the best block party in years. Even the kids Didn't want to leave the pool. Three different people asked if I cater events. Lexi never apologized, but she also never planned another family event. Guess who got asked to host Christmas? The funniest part came two weeks later when Lexi tried to plan a makeup reunion and sent out a group text asking everyone to bring food and drinks. The responses were brutal. Pass. We're waiting for the next one at your brother's house. Why would we downgrade? Thanks, but we already know where the good parties are. She finally called me crying, asking what she needed to do to fix things. I told her the truth. You can't fix eight years of taking credit for other people's work with one apology. Lexi.

I've never given a damn about plants, but watching sweet missus Brooks collapse over her grandmother's murdered African Violet flipped a switch in my brain I didn't know existed. What the kids called the Great Plant Massacre started innocently enough in September with a few missing leaves here and there that teachers wrote off as overwatering or underwatering. By October, these little psychopaths were stripping entire plants bare like piranhas on a cow carcass. These weren't accidents. This was botanical serial killing. Missus Anderson walked into her classroom to find her three year old orchid shredded across her desk. And she just stood there whispering, I grew that from a seed over and over, like she found a dead pet. Mister Thompson's ten year old bonsai got snapped in half like a wishbone. And when the kids destroyed the principal's fern and arranged the leaves into a wiener on his desk, even I had to admire their commitment. We're dealing with vandals, Principal Harrison announced at a staff meeting. And when we catch them, there will be severe consequences. Yeah, right. I thought these kids are running circles around us. And Harrison couldn't catch a cold in a preschool. Even the math teacher tried fake plants as a work around, but these little demons destroyed those, too. And use the plastic leaves to spell R I P. But everything changed in November when I Found Missus Brook sobbing over her smashed plant pot. Jake, she choked out. This plant was from my grandmother's funeral 12 years ago. I kept it alive through divorce, through cancer, through everything. And these kids destroyed it for fun. Those damn kids. I said, watching her hold a resignation letter. I can't do this anymore. She whispered, they win. That's when my teacher brain shut off, and something darker took over. Because nobody makes Missus Brooks cry. And these little psychopaths were about to learn that karma's a bitch. And she. It's about to throw hands. See, I'm genetically immune to poison Ivy, oak, and sumac, which sounds like a useless superpower until you need to use biological warfare on teenage terrorists. I actually cultivate poison Ivy along my back fence cause I'm petty and don't want the neighbor kids cutting through my yard. So I had a ready supply of nature's revenge growing right at home.

But this particular Saturday night, I witnessed something that made me question whether I should fire my top comedian, Princeton, or give him a raise. We were about two minutes from closing when this couple I didn't recognize walked in. The girlfriend immediately started apologizing to us, saying she knew it was late and they'd probably missed everything, but could they at least grab a drink before we closed. She seemed genuinely sweet, the kind of person who apologized to the Ducks when she didn't have any bread. So I let them into the bar. I was going to tell Prinston to serve them some alcohol and crack a few jokes anyway because it's Saturday night and why not? But before I could even say anything else to Prinston, the woman's boyfriend cut her off with this aggressive nudge that made my stomach turn. Ignore the woman, he said, rolling his eyes like she was a burden. Then the boyfriend actually snapped his fingers in her face like she was a dog and said, let the men talk. He then turned to Prinston and declared, we want two beers.

Growing up, I always thought my family was just really private. You know how some families share everything at dinner and others barely talk? We were the second type. But it wasn't until my cousin Danny went missing that I started to realize our family's version of private was something else entirely. Danny was the kind of guy who asked questions about everything. Why did great Uncle Vincent really move to Florida? What happened to the money from Grandpa's life insurance? Why did we never visit Mom's side of the family anymore? At every family gathering, Danny would corner someone with his theories and observations, trying to piece together our family's history like some amateur detective. The adults always brushed him off with nervous laughs and quick subject changes. Danny's always been too curious for his own good, they'd say, ruffling his hair. But there was something in their eyes when they said it, something that looked almost like fear. When Danny turned 25, he started getting really serious about genealogy research. He'd show up to Sunday dinners with printouts from ancestry websites and old newspaper clippings he'd found at the library. He was obsessed with filling in the gaps in our family tree, especially the relatives who seemed to just disappear from records. Around the 1980s, my parents and aunts would get visibly uncomfortable whenever Danny pulled out his research folders. They'd start Clearing dishes earlier than usual or suddenly remember important phone calls they had to make.

Senior year, Bella was applying to colleges. She'd been adopted as a baby and decided to write her essay about finally meeting her birth mother that summer. It was raw, emotional, perfect. She asked Ethan to proofread it one night while we were all studying at the library. I watched him read it on her laptop and I swear the color drained from his face. The essay described meeting her birth mom, Catherine, how Catherine got pregnant at 16, how her family forced her to give the baby up, how Catherine had kept one photo all these years, how they met at a specific Starbucks on Route 9. I remember Bella was so proud of that essay. She'd been working on it for weeks, crying while writing it, finally feeling like she understood where she came from. She kept saying how Catherine had the same laugh as her, the same way of tucking hair behind her ear, then stood up so fast his chair fell over. Bella asked him what was wrong. He just shook his head, grabbed his stuff and left without explanation. She looked at me completely confused. Did I write something offensive? Is the essay bad? I told her it was beautiful because it was. But Something in Ethan's reaction made my stomach drop. He didn't answer her calls that night or the next day. I found out later what happened.

Instead of taking care of his kids, who were just 10 and 11, he started going out every night, clubs, bars, road trips, anything to avoid responsibility. Meanwhile, his kids stayed at home hungry. Every day after work, I went to their house. I cooked, cleaned, helped with homework and tried to give them love. I begged my brother to step up. He always shrugged and said, relax, they'll be fine. Then he'd leave for another party. I didn't call CPS because I didn't want to traumatize the kids even more. One morning he showed up at my door with two big suitcases. His kids were behind him, looking tired and scared, smiled and said, I'm leaving town for a long time. Take care of them. I'll pick them up when they turn 18. Before I could say anything, he ran to his car and drove off. Suddenly, I was a parent of two kids who weren't mine. My house felt too small. My money was tight and my life stopped. I never dated, never looked for a husband, never went out with friends. Every time I thought about leaving, I saw their faces and thought, they need me more than I need myself. Years went by. We celebrated birthdays, joined sports and Did school projects together. I helped them with college application.

Even my own mother texted me, we raised you better than this. Nothing else. When I tried calling, she didn't pick up. My sister let me move into her basement, but her husband pulled me aside after three days. Look, I'm sorry, but you need to find somewhere else. We have kids to think about. One week, that's all I can give you. I had $247 to my name. The worst part was watching Theodore crumble. Just admit it so I can start healing, he said when I went back for clothes. Please, Lauren, just tell me the truth so I can move on. But there was no truth to tell. I felt so lonely that I started to get worried about my baby absorbing my stress hormones. I almost broke down during the first prenatal appointment with my gynecologist. Doctor badge, because it was the most gentle someone had touched me in weeks. She was halfway through the routine exam, measuring my belly and checking the baby's position when she suddenly stopped. I'm going to run a full panel just to be thorough. An hour later, she called me back into her office. My stomach dropped. In 11 years of Seeing Doctor Vag, I'd only been in that room once when she discussed my fertility options before Theodore and I finally got pregnant. Please have a seat. She close the door behind me. Is the baby okay? My voice came out strangled. The heartbeat looks strong, right? You said everything measured normal. The baby is perfectly healthy. She sat down across from me, pulling my chart closer. But there's something in your blood work we need to discuss. My mind raced through possibilities. Lauren, your test came back positive for chlamydia. The words hung there not making sense. That's, that's impossible. I've only been with my husband for 15 years. Only him. She looked at me with pity. The strain you have typically presents symptoms within four to six weeks of transmission. If you've never slept with anyone else, the only way you can have it is if Theodore slept with someone else. The room tilted as everything clicked. I wasn't the one who cheated. He was. He must have come close to being exposed and that's why he just spent weeks setting me up to take the fall for his affair. Also, he wouldn't have to pay child support. The tears streaming down my face weren't sadness anymore. They were pure relief that I had uncovered the truth. And now, two years later, when Theodore sends me court mandated money that I won in the divorce, I sit in my Manhattan penthouse with my baby girl and smile.

Now she's furious and wants to cancel it after she Learned that my dad is a millionaire. My fiance is a doctor and I work in finance earning almost equal pay. We have been together for a year and a half, got engaged a month ago and are planning a wedding in seven months. His family is full of doctors while my dad owns a business. My mom is a housewife and my brother along with his wife is a high school teacher. My parents still live in a small townhouse my grandfather bought since the two of them grew up there, fell in love and had us, plus all their friends live there. Basically emotional attachment. I never try to hide my wealth. I just don't show off. For example, I prefer travelling by public transport because of traffic and parking. While my fiance drives a Range Rover, I have a Samsung. He makes fun of me for not owning an iPhone. I prefer not to spend thousands of dollars on a dress I'm only going to wear once. I also enjoy eating fast food rather than going to a Michelin starred restaurant. I admit I never told them how much my dad earns as I felt it was unnecessary anyway. I think he and his family assumed my family didn't have much money or something after getting Engaged, we went to his parents house for dinner where they asked me what I plan to do in the future. I replied that I was planning to quit my job after the wedding and work for my dad. They kind of got confused, mad or weird saying why I would quit such a high paying job and that if I was planning to push all financial burdens on their son. Well, they asked for a prenuptial agreement. I agreed. A couple of weeks ago, we started planning our wedding. In my culture, I am an Indian and he is white. We have big weddings and that is the only place we show our wealth. My parents were discussing how they want to invite over 250 people from our side since I will be taking over the business and its networking and having how they want to have two weddings, an Indian and a white. Now Indian weddings have a lot of functions spanning three to four days, all of which would preferably be hosted at five star hotels or if we follow my dad, he wants to rent a castle. His parents demanded that if we wanted to have an extensive wedding, we would be the ones paying, to which my dad agreed, saying he was going to pay for everything even if they didn't ask. As the wedding planning proceeded, my fiance and his family realised we were spending way more than they could afford. I guess that's When it struck them that my dad's business wasn't as small as they expected it to be, they did a Google search and found his company online and his net turnover every year, which is on the website and so on. Anyway, now his family is mad at me saying why did I hide the fact that I am this rich? I am pretty sure they want to cancel the prenup. I am not going to do that now since it was their idea. Well, his mom is harassing me.

My dad snorted when I walked in. Then my sister's new husband shook my hand and froze. He turned pale, looked me up online, and suddenly everyone went silent. My dad likes to pretend I don't exist. Not in the dramatic, you're dead to me kind of way. That would have taken effort. No, he just slowly erased me. Left me out of conversations, family photos, even holiday seating charts. Wanted a son who wore cuff links and talked about sales quotas over golf. Instead, he got me, the college dropout who started bartending at 22 and never stopped. To him, that made me a failure. A joke. And he made sure everyone else in the family knew it, too. So I stopped showing up to events. Quietly cut myself out of their perfect little photo ops. Until last weekend. My sister Tessa's wedding. Fancy venue. Marble floors, chandeliers that could kill a man. I wasn't invited to the engagement party or the bridal shower, but I did get a formal wedding invite from my mom. Probably because Grandpa Harold, the only person in the family who actually likes me, threatened not to attend if I wasn't invited. So I showed up. Black suit, clean shave, no entourage. I plan to blend in, smile, and leave before dessert. But, of course, that didn't happen. First thing I hear walking in, my dad's voice. Already drunk, already talking shit. Oh, Julian. You mean the bartender? He's probably Mixing rum and Cokes in some club downtown. He wouldn't last 10 minutes in a place like this. Everyone laughed, even my mom. I didn't say a word. Just clenched my jaw and walked in like I hadn't heard it. My hands were shaking. Not from embarrassment. I'm holding back. The bride and groom made their big entrance. Tessa looked surprised to see me. James, her new husband, didn't know who I was. Not yet. Eventually they made their rounds and came up to me. Tessa smiled like it hurt. Julian didn't know you were coming. You invited me, I said. She glanced away. James stuck out his hand. Nice to meet you, he said. I'm Julian.

My 9 year old daughter Alexis spent four months growing a vegetable garden to sell at the farmers market and buy herself a 200 dollar bike. Every morning before school, I'd find her tending to her tomato plants, cucumbers, bell peppers, carrots and green beans. He practiced her sales pitch every night.

Tanner, please don't touch those, Alexis said. He picked up a cucumber. How much? Alexis said $2 per pound. Tanner made a face. That's a rip off. These look like garbage. A woman browsing frowned and walked away. They're not garbage. Please stop. And I started tossing the cucumber in the air. I'm family. I can do what I want. He tossed it higher and didn't catch it. It hit the ground and slid open. Oops. Amy was too busy playing on her phone to pair. I walked over. Tanner, you need to leave. He looked at me. For what? He turned back to Alexis. You think anyone wants to buy food from a little kid? This is embarrassing. Alexis's eyes started watering. Tanner grabbed one of her signs and crumpled it. Stop it. Tanner laughed and grabbed another sign. He ripped it in half. Then he shoved a crate of tomatoes off the table. It crashed and tomatoes rolled everywhere. Alexis screamed, why are you doing this? People stopped and stared. Tanner smiled at the crowd. Because she's a selfish little brat who thinks she's special. Then he grabbed the table and flipped it. Everything went flying.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organized every holiday, baked every birthday cake and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers and started over as Jade instead of Jade, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But week two, my brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week three, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka, couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration, same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My co workers told her I'd Moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2, Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He'd never realized I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery.

My sister's kids threw it in the fire while my parents laughed. My sister chuckled. Maybe this will teach her not to be spoiled. I just smiled, close my wallet and the whole room went silent. My daughter Carla just turned thirteen. She loves digital art and I've been saving for months to buy her a two thousand dollar laptop for her birthday. Her birthday fell around Easter, which meant the big family gathering at my parents place. My Sister Amanda arrived with her three kids who have no rules at home. Within minutes they pulled Carla's sketchbook out and scribbled all over her drawings. Carla came running outside, holding back tears. Relax, it just paper. She can draw more. Amanda shrugged. At dinner, I had the laptop wrapped in a gift bag on her chair. Carla opened it carefully and her face lit up. Dad, this is amazing! She hugged me tight. Before I could even take a picture, one of Amanda's kids grabbed the laptop. He ran toward the fire pit holding it over his head while the others cheered. Stop! I yelled, but it was too late. He tossed it in like a Frisbee. The sound when it hit the flames was sick. Carla gasped, went quiet. I fished it out, but the casing had already melted. That's when I heard the laughter. Amanda was laughing, my parents were chuckling. Dad said maybe That'll teach her not to be spoiled. Carla was shaking, tears rolling down her face. My whole family was acting like this was some kind of joke. I set the melted laptop down slowly and looked directly at Amanda. She smirked. It's just a computer. You can buy another one. Maybe get her something she needs instead of spoiling her. I didn't yell, I just smiled. The entire table went quiet because they knew that smile meant something was coming. Later, Amanda and mom were giggling in the kitchen. Don't look so serious, mom said. It was just a prank. You're acting like they burned down your house, Amanda said. I worked months

His wife said, the baby's moving. Touch it. I'm an obstetrician. I placed my hand and immediately pulled my wife aside. Call an ambulance now, she asked. Why didn't you feel the baby move? That's not. I collapsed as I heard my own words. My name is Michael. I've delivered over 3,000 babies. David's two years younger than me. Smart, kind, always a little too trusting. He married Jessica three years ago. She was sweet on the outside, but something always felt fake. Never talked about her family, always dodged questions with a perfect answer. Felt too rehearsed. She announced her pregnancy out of nowhere, said she was 7 months in. Baby boy do the spring. David was over the moon. He built a nursery, bought a stroller that cost more than my car, posted daily bump updates like a proud dad. The baby shower was packed. Food, balloons, gifts, everything blue. Jessica was glowing in a flowy dress, belly looked legit. David kept introducing her as the glowing mama. She smiled like a queen, acted warm, hugged everyone. Asked every mom there about their pregnancies. My wife, Sarah, leaned over and whispered, she's really got that new mom vibe. I didn't disagree. Around four PM, Jessica gasped, her hand on her belly. He's moving like crazy. You have to feel him. Women lined up touching her stomach. Everyone was smiling. Then she turned to me. Michael, you're the expert. Come feel your nephew. I hesitated. I don't like crossing medical boundaries at family events. But she look so excited. Everyone was watching. Sarah gave me a nudge. I stepped forward, place my hand on her belly and everything froze. I felt thousands of fetal movements in my career. This wasn't one. It was light, shallow to surface level. There was no depth, no pressure, no resistance. And the rhythm way too perfect. Like the loop, a pre recorded pattern. It didn't come from within. It was under the skin. I kept my face neutral, smiled, very active, I said. Then I turned to Sarah. Can you help me get something from the car? We walked to the kitchen. I grabbed her wrist. Call 9 1 1 right now. What? Why? She asked.

It hadn't shrunk afterward, nor had she experienced any side effects. She grabbed my hands and placed them on her breasts. I was so shocked that I unconsciously broke her heart. She grown. Be gentle, Rena. It was then that I believed she wasn't lying. I couldn't help but think that this was the perfect solution. Ahem. Could you recommend a doctor, Aya? I have a friend who's really frustrated about this. Thanks a lot, Stephanie. I smiled awkwardly as I asked Stephanie for the clinic's website so I could make an appointment. I didn't expect it to be any different from the other clinics, which were usually cold and austere. In fact, this one was kind of cute and cheerful. The first thing I saw on the website was that it was 95 years away from becoming a century old planet. Look through the information on the website and soon came across several examples of successful cases. The most recent was a photo of Stephanie. Her face wasn't in the picture, but I recognized her by the tattoo on her torso. Website also showed good reviews all over. This solidified my desire to make my chest grow through massages. Just like that, I plucked up the courage to go to the massage and body sculpting clinic on one of my days off. Wearing a mask and cap, I looked like a Spy. As I approached the receptionist. Hi, I have an appointment with Doctor Gold. Before the receptionist could say anything, a man in a white coat who looked about six feet tall, approached me. Hi, are you miss Sabrina Grant? You have an appointment for a massage and body sculpting. Right. I'm James Gold. Come with me, please. He reached out to take my bag. He put an arm around my shoulder and LED me into the room. I stood inside, feeling so awkward and embarrassed, but I couldn't stop playing with the hem of my shirt. James laughed. I can understand your concern, Miss Grant, but a doctor doesn't pay attention to the gender of his patients. It's too hard for you. You can always think of me as a potato. He could tell I was nervous about having a male doctor, so he took off his mask and smiled to ease my nerves. Without his mask, I could see how handsome he was. His eyes crinkled when he smiled, and his long eyelashes made him look at me tenderly. He had a large nose and his lips were a healthy red. I was stunned by his appearance. Then I complimented him. I can't do that. Even if you were a potato, you'd still be handsome. His smile grew. Then he put on a pair of gloves and pointed to the massage table next to him. Thank you for the compliment, Miss Grant. Now, please take off your top. And bra. And lie on your back. I shyly undressed and lay on the massage table, breathing softly. James pinched and lifted as he examined me. Then he rubbed me. I blushed and began to react down there, but soon he frowned. That scared me a little. What is wrong? Am I unfit for the massage? You are not in the best position for me to determine the best place for the massage, Miss Grant. You also seem to have other gynecological problems, he said. I was taken aback by his words and sat up anxiously. Really? That shouldn't be the case. I don't sleep around. He waved his hand with a smile when he saw how nervous I was. I don't mean that, Miss Grant. You don't have to worry about that. I just have a hunch about something. I'll have to do a more thorough check to be sure. You're not in the best position for me to detect anything, so I'm going to have to ask you to remove your pants. Kneel on the massage table. That's the best way I can see you. My period had been irregular for several months. At night I would also get, so I did as I was told. I held one arm across my chest while I spread my legs and knelt on the massage table in an embarrassing position.

You can't live with us anymore. When I packed up and told them I'd stop paying the bills, my dad, at first I thought I misheard. My mom gave this nervous laugh like maybe he was joking. But he just sat there staring at me, waiting for my reaction. The room went silent. My sister Lily froze, her fork halfway to her mouth. She looked at me with wide eyes like she couldn't believe what she just heard. I swallowed the piece of ham I was chewing and put my fork down. What? You heard me? He said, you're no longer welcome here. You need to move out. I just sat there trying to process. I'm 23, have a steady job, could have moved out years ago, but I stayed because they needed me. I, I paid the electric Bill, the internet, groceries most weeks, things they couldn't afford because my dad had been unemployed for years and my mom only worked part time. I wasn't a burden. I was the reason the lights were still on in that house. And now, out of nowhere, I was being kicked out like some useless freeloader. Mom finally spoke up. Maybe we should talk about this later. But dad interrupted. No, Ed, this is my house. I make the rules. And I say, he's done here. Lily put down her fork. She was only 16, and I could tell she was scared. She stared. At our parents like she didn't even recognize them. If they could throw me out so easily, what did that mean for her? I took a deep breath. I wasn't going to argue or beg. If they wanted me out, fine. But they weren't ready for what that really meant. I leaned back in my chair. All right, I said. My dad sat up straighter like he'd won some imaginary battle. My mom still looked uncomfortable, but she didn't say anything. Maybe she was in shock or maybe she, I just didn't care as much as I thought. I stood up, grabbed my plate and carried it to the sink. I didn't want to give them the reaction they wanted. Instead, I looked at Lily, who was still sitting there, tense and confused. I gave her a small nod. She was the only one at that table I still cared about. Dad took a sip of his drink like nothing had happened. Mom went back to picking at her mashed potato. Lilly kept looking at me like she wanted to say something, but she didn't. I didn't stay to finish dinner, just walked out. I went straight to my room, closed the door and started packing. I wasn't going to waste time trying to understand why they were doing this. If they wanted me gone, I was gone. But that also meant they'd lose everything I've been paying for, and I wasn't going to warn them. I packed in silence. But I could hear them talking downstairs. My mom's voice was low and scared. My dad's was firm, like he was trying to convince her of something. I caught bits and pieces. He's old enough. We can handle it. He should have moved out years ago. An hour later, there was a knock on my door. I opened it and Lily slipped inside, quickly shutting the door behind her. Her eyes were red and puffy. She'd been crying. Are you really leaving? She whispered. Yeah. I said, I don't have much choice. Can I come with you? That broke my heart. You're 16, they'd call the cops. But the second you turn 18, my door's open. She hugged me tight. I hate them for that. Don't, I said. Just remember who was here for you. I left that night. Didn't say goodbye to them, just grabbed my stuff and drove to a friend's place. Three days later, my phone exploded. Mom. I stared at the screen.

I smiled. Two days later, she was homeless just like him. Mom called me panicking. My sister's voice cut through the Sunday morning quiet. You need to kick Sophie out. I looked up for my coffee, kitchen table, sunlight streaming through the window, smell of bacon still in the air. What? Rachel leaned against the counter, arms crossed. Sophie's 19. She should get her own place. Derek needs to move in here. I blinked. Derek, your boyfriend of three months? Yes. He needs somewhere to stay. So does my daughter. She's an adult now. Time to grow up. Sophie was upstairs. My daughter, sophomore in college, living at home to save money. This is my house. Rachel, actually, she smiled. It's mom's house and I already talked to her. She agrees. My blood went cold. The house was in Mom's name. She bought it 20 years ago. Let me live here after my divorce. I've been paying rent to her for 15 years, but the deed was still hers. Mom said you'd kick out Sophie. She said, family helps family. Derek's practically family now. I gripped my coffee mug. He's homeless because he got evicted for not paying rent. He had a rough patch. 34 and works part time at a gas station. Her face went red. You're so judgmental. This is why you're divorced. I stayed quiet. Fine. I said, let Me talk to mom. Rachel smiled. Victory in her eyes. She's expecting your call. I called mom that afternoon. Did you you tell Rachel I'd kick out Sophie? Pause. Rachel mentioned Derek needs help and Sophie is an adult. I'm paying you $1,800 a month to live here. NP. I know, honey, but Rachel's struggling. My jaw clenched. So you want me to kick out your granddaughter for Rachel's boyfriend? Don't be dramatic. Sophie can find an apartment with what money? She's in college. You'll figure it out. You always do. I hung up. Open my laptop. 15 years of rent payments, $1,800 a month every month, never late. $324,000 for a house she bought for $180,000. I called my lawyer. I've been paying rent for 15 years. No lease. Can I be evicted all without a lease? Yes. I can give you 30 day notice. Oh, what if I've been paying above market rate? Market rate is $1,200. I've been paying $1,800. Silence. For 15 years. Yes. Plus I renovated the kitchen, replace the roof, new HVAC, all out of pocket. Send me receipts now. I did. Rachel called the next morning, smug. Mom's giving you 30 days. Better start packing. Okay. That's it. Okay. I smiled. She couldn't see it. Thank you, Rachel. She hung up. Satisfied. My lawyer called back. Your mother took out a second mortgage eight years ago. She owes $95,000. Three months behind foreclosure.

Three years later, he's losing it. Seeing me happy with my successful business and my soulmate Jason dumped me after his family decided I wasn't good enough for their precious bloodline. Nine years together and I got replaced by Victoria, daughter of his dad's business partner, old money, Ivy League degree, spoke three languages, had connections in every major city. Everything I apparently wasn't to break up speech was Caroline, you know I love you. But my family has concerns about long term compatibility after nine years after I moved across the country for his job, helped his sister get into college and every holiday with his family like I was already one of them. His mother called it incompatibility. I called it what it really was. I didn't come from the right tax bracket. They were engaged within six months. I watched their announcement on Instagram while eating ice cream straight on the container at 2:00am. The comments were full of people I thought were my friends congratulating them, saying they were perfect together. The erasure was systematic. His mother, who used to call me her second daughter, blocked my number. His sister, who I'd mentored through her teenage years acted like I was a stranger when we ran into each other at target. 9 years of my life deleted like a spam email. My friends back home begged me to leave the city, but Something stubborn in me refused to run. Instead, I got angry. That little hobby Jason always dismissed. My sustain well fashion side hustle he called playing dress up became my lifestyle. His mother once asked at dinner when I'd focus on my real career instead of wasting time on vintage clothes. I remembered that comment every single day. I threw everything into it. 16 hour days learning supply chains, connecting with local artisans, building relationships with sustainable fabric suppliers. I reinvested every penny, lived off ramen, turned my spare bedroom into a workspace. A marketing background finally paid off. I built a brand story that resonated. The sustainable fashion wave hit and I caught it. Within a year, I went from a few hundred dollars a month to five figures. By year two, I quit my day job. Then a major fashion blogger featured me as an emerging sustainable brand to watch. Orders exploded overnight. I hired employees.

I'm in love with Haley, his step sister. Everyone just sat there frozen. They walked out together while I stood there in my dress feeling like I couldn't breathe. But that wasn't even the worst part. I had to call 70 guests myself, explaining why the wedding was off. The next day, they posted photos together online like it was some great love story. Our friends actually took their side. I found out they've been sneaking around for months behind my back while I was picking wedding flowers. They were meeting in secret. I felt so stupid I packed up everything and left her law school where I basically lived in the library. No friends, no dating, just textbooks and this burning anger that kept me going. I specialized in family law. I wanted to understand exactly what makes someone an unfit parent and how to prove it in court. First year, I was sleeping four hours a night. Second year, I was top of my class. Third year, three different firms were fighting to hire me. Meanwhile, Ryan and Haley had a baby and their lives were falling apart. Their parents completely cut them off. They went from posting fancy dinner photos to selling their furniture on Facebook, lost their apartment and had to move in with roommates. Both working minimum wage at the best firm and became their star researcher. 1, 17 custody cases. My first Year never thought I'd see them again until my boss called me in one morning about a new client. He told me the client specifically asked for our firm. I walked into the conference room ready to meet this new client. There was this exhausted looking man in a wrinkled shirt facing away from me. When he turned around, my whole body went cold. It was Ryan, but he didn't recognize me at all. I'd lost 30 pounds, wore expensive suits, now had completely different hair. He just started rambling about his case. My ex is trying to take my daughter. She left me for someone else and now says I'm unfit. He kept talking while I took notes, trying to keep my hands steady. He explained how Haley met some rich dentist at her gym and wanted full custody of their daughter. She was claiming Ryan had manipulated her into their relationship. The dentist was funding her lawyers while Ryan could barely afford our consultation. Then he looked up from his hands and really saw me for the first time. His whole face went white. He said, oh, my god, no, this can't be happening. He started to leave but stopped at the door. My daughter needs the best. That's you, isn't it? I nodded. He sat back down. I spent two weeks building Ryan's case like my entire career depended on it. I found daycare records proving he did every pickup, doctor visits he attended alone while Haley Was posting gym selfies. Court day came and Haley walked in wearing a designer dress and heels. Holding the dentist's hand and actually laughing about something. Then she saw me sitting at Ryan's table organizing evidence. Her smile completely vanished. She grabbed her lawyer frantically, but there was nothing she could do. The judge had already started. For the first hour, Haley's lawyer painted Ryan as controlling and manipulative. He claimed Ryan forced her into an inappropriate relationship. Then we presented our evidence, 60 pages of proof. The daycare teacher testified that Ryan knew everything about his daughter, including her favorite toy, her allergies, her exact bedtime routine. Haley didn't even know her dog.

She was extra happy that night, holding my hand and dancing as we walked back to the car. Tonight was the night I was gonna do it. And as I watched her dance down the sidewalk, I thought someone behind us just had really bright headlights. But when I turned around, they were getting bigger. I saw the truck coming towards us and without thinking, I tried to get her out of the way. She screamed, but before I could push her, the truck hit both of us. Everything was slow motion, but I tried to shield her with my own body as best as I could. It hit us hard and I felt like my world was being ripped from me. I, I don't even remember how I landed 20 feet away, but the adrenaline was so insane, I stood up and didn't even notice my leg was broken until I tried to get to her. I just hobbled towards her and found her barely still breathing on the ground. She looked at me and tried to say something. He didn't have any air in her lungs, but reached up to hold my face before I lost consciousness. I woke up on the hospital bed and instantly noticed how much medication I was under, but none of that mattered. My first and only thought was my girl. I had to know if She was okay, nurse, nurse, where's my girlfriend? Please tell me she's okay. But the nurse's face told me nothing and everything at once. She's alive, she said, but the way she said it made a live sound like barely. She told me my leg was shattered in three places, that I was lucky, but all I cared about was her. When they finally let me crutch to her hallway, her doctor stopped me outside her room. Through the small window, I could see her mom crying her eyes out. And I started silent, praying she was okay. I tried to go inside, but he put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a look and I knew it wasn't a good one. I asked the doctor to just tell me what was going on. And he made me promise to stay calm because her family was in there already stressed, I promised. And he told me she isn't recognizing anyone. She doesn't know who her mother is. What? Why wouldn't she know her mom? She's experiencing severe amnesia. She doesn't remember anything from the past several years. I couldn't believe it. But that's temporary, right? The memories come back. They always come back. His silence was, it's deafening sometimes. He finally said, it's hard to say. I watched her mother crying and understood now her own daughter didn't know who she was anymore. I just took a deep breath and pushed open the door, ready for anything. I Turned the corner and saw my girl. She was propped up in the hospital bed, a bandage wrapped around her head, her left arm in a cast. Even though she was in the roughest state I've ever seen her in, she was still the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I was so happy she was okay. And I crunched over to the side of her bed. She was on even stronger meds than me. But when she looked at me, I could tell she was confused. She goes, hi. I gave her a smile, but I could tell by the way she was looking at me that she didn't know who I was. Her body survived, but I was terrified that the girl I fell in love with wasn't with me anymore. I felt tears in my eyes. But before it got too bad, she says, you're funny looking, but you're cute. Why are you crying? I didn't know what to say. This is probably weird to say, but you're actually really cute. I couldn't help it. I laughed. Even with no memory of us, she was still her. You think I'm cute, I asked. Tears streaming down my face but smiling through them. Yeah, I think I like you. She was definitely still her. And then I couldn't help myself. I knew she was still there. So without thinking, I just kissed her. And as soon as I did, her jaw literally dropped. In her dazed state, she Couldn't believe what had just happened and start saying, he kissed me. The cute guy just kissed me. I kissed her again and she started blushing and I knew I was falling for her all over again. She had to relearn how to do pretty much everything. But although her memory never came back, before that day, we fell in love again. Now I'm planning to propose for the second time.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. The lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes, and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find that very Hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenager, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right, but you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans work, or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss John, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems, and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick, and even the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo on his phone and showed This is a picture from your Instagram account posted three days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

My wife, Naomi, and her best friend Jen have been inseparable since college, 20 years of friendship. I've always dealt with it because Naomi's happy. But three months ago, something shifted. Naomi started saying things that didn't sound like her. Maybe we should wait on kids until we're more financially stable. We have $85,000 saved. I think you work too much. I work 9 to 5. My parents mentioned you're not very ambitious. Her parents love me. Every single new opinion came within 24 hours of Jen visiting our house. I noticed Jen started coming over three times a week instead of her usual once a month. She'd stay for hours and every time she left, Naomi would bring up something new to criticize about our life together. Two weeks ago, Naomi suddenly wanted to move to a bigger house. We bought our place two years ago. When I asked why, she said Jen's house has four bedrooms and a pool. We don't even have kids yet. Last Tuesday, I came home early from a cancelled meeting. I heard voices in the kitchen. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard my name. Jen's voice carried through the hallway. You know he's never going to make partner at that firm, right? My husband made partner at 32. Yours is 35 and still an associate. Naomi laughed awkwardly. He's doing fine. We're comfortable. Jen wasn't done. Comfortable isn't The same as successful. I'm just saying if you want the life you actually deserve, maybe this isn't it. Look at my cousin Josie. She divorced her husband last year and now she's engaged to a surgeon. She's so much happier. I stood frozen in our hallway. This woman was actively trying to convince my wife to leave me. I don't know, Naomi said quietly. Things have been feeling off lately because you're finally seeing clearly. Jen replied, I've been waiting for you to realize it. I walked into the kitchen. Jen didn't even flinch, just smiled at me like we've been discussing the weather. Hey, we were just talking about you. I looked at Naomi. She couldn't meet my eyes. Jen grabbed her purse. Well, I should get going, Naomi. Think about what I said. Okay. She hugged Naomi and walked out. Naomi immediately went upstairs without saying a word to me. That night, Naomi brought up separation. She sat on the edge of our bed and used the exact same phrases Jen had used that afternoon. I think we want different things. I need to figure out what I actually want. Maybe we rushed into this. We dated for six years before getting married. We've been married for three. I asked her Point Blank, is this what you want or what Jen wants? Naomi's face crumbled. She started crying. Mess Sarah ran down her cheeks, but she couldn't answer the question. I pressed harder because three months ago, you Were talking about baby names. Three months ago, you loved our house. Three months ago you told me I was your best friend. What changed? I don't know, she whispered. I just feel confused. When did you start feeling confused? Before or after Jen started coming over all the time. She looked at me like I'd slap. Don't blame Jen for this. She's trying to help me. Help you do what exactly? I asked leave me. She got defensive, accused me of being controlling, said I was trying to isolate her from her friends, said I'd never understood her relationship with. Then she grabbed a pillow and locked herself in our bedroom. I slept in the guest room that night, stared at the ceiling until 3:00am the next morning. I checked our phone Bill online. Jen had called Naomi. Naomi 47 times in the past three weeks. Naomi called her back 52 times. They were talking for hours, sometimes past midnight. I felt sick. Yesterday, Naomi's mom called me. She was crying. She said Naomi told her we're having problems and she doesn't understand why. Her mom said Naomi seems like a completely different person lately. She won't even come to Sunday dinners anymore.

You need to stop being so friendly with my friends. What are you talking about? I asked. She spun around, and I could see she'd been working up to this all night. You drove Carla home last week. You spent three hours helping Heather with her resume. You fixed Nicole's laptop. Her voice kept getting sharper with each example. They're your friends. I'm being helpful. She actually laughed at me. Not a real laugh, but that bitter kind. That meant I was in trouble. Helpful. My ex was helpful, too. Then I caught him in bed with my roommate. So that's what this was about. So you think I'm going to sleep with your friends? She crossed her arms, and I knew I'd already lost this fight. I'm not stupid. I see how they look at you, how they always need something fixed when I'm not home. From now on, you keep your distance. No more favor, no more long conversations. Treat them like strangers. Fine. If that's what she wanted, that's what she'd get. Carla's car died in our driveway. First she knocked on our door holding jumper cables with this hopeful look on her face. I look did her through the door window, made eye contact, then walked away. She knocked harder, and her face went from confused to hurt. Melissa had to go outside and jump the car herself. While I sat on the couch, I could hear Carla asking what was wrong with Me and Melissa making up some excuse about me being busy. The guilt hit me, but I pushed it down. Then Heather texted about a job interview in my field. She needed quick advice about technical questions. I screenshotted it and sent it to Melissa with your friend needs something as the message. Melissa spent two hours on the phone pretending to understand software development while I watch TV. She kept shooting me these desperate looks, but I just shrugged. The escalation really started at game night. Nicole's laptop ash with her presentation for work still open. She was near tears, and everyone could see it. Can you please look at it just this once? She begged. Everyone waited for me to help like I always did. Sorry, can't help, I said, and went back to my cards. Nicole left early, in full pan mode about her morning meeting. Gina pulled Melissa aside. What's wrong with him? He always helps. Melissa's excuses were getting weaker. At Melissa's birthday party, things got ugly. Her friend Amanda needed help carrying in this massive cake. I threw out my back, she explained while struggling with the box. I stayed in my chair. Hope you feel better, I said, and turned back to my conversation. Three women had to help Amanda while the entire room went silent. Melissa's mom asked if we were having problems, and I could hear the concern in her voice. The breaking point was Gina's engagement party. During group photos, I stepped out every time Melissa's friends were in the shot. I'll take the picture, I kept saying. When they insisted I join. I suddenly needed the bathroom. By the fifth photo, Gina was actually crying. Does he hate us? She asked Melissa, loud enough for everyone to hear. Melissa tried explaining I was camera shy, but everyone knew that was garbage.

My cousins laughed. My aunt whispered something to my uncle. My mom just stared at her plate. Grandma pointed her cake knife at me. He's always been different, secretive, won't tell us what he really does for work. I'm a software engineer, I said quietly. That's what you say, she replied, but you work from home in your pajamas. That's not a real job. My cousin Brandon jumped in. Grandma's right. Real men go to an office. Nathan just plays on his computer all day. The whole room nodded. My sister tried to defend me, but grandma cut her off. And he never visits, never calls, just shows up when there's free food. She looked around for agreement. I'm changing my will next week. People who care about family should be rewarded, not people like Nathan. My uncle stood up. Mom's right, Nathan. You've been coasting your whole life. The rest of us work hard, my aunt added. My son's a doctor. Brandon's in finance. What do you even contribute? I felt everyone staring, waiting for me to defend myself. I didn't say anything. Grandma kept going, when I die, I'm splitting. Everything between people who showed up. Brandon visits every week. He'll get the house, she pointed at me. You'll get nothing. Brandon smirked. Thanks, grandma. My mom finally spoke up. Mom, that's not fair. Nathan's busy with work. Busy. Grandma interrupted. Doing what? Sitting at home. She turned back to the party. Everyone here works real jobs. Brandon's closing million dollar deals. My other grandson saving lives. And Nathan. He laughed. Nathan sits in his apartment doing who knows what. My aunt nodded. It's embarrassing, honestly, when people ask what my nephew does, what am I supposed to say? Say he's unemployed? My uncle said, just it. That's basically what it is. Brandon raised his wine glass to grandma for finally telling it like it is. Half the room clinked glasses. The other half just stared at me with pity. Grandma sat back down, satisfied. I've said my piece. Now let's enjoy the party. The doorbell rang. My sister went to answer it. She came back looking confused. Nathan, there's someone here for you.

I'm safe, but I don't know about your kids. What do you mean you don't know about them? Why weren't my kids with you? I typed back frantically, I'm sorry I had to take care of myself first. I'm driving now. Good luck. I'm so sorry. I ran out of the conference room and drove home going 90 miles per hour. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the steering wheel. I pulled up our ring camera app at a red light. What I saw made me scream. The footage showed my seven year old Molly and five year old Carl being dragged out of the house by their hair. They were screaming and crying as some, someone threw them into a silver sedan. I couldn't see the person's face but they were wearing all black. I called 9 1 1 immediately. My children were kidnapped from my house. I have video. Ma'am, when did this happen? Maybe 20 minutes ago. The babysitter abandoned them. We're dispatching units now. Can you describe the vehicle? Silver sedan, four doors. I couldn't see the plates. I called my husband Ivan who was on a business trip in Dallas. He answered on the first ring. The kids were taken from the house. I screamed. That stupid babysitter left them alone and someone took them. What? What do you mean taken? Kidnapped? Ivan? Someone dragged them out by their hair. He started crying. Immediately, which made me even angrier. I needed him to help not fall apart. I'm getting on the next flight, he sobbed. Just get here. I hung up and sat in my driveway watching police search my house. They kept asking about enemies or custody disputes. We didn't have any. Then I thought about someone who'd want my kids. I called my mother. We hadn't spoken in three years after I caught her hitting Molly for spilling juice. She'd abused me my whole childhood and I wasn't letting her near my kids. Linda, she answered, surprised. Is everything okay, mom? Someone took Molly and Carl. Oh my god, that's terrible. I'll come help search right away. You will? Of course. They're my grandchildren.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at 4 in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school. Then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That it's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. But they keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. Your 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yesterday he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died. But I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy waste of space better not miss his shift tomorrow or we'll all be homeless. My mom grabbed the phone. Next, he has to give us $800 by tomorrow or I'm selling everything he owns. The doctor's voice got ice cold. Your child's organs are failing from working to support you. Stop making excuses for that pathetic failure because he can't handle it.

What? Don't think I had anything to do with this. I called you guys because of the smell. I crossed my arms defensively. The officer's face stayed neutral, but his partner was already walking toward their patrol car. Due to the nature of your relationship to the victim, we're going to have to bring you in for questioning. Relationship to the victim? Who's the victim? My voice cracked with confusion. We're not at liberty to say it at this time. Please come with us. He gestured toward the car. I'd bought this house just three weeks ago. It was supposed to be a fresh start after my divorce. Little two bedroom ranch in a quiet neighborhood where I could rebuild my life. The smell had started a few days after I moved in. At first I thought it was a dead mouse in the walls. Then it got worse, sweet and rotting and impossible to ignore. The officer guided me to the back seat of the patrol car. No handcuffs, but the door locks clicked with finality. Through the window, I watched more police arrived. Crime scene tape went up around my new home. Officers in white hazmat suits carry equipment inside. This was really happening. During the ride to the station, my mind raced through possibilities. The previous owner had been an elderly woman who died in a nursing home. Her family had sold the house quickly. Maybe someone had broken in while it sat empty. Maybe there'd been a murder years ago that nobody knew about. did they think I had a relationship with whoever was in my walls? At the station, they put me in a small interrogation room, grey walls and a metal table with one of those big mirrors everyone knows is one way glass. I sat there for what felt like hours, no phone call, no lawyer, just me and my panic thoughts. Through the door, I could hear muffled voices, officers walking past in the hallway, phones ringing, normal police station sounds that felt surreal given my situation. I'd never been in trouble with the law, never even gotten a speeding ticket. Now I was being questioned about a dead body in my house. Two officers finally entered the room. Detective Harper was older with grey hair and tired eyes. Detective Mcguire looked younger and kept glancing at a file folder. They sat across from me and the older one started a recording device. I wanna be clear that I just bought this house. Whatever's in those walls has nothing to do with me. I said it before they could speak. Harper nodded but didn't look convinced. We'll get to that. First, can you tell us about your family? My family, I'm divorced, no kids. My parents live in Florida. I didn't understand the question. What about siblings, Mcguire asked while taking Notes. My stomach tightened. I had a brother. He went missing 15 years ago. The detectives exchanged a look that made my blood run cold. Harper opened the file folder and pulled out a photo. It was a forensic photo of something wrapped in plastic inside a wall cavity. Didn't make out details, but the shape was obviously human. Your brother was 17 when he disappeared, correct? Harper's voice was gentle but firm. Yes. We filed a missing person report. The police never found anything. My hands were shaking now. And you were living where at the time? Mcguire leaned forward with my parents, about 10 miles from here. My mouth felt dry. They asked more questions about my brother, when I'd last seen him, what he was wearing, if we'd fought before he vanished. Each question felt like a trap, but I answered honestly, Tom, he had been troubled, drugs and bad friends. We'd all assumed he'd run away. After an hour of questions, Harper finally got to the point. The thing is we found some interesting evidence in those walls along with the body. What kind of evidence? I asked, though. I wasn't sure. I wanted to know. DNA evidence, hair, blood, things that help us identify not just the victim, but potentially who put them there. His eyes never left mine. I waited for him to continue. The room felt smaller, the air thicker. Mcguire was still writing notes, but I could feel him watching me, too. Whatever they'd found, it was bad. Bad enough that they'd brought me in immediately, bad enough that they thought I was involved. Harper stood up and walked around the table. He placed another photo in front of me. This one showed a gold class ring covered in dirt and decay. Tommy's high school ring, the one he'd never taken off, the one we'd assumed he was wearing when he disappeared, peared. We're rushing the DNA test, but initial field tests are concerning. Harper's voice dropped lower. Concerning how I managed to ask. He sat on the edge of the table looking down at me. Mcguire had stopped writing. The recorder's red light linked steadily. Ma'am, why is it that we found your son's DNA in your walls? Full story on channel link below.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep families safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. She says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on, and I realize immediately, really, what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect! Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the Car all day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is. Men lose interest when you mention women things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom check your location while I'm at school. Dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3 mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see. Shows up 30 it's late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2 she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money. Which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week 3, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM. Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough. But I've been to that clinic. They close at 6. That night, dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical build visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives, marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5, and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am, and it's now six PM. I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot, looking at life. 3 60, zoom.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was Familiar with the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to pull me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right Spot Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and

But her face immediately dropped when she realized that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, James. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, she tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first, it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd flash, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any evidence. Of our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch. Her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she would texting, you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that Night. She asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. Made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot! I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong.

I asked through the patrol car window, trying to understand why my 13 year old daughter would do something so violent. The other kids were crying and coughing, their eyes swollen shut from this. Brooklyn was sobbing on her mother's shoulder, her makeup running down her cheeks, while she kept asking why her best friend would ruin her birthday. Parents were shouting about pressing charges and lawsuits, while officer Decker explained that Ariana could face multiple counts of assault. Ariana looked straight ahead, her jaw set with that stubborn expression I recognized from when she knew she was right about something. Mom, check the basement window, the one behind the water heater. Please just check it. Her voice was steady, but I could see her hands trembling where they were cuffed behind her. Brooklyn's father was furious when I asked to look. In their basement. Your daughter just assaulted 15 children, including my daughter, at her own birthday party. She planned this, got the pepper spray hidden in her purse. The kids were just dancing when she started screaming for everyone to get down and then sprayed them all. But Officer Decker said I could examine the scene since Ariana was being detained. I went down to the basement where the party had been happening. Pink streamers and balloons were everywhere. The birthday cake sat untouched on a table, and Brooklyn's new speakers were still playing pop music. But when I looked behind the water heater where Ariana had told me to check, my eyes widened. The window lock was broken, twisted metal hanging loose, and there were fresh MUD prints on the carpet underneath that were far too large to belong to any of the kids at the party. When I told Officer Decker, he called for backup immediately and started searching the basement more thoroughly. While he was checking the storage area, Ariana finally explained what had happened from the back of the patrol car. She'd been watching everyone dancing when she note

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year two. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent, while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal number five. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. Convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, sir, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant, and the Mask came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. Didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

I'm on this solo trip in Tenerife at an all inclusive resort. They have this weird thing where everyone sits at tables of eight to force people to talk. Last night, I got seated first and ordered a glass of wine. Then this family walks up, two parents and three kids. The mom takes one look at my wine and goes, we do not wish to expose our children to women drinking alcohol. Just smiled and said, maybe they should ask to move tables then, because I'm definitely drinking this wine. They start making these passive aggressive comments about how I'm alone, like being single is some kind of disease, whatever. I go grab food from the buffet, I come back, and my wine is gone. Completely disappeared. Then this waiter walks over asking to see my wristband. He's all apologetic, saying the family told him I was underage and must have snuck away from my parents. I'm 26 years old. I showed him my ID and explained I paid for this all inclusive package specifically so I could drink without worrying about finding bars. The waiter felt horrible and brought me a fresh glass of wine right as the family came back with their food. The mom's face turned bright red when she saw the new wine glass. He whispered something to her husband, who marched over to the waiter. He starts demanding they check my I D. Again because there's no way someone my age would Be traveling alone.

Ma'am, I say, holding up my disaster burger. I literally just need napkins to eat this thing without destroying my shirt. She squints at me. So you're saying you're not trying to get my number right now? I am absolutely not trying to get your number. I'm trying to get napkins. She doesn't believe me. Then why did you come back up here instead of just using what I gave you? I show her the three napkins, already completely soaked through these three napkins absorb less grease than my car's air filter. The manager, a tired looking dude named Kevin, walks over. Everything okay here? Britney immediately goes into victim mode. This guy won't leave me alone. He keeps asking for my number. I turned to Kevin. I asked for napkins twice. Kevin looks at me, then at my obviously messy burger, then at the three destroyed napkins in my hand. Britney, just give him napkins. But Britney's locked in now. Why are you taking his side? He's clearly hitting on me. Kevin sighs because he's holding a burger that looks like it exploded and you gave him three napkins. The guy behind me finally speaks up. Dude, I watched the whole thing.

Growing up, my sister Brooke never let me forget I was adopted. While our parents showered us both with love, she'd whisper things like, they only got you because the agency had a two for one sale. Or at least I know where I came from. I tried not to let it bother me, but every comment chipped away at my confidence. I was 8 when my parents chose me. They already had Brooke, who was 6 at the time, but they wanted another child. After seeing me at the agency, they said it felt like I was meant to be part of our family. But Brooke never accepted me. She'd hide my homework, blame me for things she broke, and tell other kids at school I was second hand goods. Despite her constant bullying, I worked hard in school while Brooke partied and barely maintained to see average. I was taking advanced classes and studying late into the night. Our parents noticed the difference, but didn't want to compare us. He'd praise both of us equally, even when Brooke clearly didn't deserve it. Everything changed during our senior year. Brooke was failing three classes and risked not graduating. Instead of studying, she spent her time making TikToks about how adopted kids were damaged goods and posting Instagram Stories mocking my generic brand DNA. One day, I overheard her on the phone with Her friend. My parents only adopted her because they felt sorry for her. But watch, when college applications come around, they'll realise blood is thicker than water. All their money is going to their real daughter's education. That was the last straw. I had already been accepted to Princeton with a partial scholarship, but I hadn't told anyone yet. I decided to let Brooke dig her own grave. Every time she skipped class to hang out with her boyfriend, I kept quiet. When she forged our mom's signature on her failed math test, I looked the other way. I watched as she dug herself deeper and deeper. The day college decisions were released, our parents gathered. We were all in the living room, sitting with our eyes glued to our laptops. My father, with his hand resting on his chin, watched in silence. My mother, anxious, faced back and forth with her already cold cup of tea in her hands. Brooke seemed too calm, which, coming from her, was almost always a sign that something was about to explode. Come on, Brooke, open that email already, my mother said, trying to smile. Brooke huffed as if this was all a waste of time. Ugh, relax. I know I got in. I didn't even need to look to know she still believed her own lie. She had sent applications to seven colleges, even with grades that barely met the minimum. For weeks, she spent more time setting up her Instagram aesthetic, For the decisions than actually filling out the forms. Delusion was a thick layer in my sister's life. She clicked. Silence lasted a second, the kind of second that seems to stretch until it becomes a weight in the air. Then she read, frowned, scrolled down the page, read again. This is a mistake, she murmured, pulling the laptop closer to her face. Honey? My father asked, his voice heavy with concern. Rejected. She spat the word like it was poison. They said my application doesn't meet the academic requirements. This is wrong. I, I had recommendation letters. My stomach churned, but I held back the smile that threatened to escape. It was cruel to rejoice in someone's downfall, I know. But there was something cathartic about watching her arrogance crumble layer by layer, as if for the first time, reality was returning. Everything she had spread along the way. One by one, Brooke opened the other emails. All the responses were variations of the same polite sentence. Unfortunately, your candidacy was not selected in this cycle. She turned white as paper. For the first time in a long time, Brooke was speechless. My father cleared his throat. Sweetheart, maybe we can look at other options. Community colleges, technical courses. No, she interrupted him, slamming the laptop shut. This doesn't make sense. I deserve to get in. That's when I opened my email. Without much ceremony, I left the laptop screen clearly visible on the table. The word congratulations was Emblazoned at the top of Princeton's digital letter. My mother came closer, read slowly, then turned her face to me with teary eyes. You. You already knew? I nodded. Why didn't you tell us? Because I need

I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I noticed the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass, my bass actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me, look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for like two months. Two months. I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks the bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist who still can't play an F chord cleanly actually says it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs. But okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us, support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a dream Friday. Night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. The guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes, how she'll look great in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's singing through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money, the cables, the stands, hell even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains. I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising, that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs, mine, well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This, it's my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately, are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow in my dad's garage with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

I stopped at the doorway. This isn't one conversation, Maya. This is you revealing your actual plan for our marriage. You want a free nanny and a night shift worker, not a husband. That's not fair. What's not fair is expecting me to give up everything while you give up nothing. What's not fair is calling it a partnership when it's anything but. She started crying. I thought you loved my boys. I do. But love doesn't mean financial suicide. I packed that night. She kept texting saying I was overreacting, that we could compromise for compromise. I could keep my job, work from home and handle all pick up, drop off, homework, dinner and bedtime, basically still being the full time parent just with a laptop nearby. Then her mom called. You're being incredibly selfish, she said, and without even saying hello. Maya has been through so much with her divorce. She deserves a man who will support her. I agreed to support her, not replace her. Those boys need a father figure. They need a father figure who can actually afford to feed them. Money isn't everything. Tell that to the mortgage company. She huffed and hung up. Then came her sister with a novel length text about how real men sacrifice for their families, how her husband gave up his dreams, how that's what love is. I didn't respond. Three days later, Maya showed up at my new apartment with boys. They were holding a Poster that said we miss you with stick figures. See, she said triumphantly, they need you. Using her kids as emotional blackmail. That was low even for her. Maya, take them home. Not until you come back and apologize. I have nothing to apologize for. You're the one who wanted me to tank my career and our financial future. You're so focused on money. What about love? What about family? Family doesn't mean one person does everything while the other does whatever they want. She left crying. The boys looked confused. I felt terrible, but I knew I'd made the right choice. Last I heard from a mutual friend, Maya's on dating apps now. Now her profile apparently specifies, must love kids, have flexible schedule and understand that family comes first. Translation, must be willing to quit your job and raise my children while I maintain my lifestyle. Her friend said she'd been on six dates. Five guys stopped responding after the second date. The sixth one made it to date four before Maya mentioned her expectations. He apparently said, so you want to stay at home, dad, who also works nights, she said. Exactly. He paid his half of the check and left.

Oh, honey, at least you tried to look nice. I'm wearing my favourite sundress, but apparently it's not enough. She hugs my daughter like she has the right. She's so well behaved despite everything. Despite everything. Like my daughter's existence is something to overcome. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They picked this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her.

They were in the waiting area. When they took me back for surgery, everything went wrong. My blood pressure dropped and the baby's heart rate was all over the place. I could hear the doctors talking in urgent voices and see the nurses moving fast. They got the baby out, but she wasn't crying for 10 seconds. That felt like 10 hours. There was just silence. Then she screamed and I started sobbing. They brought her over and put her on my chest, and she was perfect. In recovery, my in laws were waiting with flowers and balloons. My mother in law was crying, and my father in law kept saying, she's beautiful. She looks just like you. They stayed with me for hours, taking turns holding the baby and bringing me water and telling me what an amazing mother I was going to be. Around 6 that evening, my parents walked into the hospital room. They were loud and laughing, and I could smell wine on them from across the room. My mom saw the baby in my mother in law's arms, and her whole face changed. She rushed over and said, oh, my god, let me hold her. She took the baby and stared at her and started crying. She said, she's perfect. Look at her little hands. I can't believe I'm a grandmother. My dad came over and looked at the baby and his eyes got wet. He said, she's beautiful. She Looks like you did when you were born. My mom turned to me and said, why didn't you tell us it was happening now? We would have been here. I stared at her. I said, I told you two weeks ago. You chose Natalie's party. My dad said, we didn't realize the baby would be here already. We thought we had time. My father in law stood up and said, you need to leave. My mom clutched the baby tighter and said, we just got here. We want to spend time with our granddaughter. I said, give her back to her grandmother and pointed at my mother in law. My mom's face crumpled and she handed the baby over. I said, you chose a housewarming party over your daughter's life threatening surgery and the birth of your first grandchild. You showed up six hours late, drunk, and you want me to believe you care now? My dad said, please, we made a mistake. We want to be in her life. I said, get out. My mom tried to take a photo of the baby before leaving and my father in law deleted it from her phone. They haven't seen her since.

My cat, Oliver, trained me to sleep with one hand hanging off the bed. And that's how I caught someone breaking into my house at 3:00am. It started when Oliver was just a kitten. Every night, he'd paw at my dangling hand until I pet him. For two years, I couldn't fall asleep unless my arm was hanging down, waiting for his soft fur. One night, instead of Oliver's fur, I felt human hair. My eyes shot open, but I kept my breathing steady, pretending to be asleep. Someone was crouched beside my bed. In the dim light from my window, I could make out a man wearing all black going through my bedside drawer. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought he'd hear it. Oliver wasn't in his usual spot. That should have been my first clue something was wrong. The intruder's head was right under my hanging hand. I had two choices. Scream and hope the neighbors heard, or do something really stupid. I chose stupid. I grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked as hard as I could. He yelped and fell backward. I rolled off the other side of the bed, taking my phone with me. The guy scrambled up, but his hoodie caught on my lamp, pulling it down with a crash. Get out! I screamed, already dialing 9 1 1. I have a gun! I didn't, but he didn't know that. He bolted. For the door. I heard him stumbling down the stairs, knocking things over. That's when I noticed something odd. He wasn't going for the front door. He was heading for my basement. The 9 1 1 operator was asking for my address when I heard a familiar voice from downstairs. Babe, what's all that noise? My blood ran cold. That was Greg's voice. Greg, my boyfriend of eight months who I'd given a key to last week. Greg, who was supposed to be on a business trip to Boston. I crept to the top of the stairs, phone still pressed to my ear. There's someone in my house, I whispered to the operator. I think. I think I know who it is. Greg's voice floated up again. Damn it, Patrick! You were supposed to wait until she took her sleeping pills. My hand shook. Patrick, Greg's work friend who'd been over for dinner twice, who'd use my bathroom both times, right next to my bedroom where I kept my prescription sleep aids. I've been casing my house, learning my routine. Greg knew I had a safe in my closet. Knew that's where I kept my grandmother's jewelry, worth nearly $50,000. The operator was saying something about police being four minutes away. I heard doors opening downstairs. They were looking for something. Then I remembered Oliver. He always slept under my bed. During all this chaos, he hadn't made a sound. I crouched down to check. There was Oliver crammed against The wall, fur puffed up. Next to him was Greg's phone.

I'm three months pregnant, and literally the only thing I can keep down is steak and baked potatoes with sour cream. Which is weird, because before this, I was a chicken nuggets and fries kind of person, never touch steak. But now if I don't eat it, I feel like I'm gonna pass out. So every night, I make two meals. One for my fiance and our two kids, and one for me. Tonight I made baked pizza, spaghetti with fried catfish and dinner rolls. The kids love it. I've been doing this for weeks now, and nobody said anything. I was plating everyone's food when my fiance Danny, walks up and goes, actually, I want what you're having. I looked at him confused because he literally saw me thaw out one steak this morning. He knew what was for dinner because I plan everything the night before and write it on the fridge calendar. I told him I only made one steak, and that's mine. There's plenty of catfish left. He crossed his arms and said, we can share it. Then I shook my head and explained that I'm eating for two, and this one steak barely fills me up as it is. I told him he has a whole meal he can get seconds of, while I only have this. That's when he got mad. He called me a selfish woman using pregnancy as an Excuse to be selfish. I just stared at him because where did this even come from? I asked him, what's different about today compared to the last two months when I've been eating steak literally every single night. He didn't answer, just said, it's the principal bay and walked off to eat his catfish. We haven't really talked since. Just good morning and goodbye. When he leaves for work, he's been slamming cabinets and giving me these looks like I'm the worst person alive. His mom even texted me yesterday asking why I'm being difficult during my pregnancy. Apparently, he told her I'm hoarding food from him. I went to my sister's place because I couldn't deal with the tension. She laughed when I told her and said, he's being a baby. But then my mom called and said I should have just given him half and made myself something else to keep the peace. The thing is, I tried eating other stuff. I physically can't. Two weeks ago, I tried to eat chicken and threw up for an hour. I've been to the doctor about it, and they said it's normal for some women to have very specific cravings and food aversions. They told me to just eat what I can. Danny came home last night with a bag from the grocery store. I thought maybe he was over it. Nope. He bought himself two steaks and made a big show of cooking them in front of me. Didn't Offer me any? Just sat at the table eating while I had my one steak and looked at me the whole time. The kids asked why daddy was being weird, and he said, ask your mother. I'm doing six months, and I don't know if I can deal with this the whole time.

When I was 8, my neighbor, Mister Wilson, would pay me $5 to help him feed the birds in his backyard every Saturday. I thought I had the easiest job in the world, just scattering bird seed while he took pictures from his deck. He always insisted I wear the same yellow dress. Birds are attracted to bright colors, he explained. I believed him completely. My parents thought it was sweet that an elderly widower had found a. It's good for him to have something to look forward to, mom would say, as she helped me into that scratchy yellow dress. Each weekend, Mister Wilson had very specific instructions. I had to skip in certain patterns, bend a particular way to scatter the seeds, twirl three times before collecting my $5. He called these my bird calling moves. The birds won't come if you don't do it exactly right, he'd say. Hey, adjusting his camera, I rarely saw any actual birds, but he assured me they came after I left. I remember once asking why he never showed me the bird pictures. He smiled and said they were for a special bird watching club. I imagined serious adults in safari hats nodding approvingly at photos of me with cardinals and blue jays. When I turned 10, he doubled my pay to $10 and asked if I could bring a friend. Birds love when There are two children, he explained, so I brought Emma from next door. We took turns in the yellow dress. After a few weeks, Emma refused to come back. My mom says I can't, she said, at school, avoiding my eyes. I figured her parents needed her for chores and felt secretly pleased to have my bird job back to myself. For my 11th birthday, Mr Wilson gave me a silver bracelet with tiny bird charms. Don't tell your parents, he whispered. They might get jealous of our special friendship. It was the prettiest thing I'd ever owned and I hid it in my sock drawer. One Saturday, Mr Wilson's adult son visited unexpectedly while I was there. I was mid twirl when he walked into the backyard. He looked at me, then at his father, then at the camera. His face changed in a way I couldn't understand at the time. Dad, what the hell is this? He shouted. Mr Wilson hurried me home without my $10, telling me we feed the birds another day. I was confused and worried I'd done my twirls wrong. The next day, police cars parked outside Mr Wilson's house. Men carried out boxes and his computer. I watched from my bedroom window, wondering if they were from the bird watching club. My parents sat me down that evening with strange, serious faces. They asked uncomfortable questions about the bird feeding, the yellow dress, the photos. I answered truthfully, not understanding why mom kept Crying. Mr Wilson moved away after that. The neighbor.

She ignored that question. Jake's aunt said maybe we should all calm down. Patricia sent three paragraphs about how she's being attacked by everyone. Jake told me I should just apologize to make it stop. I said absolutely not. She was wrong. He said I wasn't wrong, but sometimes you apologize just to peace.

Slipping into the shadows, I pulled out the tools I had brought with me and started working on getting his fingerprints. But as soon as I entered the code, the alarm went off. My heart skipped a beat, but luckily, it didn't wake him up. Refusing to give up, I tried again, and somehow I nailed the code this time. Opening the safe, I grabbed all the cash inside. Then I slipped all the fake bills I had taken from the tire into the safe, replacing the real money. With everything in place, I was about to put the tire, now filled with real cash, back on the car. But at that exact moment, the rich guy suddenly woke up. He spotted me and said his safe had been robbed. I froze, stunned. I had clearly put all the fake cash inside, so why was the safe empty? I followed him to the safe, and sure enough, the money was gone. Then he told me that money was crucial. It was supposed to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. I didn't believe him. For a guy like him, that amount was pocket change. But then he dropped a bombshell. He was bankrupt. The house wasn't even his anymore, and he couldn't afford his daughter's bills. Seeing how desperate he was, I couldn't go through with stealing from him anymore. So I went back to the garage, retrieved the cash hidden in the Tire and came clean to him. But to my surprise, he already knew everything I know. He said. By the way, the thief has already been caught. Caught, huh? Caught? What do you mean caught? How? Don't you recognize your partner

Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son, who I'd raised to respect women, and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter? I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively. For like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20 minutes? In a week? Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said. Like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest.

One. There was one morning in high school when my dad decided to wake me up for school by ripping the covers off me in bed. That was the last time that happened. Two. One time, my sister was hiding in my closet to wait for a bit until I was almost asleep so she could scare me. Unfortunately, she didn't know I was whacking it, and she jumped out to scare me right as I came, which ended up going. Going all over her face and into her mouth. My mom heard the commotion and came into my room to investigate. And after seeing me naked and my sister covered in my jizz, got the wrong idea. Three. I had a closet sized single dorm room, and people would always pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night, and we'd all have to go outside. One time, I was so drowsy, I just walked out instinctively, and halfway down the hall, I raced back. Thankfully, this was an old building, so I didn't get locked out of the room or not. Me. But I was spending the night at my friend's house in a suburban neighborhood. In the middle of the night, his mom had let their toy fox terrier out to go pee, and it got snatched by a coyote. She screamed and woke us all up. A wolf got noodle within 10 seconds, his dad was sprinting. Out of the house completely butt ass naked with a Glock in his hand and went running down the street. Came back about 15 minutes later with the dog and obviously still completely naked. 5. I locked myself out of my flat whilst sleepwalking. My girlfriend was on holidays so I had to wait until morning, borrow a towel off a neighbour, and then walk about a mile up the road to the estate agent to get a spare key. Six never chased a burglar down the stairs, through the kitchen and out my front door without wearing a shred of clothing and no weapon in hand. The power of nakedness.

She said, oh, just one won't hurt. Jake ate six. He was in the bathroom for an hour. That night, Sunday, we went out to dinner with my in laws. I found a restaurant that had a whole gluten free menu. I ordered Jake a gluten free burger and fries, $26. Everyone else's meals were like $15. I made sure he was okay with it before I ordered. He said, yeah, it's fine. The food came. Jake ate maybe three fries. Then when no one was looking, he reached over and grabbed a regular roll from the bread basket. Then he took a bite of his dad's sandwich. Then he grabbed some pasta off his grandmother's plate. My mother in law didn't stop him. She just smiled and said he's a growing boy. On the drive home, the car smelled terrible. Jake was in the back seat holding his stomach. I asked him if he ate wheat and he said no. His little brother said, yes, you did. I saw you eat the bread. Jake finally admitted it. He said the gluten free burger looked gross. He wanted to stay home from school the next day because his stomach hurt. I said no. I told Him. I wasn't cooking gluten free anymore. If he was going to eat regular food anyway, then I wasn't spending extra money and time on meals he wouldn't eat. He got mad and said I was being unfair. I said he was 17 and making his own choices so he could deal with it himself. I stopped buying the expensive gluten free snacks. I stopped making separate meals. When we went out to eat the next week, I ordered him whatever was cheapest on the menu. He complained that it had wheat in it. I said, I know. He asked why I wasn't getting him the gluten free option. I told him there was no point since he was going to eat gluten anyway. He sat there and didn't eat anything. Jake hasn't eaten dinner at home in four days. He buys fast food with his paycheck, then comes home and goes straight to the bathroom.

From my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble. He walked over to my TV. I was dead and caught red handed. Game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this.

The color drained from her face. Are you being serious right now? Kayla's smile got bigger. Dead serious. Alison started begging. She dumped her entire purse on the table pretending to look for money she knew wasn't there. She asked if anyone could spot her just this once. She even tried to negotiate with the waiter about taking off the dessert. We just sat there watching like we were at a movie. Finally, the waiter was getting impatient. Other tables were staring. The manager started walking over. Ma'am, I need payment now or I'll have to get my manager involved, the waiter said. Allison looked around the table one more time hoping someone would cave. Nobody moved. She had to call her mom on speaker phone in front of everyone. Mom, yeah, I'm at dinner and I, I need you to bring me some cash like right now. We could hear her mom losing it through the phone. Allison Marie, how many times have I told You not to do this to your friends. Twenty minutes later, her mom showed up looking furious. She slammed the cash on the table, grabbed Alison by the arm and hissed, we're talking about this at home, loud enough for half the restaurant to hear. The whole table watched the entire thing go down like it was primetime TV. That was the last dinner Alison ever came to. She stopped getting invited to group stuff pretty much immediately after that.

My husband, Mark used to be a kind man, but over the last few years, he became angry about everything. If the Wi-Fi was slow, he yelled. If the house had one crumb, he complained. And when he got upset, he always took it out on me with sharp, hurtful words. Last Saturday, I was cooking dinner when he walked into the kitchen complaining about bills. He snapped, do you ever do anything useful? Then he called me lazy. My heart dropped. But when I turned around, I saw our eight year old daughter, Lily, standing there quietly. Her eyes were wide, like she had just seen something she wasn't supposed to. She didn't talk about it until bedtime. She crawled next to me and whispered, mom, do dads get brain damage after they get married? I almost laughed. She wasn't done. Is daddy allergic to being happy? His face looks mad all the time. I laughed so hard, I cried. The next morning, she walked straight up to her dad. Daddy, please stop being rude to Mommy, she said. He told her it was an adult problem. She crossed her arms and said, do adults need help because they forget how to be nice? I hid behind the fridge so he wouldn't see me laughing. Right then, the doorbell rang. His mom came in with groceries. Lily hugged her and said, grandma, daddy is being weird again. Maybe he needs a nap. Or a new brain. His mom looked at him like he was a

I tried to ignore it, but one day he went too far. He tried to touch me. I pushed him away and said, I'm single. That doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with me. After that, he got mean. He cut my hours, left me out of meetings and blamed me for things I didn't do. I wanted to quit, but I couldn't.

It was supposed to fix everything except she texted him two to three times every single day. I'd see his phone light up. Autumn, autumn, autumn. He'd wait until I was in the shower to respond or when I fell asleep. Once I woke up at 2:00am and he was on the balcony typing away. When I asked about it, he said she was having marriage problems, that she needed someone to talk to. Are you a marriage counselor now, I asked. He laughed it off. We got home with one week of vacation left. He suggested dinner and a movie. I agree. We needed it. We were at the restaurant finally having a good time when she walked in with her husband. She spot at us, immediately came over. Oh, my god, what a coincidence. Do you guys wanna join us? I said yes before my husband could say no. She was so pleasant, touching my husband's arm while asking about Santorini, laughing at his jokes. Her husband barely said a word. Then I asked loud enough for everyone to hear. So how are things with you two? I heard you've been having marriage problems. Her husband's face went white. What? Who said that? My husband did. He showed me all your texts about, about it. The table went silent. Autumn stared at my husband. Her husband stared at her. My husband tried to backtrack, stammered something about misunderstanding. I smiled. And said, oh, I'm sorry if I got it wrong. I just assumed. Since you were texting him multiple times a day on our vacation, autumn looked like she wanted to kill him. When we got home, he exploded, said I was out of line, that I humiliated him. I asked him one question, have you ever slept with her? He went quiet. Then once, before I even met you, I told him I wanted a divorce, said at minimum they were having an emotional affair. He called me silly, said I was overreacting to text the friend. That was two weeks ago. I've refused all physical contact since. I work late, go to the gym, take long walks. I eat dinner alone at restaurants or the library. When I come home, I shower and go straight to bed. My mother thinks I'm making a big fuss over nothing. His parents called me immature. He's begging for marriage counseling, offering to his job, move cities, anything. But my gut is screaming that something is very, very wrong. And I've Learned to trust my gut.

After that, I drove home, put the folder on my kitchen counter and stared at it for an hour. Two weeks later, my phone rang. Unknown number. I answered. Hello, it was my mom. Her voice was shaky, frantic. She didn't even say hi, just launched into it. We lost the house. Someone bought it at auction. We have 30 days and nowhere to go. I know we haven't talked, but could you maybe help us with a deposit for an apartment just alone? We'll pay you back. I let the silence sit for a second and I said I'd think about it and hung up. Day 29, I drove to the house, pulled up in my truck at four PM, parked in the driveway. My dad answered the door. He looked older, grayer, thinner. He squinted at me like he couldn't place my face, then glanced at my truck. You with the new owner, he asked. I nodded, didn't say anything. He sighed, stepped out onto the porch. This whole thing is a nightmare. We built this place, raised our kid here, and now some vulture bought it out from under us for pennies. Not right. I just stood there, hands in my pockets, listening. You know how much we put into this house, he continued. And now we've got one Day left and nowhere to go. It's criminal. That's when my mom came to the door. She saw my face and stopped cold. The color drained from her cheeks. Her mouth opened, but no sound came out. I reached into my jacket, pulled out the deed and unfolded it slowly, held it up so they could both see, pointed to the owner's name printed at the bottom. My dad leaned in, squinted, read it. His face went from confused to pale to deep red in about three seconds flat. And my mom's legs actually buckled. She grabbed the door frame, whispered, no, that's not possible, while my dad stood frozen, staring at my name in bold letters on the deed to the house he kicked me out of 8 years ago. I told them they had until midnight tomorrow and walked back to my truck.

I only found out because his mom knocked on my door at 2:00am absolutely panicking. She said Oliver had been acting weird all evening, kept staring at her neck and asking strange questions about her breathing. Then an hour ago, he walked into her bedroom, calm as anything, and told her she needed to go to the hospital right now because her thyroid was swollen and she had all seven symptoms of a thyroid storm. She laughed it off at first, thought maybe he'd seen something on YouTube or overheard adults talking. But he wouldn't let it go. He kept following her around the house, getting more and more persistent. Every time she tried to sit down, he'd appear with this worried look on his face. He brought her a piece of paper where he'd written down everything he noticed over the past few days. His handwriting was messy, letters backwards in places. But the observations were terrifyingly precise. Rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, even though the house was cold, check. Shaky hands when she picked up her coffee mug, check. Confusion and irritability, especially in the afternoons, check. Weight loss, even though she was eating normally, check. He'd been tracking her symptoms for three full days, writing them down in a little notebook he kept hidden under his bed. He'd even drawn arrows pointing to which symptoms were getting worse. She told me she Was about to send him back to bed and tell him to stop worrying when she actually stopped and felt her pulse was racing so fast she could barely count the beats. Her hands were trembling when she held them out. That's when real fear kicked in and she came banging on my door because her husband was out of town on business and she didn't want to call an ambulance over what might be nothing. She kept saying she felt ridiculous but also terrified. I threw on shoes and drove her to the er while Oliver sat in the back seat, completely silent, holding his crumpled list in both hands. The whole drive there, he didn't say a word, just stared out the window like he was waiting for something. His mom kept looking back at him in the mirror asking if he was okay. He just nodded. When we got there, she tried to downplay it to the triage nurse, said she was probably overreacting but wanted to get checked out just in case, mentioned she'd been feeling off for a.

I work in a small office with about 12 people and we all share one fridge in the break room. For the past six months someone has been stealing my lunch at least twice a week. At first I thought maybe I was just forgetting it at home or something, but then I started paying attention and realised my food was definitely disappearing. I'm talking full meals. A chicken pasta I meal prepped on Sunday, a sandwich I made that morning, even my leftovers from nice restaurants. I tried labeling everything with my name in giant letters. Nothing changed. I put sticky notes on my container saying please don't take this. It's my only lunch. Still gone. I even tried the passive aggressive route and wrote really? Again on one note after someone took my Turkey wrap. The worst part was watching my co workers eat their lunches while I had to order expensive take out or just eating. I was spending like 60 bucks a week on food I shouldn't have had to buy. So last month I bought this container on Amazon that has a little combination lock on it. Nothing crazy, just a basic lunch box with a three digit lock. The first day I used it I packed my usual chicken and rice, locked it up and put it in the fridge. Lunchtime came. I noticed people staring at me as I unlocked my Container. My coworker Derek actually said out loud, seriously? A lock? I just shrugged and ate my lunch. But by the end of the day, three people had made comments about it. My coworker Lisa said it made the office feel hostile and unwelcoming. Another guy named Marcus joked that maybe I should get a safe for my desk, too. The next morning, my boss, Jennifer, called me into her office. She had this concerned look on her face and asked if everything was okay. I said, yeah, why? She told me that several people had complained about my locked lunch container. Apparently, it was creating tension in the office and making people uncomfortable. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told her that someone had been stealing my lunch for months, and the lock was the only thing that worked. She nodded, but then said that my solution wasn't really in the spirit of teamwork and collaboration. I asked her if stealing food was in the spirit of teamwork. He ignored that and said that using a lock sent the message that I didn't trust my colleagues. Well, yeah, I don't trust them because one of them keeps taking my food. Jennifer said she understood my frustration, but that I needed to find a different approach.

I couldn't stop laughing. So my wife, Mina, she's the kind of woman who turns heads wherever she goes, always glowing, always put together like she's walking out of a magazine, even if she's just running to grab milk. She loves fashion. She loves herself and she owns it. My sister, Betty, the complete opposite. She's the women belong in the kitchen type. Think floral apron, husband's dinner on the table by 6. I die for anyone who doesn't fit her idea of a lady. We don't talk much and honestly, that's by design. Every time we do, she finds a way to throw shade at Mina. Like if Mina wears a sundress, Betty will go, well, at least she's dressed like a woman today. But if Mina wears something fitted or modern, it's, wow, that's a little revealing for family, don't you think? Mina just laughs. She's got that kind of laugh that makes you think she's unbothered, the kind that kills with Grace. But me, I'm counting to 10 in my head every time. Anyway, anyway, Eddie got pregnant and when she invited us to her formal dinner to celebrate, I thought maybe, just maybe, we could be civil. Mina wore this dark green tailored suit, sleek and powerful. It wasn't revealing, wasn't flashy, just elegant. She looks like money, like power, like everything Betty could never be. We get to the door, Betty opens it and her face drops. Like she just saw a ghost. She forces a smile and says, are you really wearing that, Mina? Cool as ever goes. Yes, you said formal, right? Inside, it's obvious Betty's been rehearsing her judgment all week. She's whispering behind her wine glass, smirking to my aunt, giving me those fake smiles that mean I'm about to talk shit. Every time Nina walks by, Betty's eyes roll like clockwork. At one point, she cracks this joke loud enough for everyone to hear. Guess Nina wears the pants in your marriage, huh? Poor you, stuck wearing all the pink frilly dresses. Everyone laughs awkwardly. Mina squeezes my hand under the table and whispers, don't, not tonight. I nod. I try to breathe. I try to focus on anything else, the candles, the baby photos, the sound of my jaw clenching. Then Betty stands up, glass in hand. I'd like to make a toast, she says. She starts soft, thanking everyone, talking about motherhood, family, all that sentimental crap. Then her tone shifts. Her smile fades. Her voice gets that sharp, sugary edge. She looks straight at Mina and says, it's hard raising a daughter in a world where women want to act and dress like men. She pauses, eyes locked on my wife like a sniper sight. The devil often hides in those closest to us. If you can spot him, don't let him into your home. The table goes dead silent. You could hear a pin drop. Everyone's eyes flick. Between them, Mina's calm face and Betty's smug little grin. Mina doesn't say a word. She just pushes her chair back, stands up and walks out. No scene, no words, just this quiet dignity that somehow felt louder than.

So I left her there without a word. Now her upgrade calls her a fling. She's blowing up my phone, and I couldn't care less. Sarah started making me wait in the car whenever we met. Her friend, just give me five minutes to say hi first, he'd say. Five minutes became 20 after two years together. I'd never actually met most of her friends. The breaking point came at Romano's. I reached across the table to hold her hand while we waited for food. She jerked it back like I'd burned her. Jake, seriously? She glanced around nervously. People might see us. I'm trying to hold my girlfriend's hand. Look, I'm embarrassed to be seen with you in public, okay? You don't exactly fit my aesthetic. The words hit me like a slap. Your aesthetic, my image, my brand. You wouldn't understand. It's a career thing. I watched her angle her phone for a selfie, cropping out any evidence I existed. So what am I, then? You're my boyfriend. Just not publicly. That night, I started paying attention. Sarah posted constantly. Hundreds of posts documenting every aspect of her life. I appeared in exactly zero of them. Her relationship status? Everywhere. Single. Her dating profiles were still active. When friends asked about her love life, she'd sigh dramatically. Still searching for the right guy. It's so hard to find someone on my level. I'd be standing right there. The final straw came at her company party. Just tell people you're my friend from college, she said. Actually, don't talk to anyone unless they talk to you first. At the party, Sarah immediately abandoned me to work the room. Around 10 p m, she was deep in conversation with Marcus from her marketing team. I watched her touch his arm, lean in close, doing all the things she never did with me in public. I walked over to exist in the same space as my supposed girlfriend. Oh, Marcus, this is Jake, Sarah said when she couldn't ignore me anymore. We went to college together. Marcus barely glanced at me. So you're really single? That's crazy. Sarah giggled. I know, right? I'm just so pick. I can't seem to find a guy on my level. I was standing three feet away. What about your friend here? Marcus nodded in my direction. Sarah looked at me like she'd forgotten I existed. Jake? Oh, no. He's, like, not my type at all. Total friend zone material. She laughed. Marcus laughed. I walked away, got my coat, and left without saying goodbye. Two weeks later, I confronted her about everything. Look, you're not exactly boyfriend material for someone like me, she said. I have a reputation to maintain. You don't fit the life I'm building. I need someone who enhances my brand, not someone I have to hide because I'm tired of being your secret. The next day, while she was at Work. I packed everything and left her key on the counter with a note. You're right. We were never really together anyway. Then I blocked her on everything and disappeared from her life as completely as she'd made me disappear from her public image. Sarah got her Instagram worthy relationship. Two weeks later, she and Marcus became official with a professionally lit photo caption. When you know, you know. Hashtag blessed, hashtag couple goals, hashtag authentic. For three months, she lived her best social media life. Then everything imploded. A comment appeared on one of her couple photo. Thanks for helping me realize my boyfriend was cheating. He told me you knew about me the whole time. Glad you were okay being the other woman. Turns out Marcus had been telling Sarah that Lisa was his crazy ex while telling Lisa that Sarah was just a work friend with a crush. Sarah had been the side piece the entire time.

So I crushed her ego by saying she's too dependent to be this demanding. Her parents were visiting for two weeks. Two weeks? We'd always had our system. I work 50 to 60 hours a week, pulling in $140,000 as a software engineer. She works part time from home 15 hours a week doing freelance graphic design, bringing in maybe $18,000 annually. I handle breakfast and pack the kids lunches. She handles dinner since she's home by three PM. It worked. Our kids were happy, fed, and thriving. But the moment her dad walked through our door with his vintage leather duffel, I knew I was cooked. Day one, he criticized my car. That's it? I thought you'd be driving something more impressive by now. Day two, he watched me load the dishwasher after breakfast and actually laughed. My son does that himself. You have a wife for that? Day three, he started commenting in front of the kids, daddy does a lot of woman's work, doesn't he? That's not what a strong man looks like. My wife said nothing. Just gave me these weak smiles. Like that somehow made it okay. By day five, I was mentally exhausted. Her mom joined in, cooing at my wife. You're so lucky he helps out. Most men wouldn't. Like I was the babysitter, not the father. I bit My tongue smiled through it. Kept the P. Then came day 8. The day I stopped caring about peace. I got home at 7:30 p m. Brutal day. Production server crashed, emergency meetings, skipped lunch. My head was pounding. I walked into an empty kitchen. No dinner, no ingredients out. Nothing. My wife was on the couch with her mom, watching some reality show. Both had wine glasses. Both looked comfortable. Hey, I said, loosening my tie, what's dinner? She didn't even pause the show. Figure it out. I stood there, certain I'd misheard. What? You heard me. Figure it out. She turned to face me, her mother smirking beside her. Dad's right. You need to start acting like a real man. Real men provide and don't complain. Stop acting like doing basic chores is some huge favor. The room went silent except for the TV. Her dad appeared from the hallway, arms crossed. You worked all day, her mom said, voice dripping with sarcasm. Welcome to adulthood. Your wife works, too, and she still has to manage everything here. You're failing as a father. Our daughter deserves better. I looked at my wife, really looked at her. She had the satisfied expression, like she'd been waiting for this moment, like her parents validation gave her permission. Something shifted in me. I pulled out my phone, opened our joint banking app, the one that shows all our accounts and contributions. You want to talk about provision? I said, voice eerily. Calm. I turned my phone toward her. See that? That's our monthly expenses. Thousand, two hundred dollars. Mortgage, cars, insurance, groceries, kids, activities, everything. Her mom started to interrupt, but I kept going. My monthly take home after taxes, $8,750. Your daughter's monthly finance income? $1,500 on average. Some months less. I looked directly at my wife. I cover 85% of our life. You cover 15%. And you work 15 hours a week while I work 55. Her dad's arms uncrossed. Now let's talk about chores. I can continued. I make breakfast every single day. I pack lunches, I do dishes. I handle bedtime three nights a week. Because you're exhausted from your four hour work day. The only thing I asked one thing was that you handle dinner since you're home five hours before me. Her face went pale. So here's the reality check you apparently need. I said you're too dependent to be this demanding. If you wanna criticize how I show up as a man, you actually need to be pulling your weight as a partner. You're not. Not even close. I turned to her parents. You raised her to think she deserves a CEO salary. Lifestyle on a hobby. Job, income. I'm not her father. I'm not her ATM. I'm her partner.

The moment happened at their country club's anniversary gala. The one they pointedly not invited me to for eight years running. I only knew about it because my husband posted photos every year of him standing awkwardly alone while couples danced around him. This year was different. His mother called him the morning of, and I heard her through his phone. Bring someone respectable this time. The Hendersons are bringing their daughter. Harvard Law School. Very accomplished. My husband looked at me across our kitchen table and said loudly, I'll bring my wife like I've offered to every year. The silence on her end stretched so long, I thought she hung up. Then I suppose, if you must. Eight years we've been married. Eight years of his mother introducing me as David's friend at family functions. Eight years of these settings mysteriously disappearing when I'd arrive at holiday dinners. Eight years of his father asking when David was going to get serious about his future while I sat right there, my wedding ring catching the light. They thought I was temporary because I was a mechanic. Not even a man, which might have been acceptable in their backwards way, but a female mechanic with grease under her nails and coveralls in her closet. Their son, the surgeon, had married someone who fixed cars, and they'd never recovered from the shame. The night of the gala, I wore the Emerald dress David had bought me for our anniversary. His mother took one look and whispered to his aunt, loud enough for me to hear, at least she cleaned up small miracles. The Henderson's daughter was indeed there, beautiful, accomplished, and placed strategically at our table. David's mother kept steering her toward him, literally putting her hand on the woman's back and pushing her forward while I stood right there, my hand in his. Claudia just made partner at her firm, his mother announced. Isn't that wonderful, David? That's nice, David said flatly. My wife just opened her third auto shop. She employs 47 people now. His mother's smile went rigid. How industrial. The breaking point came during the auction. They we're auctioning off luxury experiences for charity. Weekends in Aspen, yacht trips, the usual rich people things. Then they announced a special item, a full classic car restoration by Morrison Automotive. My company. The one I built from nothing. David must have submitted it without telling me. His mother actually gasped. You put her little garage project in our charity auction? David stood up. Her little garage project is worth more than most items here. She restored a 1967 and Shelby for the governor last month. The waiting list is three years long. It's still just cars, his father said dismissively. That's when Roger Blackstone, the actual billionaire Roger Blackstone, stood up from across the room. Excuse me, did you say Morrison Automotive as in Riley Morrison? He looked Around until his eyes landed on me. You restored my father's 1955 Thunderbird. He cried when he saw it. He hasn't cried since my mother died. The room was staring. Now Roger walked over to our table. My father is here tonight. He'd love to thank you in person. He helped me up and LED me to his father, this 90 year old man who grabbed my hands with tears in his eyes. You brought back my memories, he said. Every detail perfect. Even found the original cigarette lighter my wife bought me. The bidding for my restoration service started at 10,000. It ended at $78,000, the highest bid of the night. The winner was a taxi yo who'd been trying to get on my waiting list for two years. When I returned to the table, David's mother was staring at me like she'd never seen me before. 78,000, she kept repeating. But the real moment, the one that ended it all, came when her best friend leaned over and said, Margaret, you never mentioned. David's wife was the Riley Morrison, the one featured in Classic Car Monthly. My husband has been trying to commission her for three years. The dominoes fell fast after that. Every person at the table, it turned out, either knew my work, wanted my work, or knew someone desperate for my work. The Henderson's daughter, the Harvard lawyer, spent 20 minutes asking me about the legal structure of my business expansion. You're franchising nationally. That

Now she's horrified when my daughter calls her by her name and not mom. I had my daughter at 17. Her bio mom disappeared the second I told her I was keeping the baby. I raised her alone for seven years before I met Mia at a coffee shop where I was working double shifts just to keep keep us afloat. Mia was different. She didn't run. When I told her about Hannah, she said she wanted to meet her. Their first interaction, Hannah spilled juice all over her shirt, and Mia just laughed and said, guess I needed to do laundry anyway. We got married when Hannah was 8. Mia walked her down the aisle as our flower girl. We had two more kids together. Emma, who's now 6, and Tyler, who's 4. From the outside, we looked like the perfect blended family. Last month, Hannah came to me sobbing happy tears. She said she wanted Mia to officially adopt her for her 16th birthday, that she wanted her last name, wanted it to be legal, wanted everyone to know she was her real mom. I was so happy, I couldn't breathe. I told Mia that night, expecting her to be thrilled. She smiled and said yes, hugged Hannah the next morning, and told her they'd start the paperwork. But that night, after the kids went to Bed. Mia asked to talk. She looked sick. She said she'd been thinking about the adoption all day, and she couldn't do it. I asked her what she meant. She said she loved Hannah, but it was different. That she didn't feel the same way about her as she did about Emma and Tyler. That legally adopting her felt wrong because she'd be lying. That it wouldn't be fair to her to have a mom who didn't love her the same way. I felt like I'd been punched. I. I asked her if she'd been pretending this whole time. She said no. That she cared about her, that she'd always treat her well, but that she wasn't hers, and she couldn't pretend otherwise on legal documents. I told her not to say a word to Hannah, that I'd handle it. I spent three days trying to figure out how to tell my daughter that the woman she'd called mom for eight years didn't actually want to be her mother. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. Hannah kept asking me when they were going to the courthouse. I kept making excuses. Then I came home early from work one afternoon. The house was quiet. Too quiet. I walked into the kitchen and found Hannah sitting at the table with Mia's phone in her hands, tears streaming down her face. She'd picked it up to answer a call from Mia's brother, but she saw the text thread first. Mia had been venting to Her brother. I don't know how to tell her. I can't do this. She's not really mine. I don't want to be legally responsible for someone else's kid. I love my husband, but this. This is too much. Hannah looked up at me with the most broken expression I've ever seen. She said, you knew, didn't you? You both knew she didn't want me. I tried to explain. Tried to tell her I was going to tell her that I was trying to protect her. She just shook her head and walked out. That night at dinner, she didn't come down. Mia went to get her. I heard her knock on her door. Heard her say, Hannah, Honey, Dinner's ready. Her voice came through the door, cold and flat. Mia, I'm not hungry. She came back downstairs looking confused. Next morning, same thing. Mia, can you pass the milk? Emma looked between them, worried. Tyler asked why she wasn't calling Mommy Mommy anymore. Mia tried to talk to her. She sat outside her door and apologized. Said she didn't mean what she texted, that she was scared and confused. Hannah opened the door, looked her dead in the eyes, and said, at least now I know the truth. Mia, it's been three weeks. She only calls her.

Why would I want kids with you? In front of everyone at dinner. I walked out calmly. And what she tried to do next. We were at a dinner party with 10 friends, wine flowing, normal evening. Someone brought up kids and starting family. I joked about being the dad who burns breakfast but tries really hard. Everyone laughed. Then Chloe, sitting right next to me, turned with this smile that didn't reach her eyes. Honestly, you can barely take care of yourself. Why would I want to have kids with you? The entire table went silent. That uncomfortable silence where people suddenly find their wine glasses fascinating. I felt like someone punched me in the stomach. We laughed nervously and touched my arm. I'm kidding. You know I'm kidding, right? But she wasn't. I could see it in her eyes, that slight smirk. I set down my fork carefully. Thanks for being honest about how you feel. I think that tells me everything I need to know about our future together. Her face changed. This smirk disappeared. Wait, what? Daniel, I was just. I stood up and grabbed my jacket. Thanks for dinner. I'll see myself out. Daniel, don't be so dramatic. Chloe hissed, reaching for my arm. Sit down. I pulled away. Enjoy the rest of your evening. I drove home, poured Bourbon, and sat there thinking, here's what nobody at that table knew. This wasn't a surprise. Chloe had been making comments like this for months. Little digs about my job not being impressive enough, comparing me to her friend's boyfriends who were lawyers or worked in tech. Jokes about my paycheck. In front of her work friend. I brought it up privately. She. You'd always say I was being too sensitive or just joking. But when someone repeatedly tells you they don't respect you, believe them. I've been realizing I was more like a project to her than a partner. Someone she wanted to improve rather than someone she valued. Our lives were already separate. Apartment lease only in my name, separate bank accounts. No wedding deposits made. We were done. Two days later, Chloe was blowing up my phone. I didn't respond. I wasn't punishing her. I was just. I'd spent three years trying to be enough for someone who clearly thought I wasn't. I felt lighter than I had in months. Five days in, her best friend Megan called. You're really gonna blow up your entire relationship because you got your feelings hurt over one joke? Let me ask you something. If your boyfriend stood up in front of all your friends and said you weren't worth having kids with, would you marry him? Silence. Saying something hurtful once might be an accident. Saying it repeatedly, that's just who they are. Tell Chloe I'm not fragile. I'm just done accepting less than the bare minimum of respect. I hung up. I started packing up. Chloe's stuff. Four large plastic bins. Everything labeled and organized. A week later, I got home and found Chloe sitting in my hallway. Eyes red, makeup smudged. We need to talk. I unlocked my door. Come inside. She froze when she saw the bins. What is this? Your things. I figured you'd want them back. Daniel, this is insane. I said one thing that came out wrong. I handed her an envelope with photos. Every vacation, every moment I thought was building towards something. Our history. I'm keeping the ring, though. I'm still

Six years ago, my wife Rachel died after getting really sick out of nowhere. Like one week she had a bad cough and three weeks later she was gone. The day before she passed, she actually seemed better. The doctor said her numbers looked good and we thought maybe she'd make it. That's when she grabbed my hand and said, if I die, promise me you won't date anyone else. I literally laughed because it felt so ridiculous in that moment. I was like, okay, babe, I promise and kissed her forehead. My two daughters, Chloe and Amy, were sitting right there when she said it. They were 14 and 16 at the time. That night, everything crashed. Her organs started failing and by noon the next day, she was gone. I had to tell my girls their mom wasn't coming home. The next six years were just survival mode. I worked from home so I could be there when they got off the bus. I Learned how to braid hair from YouTube. I sat through every volleyball game and school play. I helped with college applications. Last August, I finally dropped Amy off at her dorm and drove home to an empty house for the first time in my life. I'm 45. The silence was suffocating. I've been going to these support groups for widows and widowers for about three years just to talk to people who got it earlier this year. This woman named Janet started coming. Her husband died around the same time as Rachel. We'd grab coffee after meeting sometimes and just talk. Nothing romantic at first, just two people who understood what it felt like to lose everything. Then in September, we went to dinner, then again in October. By November, I realized I actually liked her, like really liked her. We kept it quiet because I wasn't ready to tell my girls yet. Figured I'd wait until Thanksgiving when they were both home. Except last week we went to this Italian place downtown and our waiter was this kid named Trevor who graduated with Chloe. I didn't even notice him until Janet and I were leaving. He definitely noticed us, though, because that night my phone exploded. Chloe called me screaming, actually screaming. He said Trevor texted her a photo of me and Janet holding hands at the table. She said I was disgusting, that I was cheating on mom, that mom literally made me promise not to date and I couldn't even respect her dying wish. She said I was spitting on her grave and she didn't want to see me at Thanksgiving. I tried to explain, but she just kept yelling over me. So I hung up. I texted her that we talked when she calmed down, but she left me on read.

So that night during my usual gaming session time, the entire intervention team burst through my door. Gotcha, my wife yelled but everyone else just froze staring at me and my computer monitor showing a cartoon dragon breathing rainbow fire at a bunch of wizards in ridiculous clothes. Um, can I help you? I asked, blinking back at them. Adam, the high pitched female voice shrieked through my speakers. Did you just go AFK during the boss fight? We're dying here. My wife pointed at the speakers frantically there that's her. That's the woman he's been cheating on me with. What cheating? I pulled up my discord window and showed them the five male friends I've been gaming with every week, Ray Simon and three random teens that kick butt at the game. That voice you've been hearing, that's Ray, I said pointing to the bald guy on the screen, waved and said hi. With the female voice changer still on, everyone took a step back in horror. He quickly turned the voice changer off. Oh, sorry about that he said. Now in his regular voice, deep and gravelly like a truck driver who'd smoked for years, Ray shared his screen and showed his discord settings with the anime girl voice changer chosen as his primary microphone. No cheating, no girl, just men, I said suddenly starting to feel embarrassed While the others looked convinced, my wife still wasn't satisfied. Why would a grown man use a voice changer? My wife demanded people help girls more in the game. Ray said in his normal voice, I get free stuff all the time. Just acting all cute. Plus it's hilarious. He switched it back on. Daddy. Everyone on the discord call gagged and gust. So freaking cringe, one of the teens said. My wife looked at me, then at the screen, then back at me. But all those things you were saying, it's just banter between boys, I said, my face burning red. My mom turned to my wife. The woman you were worried about was Ray. I told you we should have just asked him, my best friend muttered. The neighbor raised his hand. So no drama then. Can I still tell people I was here? My dad had moved closer to the screen, squinting at Ray's hot elf character. So you can dress up your elf girl however you want, Harold. No, my mom snapped.

The day I met Harold, I had a black eye. I was trying to hide with sunglasses and a hoodie even though it was 90 degrees outside. I was moving boxes into my new apartment, the one I'd rented under my mother's Maiden name with cash I've been secretly saving for 18 months. He was sitting on the bench outside our building feeding pigeons. That's a lot of boxes for one person, he said, I'm managing. I said, without stopping, I'm sure you are. Something about the way he said it made me pause. Not pity, just quiet acknowledgement, like he'd seen people like me before. His name was Harold and he lived next door. Over the next few weeks, he became the closest thing I had to a friend in this new city. He brought me soup when I was sick. He sat with me on the balcony and told me stories about his late wife, his career, that he was always vague about, the daughter he lost too young, Vivian. He said her name like a prayer. How did she die? I asked. Once. Face changed before he smiled sadly. She trusted the wrong person. Two months into my new life, I was starting to believe I might actually be okay. Then I found the note under my windshield wiper. I will always find you. Stan knew where I was and Was coming. That night, Harold knocked on my door. He took one look at me and said, tell me what's wrong. For the first time in years, I did. Harold didn't react the way I expected. No shock, no panic, no empty reassurances. He just listened. And when I was done, he said something strange. I'm going to help you, but I need you to trust me even when what I'm asking doesn't make sense. Over the next few weeks, Harold became my shadow. He was always nearby, always watching, always aware of things I didn't notice. A car has driven past three times, he'd say casually. I started seeing the world the way he did. Every stranger was a potential threat. But for the first time, I wasn't just prey. I was paying attention. He taught me things between his observations, how to hold my keys as a weapon, how to scream in a way that actually gets attention. Predators choose easy victims. He, your job is to not look easy. One evening I asked him how he knew all this. I spent 40 years watching men like your ex destroy families. I Learned how they think. Stan was getting bolder. He started showing up at places I went, grocery store, the gym, the coffee shop. Never close enough to confront, just close enough to make sure I saw him. I told Harold, his jaw tightened. He's escalating. When he comes, we'll be ready. Three days later, I found My apartment door open and a photograph on my kitchen table, me sleeping, taken through my bedroom window on the back. Tomorrow. Tomorrow came. Harold insisted I stay in my apartment. If you run, he'll chase. If you hide, he'll hunt. The only way this ends is if he thinks he's winning, right up until he's not. That night, I sat in my living room jumping at every sound. Harold was next door. At eleven PM, I heard the lock click open. Stan had gotten a key somehow. Of course he had. He stepped inside and.

Everyone nodded. I said okay and left. Three days later, the bank called them. I was carving the Turkey when my sister Melissa clinked her fork against her wine glass. The room went quiet. We need to discuss something as a family, she said, looking directly at me. We took a vote last week. You're not part of this family anymore. I sat down, the carving knife slowly around the table. My parents nodded. My brother Josh avoided eye contact. My other sister, Emma, was recording on her phone. Even my grandmother folded her napkin and muttered, it's for the best. You voted me out of the family, I asked. It was unanimous, my father said. You never fit in anyway. Different values, different priorities. You're always working, never here for family events. I missed three dinners in five years. You didn't come to Emma's gender reveal party, Melissa added, I was performing emergency surgery. Exactly, my mother said. You think you're better than us with your doctor job and your fancy hospital. We're simple people. You don't belong here. Josh finally spoke. Plus, you never help with family expenses. Melissa needs money for her kids. Emma's starting her business, but you just hoard your money. I paid for dad's bypass surgery, I said quietly. I've been paying the mortgage on this house for eight years. That's different, my father said quickly. That was Your choice. Melissa stood up again. Look, we already decided. Pack your things from your old room. Don't contact us anymore. We'll tell people you moved away for work. My grandmother nodded. The family name stays with real family. I looked at each of them. These people I'd loved and supported my entire life. Okay, I said. I put down the carving fork, grabbed my coat and walked out. My mother called after me. You can't just leave. Finish carving the Turkey. I didn't look back. That night, I made three phone calls. First to the bank. I need to remove myself from the mortgage I've been paying. The woman on the phone was confused. Sir, you're the sole name on this.

I have this terrible habit of doing everything last minute, and I mean everything. Homework done during lunch, project night before, studying for tests. What's studying? I just walk in, pray, and somehow scrape by with a C plus. My parents hated it. Teachers would literally beg me to just try for once. But honestly, it kept working. So why change? Then 8th grade hits and they announce the big one. This massive final exam that decides if you even move on to high school. Like fail this, you're repeating the entire year. Hello. Everyone in my grade was panicking. Kids were making study schedules three weeks out, forming study groups, buying practice book. My friend Terrell dude made flashcards, physical flashcard in 2024. I'm talking color coded, laminated, organized by subject like he was preparing for the SATs. Meanwhile, I'm over here telling myself, yeah, I'll study. I got time. Week before the exam, I discovered this new show, binge the entire thing in three days. Two days before, my cousin wanted to play basketball all afternoon. Did I say no? Absolutely not. We were out there for hours. I came home sweaty, exhausted, and still haven't cracked open a single notebook. The night before, I'm sitting at my desk, stacked up, textbooks open, highlighters ready. I'm ready to lock in. Then I remembered I was stuck on this one level in my game. Just one level, I told myself. One level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2 a. M. I'm half asleep and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. Went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning, I drag myself to school running on four hours of sleep and vibe, literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flashcards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. I open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing. Science, picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully. There's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in and my teacher just looked at me that disappointed headshake that says I'm not even surprised. I went home fully prepared to tell my parents I'm staying in middle school another year, already planning my excuse, my apology speech to continue.

So I got him banned from the building. So I live in a college dorm and our entire floor is all girls. I'm pretty much always wearing a bra if I'm going outside or to class or whatever. But like if I'm just walking 10 feet down the hall to fill up my water bottle or use the bathroom, I'm not putting on a bra. Nobody does that. It's our floor. We all live here. And half the time people are walking around in pajamas or towels going to the shower. Anyway, so a few days ago, I left my room to go to the water fountain. I was wearing a white tank top and no bra. The tank top wasn't see through or anything, but yeah, you could probably see the outline if you were looking. I filled up my water bottle, walked back to my room. The whole thing took maybe two minutes. There was a small group of people hanging out in the hallway near some of the other rooms, but I didn't really pay attention to them. It's a dorm. People hang out in the halls all the time. About half an hour later, I hear a knock on my door. I open it and it's one of the girls from that group in the hallway. I recognized her from orientation at the Start of the year. We talked a few times back then. She had this kind of awkward smile on her face and was like, hey, so sorry to ask you this, but if you go out into the hall again, could you maybe put a bra on? My boyfriend was out there and he was kind of staring. So I'm not a confrontational person at all. Like I hate conflict. So I was just like, oh yeah, sure, sorry about that. Even though in my head I was thinking, why is that my problem if your boyfriend can't control himself? But whatever. I didn't wanna make it into a thing. So for the rest of that night, anytime I left my room, I threw on a bra or a hoodie, figured that was the end of it. It wasn't. The next day my roommate came back from the bathroom and told me she'd overheard the girl talking to her friends in there. She said the girl was making the whole thing sound completely different from what actually happened. She was telling them that I've been basically half naked, taking my sweet time at the water fountain, posing and arching my back to make my chest stick out like I was purposely trying to get her boyfriend's attention. My roommate said the girl was literally acting it out at the water fountain, pretending to be me, pushing her chest out and everything. Her friends were all.

The reading started exactly how my siblings wanted it to. To my eldest son, Steven, I leave $4 million and the Manhattan penthouse. Steven fist bumped like he'd won the lottery, which I guess he had. To my daughter Diana, I leave $4 million in the entire art collection. She was already googling yacht prices. To my son Paul, I leave $4 million in my investment portfolio. Paul whispered yes and high fived Steven. My youngest son, Marcus, I leave the contents of storage unit 47B, which contains nothing of monetary value. The room exploded in laughter. Diana actually snorted champagne. Nothing of monetary value. Oh, my god. Dad had jokes. Paul slapped my shoulder. Hey, maybe it's full of his old golf clubs. Those might be worth 20 bucks. But I noticed something they didn't. The lawyer's hands were trembling as he folded the will. And there was one more envelope with my name on it. I see the key, I asked. More laughter. Steven pulled out his phone to record. This is too good. Marcus opening his inheritance of nothing. The lawyer handed me a small key and the envelope. Your father insisted you read this privately, probably an apology letter, Diana shrieked. Sorry you were born last. I pocketed both and stood up. Three years of being Dad's sole caregiver during cancer, three years of running the family construction empire while they partied. In Europe and I got nothing of value. Wait, Paul called out, suddenly serious. We need you to keep running the company. We'll pay you a salary, 65 k, Steven added. That's generous for someone with no ownership. Very generous. Diana agreed, considering you just inherited nothing. I walked out without a word. That night, I opened envelope first. Dad's handwriting shakier than I remembered. Son, they think value only means money. Check the unit, then wait for them to call. Dash Dad Storage unit 47B was stuffed with filing cabinets, old ones from the 1970s. I opened the first drawer and my heart stopped. Every original contract, every patent, every client relationship agreement, every single document that proved ownership of anything in our company. But that wasn't the kicker.

When Bella was 4, we invented a game. I was her favorite aunt and she slept at my apartment every weekend. One night she asked what she should do if a monster ever tried to get her and she couldn't scream. I told her to draw a purple elephant. Why purple, she asked. Because purple elephants don't exist, I said. So if I ever see one, I'll know something is really wrong and I'll come running no matter what. She thought this was the funniest thing in the world. We Pinky promised she never used it. That was before Kevin. My sister met him at a party and within a year they were married. He was handsome, successful, patient. With Ella, everyone said she hit the Jackpot. He adopted Bella within six months. They moved an hour away and suddenly my weekend sleepovers turned into monthly visits, then holidays only. Kevin said Bella needed stability and routine. My sister agreed with everything Kevin said. Thanksgiving was the first time I've seen Bella in almost six months. Kevin always had an excuse. She, she's sick. She's got activities. She's overwhelmed by big gatherings. But they couldn't skip Thanksgiving. Bella walked in holding Kevin's hand and didn't let go. For the first hour, the little girl who used to do cartwheels in my parents living room sat perfectly still on the couch. I tried to hug her and she went stiff in my arms. Tried to talk to her and she gave one word answers while looking at Kevin. He smiled and answered for her. She's going through a shy phase. I watched them all day. The way she asked permission with her eyes before eating, the way she startled when Kevin stood up suddenly. The way her whole body relaxed for just a second when he went to the bathroom before tensing right back up when he returned. I, I told my sister I was worried about Bella. She rolled her eyes. You've always been dramatic. Kevin is the best father she could ask for. After dinner, Bella found me in the kitchen alone. Can we draw? She said it so quietly I almost missed it. I grabbed some paper and crayons. She drew for a few minutes. Flowers, a dog, her house. Then she stopped and looked toward the doorway. Kevin wasn't there. She grabbed the purple crayon, drew fast, push the paper into my hands and walked away before I could respond. Purple elephant, messy and rushed, but unmistakable. I looked out. Kevin was standing in the doorway now watching me. I didn't know how long he'd been there. I pocketed the drawing in my hand.

I now know the disgusting reason why. When I was seven years old, my older sister Emma, started sneaking into my room every night. She'd wait until I was asleep, then she'd press her hands over my ears and hold them there for hours. I'd wake up sometimes and ask what she was doing. She'd always say the same thing. I'm protecting you. Go back to sleep. I never understood what she meant, but every morning, she'd be gone and my ears would ache. This went on for three years. Every single night from age 7 to 10. Then suddenly it stopped. Emma moved away to college, and I never saw her do it again. I'm 32 now. Emma died last week in a car accident. A funeral. My aunt pulled me aside and said, your sister asked me to give you this if anything happened to her. She handed me a sealed envelope. Inside was a letter in Emma's handwriting. If you're reading this, I'm gone. And now you need to know the truth about why I covered your ears all those years. I wasn't protecting you from something outside. I was protecting you from something inside our house. Something that only came out at night. My hands started shaking. I kept reading. When you were seven, I started hearing voices at night. Not from outside. From the walls, from the floor, from the ceiling. They were whispering. Hundreds of Voices, all talking at once. I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I knew they were talking about you. I felt sick. Emma had never mentioned hearing voices. I went to mom and dad, but they said I was dreaming. They said I was making it up for attention. But I knew what I heard. And the voices got louder every night. They were saying your name over and over, like they were calling you. The letter continued. One night, I followed the voices. They LED me to the basement, to the door that's always locked. The door dad told us never to open. I found the key in his desk, and I opened it. I remembered that door. It was in the corner of the basement behind some old boxes. I asked my parents about it when I was a kid, but they said it was just storage. Behind the door was a staircase going down, way down. I counted 47 steps before I reached the bottom. And what I found there made me understand why the voices wanted you. I stopped reading. I didn't want to know. But I forced myself to continue. There was a room. A big room with symbols painted on the walls. And in the center was a circle drawn in something dark. Something that looked like dried blood. Inside the circle were photos. Dozens of them. All of you. From the day you were born until that week. Someone had been taking Photos of you your entire life. My stomach turned. I kept reading. I looked closer and saw writing under the photos. Dates. And next to each date was a number. I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the last photo. It was from that morning. And next to it was written, day 2 5:57. Final phase begins tonight. 2,557 days. I did the math. That would have been right around the time I turned 7. I ran upstairs, and that's when I realized what the voices were doing.

The moment happened at their country clubs anniversary gala. The one they pointedly not invited me to for eight years running. I only knew about it because my husband posted photos every year of him standing awkwardly alone while couples danced around him. This year was different. His mother called him in the morning of and I heard her through his phone. Bring someone respectable this time. The Hendersons are bringing their daughter. Harvard Law School. Very accomplished. My husband looked at me across our kitchen table and said loudly, I'll bring my wife like I've offered to every year. The silence on her end stretched so long, I thought she hung up. Then I suppose, if you must. Eight years we've been married. Eight years of his mother introducing me as David's friend at family functions. Eight years of these settings mysteriously disappearing when I'd arrive at holiday dinners. Eight years of his father asking when David was going to get serious about his future, while I sat right there, my wedding ring catching the light. They thought I was temporary because I was a mechanic. Not even a man, which might have been acceptable in their backwards way, but a female mechanic with grease under her nails and coveralls in her closet. Their son, the surgeon, had married someone who fixed cars, and they'd never recovered from the shame. The night of the gala, I wore The emerald dress David had bought me for our anniversary. His mother took one look and whispered to his aunt, loud enough for me to hear, at least she cleaned up small miracles. The Henderson's daughter was indeed there, beautiful, accomplished, and placed strategically at our table. David's mother kept steering her toward him, literally putting her hand on the woman's back and pushing her forward while I stood right there, my hand in his. Claudia just made partner at her firm, his mother announced. Not wonderful, David. That's nice, David said flatly. My wife just opened her third auto shop. She employs 47 people now. His mother's smile went rigid. How industrial. The breaking point came during the auction. They we're auctioning off luxury experiences for charity. Weekends in Aspen, yacht trips, the usual rich people things. Then they announced a special item, a full classic car restoration by Morrison Automotive, my company. The one I built from nothing. David must have submitted it without telling me. His mother actually gasped. You put her little garage project in our charity auction? David stood.

Every sign pointed to maybe one night at her place. She leaned into me halfway through a movie. I wrapped my arm around her. She tilted her head up, eyes lingering. Too long for just friends. I leaned in. Not fast. Fast enough to see if she'd meet me halfway. She froze, then gave me that pitying smile. Let's not ruin the friendship, okay? You're my best friend. I don't wanna mess that up. I could have argued. Instead I said, okay, friends. She looked disappointed. I didn't fight for it. You're not upset. You were honest. That's enough. I grabbed my jacket. Good night, Maya. You don't have to be weird about it. I'm not just adjusting. The next morning, I woke up with strange clarity. I didn't block her. I just stopped prioritizing her. Shorter texts, no initiating calls. When she asked if I was okay, I said, yeah, just been busy. She treated it like a phase. She'd send inside jokes, old selfies. I'd respond with thumbs up emojis. Nothing more.

So, listen, I just got home from the hospital, barely surviving, walking through the door like a penguin who lost a fight with gravity. My back hurts, my hair is a mess. I'm holding this tiny Newborn boy all wrapped in a blue blanket, and I'm thinking, this is gonna be one of those sweet movie moments. I look at my four year old daughter and say, sweetie, this is your baby brother. She stares at him like he's a moldy sandwich and goes, that. That's what you were hiding in your stomach? You? I thought you were getting me a sister. Or at least a dog. I swear, even the nurse started laughing when she heard that one. And of course, the drama didn't stop there. First night home, the baby cries at 2:00am. I'm rocking him like a zombie, and Bella marches out of her room with bed head holding her stuffed unicorn like a weapon. She yells, shut that baby up or I'm moving to Grandma's. I tell her, honey, he's just hungry. She squints at me and says, then give him a cheeseburger and let me sleep. Yeah, let me just run to McDonald's at 2:00am for your Newborn brother. The next morning, she wasn't any sweeter. I'm making coffee, half dead, and I see Bella dragging her little stool to the crib. I panic, what are you doing? She goes, just checking if he has An off button. She taps his nose. Dead serious. Nope. Defective. I almost spit my coffee out all over the baby and it kept going. Later that week she walks around the house holding her play phone like she's on a customer service call. Hello, yes, I'd like to return my brother. He cries, he smells, and he doesn't know how to play roblox. Refund please. She even added fake hold music like girl, where did you learn this? By then she had upgraded from complaints to straight roasting. I was changing his diaper and Bella leans over, looks at him and screams laughing hahaha he has a baby butt time! Little chicken legs! Mom! He looks like a potato with arms! Then she runs off yelling potato boy! Potato boy! My poor son is three days old and already bullied in his own house. Even the dog looks like he was laughing. Things only got crazier when she caught me breastfeeding. I'm nursing him on the couch, Bella walks in, drops her juice box and yells mom! He's eating your boob! I try to explain it's normal, but she's running around the house screaming help! My brother's having boob dinner! She even tried to put a plastic cross from her dollhouse on his chest. Like yeah, thanks Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you really saved me there. And just when I thought she'd calm down, she moved into full blown trash talk mode. One afternoon she looks at him sleeping. And whispers, you think you're cute, huh? Everyone thinks you're cute. Well, guess what? You can't even walk, loser. Like she's roasting an opponent. He's literally drooling, and she's roasting him like it's Comedy Central. But the part that completely killed me was one night when I walk in on her laying next to his crib, poking her finger through the bars like it's jail. And she whispers, okay, potato boy, I'll protect you, but if you touch my Legos, you're done. Then she kiss

I'm gonna say he touched me here. My daughter was pointing at her private parts while my mother hugged her and told her she was a good girl. I almost swerved off the road watching my daughter smile about how she was going to ruin my life in three weeks time. The surprise build a bear I bought her was laughing at me from the back seat. Photos of Julie my mother had sent earlier now seemed contaminated but instead of getting angry and acting on impulse like college me would have, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I sewed a recording device into the Build a bear before driving home. Grandma's here, Julie squealed when I walked through the door 20 minutes later running to me with the same same innocent face that had just been rehearsing my destruction. I know sweetheart I said handing her the build a bear. Mr Snuggles has a new friend for you. My mother smiled that grandmother smile I'd trusted for 42 years. You spoil her Daniel. How was work? The usual. I kissed Julie's forehead my stomach churning. Thanks for watching her mom. Over the next two and a half weeks I became the world's greatest actor. I installed cameras in Julie's dollhouse, her jewelry box even inside the old tablet She used for games. Every device was legally purchased and placed in my own home and items I bought. My lawyer would later call it Genius. Tuesday, my mother brought Disney brochures to my daughter for after the bad man goes away, she whispered to Julie who was ecstatic about the holiday and seemed to have no idea of the consequences she was doing. On Thursday, they practiced Julie's testimony again. Remember baby tears? Help. The judge needs to see you're scared of daddy. On Saturday, she gave Julie a new American Girl doll. This is for being such a brave girl about our secret. Each night I transfer the recordings to three separate cloud services and a physical drive in my office safe. Then I took my daughter in bringing her milk and cookies before calling her a good girl. It wasn't her fault. She had down syndrome and didn't understand the gravity situation. Be mad at her. When young children do bad things, you point the finger at the adults in their life. The court date arrived three weeks later. The room was packed for what everyone thought was day three of our custody battle. Jessica, my ex wife, sat with her lawyer looking confident. She'd been pushing for full custody with supervised visits. Only my siblings sat behind my mother. Your honour, Jessica's lawyer announced he'd like to call Julie Grimes to the stand. My eight year old daughter walked in clutching her build bear. She wouldn't Look at me. The Taylor helped her onto the witness stand, adjusting the microphone to her height. Julie, Sweetheart. Jessica's lawyer said, I know this is scary, but can you tell the judge what you told your mommy and grandma? Julie's little voice shook. Daddy, daddy touches me in bad places. The courtroom gasped. Jessica dabbed her eyes. My mother reached over to squeeze Jessica's hand in support. Where does he touch you? Julie pointed to her private areas. There, he says, it's our special secret. I felt my lawyer's hand on my arm keeping me seated. My siblings were staring at me in horror. How long has this been happening, Julie? A long time, he said. If I told anyone, Mommy would get hurt. Jessica broke into performative sobs. The CPS workers were furiously taking notes. The judge's face had turned to stone. Julie, one last question, the lawyer continued. Do you feel safe with your daddy? Julie started crying. Coached tears. No, I'm scared of him. I want to live with Mommy and grandma forever. No further questions. The judge looked at my lawyer. Does the defense wish to cross examine?

Watch me say no and make him cry. I froze outside our apartment door, grocery bags in hand. My heart shattered. We've been together four years. I had the ring in my jacket pocket. I walked in like nothing happened. Sophie was laughing on Facetime with her college friend Samantha. Babe, you're home early, she said, quickly hanging up. That night, I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. I kept replaying her words. Plan was to propose at her parents house during Sunday dinner. Her whole family would be there. Saturday was torture. Sophie kept asking if I was okay, touching my arm, trying to figure out why I was distant. I wanted to scream at her. I wanted to ask why? Why would someone spend four years with me just to humiliate me in front of the people who mattered most? I barely slept that night either. I kept staring at the ring box on my nightstand, thinking about how excited I'd been when I bought it three months ago. I'd saved for eight months, asked her dad for permission. Like an idiot, he'd hugged me and said, welcome to the family, son. What a joke. Sunday came. I was numb. We drove to her parents place and she kept chattering about random things. Completely normal. She talked about her coworkers drama, about wanting to repaint the bathroom, about her mom's new recipe she was excited to try. Every word felt Like a knife. How could she act so normal, knowing what she was about to do? I gripped the steering wheel so hard, my knuckles turned white. Part of me wanted to turn the car around. Another part wanted to confront her right there. But I kept driving. Maybe I needed to see it. Needed proof that the woman I loved could be that cruel. When we pulled into her parents driveway, she squeezed my hand. You seem stressed lately. Everything okay? I nearly laughed. Yeah, everything's fine. Dinner was perfect. Perfect. Her mom made my favorite pot roast. I pushed food around my plate, forcing down a few bites so no one would ask questions. Sophie's dad talked about his golf game. Her sister showed us photos of her new puppy. Sophie

After 3 exes who destroyed that word, I was terrified. I hate surprises. Hate them. My first boyfriend's surprise was forgetting our anniversary and pretending the gas station flowers he grabbed on the way over were planned. He handed them to me still wrapped in plastic with the price tag on. My second boyfriend surprise was a trip to Vegas. I, I was so excited until I found out it was for his buddy's bachelor party. I spent three days holding purses while they got drunk at clubs. My third boyfriend's surprise was the worst. He broke up with me at my own birthday dinner right after the waiter brought out the cake. He said he didn't want to ruin my birthday by doing it before, so he waited until dessert, like that was better. So when Jordan left a blindfold on my pillow and told me to clear my Saturday, every alarm in my body went off. We've been dating two years. Good years, really good years. But I had good years before. Good years don't mean anything when the bad day finally comes. Just trust me, he said. Guiding me into his car. I wanted to. I really did, but my hands wouldn't stop shaking. The drive took 40 minutes. I tried guessing where we were by the turns and the sounds outside a highway for a while, then smaller roads, then gravel. Nothing made sense. When the car finally Stopped and he helped me out. I heard birds, lots of them, chirping, squawking, whistling. It sounded like we were in a jungle. He pulled off the blindfold. We were standing in front of the city aviary. I blinked at the sign, not understanding at first. Then I remembered I'd mentioned this place once be six months ago. I saw a flyer at a coffee shop and said it looked cool, just a passing comment while we waited for our lattes. I didn't think he was even listening. He was on his phone. You remembered, I whispered. Jordan grinned, but there was something nervous in his eyes. Two years with you, I pay attention. None of my exes ever paid attention, not once. I wanted to cry right there in the parking lot. Inside was magical. Families filled the seats. Kids pointed at bird cages along the walls. Parakeets chirped, a macaw squawked somewhere. A cockatoo whistled a little tune. We found seats in the middle and I couldn't stop smiling. But Jordan kept fidgeting, checking his phone, adjusting his collar, bouncing his leg. The old fear crept back. What if this was the setup for Bad News? What if he brought me somewhere beautiful so I couldn't make a scene when he dumped me? My third boyfriend did that, picked a nice restaurant so I'd be too embarrassed to cry. What if Jordan was doing the same thing? I started picking at my nails, a nervous habit I'd had. Since I was a kid. A woman in khaki pants stepped onto the stage with a grey pigeon on her arm. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Percy. He's a messenger pigeon. Hold up a Bill and Percy takes it. Then he brings back a special note. Think of it as the world's most expensive fortune cookie. The crowd laughed. A little girl went first. Percy swooped down, gentle as a feather, took her dollar and flew back. Her note said, adventure awaits. She beamed at her mom. An older man tried next. His said, wisdom grows with age. He chuckled and showed his wife. Jordan nudged my arm. You should try. I don't know. Come on for me. He was still fidgeting, still nervous. But something in his voice made me reach into my purse. I found a five dollar Bill and held it up. Percy's head turned toward me. He launched from his perch and landed on my armrest, talked his head like he was studying me. Then he took the Bill so gently it felt like a kiss. He flew back to his cage. The woman retrieved a scroll tied with white ribbon and walked it over to me. That seemed odd. The others have been read out loud from the state. This one's special, she said with a wink. My hands trembled as I untied the ribbon. The scroll was longer than the others, real Parchment. I unrolled it slowly. The handwriting was Jordan's, my dearest love. From the moment you stole my heart, like Percy stole that Bill, I knew you were the one. I know surprises scare you. I know people have let you down, but I'm not them. I see you, I hear you. I remember the little things because to me, nothing about you is little. Will you marry me? I read it three times. Ears blurred the words. I turned to Jordan. He wasn't in his seat anymore. He was on one knee in the aisle holding a small velvet box. I know you've been hurt, he said. His voice cracked, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm just asking you to let me love you forever. A little kid in the front row whispered loud enough for everyone to hear. Is she gonna say yes? I laughed through my tears a thousand times. Yes. The ring caught the light as we walked out hand in hand. Percy had delivered a lot of messages, but I like to think ours was his favourite.

I was literally just existing in chemistry class, minding my business, when Asia walked in late with a Starbucks cup and sat right next to me. For context, this girl had the entire school obsessed with her. Football players were tripping over themselves in the hallways. Honor students were suddenly offering free tutoring. Even some of the teachers got weird about it, like they'd stutter when calling on her. And me, I was just the kid who wore the same hoodie three times a week and kept his head down. She asked to borrow a pencil. I gave her one. That was it. Normal interaction, zero fanfare. But then she started sitting next to me every day. I, I didn't think anything of it until my friend Sean pulled me aside after third period, looking like he just witnessed a murder. He goes, bro, half the school thinks you're dating Asia now. I blink. We barely even talk. Exactly. He said, like that explained everything. Apparently, Asia had been turning down literally everyone for months. And the fact that I wasn't trying was making people think I had some secret game. Sir, my game is eating Hot Cheetos in the library and pretending to understand calculus. Things got weird when her ex, this kid named Trent, started giving me death stares in the hallway. Trent thought he was the main character of life. Varsity jacket, gelled hair, walked Like he invented. Confident bro would literally stand outside my locker just staring, not just locked in like a malfunctioning security camera. One day he walked up to me and asked what my deal was with Asia. I told him we just sat together in class. He leaned in and said, that's my seat. Hello. It's a public school. You don't own furniture, Trent. I ignored him, grabbed my stuff and left. But the next day in chemistry, he moved my backpack and sat in my spot before I got there. I walked in, saw him sitting there looking smug and just sighed. Asia walked in two minutes later, saw him, and without saying a single word, she picked up his stuff and dropped it on the floor. The entire class went silent. She looked at me and said, sit down. Trent's face turned the color of a stop sign. He just stood there for a second, then grabbed his bag and left the room like his soul had been banished. I sat down. Someone in the back whispered, he's cooked. After that, Asia started talking to me way more.

Here's the thing about me and my brother. We basically raised each other. Our parents were too busy with their own demons to notice they had kids 11 months apart but might as well be twins. Growing up, we shared everything because there wasn't enough to go around. One meal split two ways, one winter coat we traded off. That kind of childhood changes you. Now we're functioning adults but still weirdly close. Share drinks without asking, use each other's deodorant. Close people side eye us when we split food. They don't understand that when you've been someone's lifeline since you were five, boundaries become irrelevant. The graduation party for my cousin was at some bougie venue where they charged $30 for two olives and a martini. I walked in feeling underdressed, even though I'd worn my nicest outfit. My brother was near the entrance probably waiting for me. Finally, he gave me a quick side hug, the kind where you pat someone's back twice and release thought you died or something. We started talking about how this place was out of our budget. When he stopped the conversation saying he wanted me to introduce me to someone. Before I could ask for more context, he was gone. He disappeared into the crowd. I stood there awkwardly doing that thing where you check your phone to look busy. About 20 minutes in, I Noticed this woman in a red dress near the bar. Designer everything, harsh eye makeup, stilettos that probably cost more than my rent. She kept staring at me. Not subtle glances either. Full on staring like she was trying to place me. At first I thought maybe we'd met before. I smiled at her. She whispered something to her friend and they both laughed. Okay, guess not. I moved to the appetizer table trying to shake off the weird feeling. That's when I heard her. She was talking to her friends, but her voice carried over the music. I cannot believe she showed up here. Like we get it. You're obsessed with him, but this is just pathetic. My stomach dropped. Was she talking about me? No. That's paranoid. I don't even know her. I grabbed some food and found a spot by the windows, but she kept appearing wherever I went by the bar. She probably thinks she has a chance. It's actually sad. Him? Who was him? I looked around the party trying to figure out who she thought I was following, but I'd literally only been here 30 minutes and hadn't talked to any guys. The harassment escalated. He accidentally backed into me while I was holding a drink, sending red wine all over my dress. Oops, she said flatly, not even turning around. Later, she stepped on the hem of my dress with her heel when I walked past, causing me to stumble. She was actually Pissing me off. this woman was clearly unhinged and I had no idea why she targeted me. I kept looking for my brother, but he was nowhere to be found. Then my cousin appeared with her baby. Bathroom emergency. The salmon was bad. Two minutes. He handed me her six month old baby and ran off. My brother finally reappeared looking exhausted. His lips were cracked and bleeding from working construction all week in the sun. Jesus, my lips are killing me, he said. Winson, do you have Chapstick? Yeah, one sec. I carefully balanced the baby, digging through my purse, found it, handed it over. You're the best. That's when that girl completely lost it. Are you fing kidding me? She yelled across the room. The entire party went silent. You pathetic hoe. I was in shock watching her rip off her stiletto. I'm so effing done with B words like you. The shoe was in her hand. She wound back. The stiletto was flying straight at my head. The stiletto flew straight at my face. Instinctively, I spun around, curling my body over the baby. The heel slammed into my back, sharp pain shooting through my shoulder blade. I heard gasps from every direction. What? What the hell? Normani, my brother's voice boomed across the venue. That's my sister. The entire party froze. Normani's face went from rage to horror in a split second. Your sister? Her voice cracked. My sister, the one I told you about. 50 times. The one holding our cousin's baby. The new manager rushed over with security. We're calling the police. That's assault with a weapon. My cousin burst out of the bathroom, saw me hunched over protecting her baby and charged at Normani. You threw something at my baby. Security was barely able to restrain my cousin from fully decking her. Normani stood there, mascara running as the graduates parents demanded she be removed immediately. Everyone had their phones out recording her complete humiliation. Obviously, he broke up with psycho ass.

My girlfriend Bianca is a model. I'm an accountant. When she agreed to a second date, my brother literally asked if I was paying her. Eight months in, everything was perfect. She was funny, spontaneous, literally everything a man dreams of. We'd stay up talking until 3:00am. She'd surprise me at work with lunch. Made me feel like I was the only guy in the world. Then I moved into her place. Little things started changing. The, the way she'd phrase questions that weren't really questions, how her suggestions felt less like suggestions. Still perfect on the surface, but the way she looked at me was different. Then Christmas morning changed everything. We're opening gifts in bed and she hands me this perfectly wrapped box with a huge smile. Inside is a leather looking dog collar with Bianca's engraved on a silver tag. We both burst out laughing. For when you're being a bad boy, she joked, kissing me. I tossed the gag gift in the closet with the ugly sweater my mom sent. A week later, she's making dinner when she brings it up. You never wear my gift. Her voice is flat and serious. I laugh thinking she, she's joking, but she's not. I put thought into that. You obviously don't care about what I give you. She locks herself in the bedroom. Two hours of silence. When I knock on the door, she Screams, just admit you don't love me. After hours of me waiting outside the bathroom, she comes out, eyes red. You really thought my gift was a joke? I wore it that night just to make her happy. The smile that spread across her face was worth the weirdness. Good boy, she said, running her fingers along the leather. Something in her tone made my stomach turn, but she was happy again, affectionate again. That's all that mattered. Next day I get home from work and she immediately freezes. Where's your collar? Like asking where my watch was. I laugh it off, thinking she's joking, but she's genuinely upset. You only wear it when I force you. That's what I mean to you. The guilt hits different when someone you love thinks you don't care. So I put it on. It becomes routine. Walk in, call her on. Small price for peace. I thought it would only be a temporary thing that she would forget about after a few weeks. Then two weeks in, she starts saying good boy constantly when I'd bring her coffee, when I'd agree with her, when I'd put the collar on without being asked. I mentioned it feels weird. It's just cute, she says. Don't you wanna be my good boy? The way she asks makes saying no feel like saying I don't love her. Then the commands start. I'm heading to the kitchen for dinner. Sit, she says from the couch. I freeze. What? Sit here next to me. Her tone is playful, but her eyes aren't. I sit confused. Good boy. My skin crawls. Later, I'm making my plate. Did I say you could eat yet? She's not joking. Beg for it, I laugh nervously. She doesn't. I'm serious. Beg or don't eat. I stand there, plate in hand, calculating if this is the hill to die on. My stomach growls, please, can I eat? She smiles. Good boy. I start documenting everything in my phone. The commands get worse. Stay when I try to leave arguments. Speak when she wants me to agree with her. Quiet when I'm winning a discussion. She uses them strategically, always. When I'm too tired or hungry to fight back, her friends come over for wine night. I'm getting drinks from the kitchen. Look how well trained he is. Melissa laughs.

Caleb was the sweetest kid I'd ever known. 11 years old, autistic, heart of absolute gold. He had a pet goldfish named bubbles that he talked to every morning. Would stand there in his pajamas telling her about his dreams before school. He was obsessed with anime. Could name every character from My Hero Academia. Talk your ear off about it if you let him. But the thing that got me most was how he treated people at family gatherings. He'd run around giving everyone hugs. Not the obligatory kind. Real ones, tight ones. Like he meant it. If someone was sitting alone, he noticed, walk right over and sit next to them. Wouldn't even say anything sometimes. Just be there for them. I adored that kid more than anything. Then last Thanksgiving happened. Caleb pulled me into the hallway careful so his parents wouldn't notice tears streaming down his face. Uncle, I need to tell you something. His chest was heaving. That rapid rise and fall when someone is crying and hyperventilating at once. I'm getting bullied in school. He told me about these two kids, a boy and a girl. They wouldn't leave him alone. They knocking his anime books out of his hands, calling him names, stealing his peanut butter jelly sandwiches. Sometimes they even shoved him into lockers. I held him while he cried. Have you told your mom and Dad? I asked gently. He nodded. They told me big boys deal with bullying themselves. They told me to figure out how to stop it alone. I watched anime with him until he calmed down. Then I found his parents in the kitchen. Did you. You know Caleb's being bullied? His mom. My sister barely looked up from her mashed potatoes. Kids are mean. He needs to toughen up. His dad shrugged at me. He's exaggerating. You know how Caleb gets. I was stunned. He was sobbing. This seems serious. My sister swatted at the air like I was being ridiculous. We'll handle it, she said. Don't worry about it. Then they changed the subject. Weeks went by. I kept checking in on Caleb, texting and calling him every day. Each time, he seemed a little dimmer, quiet. By the time Christmas came, Caleb walked into the family gathering and didn't hug anyone. All the light had been bullied out of him. While the other kids played and even discussed anime, he sat in the corner alone, staring at nothing. I pulled my sister aside. Something is seriously wrong. Why aren't you doing anything? She snapped. I said, drop it! This is none of your business. I didn't understand. Why were they being like this? Their son was falling apart. Caleb had even stopped taking care of bubbles. The light behind his eyes was gone. I couldn't just watch anymore. I called my sister next week, said I wanted to Pick Caleb up from school, take him for ice cream. She hesitated, then agreed. My real plan was to see and confront these bullies myself. I got to the school on the Friday a few minutes after the bell. Saw Caleb walking out alone, the only kid not picked up yet. I started walking towards him. Then suddenly, two kids stepped in front of him. A boy and a girl. His bullies. The boy shoved his shoulder hard. I picked up speed, marching right at them, ready to end this. Then the girl said something super loud. Loud enough for me to hear, aimed at Caleb. You think we forgot about Sophie? You think anyone's gonna forget about her? I froze. Caleb had never told me about a Sophie. Caleb saw me and ran over. Can we go, please? He started dragging me away, but the girl caught up before we could go. I noticed her eyes were red and puffy, not the eyes of a bully. She was yelling. Sophie never got the chance to run. I looked at her. I dared myself to ask, who's Sophie? The girl stared at me like I was stupid. You seriously don't know? I shook my head. She pulled out her phone, brought it closer to me. I felt Caleb trying to drag me away, but something in me told me I should look at the phone. So I did. A photo of a small girl with down syndrome, smiling, holding a Stuffed rabbit. The girl started talking again. Sophie's my best friend. But she can't come to school anymore because of Caleb. That's when the boy stepped forward. Your nephew's messed up, dude. He used to harass Sophie all the time. Pinch her and take her stuff. And make fun of how she walks. The girl's voice cracked. She can't even talk. She couldn't tell anyone. I felt sick. I looked down at Caleb. He'd stop trying to drag me away. The girl's voice broke. Then he followed Sophie into the bathroom with his iPad. Recorded her and showed everyone. Silence. Try to hang herself with her jumping rope. After that, the boy. The school didn't do anything because he's autistic. His parents know, but won't do anything. The girl wiped her face. So, yeah, we push him because nobody else will do anything. I turned around. Caleb was staring at the ground. The car ride home was silent. I pulled into the driveway. Is it true? I asked Caleb. Nothing. What you did to that girl, is it true? Silence. Look at me. He turned. But his face wasn't sad, wasn't sorry. It was blank. Empty. That's when I realised. The nice kid act was all fake. I stared at him for a long time. You deserve it. He blinked. Everything they're doing to you. You deserve all of it. I unlocked the doors. Get out!

The champagne glass nearly slipped from my hand. He's here right now? Yeah, he's at the bar right there. But don't worry. He did anger management, and he's supposedly a totally different person. I turned and saw him across the reception hall chatting with the groom. The last time I'd seen him, Liam, I'd been on the bathroom floor, spitting teeth into my palm while he stood over me fixing his hair in the mirror. Now he was laughing, holding a beer. Then he saw me watching. He raised his glass in a small toast and smiled. Not his old aggressive smile. Something softer, apologetic. I excused myself to the bathroom, my heels clicking too loud on the marble floor. In the mirror, I fixed my lipstick with shaking hands and told myself, maybe he had changed. Maybe I could get through the wedding. But when I came out, he was waiting in the hallway. I froze, but he held up both hands, palms out. He said, I know you don't wanna talk to me. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. The therapy made me understand what I did. His voice was different, calmer. He said, I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm different now. I walked past him, and he let me go. He even stepped aside to give me more room. Back at the reception, I tried to relax. Maybe he really had changed. Twenty minutes later, a groomsman I didn't know approached me. He said, you're the maid of honour, right? The bride needs you on the roof deck. Something about her dress. I said, what's wrong with her dress? He said, I don't know. She just said it's an emergency and to get you right away. I followed him to the service elevator. He pressed the button for the roof and said, she's pretty upset. Something tore. The elevator opened to the roof deck, where the venue sometimes did ceremonies. But it was dark, no lights on, and I didn't see the bride anywhere. I turned to ask the groomsmen, but he was already back in the elevator. Doors closing, I called out, wait! But the door shut. I pulled out my phone to call the bride, but had no signal up here. Then I heard footsteps behind me. Liam stepped out from behind the ventilation unit. He said, she's not coming. Her dress is fine. My blood went cold. I ran for the elevator, but he was faster, blocking me. I tried to dodge around him, but he grabbed my wrist, the familiar grip that left bruises for weeks. He said, that was my cousin who brought you up. Told him you and I needed to talk privately about the restraining order. He was happy to help. And don't worry, he won't tell anyone you were dumb enough to follow me. He'll say he never saw You. No matter what happens. I tried to pull away, but he twisted my

I dropped the sundress. I'm packing. What I didn't. You texted me last night that you and your husband changed your minds about the family cruise. He sends me a screenshot. It's from my phone number. Changed our minds. Just want it to be me and hubby for the cruise. Don't bother coming. My stomach drops. I check my sent messages. Text is there. Sent at eleven forty three PM I was asleep by 10:30. I start scrolling through my message history. The same text was sent to my husband's parents, his sister, our college friends, everyone we'd invited to join us on this cruise because it was supposed to be a big Celebration with family and close friends that's leaving in three days. My brother text again, I need you to send back the money I gave you for the cruise booking. I call the cruise line and the agent's words make me want to claw my eyes out. Ma'am, you called us Tuesday and cancelled the entire Mediterranean cruise. The refund of $14,000 was processed yesterday. I never called you, I whisper. The caller had all your booking information and said you needed the money back for an emergency. My husband checks my phone's app history. Then my iPad. Your iPad sent those texts. Didn't you lose it last week? I tell him I left at my mother's House during Sunday dinner. I'm at my mother's house. 20 minutes later, she opens it while holding a new designer handbag. Someone cancelled my anniversary cruise, I say, pushing past her into the kitchen. Someone who had my iPad. I don't know what you're talking about, she says, pouring coffee from a brand new espresso machine I've never seen before. I stare her down. $14,000 was refunded somewhere. Where did it go? How would I know about your finances? She says, but won't meet my eyes. I noticed the new granite countertops, the new stainless steel appliances. You remodeled your kitchen, I say slowly. Dad got a bonus, she says, too quickly. My dad's been retired for two years. I call him right there and then. He's confused. What bonus?

When my older brother accidentally got his girlfriend pregnant as a teen, my parents decided I couldn't make the same mistake. So on my 16th birthday, instead of taking me out for pizza and cake, my parents took me to a clinic to get a vasectomy. I didn't understand what vasectomy even meant until years later in the worst way possible. I was dating Stephanie at the time, but after the third date, I knew I wanted to marry her and start a family. When I told my parents, they laughed. She told you she wanted three kids together, son, you can't give her any kids. We made sure of it with your vasectomy, dad explained bluntly. The truth felt like a sucker punch to the gut. I felt betrayed. I stopped speaking to my parents that week, but I couldn't tell Stephanie about it, not yet. I was too terrified and embarrassed. So I kept dating her, got engaged, then married her, all while carrying this secret. I promised myself I would tell her the truth someday when I was ready. But eight months into marriage, she brought up the idea of starting a family. I told her gently, let's wait a few years and get settled, hoping it'd buy me more time to fix the problem. She looked disappointed but always agreed to wait. And so for the past Six months I've been hopping from doctor to doctor in secret discussing reversal surgeries, getting turned away because the reversal success rate is almost impossible. But I kept hope. Then by some miracle, two weeks ago, a surgeon emailed me back saying he was willing to try a new procedure with me. I was real. The only thing I needed to do now was buy myself a little more time before I told her everything. That's when I found something strange. I found her birth control in the trash, still half full, along with ovulation test that clearly showed that she was trying to get pregnant while telling me straight to my face that she was it's willing to wait. I mean, the irony of it was pretty sickening. Her best friend even started making jokes during our hangout about oops babies and how accidents are still blessings. We could never be too sure. I realized Stephanie had been trying to trap me into finally having the baby she wanted while I was secretly sterile. But it didn't matter because after the surgery, I could give her what she wanted. What I didn't realize was that she'd make it happen on her own. I had to leave town for a work convention for four days. When I got back, Stephanie seemed different, more alive, happy and hopeful. When I asked what changed, she mentioned her coworker Caitlin had been helping her out while I was gone, keeping her company. I Was relieved. Maybe all she needed was some space and a friend to take her mind off things until my surgery. But that same night, I found Stephanie sobbing on the couch. I sat down beside her, worried that something bad had happened when she suddenly held up three positive pregnancy tests with shaking hands. We're pregnant, she cheered, wrapping her arms around my neck as she continued crying in my ear. I know it's scary.

For six years straight, I showed up to every single one of my nephews birthday parties with wrapped presents. Noah turned seven, I brought him that expensive robot kit he wanted. Jacob turned five, I got him the Dinosaur set from the fancy toy store. Every year. Twice a year, I'd spend at least 40 bucks per kid and drive 30 minutes to their house. My kids are eight and 6 now. In all those years, not once did my brother Keith or his wife bring anything to my kids parties. Not a card, not a five dollar toy from the discount store. Nothing. They'd show up, eat the cake, let their kids play, then leave. Last year was the worst. My daughter turned 7 and specifically asked if Noah and Jacob were coming because she wanted to show them her new bike. Texted Keith three times confirming they'd be there. They came two hours late, stayed for 15 minutes, and left without even singing Happy Birthday. My daughter kept asking where they went. Two months later, Noah's eighth birthday invitation arrived in the mail. One of those fancy printed ones with the superhero theme. My husband saw me looking at it and said, you're not actually going to buy another present, right? I thought about it for three days. I looked at my Amazon order history and counted 12 birthday gifts I'd bought for My nephews over the years. Then I checked my kids birthday photos. Keith's family wasn't in a single one from the last three years. I decided we'd still go to the party, but I walked in empty handed. My mom was already there and immediately pulled me aside. Where's Noah's gift? She whispered. I didn't bring one. Her face went red. What do you mean you didn't bring one? Everyone brings gifts to birthday parties. Keith never brings gifts to my kids'parties, I said. She started talking about how that's different, how I'm being petty, how it's not the kids'fault. But I just walked away and sat down at one of the tables. Keith's wife noticed right away.

I worked at the same insurance office for almost 10 years. Every single morning I'd stop at Jerry's Coffee on Fifth Street, order my usual black coffee and add what I thought was cream from the self serve station. My co workers always made fun of how strong and bitter my coffee was. They'd take one sip and make faces like I was drinking motor oil. How do you drink that garbage? My, my desk mate Ashley would say, watching me gulp down my morning cup, I just laugh and tell her I liked my coffee with character, strong and bold, just like me. The whole office knew about my weird coffee preference. Even during meetings, people would joke about how I could probably strip paint with whatever I was drinking. For almost a decade, this was my routine. Same coffee shop, same order, same weird looks from everyone who tried it. I thought I just had different taste buds or something. Maybe I was just tougher than everyone else when it came to bitter drinks. Then one Tuesday morning, Jerry's Coffee was closed for kitchen repairs. A handwritten sign on the door said they'd be back in a week. I panicked a little because I'm not great with change. But I spotted another coffee place just two blocks down called bean. There I walked in and ordered my usual black coffee. Please, the young Barista with purple hair smiled and handed me the cup. Then I asked for cream on the side, just like I always did at Jerry's. She pointed to a small metal pitcher next to the sugar packet. I poured in my usual amount and took that first sip. My mouth almost dropped open. The coffee was smooth, creamy, actually enjoyable to drink. Instead of feeling like punishment, maybe this place just had really good coffee beans or something. When Jerry's reopened the next week, I went back to my normal routine. But something was bugging me. Now, why did that other place taste so different? Was their coffee really that much better? I decided to pay closer attention to what I was doing. I walked up to the self serve.

And my best friend tried to kick me out of her wedding because of it. When Riley asked me to be her maid of honor, I cried. We've been best friends since sophomore year of college. The kind of friends who knew each other's coffee orders and Netflix passwords. She'd always been the gorgeous one, the one guys noticed first when we walked into bars. I was the funny sidekick who made everyone laugh when conversations got awkward. I was fine with it. That was just our thing. She got engaged, Connor, in February, and the wedding was set for October, eight months away. When she handed me the bridesmaid dress options at her apartment, she hesitated before saying, so these run pretty small. The designer only goes up to a size 16. And you're like an 18 or 20, right? She said it so casually, like she was commenting on the weather. Maybe we could get you a personal trainer as an early birthday gift. I know this amazing guy named Dominic who works at APEX Fitness downtown. Got my cousin Rachel into crazy good shape. I felt my face get hot, but I smiled and said, sure. She venmoed me $800 that night with a note for Dominic. You're gonna look so good. I met Dominic the next Monday. He was brutal. Six days a week, 5:00am. Full body torture sessions that left me barely able to walk to my car. He put Me on 1,400 calories a day. Mostly grilled protein and vegetables. No alcohol, no. No sugar. No excuses. I started tracking everything in this app called My Plate. I canceled plans so I could meal prep. I stopped going to happy hours. My co workers asked if I was okay because I turned down birthday cake three times. But something clicked. For the first time in my life, I felt in control. By June, I'd lost 40 pounds. By September, I'd lost 70. My face had cheekbone. My collarbone showed. I bought jeans in a size 6, a size I'd never even touched in a store before. I felt like I'd unlocked a secret level of life I didn't know existed two weeks before.

Henry froze, because standing before him was his grandfather. The shock was overwhelming. His grandfather had passed away years ago. So how was he here? The grandfather didn't explain. He simply comforted Henry and gently took him to meet his grandmother. Just as they were about to leave, black, still confused, tried to follow them.

So he sold me to a witch. That day, a woman who came to buy pigs stared at my dirty face and casually asked my father, how much for this creature? Six for. What are you doing? Sold for four marks! Have you lost your mind? You can't give her to them! As I said, sold for four marks. Terrified, I begged my mother to save me. But my father held me down so hard, couldn't even move. Just like that, I was treated like freight. And hand it over to a stranger, a woman who turned out to be the witch to SEIA. She brought me to eritusa, a place they called a sanctuary of magic. That night, I saw myself in a mirror for the very first time. Ugly, twisted, almost not human. Shame and despair surged inside me. I smashed the mirror with my fist, grabbed a sharp shard with shaking hands, and tried to end a life that felt pointless. But I couldn't. Couldn't even die. The next day, I woke up in Eritrea's Grand Hall with Toseia standing beside me. Shaking with hatred, I clenched my teeth and asked her, do I not even have the right to die? That's adorable, piglet. You weren't taking control. You were losing it. In the end, toseya said she wanted to teach me magic. Magic to someone who didn't even Think life was worth living

Next, he poured cold water at the front door, which froze into a sheet of ice. He also used a hose to spray water onto the icicles hanging from the eaves, making them thick and sturdy. Everything was ready. Soon enough, two clumsy burglars arrived at his house. Their car immediately slid on the ice and crashed into a street lamp. But the thieves didn't give up. Disguising themselves as Santa Claus, they prepared to sneak inside. However, this is not going well. But the pair persisted, starting to run in place on the ice. Just then, the boy flashed his headlights, terrifying them into raising their hands in surrender. When the light went off, they continued forward. This repeated operation went on about 100 times. Finally, one man reached the door and saw a stack of cookies and a glass of milk with a note saying for Santa. The man thought, this must be for me. He picked up a cookie and started eating. The spicy cookie instantly set his throat on fire, forcing him to immediately drink the milk nearby to quench the heat. It turned out the milk had also been tampered with. Left with no choice, he had to shove his head into the snowdrift. The man finally managed to sneak inside the house. As soon as he entered, an alarm went off. He rushed to turn it off, only to find a nail placed on the button. Just then, the boy appeared with his weapon and the man was immediately knocked unconscious. Next, the boy put a VR headset on the man. When the man woke up, he found himself standing on a sheer cliff face.

When I discovered I could hold it for 50 seconds, I decided to compete in the Olympics. I hobbled down the stairs, put on my backpack and prepared to leave. But my mom called out to me and handed me a box, telling me to use it for my medals. I left happily while my mom shook her head. I limped to the bus stop where my dad was already waiting. My dad drove me home, but I didn't give up my Olympic dream. As soon as the brace came off my leg, I started trying out various sports. I tried weightlifting, but fell to the ground. I tried pole vaulting and the pole broke. The box originally intended for medals was now filled with broken glasses. I still didn't give up until I tried javeling, throwing and accidentally smashed the living room window. My father finally reached his limit. Eddie, you are not an athlete. My father shattered my fantasy. He took me to a construction site to work as a bricklayer. But my attention was drawn to skiing and I decided to compete in the Winter Olympic. I strapped on the skis and started repeating the training day after day. After more than 10 years of hard work, I won countless medals and finally awaited the national team tryouts. But I accidentally knocked down a teammate and the coach bluntly told me I wasn't suitable to be an athlete. My dream was crushed. Once again, I gazed at the skiing footage on TV, longing to try one more time. After packing my bags, I left home. When I walked to the bus stop, my dad was still there waiting. This time, he didn't stop me, but instead encouraged me to bravely chase my dream. I stood on the high diving platform, skied down rapidly, soared into the air and landed smoothly. I succeeded and earned the opportunity to compete in the Winter Olympics. My mom handed me the medal box. Standing on the Olympic stage, I skied like an eagle toward the distance, flying off a high ramp dozens of meters high. This time, I realized my dream.

Her parents look lovingly at their younger daughter. That's when her older sister suddenly walks in. Listening to her younger sister's accusations, the older sister has gotten completely used to it. The parents who were smiling moments before, now turn their faces away. They want the older sister to hurry back to her room. Looking at the manga about celebrity training in her sister's hands, Andy becomes even more brazen. She mocks her sister, telling her to be realistic and stop having unrealistic dreams. The older sister ignores her. Andy complains to their parents again, asking why they don't just lock her sister in her room. Having her wander around the house affects her own image. Andy acts so domineering because she's already an influencer with tens of millions of followers. When she posts a random dance video at school, quickly gets tens of thousands of likes. Countless little fans constantly surround her, asking for photos. Even major brands compete to have her as their spokesperson. Compared to such a beautiful younger sister, the overweight older sister feels deeply insecure listening to her sister praise her. The younger sister looks completely unhappy. She sarcastically says her sister could achieve the same with effort, so it would definitely be 100 times harder than for normal people. Back in her room, the older sister looks at the female celebrity in her manga. Listening to the sound of her sister dancing. Next Door. A bold idea suddenly.

A note was tied to the arrow, telling him, shoot the gun in the basket into the sky and all of your mortgage debt will be wiped clean. With such an irresistible offer, he couldn't say no. So without hesitation, he fired straight into the sky. At the same time, a truck driver climbed into his vehicle and found a note waiting for him. It said, after hearing a gunshot, drive to the designated spot and you'll get a brand new woolen homework. At first, the man didn't believe it. He threw the note out the window. But when he grabbed his keys, a deposit slip for 60,000 fell out. And then he heard the gunshot. So he quickly headed to the designated location. As soon as the truck stopped, Jack hopped in, grabbed an invitation card, and told the driver to wait right there. Then he walked into India's biggest jewelry store, handed the invitation to the owner. The message on it told him, pack up all the gold and jewels or Tony will detonate the bomb. Tony's job was simple. Just stare at the owner with a fierce look and he'd earn himself a stylish suit. Terrified, the owner sprinted into the back room, stuffed all the gold and jewels into bags, and handed them to three delivery guys who had just arrived. Their job was to load the bags into the waiting Truck and tell the driver to take the same route back. When the truck finally returned to the starting point, Mark quickly unloaded the bags and transferred them into another luxury car. And just like that, the perfect heist was complete. Even though the police arrested everyone involved, the investigation was strange. No one knew each other, and no one realized they were part of a robbery. They were all just following the promises written on the notes. Mark was the final executor. The captain figured he must know who the real thief was, but he didn't realize Mark was blind. So he asked Mark if he saw the suspect. Mark shook his head, saying no. Then the deputy explained the blind man's task was to carry the bags, take five steps back, and toss them into the car. The reward was the restoration of his eyesight. After confirming it, they scheduled surgery for six PM. When the captain heard this, he was furious because two similar cases had already occurred this month. With no other options, they called for help from higher UPS, and headquarters sent a top detective.

I said nothing and revealed what she'd hidden for years. When I was 19, my mom remarried Richard and suddenly decided I was too spoiled living in our family home. Time to learn independence, she said, kicking me out so Richard's son Tyler could have my room. My childhood bedroom became his gaming setup overnight. I'll never forget packing my stuff while Tyler lounged on my old bed, already planning where to put his new desk. Mom stood in the doorway with her arms crossed, explaining how this would build character. The same woman who used to make me hot chocolate when I had nightmares now treating me like a burden she couldn't wait to get rid of. I crashed on couches for months. My friend Jake's mom let me sleep in their basement, but I felt like such a charity case. I worked three jobs, morning shift at a coffee shop, afternoons at a retail store, nights doing delivery driving. I'd see families eating dinner together through restaurant windows and feel this hollow ache in my chest. Mom would post family vacation photos with Tyler in my old spot at the dinner table. Disney World trips, beach houses, fancy restaurants. Tyler wearing my old high school Letterman jacket in one photo. Really stung like I never existed. The worst part was running into them at the grocery store. Mom would get this awkward smile and ask how I was Doing out there in the real world while Tyler stood behind her wearing brand new clothes. Meanwhile, I'm calculating if I can afford name brand pasta sauce. This week, I finally saved enough to rent a tiny studio apartment above a pizza place. The walls were thin. It smelled like pepperoni constantly and the heat barely worked. But it was mine. I'd fall asleep listening to Tyler's Instagram stories about his awesome new room and best mom ever. During this time, I was the only one who visited grandma regularly. Every Sunday, I bring her groceries and we'd watch old movies together. She never asked why I look so tired or why my clothes were getting loose from skipping meals. She just made sure I ate a real dinner every week and sent me home with leftovers. Grandma would tell me stories about growing up during the depression, how her family stuck together no matter what. Real family doesn't abandon each other when times get tough, she'd say, patting my hand. I always wondered if she knew what mom had done to me. Five years crawled by like this. I bounced between apartments, worked my way up to assistant manager positions, slowly built a small emergency fund. Mom would occasionally text on holidays, generic thinking of you messages that felt more like obligation than love. Then grandma died suddenly, heart attack in her sleep. At the funeral, mom cried dramatically while Tyler stood there checking his phone. I was the One who held Grandma's hand during her final hospital visit. I was the one who knew she wanted to be buried next to Grandpa wearing her blue dress. A week later, the lawyer called. Grandma had left me everything, her house, her savings, her vintage jewelry collection that I'd always admired. The reading of the will was surreal. Mom kept shooting me confused glances like there must be some mistake. But the real shock came when mom.

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil ever since dad left us when I was seven. But that was years ago now. At 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in glittery pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period, and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. I lived in a sketchy neighborhood. The first time I got catcalled was on my 8th birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us. We both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing. All her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. When I met him, this guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers, like mom taught me. Hey! He called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that, but he persisted. I live two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed him after that. Always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks. Until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. The guys backed off. Immediately. After they left, he dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule. Always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me, and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. Stupid, I know. When my mom's car turned the corner early, He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around, too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Missus Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cops said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed another home safe text. Chemistry boy texted a lot. Like, a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour, and he showed up at the library looking panicked. Just worried, he said. Well, three weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said, heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text. Still in here? No sheet, Sherlock. That's when I heard it. Glass breaking downstairs. My whole body Went ice cold. Mom appeared in my doorway, face white. Did you hear that? We froze as footsteps creaked on the stairs. Heavy, deliberate. Mom's eyes went wide. She mouth 9 1 1, but her phone was downstairs in her purse. Mine was dead. The footsteps got closer. My 4 11. Mom pushed me behind her, grabbing my field hockey stick. The door. Door swung open. A man in a ski mask stood there, knife glinting. Mom swung the stick, but he caught it, yanked it away. Shoved her heart into the wall. I screamed. The closet door exploded open. Chemistry boy launched himself at the intruder using those same moves he taught me. They crashed into the hallway. Call 9 1 1, he yelled, wrestling for the knife. Mom scrambled for my phone, hands shaking. Pinned the guy using some wrestling move. Knee on his back. Knife kicked away. Held him until the cops arrived. Turns out the intruder had been hitting single mother houses for weeks. Watched for houses with no male presence. No man's shoes on porches. Easy targets. That night, mom sat on my bed, still shaking. How long? Four months. I admitted she looked at him. Really looked. Then said quietly, my rule. Made us a target, didn't it? She didn't say anything else, just squeeze my hand. I really thought she had come around. But the next morning, chemistry boy wasn't at our usual meeting spot or at school. Soon he went from having Perfect attendance. To missing a week straight of school. An awful gut feeling washed over me. I knew that my mom was behind it. Full story on channel link below.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color, like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved three rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it. Stacy, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear, and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but missus unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat, but the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going on? He Backed away. Nothing. I just. I need space. Bro, I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain, who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulder. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting. Now he just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo, the blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward from what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline, right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. Now! I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't? His girlfriend Ava, read over his shoulder, then slapped him hard. How could you Not tell him, you coward! She stormed off. Jason did. Something happened to Isabella. He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like you, Isabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Missus! Agriffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening! I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that point, I was so sick of everyone's BS that I just wanted to show him the Minecraft base I'd been working on. We were ten minutes away from the

So my grandpa died two months ago, and my dad has been acting like he just won the lottery. He's already picked out a new truck, started looking at vacation houses, and keeps talking about how he's finally gonna live the good life. Thing is, I'm the one who helped Grandpa write his will three years ago when he was still sharp, and I know exactly what's in it. Dad's not getting what he thinks he's getting. My grandpa was this tough old guy who owned a small auto repair shop for, like, 40 years. Super smart with money, never spent on anything fancy. Drove the same beat up Ford for 20 years. But he was also really good at reading people. And honestly, he wasn't too happy with how my dad turned out. See, my dad's always been the type to count other people's money. When grandpa got sick last year, dad started coming around way more often. But it was obvious he was just waiting for the inheritance. He'd make these comments like, when I get the shop, I'm gonna modernize everything. Or, can't wait to see what grandpa's been hiding in his bank accounts. It was honestly pretty gross to watch. The real kicker was when Grandpa was in the hospital for his final stay, dad spent more time on his phone looking at boats online than actually talking to Grandpa. I remember sitting there Watching dad scroll through some Marina website. While Grandpa was trying to tell him stories about the old days. Grandpa noticed, too. I could see it in his eyes. Now, here's what actually happened with the will. Three years ago, Grandpa called me over and said he wanted to update his will. He was always closer to me because I actually helped him at the shop sometimes. And didn't just show up when I needed something. He sat at his kitchen table with this lawyer he'd known forever. And Grandpa laid it all out. The auto shop going to Carlos, his head mechanic, who's been there for 15 years and actually knows how to run the place.

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. 3,000 dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you, you sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake? Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name. And track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look, the same guilty look they've been giving each other for months. Whenever grandma brought up gifts or money, I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The Same design, the same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop, making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought you a 3,000 dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara's been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents cause last month she asked me for $20 for gas money. The month before that, she needed $50 for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Lauren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Alara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing and everyone at the table knew it. Grandma leaned forward. Her eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

Women never know what they want. Then he actually snaps his fingers and adds, make it a large and make it quick. The girl, clearly uncomfortable, softly says she really just wants a small. The guy rolls his eyes, calls her an idiot, tells her to shut up, and repeats to Chandler that they'll be taking a large because the man decides. That's when Chandler looks up, completely serious, and goes, is this. This is how it usually goes in your relationship? You telling her it's large when she knows damn well it's small?

Dad shifted uncomfortably. About $85,000 over four years. And Melissa? Closer to $110,000 with the private school. I pulled out my phone, opened my notes app. Wanna know what you spent on mine? I turned the screen around. $3,200. That's it? One semester of community college before I couldn't afford to continue. The table went silent. I worked three jobs. I ate meals that cost under $2. I studied in my car between shifts because I couldn't afford to waste gas driving home. I graduated six years late because I could only take one class at a time. You gave them nearly $200,000 and gave me a speech about character. Mom's voice trembled. We were in a different financial situation. No, I cut her off. Derek's ski trips, Melissa's new car. Those weren't different financial situations. Those were choices. You chose them. You chose to help them and tell me I'd figure it out. Derek spoke up. That's not fair. We didn't ask to be treated differently. But you never said anything either. You both watched me struggle and said nothing. Took every advantage while I got nothing. I stood up, grabbed my coat. Here's what's going to happen. You need $4,000 a month to supplement retirement. That's $48,000 a year. Split three ways, that's $16,000 each. I'll pay my third. Just my third. Same as them. Dad's face went red. They can't afford. Exactly. I smiled coldly. They can't afford it because you never Taught them to struggle. You never made them work for anything. You spent $195,000 on their futures and $3,200 on mine. So I'll contribute exactly one third of what they do. When they come up with their $32,000, I'll match with mine. Mom started crying. You're punishing us for trying to help your siblings? No, I said, heading for the door. I'm treating you exactly how you treated me. Fairly? Equally? Self. Sufficiently. I walked out to 67 missed calls by morning last week. Derek asked to borrow $10,000. I sent him a link to the warehouse that's hiring night shift. Same one I worked. He hasn't responded yet.

And yes, this giant truck ran on regular gasoline, which already tells you everything about how outdated it was. Right before the gas station, a mobile dot inspection setup was operating on the side of the road. They looked up the moment they saw the truck come around the corner. I could practically feel them staring at the smoke drifting from the exhaust. I pulled into the fuel station, filled up and could tell they were waiting for me. As soon as I got back on the road and approached their checkpoint, they stepped out into traffic and waved me in. I parked and shut the truck off. One of the officers walked over carrying a creeper so he could slide under the frame. I asked, why do you need that? He said, I need to inspect your vehicle. I held up my stack of notes. No need. I already made a list. He looked through my paperwork, nodded and walked back to his car. For the next 30 minutes, he scribbled non stop. He returned. He asked, why are you driving this thing? I told him the truth. They told me I had to. If I don't drive it, I guess I don't work. He walked away again without another word. When he came back, he placed a bright red out of service sticker on the windshield. There are 21 separate issues that make This truck unsafe to operate, he said. Your company is getting fined for every one of them. Then he pointed to the expired fuel tax sticker. That alone is normally a 10 thousand dollar fine to you personally. He I'm calling a local officer instead. He'll give you a small ticket the company can pay. I thanked him. They towed the truck and I called the warehouse for a ride back. By the time everything was settled, the company had paid more than $65,000 in fines, towing and penalties. The following week, every old truck was gone. In their place was a full fleet of brand new leased trucks, complete with a maintenance plan, replacement vehicles and even scheduled washing twice a month. I stayed for two more years before a competitor hired me for better pay. But the company never forgot that day and they never tried handing me an unsafe vehicle again.

I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kid showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really?

Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rental GTR, strikingly white engine purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop, and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard. I and everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out Fairy tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb, his 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again, fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework, completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab programme, 60 days, some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapse the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox thinking maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,500 for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. Stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewellery, our t v, Emma's laptop and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The kid Had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. When my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed, not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad who died when she was 6. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born, $180,000 that was meant to get her through whatever college she wanted without debt. Emma's crazy smart, like scary smart. Her teachers keep telling me she could get into Harvard or Yale if she keeps her grades up. But even with scholarships, those schools cost a fortune and our incomes too high to qualify for financial aid. That money was supposed to be her safety net, her ticket to whatever future she wanted. I told my husband absolutely not. The fund was off limits, period. That's when he lost it, started yelling about how I was choosing money over his son's life, how addiction was a medical condition, how we had a moral obligation to help family. He kept saying medical emergencies come before education, like Emma going to college with some luxury instead of her entire future. The worst part happened three days later. I came home from work early and found my husband and Emma sitting at the kitchen. Table. She looks like she'd been crying. And there were all these pamphlets spread out about the rehab place. My husband had asked her directly if she'd be willing to give up 30,000.

While 300 students watched my sister Riley collapsed backstage during the spring musical. Not a graceful stage fall. She went down hard, gasping like she couldn't pull air into her lungs. I was helping with tech crew when I heard the thud. Riley was on her knees, one hand clutching her inhaler, the other braced against the wall. Her lips had that bluish tint I'd seen before during bad asthma attacks. Missus Chen, the drama teacher, rushed over. Riley, honey, can you breathe? Riley shook her head, tears streaming. She managed to use her inhaler, but nothing changed. She was wheezing so loud, I could hear it over the opening number playing on stage. Call 9 1 1, I said already, pulling out my phone. Principal Vega appeared out of nowhere and grabbed my wrist. Absolutely not. We have 300 people out there who paid for tickets. Missus Chen looked up from where she was crouched next to Riley. She's having a severe asthma attack. She needs medical attention. She's anxious. Vega cut her off. Opening night jitters. I've seen it 100 times. Crouch next to Riley with his fake concerned expression. You're the lead, sweetheart. Everyone's counting on you. Just take some deep breaths and get back out there. Riley tried to seek, but could only wheeze. The sound was getting worse. Higher pitch, more strained. My mom pushed Through the backstage curtain. She'd been sitting in the third row and somehow knew something was wrong. She took one look at Riley and went pale. She needs a hospital now. Vegas stood up, physically blocking her path to Riley. Missus Hoffman, I understand your concern, but this is a school event and I'm in charge. Your daughter signed a commitment contract. We've sold out three nights. The show must go on. Are you insane? Look at her. Riley was leaning forward now, propped on her hands, using her arms to help her breathe. It's called tripod positioning. A classic sign. And asthma attack is getting danger. I'd Learned that after her last er visit. Missus Chen tried again, her voice shaking. Principal Vega, I really think we should. She goes on in 90 seconds, he said flatly. The curtain call for Act 1 is already running. Her entrance is huge. Get her on her feet. I could see the stage manager through the wings, headset on, counting down with her fingers. 60 seconds.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy, Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend, smart girl, lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colours are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes.

When my 15 year old son, Jake, came to me asking for cooking lessons, I thought he was finally growing up. He'd been dating this girl, Emma, for three months and wanted to surprise her with dinner. Sweet, right? Wrong. What's her favourite food? I asked, pulling out my recipe box. Well, she loves pasta, but she's allergic to gluten and dairy and tomatoes. Oh, and nuts. Actually, most fruits, too. I stared at him. What exactly can she eat? Jake pulled out his phone and showed me a list. I'm not kidding. This girl had a notes app with 17 different food allergies. Shellfish, eggs, soy, corn, most vegetables. Except, like, three specific ones. I'd never seen anything like it. Jake, honey, are you sure she's not just extremely picky? Mom, no. She carries an Epipen everywhere. Last week, she had to leave lunch early because someone was eating a peanut butter sandwich two tables away. So we spent the next weekend researching recipes. Everything we found either contained something on her list or tasted like cardboard. I suggested rice with plain chicken, but apparently she's also allergic to poultry. We tried quinoa salad. Nope. She reacts to most herbs and spices. By Sunday night, we'd narrowed it down to exactly one meal. Plain white rice with steamed carrots and a specific brand of olive oil she could tolerate. That's it? For a romantic dinner? This is insane. I told my husband later. What does this girl eat normally? Maybe she just brings her own food everywhere, he suggested. The next day, I decided to do some detective work. Picked Jake up from school and saw Emma by the parking lot. She was eating a massive Turkey sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, basically everything on her allergy list. I drove home in silence, my brain trying to process what I just seen. Either this girl had miraculous healing powers, or something else was going on. That evening, I sat Jake down. I need to ask you something about Emma's allergies. His face went red immediately. What about them? I saw her eating a Turkey sandwich today with cheese and tomatoes. Jake stared at his shoes for the longest minute of my life. Finally, he mumbled, she's not actually allergic to anything. What? She made it up because she didn't want to eat dinner at my house. She said our family seems too intense and she needed an excuse to avoid family meals. I felt my eye twitch. We'd spent an entire weekend researching hypoallergenic recipes. I'd called three different specialty stores looking for specific ingredients. I'd even ordered a separate set of cooking utensils to avoid cross contamination. Jake, why didn't you just tell me the truth? Because then you'd know she doesn't wanna meet you guys. And I really like her. The kid had a point, but I Was still annoyed. All that work for a girl who was basically lying to avoid spending time with our family. So what do you want to do now? I asked. Jake thought for a moment. Can we still make the rice and carrots? If she's going to fake allergies, might as well give her exactly what she asked for. The next Friday, Emma came over for dinner. Jake had set the table with candles and everything. When I brought out the plain rice and carrots, her face was priceless. This looks simple, she said, clearly trying to be polite. Well, we had to work around your extensive allergy list, I replied sweetly. Jake wanted to make sure you felt safe eating here. She picked up the rice for 20 minutes, clearly starving. Meanwhile, the rest of us enjoyed the lasagna I'd made for the family. Emma kept glancing at it longingly. After dinner, she excused herself to the bathroom. Jake followed her out to the hallway, and I could hear them whispering. Your mom knows, doesn't she? Emma said. Knows what? Jake played dumb. That I'm not allergic to anything. This dinner was punishment. When they came back, Emma looked mortified. She apologized to me directly, admitting she'd made up the allergies because she was nervous about meeting us. I just thought your family seemed really close, and I didn't want to say something wrong at dinner, she explained. I actually felt bad for her then. The kid was just Anxious? Emma, next time just tell us you're nervous. We don't bite much. She laughed and Jake looked relieved. We ordered pizza and she ended up staying until 11, talking with all of us about school, her part time job at the bookstore, her plans for college. Three months later, she's practically part of the family. And yes, she eats everything we cook. Turns out when you're honest with people, dinner tastes a lot better.

Here's the thing, I'm half Russian. My dad's side is Russian and I grew up speaking it fluently. But I never told Alex's family because I wanted to see how they really felt about me. First time Alex brought me home for dinner, Babushka Vera looked me up and down and started speaking rapid Russian to Alex's mom. She's too skinny. Feed her more borscht. American girls don't know how to eat properly. I'm trying not to laugh while she's literally shoving bread at me. Then she turns to Alex and says in Russian, this one has good hips for babies.

They never listen. Over the next few months, I heard some incredible commentary. During our second dinner, Vera whispered to Alex's aunt, the American girl has no meat on her bones, but she ate three bowls of my soup. She has potential. At Alex's birthday party, she told his cousin, look how she watches him when he talks to other girls. Good. She's territorial. I like this. But the best was when Alex's ex girlfriend showed up unexpectedly. This girl, Natasha, was also Russian and kept trying to flirt with Alex right in front of me. Vera watched this whole interaction, then turned to Alex's mom and said, watch this. The American girl looks calm, but her eyes are saying, I will bury you.

Back when I was a truck driver, I worked for a company that treated maintenance like an optional expense. We had several trucks for different types of deliveries and on a normal day, I might end up driving two or three different ones. None of them were in great shape. But one truck, the big 33,000 pound gas powered one, was falling apart faster than anyone wanted to admit. For months, that truck got worse and worse. It stalled randomly, smoked constantly and leaked more oil than it kept. I told the company repeatedly that it wasn't safe and that I wouldn't drive it until it was properly repaired. They shrugged every time. As long as the wheels turned, they considered it fine. One week, they finally let me avoid it. Then one morning they said they needed me to take it out for a single delivery. I didn't want to, but I also didn't want a customer waiting on materials all day. Trying to be a team player, I agreed. They even loaded a full case of motor oil in the cab just in case. That should have been the clue. The moment I got on the highway, the truck started leaving a trail of thick white smoke behind me. Drivers turned on their high beams in broad daylight to see through the haze. Others pulled up beside me, honking and gesturing, clearly annoyed. I Eventually realized why so much oil was blowing through the exhaust that it was landing on the cars behind me. By the time I returned from that 50 mile round trip, the truck had burned through 24 quarts of oil and nearly a full tank of fuel. I stepped out of the cab and told them again, I'm not driving this truck until it's fixed. I mean it. They insisted they were working on it, which meant doing nothing. As drivers, we're required to do a pre trip inspection every day. You list every issue, sign it, keep one copy for the truck, send one to the company and carry one in case dot asks for it. I filled that sheet completely every time I touched that truck. I also kept a second personal list with even more details, things that made it unsafe even if they weren't part of the official checklist. The next day I walked into the yard and saw that same truck loaded, Florida ceiling keys in it ready to go. I said I'm not driving that. They said, well, you have to. After a few seconds of thinking, I grabbed the keys and said alright. I started the engine and pulled out of the lot. Normally I would make a left to head to the job site.

I talked to her dad over beers at his favorite sports bar, booked our anniversary restaurant for Valentine's Day, even practiced the speech in my car during lunch breaks like a complete idiot. But when Lisa sat me down that Tuesday night, her face all serious and uncomfortable, talking about needing space to grow as individuals and finding ourselves, I just nodded calmly. Take all the time you need, I said. Watching her fidget nervously with that silver bracelet I bought her last Christmas. She looked genuinely confused by how calm I was staying. Probably expected me to egg cry, make some desperate emotional speech about our four years together and all our future plans. Instead, I helped her pack her overnight bag, even folded her clothes neatly. The whole time she kept glancing at me like she was waiting for me to break down. The next morning, first thing, I walked straight into the jewelry store downtown and returned the ring, $2,000 back in my account just like that. The jeweler looked sympathetic but didn't ask questions. Then I did something completely insane. I bought a one way ticket to Tokyo, leaving in 10 days. I'd always dreamed of teaching English in Japan since college, but Lisa absolutely hated the idea whenever I brought it up, called it running away from real adult responsibility and said I was being childish and unrealistic. We had our whole life mapped out. House in the suburbs, two kids, white picket fence. The worst, two weeks later, I was standing in Shibuya crossing with one suitcase and absolutely terrible Japanese. Found a tiny teaching job at a conversation school in Akihabara, rented a shoebox apartment with paper thin walls, started learning the language from complete scratch using phone apps and YouTube videos for the first time in years. Life felt electric and unpredictable. Every single day was an adventure. Meanwhile, my buddy Jake kept me updated on Lisa's journey of self discovery through social media. She was posting thirst traps daily on Instagram.

So whatever, that, whatever broke something in me. We're both first gen Indian Americans and since we got married last year, we've been having off chicken and rice because the nearest Indian grocery store is two hours away. I didn't realize how much he missed home until I heard his voice crack talking to his friend. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 4:30 this morning while he was still asleep. I grabbed the grocery list. His mom texted me at midnight after I called her crying and I just drove. The GPS said two hours and 12 minutes one way. The store opened at 7. I got there at 6:45 and sat in the parking lot watching the sun come up, trying not to think about how I've never made Riani in my entire life. My hands were shaking when I grabbed my coffee. When the doors finally opened, I walked in and immediately felt lost. The store was huge and everything was labeled in three different languages. I called his mom from aisle three, standing there with my list and she walked me through finding every single ingredient. Basmati, rice, saffron, $40 for a container small Taller than my thumb. He got it. Cardamom pods that I had to count out myself. The spices alone cost me $87. I stood at checkout watching the total climb, $120, $150, $180. The cashier asked if I was cater in an event and I just laughed and said something like that. I loaded everything into the trunk and drove home, checking my phone every five minutes, terrified he'd wake up early and text me asking where I was. I got back at 10:30. I sat in the driveway for three minutes just reading. Then I checked through the bedroom door and he was still asleep. So I hauled six grocery bags into the kitchen as quietly as humanly possible. Every plastic bag sounded like a firecracker. I hid everything in the cabinet we never use, the one above the fridge. Then I called his best friend, Griffin, and begged him to take my husband out of the day. I need at least six hours, I said. Griffin asked why, and I just said, trust me, I'll explain later. He showed up at noon and they left to go to some car show two towns over. The second the door closed, I pulled out every pot we own.

The judge nodded. When the video started, the entire courtroom froze in silence. The envelope arrived by courier. Divorce papers. My husband Rick was suing me for being a failed mother and wife. He demanded full custody of our daughter Zariah, the house and all assets. Claimed I was emotionally unstable and financially irresponsible. I stared in disbelief. I'd given up my career to raise Zariah. Seven years of making his breakfast, pressing his shirts, keeping the house spotless and perfect. When Rick came home that evening, I confronted him with shaking hands. What does this mean? He looked at me with cold disgust. You failed as a wife and mother. Zariah needs someone competent. I hired attorney Seth, the only lawyer I could afford. He reviewed Rick's evidence carefully, with growing concern. Turn photos of our messy house. Credit card statements showing luxury purchases I never made. Testimony from Doctor Valencia, a court appointed parenting evaluator, claiming I was emotionally volatile. These photos were taken when I had a fever for three days. I protested. Rick took them on purpose. And these purchases? I never bought those. Rick used the card, but it was my word against physical evidence. I checked our joint account balance. Zero dollars. Rick had withdrawn everything. Over six months at home, Rick played perfect father. Expense of gifts for Zariah, Amusement, park trips, whispers that made her look at me with confusion. One night, I noticed Zariah slept with her old, broken tablet hidden under her pillow. Not the new one Rick bought, the act one. I didn't understand why. The trial was devastating. Rick's lawyer showed the messy photos. The credit card bills made me look lazy and wasteful. Then Doctor Valencia testified. Beautiful, elegant, professional. She claimed she'd evaluated my parenting and concluded I was emotionally unstable. When I testified, they showed a photo of me screaming, crying hysterically. I tried explaining Rick had provoked me, insulted me, then photographed my breakdown. I sounded exactly like the unstable woman they described. I'd lost. I could see it on the judge's face. As the judge prepared to read his final verdict, the courtroom door opened. Zariah stood there in her school uniform. Zariah! Rick's face went pale. Get out! Zariah walked straight to the judge with determination. Your honor, can I show you something my mommy doesn't know about? Jumped up. This is inappropriate. Sit down, Mister Carson. The judge looked at Zariah gently. What do you want to show me, sweetheart? Zariah held up her old cracked tablet. There's a video. I recorded it when daddy didn't know the

Hope you understand. So I sued them and destroyed everything they built. My parents sat me down after birthday dinner. Mom had made lasagna. She only cooked elaborate meals when softening. Bad news about your trust fund? Dad said, we need to talk about your expectations. My grandfather had set up trust funds for all three grandkids. Thousand dollars each in 1998. Grown for 18 years. I planned my college strategy around it. Your sisters both got married recently, mom said. Beautiful weddings, very expensive. We had to make difficult financial decisions. My hands went cold. How much is left? Dad slid me a statement. $8,472 out of what should have been one hundred forty two thousand dollars. They burned through 95% for my sister's Instagram weddings and condo down payments. Family means making sacrifices, mom said. When you get married someday, they'll return the favor. Did they know? I asked. Did Victoria and Ashley know you were spending my trust fund? The pause told me everything they knew. My sisters knew they were spending my future on wedding flowers. I went to my room and started planning. Not revenge planning. Like it was an engineering problem. I researched trust law that night. Trustees have fiduciary duties. They can't spend education funds on weddings. That's legally actionable breach. Sunday morning, while they were at church, I raided Dad's office on the Trust documents. Funds to be used exclusively for post secondary education expenses. Not weddings. Education. I photographed everything. Bank statements showing massive withdrawals during both weddings. Built a timeline, cross referencing their wedding dates. Monday, I called law firms, met with Eric, a trust litigation specialist. He reviewed my evidence. This is actionable. You can sue for the full amount plus damages. What about my sisters? If we prove they knew it violated trust terms, they're liable too. Include them. That's scorched earth. Good. Two weeks later, Eric filed. My parents and sisters were served. My phone exploded. Dad, you owe this family loyalty. Drop the lawsuit, Victoria. You're suing me over a wedding? I didn't respond. Communication went through attorneys only. Discovery was devastating. The text messages came out. Victoria to mom, can we use Finn's fund? He's only 15. He won't even know. Ashley, can we use Finn's trust for the 20 thousand dollar down payment? I'll pay back eventually. Time stamped, proving they specifically targeted my fund. At depositions, mom admitted she knew the trust spec by education only asked why she violated those terms. I didn't think Finn would mind. She spent $134,000 and didn't think I'd mind? Victoria claimed she didn't know where the money came from. Eric showed her the texts. She went pale. Ashley said the money was family assets and Grandpa would have wanted us to support each other. Eric asked for evidence. She had none. Their lawyer pushed for settlement. We Pay $134,000 over five years. If I dropped my sisters. No. We go to trial. Trial started March 12. Eric showed the documents. Withdrawals, timeline, texts. Methodical and devastating. My parents attorney argued post secondary education could include family support. Judge Harrison interrupted. Are you arguing a wedding is post secondary education? He backtracked immediately. My parents tried playing victim. Eric questioned them with their financial records.

Zariah walked straight to the judge with determination. Your honor, can I show you something my mommy doesn't know about? Rick jumped up. This is inappropriate. Sit down, Mister Carson. The judge looked at Zariah gently. What do you want to show me, sweetheart? Zariah held up her old cracked tablet. There's a video. I recorded it when daddy didn't know. The clerk connected it to the courtroom monitor. Zariah pressed play. The video showed our living room from behind a plant. Rick and Doctor Valencia entered. He wrapped his arms around her, kissing her neck. The courtroom gasped. Their voices Came through clearly. Valencia, are you sure you're.

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time? I belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background. At first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, thing I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead, grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. He never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much, she asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your Price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected and desperate to adopt, but no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. Mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans, hired expensive lawyers claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder through Nathan. The final blow came when they Offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy. She was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was giving.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

She went silent when she found out why everything she owned smelled like chemicals. Mia cornered me in the kitchen Tuesday morning, holding one of her sweaters at arm's length. This freaks. What did you do to it? I didn't borrow it. I barely leave my room. Stop lying. Everything I own smells like a lab explosion. She threw the sweater at me. Touch my stuff again and you're out. I work night shifts at the hospital as a lab tech. When I'm home, I'm sleeping. I don't have time to steal clothes. But she wouldn't listen. You're the only one who could have done this. Casey doesn't touch my things. Casey's our third roommate. She was sitting at the table eating cereal, watching the whole thing. I picked up the sweater and smelled it. It smelled clean, like really clean. The kind of clean that costs money. I seriously have no idea what you're talking about. Then why does every single thing in my closet smell like this? Mia grabbed the sweater back. My jeans, my shirts, even my towels. You're using some weird chemical on them. I don't even do my laundry here. I drop it off at the wash and fold, right? Sure. She stormed back to her room and slammed the door. Three days later, she installed a lock on her bedroom door, a real dead bolt. Then she posted in our apartment group chat that I was Stealing her clothes and ruining them with chemicals. Casey responded immediately with a shocked emoji. That's so messed up. My other roommate, Brandon, just replied, yikes. Nobody asked for my side. That weekend, Casey stopped talking to me. We leave rooms. When I entered, Brandon started locking his door, too. Mia told our landlord I was damaging her property. He sent me an email asking if we needed to have a formal meeting about respecting boundaries. I was being painted as some kind of creep who snuck into rooms and contaminated people's belongings. That's when I actually started paying attention to the apartment. The bottle of fabric softener I bought last month was half empty. The expensive hospital grade kind I get from work, $40 a bottle because it's hypoallergenic and removes biological contaminants. I'm the only one who does laundry at 2:00am after my shifts. The building's laundry room is empty. At that hour, it's the only time I can go. But that bottle was definitely half empty. Now I checked my detergent too. All.

Nothing but an annoyance to talk to? And no, I won't tell anyone privately about this. Because what if someone starts talking to me out of pity? Because they feel obligated to?

My ex boyfriend, Jake, and I broke up two years ago, but we stayed friends. He was dating this girl, Emma, who seemed nice enough, and when their wedding invitation came in the mail, I honestly felt happy for them. The invitation said cocktail attire, and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream colored with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning, I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The. The moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me, and this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic, but figured maybe I was just imagining things. Then Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm, and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant, and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress wedding. Oh, no. I Tried to explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer, but she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me. I expected him to be angry or embarrassed. Instead, he started laughing. Not mean laughing, but genuine can't help it laughing. He said, mom

The lawyers always like, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, don't make me work. They put the cuss on him. The Marshall does walk him back to the Marshall hold over, go inside. He sits down like guys are sitting there staring at you. Everybody that walked in after sentencing like what you get? And he goes, uh, he goes 300 months. They're like 300 months? He's like, yeah, I expected 15 years so you know, I'm okay with it. So I mean, I know I was gonna do 15 and they're like, no bro, 300 months they go, that's not 15 years that would be 180 months. 300 months is 25 years. He goes, no, he goes, it's not 25 years.

Al escuchar su descubrimiento, todos se emocionaron y la maestra capturó rápidamente la escena que jella había visto. Sin embargo, por la tecnología poco desarrollada a inicios del siglo 20, las fotos salieron borrosas, así que la maestra karen al final concluyó que solo era una gran erupción volcánica en marte. Jella también pensó que podía ser así, pero la serie de eventos que siguió destrozó por completo su percepción inicial. Esa noche, una luz azul se encendió afuera de su casa, seguida de un fuerte temblor. Jella y su esposo galen corrieron rápidamente hacia afuera, solo para ver una estela de nube en el cielo, dejando claro que algo había caído desde gran altura. Al amanecer del día siguiente, jella, su esposo y karen siguieron la dirección de la nube. Entraron a un bosque donde una gran zona de árboles estaba quemada en el centro del claro carbonizado y hacía un meteorito gigante, diferente a cualquier meteorito común. Este era enorme y vibraba de manera periódica. La escena extraña puso a todos incómodos y galen sugirió evitaran actuar sin pensar mientras él buscaba a las autoridades. Sin embargo, ya que toda comunicación había estado cortada desde la noche anterior, solo pudo irse caminando. Poco después, galen logró encontrar gente del departamento de seguridad nacional y los llevó De regreso, todos acordaron excavar la tierra alrededor del meteorito. Primero, inesperadamente, cuando apenas habían cavado la mitad, una grieta apareció de repente en la superficie del meteorito, acompañada de un sonido mecánico parecido a engranajes desde dentro, como si algo estuviera a punto de salir

Antes de que el hombre pudiera reaccionar, uno de ellos le agarró el brazo con fuerza. Al ver eso, la mujer lo pateó con todas sus fuerzas, lanzándolo por el acantilado. Pero en ese instante miles de monstruos más se abalanzaron sobre ellos. El auto empezaba a ceder bajo el peso y estaba por caer. El hombre le entregó una caja de madera a la mujer, diciéndole que la usara para trabar el acelerador del auto. El vehículo empezó a subir por el acantilado de forma automática, pero antes de que pudieran respirar tranquilos, los monstruos atacaron de nuevo. El hombre tomó un gran machete y lo blandió con fuerza, luchando contra las criaturas. Si los monstruos lograban subir, quedarían atrapados allí. La mujer tampoco mostró miedo. Agarró un hacha y comenzó a cortar a los monstruos. Juntos lograron lanzar a todos por el acantilado, pero antes de que pudieran recuperarse del susto, otro monstruo se abalanzó de repente. Por suerte, el hombre alcanzó a sujetarse del barandal, aunque las criaturas seguían llegando en oleadas. Entonces el hombre tomó una decisión valiente, sacó un cuchillo pequeño y lo clavó profundamente en el tanque de gasolina. El combustible empezó a fluir hacia los monstruos. Sin dudar ni un segundo, el hombre subió al auto, abrió una bomba incendiaria y la lanzó hacia abajo. Las llamas provocaron una reacción en cadena y los monstruos pronto fueron reducidos a cenizas. Pero cuando el fuego alcanzó el tanque de Gasolina, este explotó lanzando a las criaturas por los aires. Por suerte, los 2 esquivaron la explosión con movimientos ágiles, eliminando por completo el peligro.

So I walk in there looking like out mess and I tried to pull out 50 grand. One of the managers of the bank comes up to me and he says, it's a lot of money right now. Give me like an hour.

Gunshots thundered before anyone understood what happened. The security guards collapsed where they stood. Police sirens filled the air as officers rushed to the scene. But not a single witness could point out where the shooter was hiding. Detective Mike stepped in. Studying the entry angles and the bullet trajectories, he quickly triangulated the sniper's nest. He LED the team to the rooftop of a nearby building, the only place high enough and clear enough for someone to pull off shots that precise. This wasn't the work of an amateur. Whoever fired those rounds was a trained marksman. Yet the investigation hit a wall. There was no link at all among the three victims. No shared workplace, no overlapping past, not even a mutual acquaintance. Just when the city thought the nightmare was over, the killer struck again. This time inside a quiet suburban community. Witnesses reported a black SUV fleeing the scene moments after the gunfire. And surveillance footage revealed something even more alarming. Every victim dropped at the exact same second. That meant only one thing. Two shooters. The FBI issued an immediate warrant for the SUV. Patrol officers spotted the vehicle soon after and attempted a traffic stop. But the driver stepped out and executed him on the spot. The killer sped off, disappearing into the dark. But his partner wasn't so lucky. He was left behind, abandoned like dead weight.

Then I went for a dunk and the referee blew his whistle again. He that he had never seen that style of dunk before. It was then that I realized how serious the situation was. Every move I made was being called a foul. As the star of the team and being black, I had clearly become the target. 20 minutes passed and our team hadn't scored a single point. Then something really pissed me off. The opponent shoved me to the ground, but the referee acted like he hadn't seen it. I tried to keep my patience, but my explosive tempered coach couldn't take it anymore, yelled at the referee, saying it was unfair. The referee refused to admit his mistake and even gave my coach a warning. In the end, the team owner stepped in and took the coach aside. If they had kept arguing, things could have gotten much worse. This just wasn't working. The coach decided to bench me, and we were going to wait for the right moment to change things.

They couldn't be separated, not even in their dreams. So every time she fell in love, her sister would secretly sabotage everything. She would steal her boyfriend's watch and jewelry, always at the worst possible moment, the most uncomfortable part. Her boyfriends often couldn't control themselves. And her sister, she always found a way to strike just when things seemed perfect. But there was a fatal flaw between them. Every meal had to be shared once. And her boyfriend offered her a steak. She refused, saying she was on a diet. He quickly handed it over to her sister, who swallowed the whole thing under the table. Through their intertwined braids, the bite traveled straight into her own body. She burped awkwardly, not even pretending to care about wasting food. Her boyfriend, confused, then handed her sister all the leftovers. She devoured happily. The sad truth, all that food ended up in her stomach while she was still dieting. Her boyfriend watched in disbelief and her sister, smiling mischievously, would always swipe his jewelry whenever he wasn't looking. It would then travel from one braid to the other right into her mouth. She was horrified, but her sister never seemed to tire of these tricks. While shopping with her boyfriend, her sister suddenly became interested in the jewelry. In a store, she had to yank their braids, pulling her out of the shop. What? Hurt the most, though, was the growing suspicion that her sister and boyfriend were plotting behind her back. The thing that happened in the fitting room confirmed her worst fears. In a fit of rage, she grabbed her boyfriend's clothes, yawned loudly and cut the braid that had bound them together. She escaped the farce only to find her ex, Leander, laughing behind the curtains. It didn't matter. She and her sister could always braid their hair again. And now it was time to start looking for the next one.

It thrashed, suffocating, then went still. But five minutes later, it twitched back to life. The liquid wasn't poison at all. It was the scientist's newest breakthrough. A substance so oxygen rich it could keep living creatures alive without air. After the mouse survived, they moved to human testing. They filled a man's breathing mask with the liquid, even knowing it was safe. The sensation of drowning sent him into a panic. He clawed at the mask until the team held him down. But slowly his body adapted, and he breathed the liquid as if it were air. His name was Bud. Later suited up, Bud dropped into the ocean. To ending thousands of meters. The deeper he went, the heavier the pressure crushed him. Lights shattered. Pain squeezed through his chest like a fist, closing around his organs. 16,000 feet down, he shattered the world record. The team begged him to return, but his oxygen reserves were nearly gone. But whispered a final goodbye, accepting he wouldn't make it back. Then light. Something glowed in the abyss. At first, he thought it was a jellyfish. But as it drifted closer, he realized it wasn't from earth at all. An alien. It reached out, took Bud's hand, and guided him deeper, until an enormous ship emerged from the darkness. An alien craft resting on the seafloor. The sight broke everything he thought he understood about the ocean. Inside the Creature pulled the seawater off him like dust, restoring oxygen to his lungs. Then it projected a video. Centuries of human wars, nuclear tests, oceans burning, forests erased. A planet ruined by its own inhabitant. And the aliens had made their choice. They would trigger massive tsunamis across the globe and wipe humanity out completely.

His car had veered off the road and crashed into some kind of obstacle, leaving him disoriented and with no clear idea of what had happened. It felt as though he had collided with a motorcycle, but the details were hazy, like fragments of a dream. Then, out of nowhere, he heard a voice cut through the silence. Turning, he saw a strange man approaching from the side of the road. Jack slowly processed the situation, piecing together his thoughts, and after a moment it hit him. This was real. But as he stared at the man, standing completely unharmed, without a scratch or sign of injury, Jack felt a wave of relief wash over him. For a brief moment, he thought that maybe, just maybe, he wouldn't have to pay for the damages. But the man didn't seem to be focused on the crash itself. Instead, he asked Jack if he remembered the exact moment of the impact. Jack paused for a second, then replied, saying that the only thing he could recall was instinctively ducking his head in an attempt to protect himself. But what really threw him off was when the man calmly said that both of them were already dead, and that all that was left of them were their spirits. Jack was in complete disbelief. He couldn't process what the man was saying. Everything he knew about life had just Been turned upside down. Jack quickly rushed over to his car and checked again. The man was still standing, unshaken and eerily calm, and he seemed to be trying to help Jack calm down. But Jack wasn't having it. He still firmly believed that he was alive, that his life wasn't over, that he still had years and years ahead. He refused to entertain any idea that they were both dead. The man repeated his claim that they were no longer alive, but Jack still couldn't accept it. Then, in an instant, man pulled Jack's lifeless body from the car. Seeing this completely shattered Jack. It was as though his entire reality was crumbling before him. How could this be happening? Was it some sort of twisted nightmare? Jack, in a daze, thought he had found a way out. He dashed toward the front of the car, desperate to stop it, but to his shock, the driver didn't even attempt to call the police. Jack was overwhelmed with confusion. He didn't know what to do or where to go. Before he could even react, the man returned to the car, casually grabbed Jack's body, and without hesitation started walking away. The man seemed utterly indifferent to the death it just occurred, calmly leaving the scene as if it were an everyday occurrence for him. Jack stood there feeling more lost than ever, his mind racing with questions. But the answer to the most important one eluded him. What in the World was happening

He starts by taping his flops tightly to his, then hides a wooden tag Mark 21 behind his back. But the moment he steps outside, the female guard notices what he's up. She rushes toward him to stop the escape, but the boy never slows down. He reaches the fence and climbs at full speeds, scaling it in seconds and disappearing into the wood. He runs like his life depends on. At the first turn, he finds a wooden marker, then a second, then a third. Clearly, he's been through this route before. But when he climbs over the barrier that cleared the way for him last time, a guard grabs him once again. Looking down at the markers, 19:20, the boy suddenly tosses aside the 21 tag and dives straight into the ring. The guard can't react in time, and this time the boy truly escapes. Later that night, he heats a plastic bottle cap with a lighter, softening it before jamming it into the lock. After a few attempts, he manages to get the security lock open. Next, he hot wires a scooter and claims it as his ride. With his stolen wheels, he heads for a mall that's moments close. Seeing no one around, he's slipped inside a display tent nearby and zips it shut. Soon, the mall closes and the light fade out. Inside the tent, the boy pulls out a Sandwich and an apple, tonight's dinner. After resting, he steps back out. The entire mall is now deserted. Careful as ever, he even puts on a helmet so the cameras won't catch his face. All this effort just to steal a space heater. But as he gets the heater pack and is ready to leave, he spots an electric razor on a nearby shell. He touches the faint stubble on his chin, picks up the razor, tests it. Realizing he could really use it. He tries cutting the security cable with a knife, but that sets off the store alarm. Even though he sprints out of them all and hot wires, the scooter security is already rushing out after him.

And to her astonishment, it handed her diamonds to eat. But that was just the beginning. The creature began producing diamonds nonstop, pouring them out endlessly like a living treasure vault. Wow! You really think you can shop with me? This type of being existed in massive numbers across this mysterious planet. And the adorable creature she held. It was none other than the beloved pet of Princess Mia. Every morning, the princess awoke and washed her face with these enormous pearls. Thanks to their enchanted nutrients, she maintained an eternal youth untouched by time. These magical pearls had given rise to an elite group of people, pale skinned and breathtakingly beautiful, known as the Pearl folk. Their daily duty was to collect pearls and transport them carefully out of the royal palace, pouring each glittering gem into a massive reservoir. Once the pearls accumulated in sufficient numbers, the king and queen would rise to the surface to select the most powerful pearl of all. The celestial king's pearl. The king would then entrust this incredibly potent pearl to one of his subordinates, with strict orders to deliver it safely to the princess. And then the princess would summon her magical pet, placing the pearl directly before it to consume. In an instant, the pearls erupted from within the creature, spilling out in a dazzling cascade, a shower of brilliance that lit up the entire palace like a constellation. Come To life

A corpse in the coffin just sat up straight on its own. That sight scared me out of my wits. I instinctively glanced over at grandma, but she just told me to stay calm with a calm look on her face. Right after that, the corpse started walking slowly toward me. It wasn't until then that I realized already become a ghost. He begged me to pass a message to his wife. Live well like you used to and make wishes under the stars. Don't let my departure turn into your loneliness. How will she know this is from you, I asked. Tell her, remember to have a glass of champagne every Friday night. That's our promise. I relayed every word to his wife. When she heard that champagne promise, she broke down crying instantly. But at that moment, she no longer felt lonely. Even though he was gone, he was still with her in another way, just in a different world. I didn't get why I had to go through all this, but grandma just smiled and shook her head. Maybe this was the price of growing up. Time flew by and before I knew it, I walked into my own marriage. During our first wedding dance, strange symbols suddenly appeared on the window. My husband noticed I was acting weird. Don't tell me you're seeing something again. No, no. Come on. It's nothing at all. I didn't want anything to ruin our wedding, but That very night, another ghost came to find me. Even though I'd seen so many weird things, this one still gave me a shock. But he wasn't hostile. Instead, he was full of confusion. I had to be patient and comfort him. All he could remember was his name, Paul, and that he was a soldier who'd fought overseas. His wife was pregnant at the time. The only thing he cared about was getting home. Please help me. They said you could do it. Who told you that? I don't know. I just have to get home. Before I could ask more questions, he vanished into thin air. I had no choice but to dig for clues on my own. I went to the Veterans Affairs office. Staff found an old address under the name Paul. I drove there. Right away, the compass I carried pointed straight at a man. He was Paul's son, born after Paul went missing in the war. Everything he knew about his dad came from his mom. She told him his father was a hero who died in battle. I wanted to tell him the truth. But when I saw his pregnant wife, I held back cause I knew when ghosts show up, something big is always about to happen in the family. But Paul obviously thought his wife had called him back. I knew I had to clear this up with him. Later, I ran into him again on the street. We went to The cemetery together. When he saw his own name on the Tombstone, he finally accepted that he'd been dead for more than 30 years. His wife had passed away not long ago. He'd missed everything without even knowing. He didn't want to miss any more of his son's life, so he begged me to tell his son the truth. That night, I went to the man's house. I told him everything, but he lost his temper completely. He yelled at me and accused me of making up lies. Get out of my house. I showed him the compass and told him where Paul had died, but he didn't believe me at all and kicked me out. To my surprise, he showed up at my door the next night. It turned out he'd followed the clues and really found Paul's remains. Now he asked eagerly, can you really talk to my dad? Right at that moment, Paul appeared. Ask him if he still has the last letter I sent to his mom. I passed on the words. The man's doubts finally crumbled. 30 years of confusion, grief and longing poured out all at once. Father and son finally had a real conversation, one that was decades late. She never forgot about you. Every night she'd tell me stories about you. She kept you alive in my heart, but it also made me miss you more. I mean, did you get to see me grow up? I relayed the boy's words and Paul choked up. I was lost before, but now I can see you. The boy said he wanted to go back to the place where his dad had served, but Paul stopped him. His, his pregnant wife needed him more right now. Before leaving, Paul walked with his son all night long. At that moment, the boy finally felt his father's presence for real. At the funeral, Paul looked at the little family his son had built. He had no more regrets. A white light appeared in front of him. His wife was waiting there. I couldn't see her, but I could see the peace on Paul's face. And right then and there, I finally understood why I was given this gift.

She feigned slumber, then sneakily taped her last goodbye. Day in and day out, she dragged her weary body to petal pizzas just to scrape together extra cash for her folks. That day, a guy placed an order for 1,000 pies. She could barely contain her joy. A high roller. But then a black sedan screeched to a halt. Masked thugs jumped out, guns locked on the man. She yanked him down to duck for cover, but Tara knocked her out cold. The man rushed her to the hospital and vanished without a trace. He'd been shot, too. After all, doctors broke the news her heart condition had taken a catastrophic turn. She had at most three days left to live. She froze, not scared of dying, but terrified. Her parents couldn't cope with the loss. She called her best friend, then snuck out of the hospital. At home, she smiled and told her folks she'd landed a huge sale. Back in her room, she recorded a brand new final message. The next day, her dad pushed open her door like always. Spotting her swollen hands, he thought she was gone. Panic set in. He called her name, careful not to yell too loud. She rolled over and he let out a shaky breath. Under the covers, she sobbed quietly. He headed to work at a millionaire's mansion, unaware the family's grandson was the man. His daughter saved the day. Before the boss, grateful for his years of loyal service, signed a heart donation contract stating his heart would go to the boss's daughter after he passed. The dad came home in tears, overjoyed with the news, never noticing his daughter had grabbed her pizza basket and headed out again. Once more, a security guard tried to boot her out, shut down her stand. Then the man from yesterday showed up. He cleared a path and chewed out the guard. She recognized him, but his sudden disappearance the day before left her bitter. What she didn't know. After tending to his wounds, he'd gone back to the hospital, only to miss her by minutes. He brushed off her cold shoulder and asked her to be his dance partner at a charity gala. She hesitated, full of doubt, but the wealthy guy pulled her along anyway. He took her to an upscale venue. Her plain clothes made her stick out like a sore thumb. Self doubt flooded her. She tried to bolt, but he held her back and staff styled her up. In no time, the pizza girl, worn out from endless workdays, transformed into a total socialite. She stepped into the ballroom. Every eye turned to her. The crowd of elites made her nervous, but his attentive care gave her a glimmer of comfort. She knew he was rich, but not how powerful he truly was. The event focused on helping underprivileged kids. When the children walked in, her fear Melted away. For the first time in ages, warmth filled her chest. After the gala, he draped his coat over her shoulders. They danced beneath the moonlight. Her heartbeat mingled with the night wind. She knew she had three days max. Goodbyes. She deliberately brushed him off. She kept the necklace he gave her. Silently took off his coat and slipped away once more. A few steps later, she collapsed from exhaustion. At the hospital, she had no pulse. Doctors called it quits, turned to leave, crushed. In that split second, her heart monitor flickered back to life. Her parents arrived. Seeing her on life support, doctors warned, no matching heart in two days. There be no saving her. Her dad's pain was unbearable. Then he remembered the boss's signed agreement. The next morning, he glanced at his sleeping daughter and smiled softly. He headed to the boss's garage. He tampered with the car's brakes, hoping for a perfect accident. Then suddenly, he ran into the wealthy guy. Panic showed on his face. But years of loyalty had earned him trust. The crash happened just as planned. The wealthy guy raced to the hospital. The boss lay cold and lifeless. Her surgery got underway, and it was a success. She survived. Her dad was badly hurt, but alive. The family was finally reunited. Tears and laughter mixed together. Meanwhile, he lost his only family. He buried his grandma alone, then isolated himself in the mountains. He swung his axe, chopping Wood letting his anger roar through the sky. One day, his men told him his grandma's death wasn't an accident. The killer was the family chauffeur. His empty eyes turned icy cold. Once she recovered, she decided to apologize to him for bailing on him so suddenly. But at his company door, she. He got stopped. She had no idea her dad was inside, confessing his crime, begging the man to spare his daughter. Finally, he put it all together. The girl who'd saved his life was the daughter of the man who'd taken his family. He didn't pull the trigger. He let her go. She thought she'd been rejected. Crying as she walked away, he watched her retreating figure torn apart inside.

Standing in that crowd, drowning in grief and anger, couldn't stomach another second of his smug grin, my rage exploded. I lunged straight at him, ready to end the monster myself. Cops tried to hold me back, but fury made me stronger than all of them. I was just inches away from tearing him apart when a stun gun cracked against my body, dropping me to the floor like a discarded rag. The murderer sauntered over, smirking, muttering taunts in Korean, mocking me, mocking my mother, mocking the justice I'd never receive. Watching from the side, John froze. He recognized the look in my eyes, the same hollow agony he once carried after losing someone he loved. In a country where the death penalty doesn't exist, even the most vicious criminals slip through loopholes and walk free, leaving family shattered with no way to fight back. John refused to accept that. For 20 years, he built something in the shadows, a covert operation designed to hunt down the Untouchables. He called it Revenge Taxi. His crew was small but lethal. Lisa, a cyber wizard who could break into anything. Mark and Jim, mechanical geniuses able to turn any vehicle into a weapon. And John himself, the architect of the whole mission. They had everything except a driver who could actually outrun death. After watching me fight earlier, John. Dug into my background, turned out I was a former Special Forces soldier, exactly the kind of controlled chaos his team needed. So he came to me that night, handed me a taxi license and offered me a place in his underground crusade and invitation to deliver the justice the courts refused to. Burning with helpless rage over my mother's murder, I accepted without hesitation. My first target, a convicted rapist who should have spent the rest of his life behind bars but walked free.

So this time the courier left the food by the doorstep and pointed toward the house with an oddly respectful gesture. With the meal right in front of him, he still had to stretch forward with an exaggerated step just to reach it. The distance was too wide, forcing him to crawl slowly toward the bag. Without noticing, his foot slid past the boundary. Realizing it, he jolted upright and retreated into the yard like someone startled awake. He was serving a 14 month house arrest sentence. An electronic anklet clung to his leg. One step outside the permitted zone would trigger an alarm and send him straight back to prison. But that night, the device suddenly went silent. The police soon called, informing him the blizzard had wiped out the monitoring network. The ankle tracker would be down until 7 in the morning when officers would return to check. The moment he heard this, exhilaration rushed through him. He jumped into his luxury car and tore down the highway, savoring this rare fragment of freedom. But the storm reduced visibility to a blur. A single glance over his shoulder caused his car to slam into a shadowy figure. He stepped out and nudged the body with his boot, but there was no response. Just then, headlights grew behind him. He shoved the body into the trunk and slipped back into the driver's seat, acting as if Nothing had happened. After the car passed, he called his friend saying he was on his way at the house. He recounted the accident in detail, begging his friend to help hide the body. Reluctant but loyal, the friend agreed. Together, they dragged the corpse to a massive tree and stuffed it into a hollow beneath the roots. On the way back inside, he told his friend he was heading home to rest. But just as he turned violent, pounding exploded at the front door. His friend panicked and pulled a pistol from a drawer. With every road buried under snow, any visitor at this hour could only mean trouble. Yet when they opened the door, someone collapsed across the threshold. They froze. The figure lying there was the very corpse they had hidden in the tree hollow moments ago.

A police officer appeared and they pressed against the walls, hearts racing, hiding behind him in the suffocating space. But he laughed, holstered his gun and revealed himself as an accomplice, eyes glinting with cruel amusement. He chose one of the women and stepped into the container, leaving the other trembling in the dim interior. Three minutes later he emerged, a satisfied smirk on his face, leaving both women crying and broken inside. Soon a man wearing a grotesque pig mask arrived, selecting another girl. As the container doors creaked open again, the chosen woman sat slumped on the floor, a mask covering her tear streaked face. Silently shaking from the torment endured inside, the two women grew stronger, courage rising from shared suffering and fear. Several kidnappers went out searching for new victims, leaving only one guard behind. One of the women crept toward him, movements deliberate and silent, then struck him unconscious and grabbed the key to their chains. The corrupt officer returned and froze at the fallen guard. Seizing the moment, the women climbed into the patrol car, engines roaring, and sped down the empty road. They exchanged a fierce, determined glance, silently vowing to make their tormentors pay. They stopped at a supermarket, bought weapons and asked the terrified owner for gasoline. Eyes wide with fear, prepared for a brutal, blood soaked retaliation, they steeled themselves for the reckoning about to unfold.

He smeared butter on every step to make sure each one was slick. Next, he baked a batch of ultra spicy cookies using hot sauce and stacked them neatly. Then he poured cold water at the front door, letting it freeze into a solid sheet of ice. Not stopping there, he used a hose to spray water onto the icicles hanging from the eaves, making them thick and sturdy. Everything was set. Soon, two bumbling burglars arrived at his house, and their car slid on the ice, crashing into a street lamp. Despite the crash, they didn't give up. Disguised as Santa Claus, they tried to sneak inside, but things weren't going well. They awkwardly started running in place on the ice, slipping and sliding. The boy waiting nearby turned on his headlights. A sudden light terrified the burglars, causing them to immediately raise their hands and surrender. Once the light went off, they continued their advance, only to face the same outcome again and again, about 100 times. Finally, one of the men reached the door and saw a stack of cookies and a glass of milk, along with a note that read for Santa. He thought, this must be for me. Eagerly, he grabbed a cookie and took a bite. Instantly, the spice hit him, setting his throat on fire. Desperate, he drank the nearby milk, only to realize it had been tampered with. With no other choice, He shoved his head into the snowdrift to cool down. The man eventually managed to sneak inside, but as soon as he entered, an alarm went off. He rushed to turn it off, only to find a nail placed on the button. At that moment, the boy appeared, weapon in hand, knocking the intruder unconscious. Without wasting any time, the boy put a VR headset on the man. When the man regained consciousness, he found himself standing at the edge of a sheer cliff, his heart racing.

The giant took the drink and left. The girl crawled out of the cucumber, all dirty and covered in MUD. The man grabbed her in his hand, washed her with water, then dried her by the fireplace. The next day, the Giants came to the man's house. He gave them the girl's blanket to smell and they started searching for her. The girl ran everywhere, almost getting caught by the giant. The man tried to hide her in a bag, but the giant grabbed the bag. The man hit him with a torch and lifted a bucket of water, the one thing the Giants feared most. In the end, the giant got scared and ran away. The man then made a terrifying dream about the giant and threw this dream at the Queen. The Queen woke up instantly, dreaming that the giants were eating children. She sent out many helicopters and they captured the giants in nets.

I never understood why until Charlie noticed her face was covered in pimples. She erased a blemish with her finger and pressed down on one of the bumps, and to my shock, all those imperfections sank into her skin, then traveled down the braid and transferred directly onto my face. I was horrified. Meanwhile, Charlie pulled back the covers in surprise, only to reveal that my sister's thighs were covered in fat and her feet were full of fungal nails. My sister was mortified. She pressed her hands against her thighs and pushed hard, causing the fat to slide right up to her belly. Then she yanked her belt tightly, and the extra fat traveled up our connected braids straight to my belly and thighs. I stared in terror as it happened. Next, she pressed five fungal nails inward, one by one, and each sprouted from my own toes. That's when I couldn't hold back a scream. I quickly realized the problem was our connected hair. I grabbed a pair of Scissors and tried to cut the braid, but the Scissors broke instead. I didn't panic. I grabbed a lighter and set the braid on fire. Flames shot up two meters high, setting off the smoke alarm, and water rained down from the sprinklers, but it didn't help. When no one was looking, I rushed outside and tried to smash the grate in the door. Tears streamed Down my face. Then I spotted a fire extinguisher and a plan came to mind. I ran back inside and saw my sister's angry face. Without hesitation, I sprayed her entirely with the extinguisher, freezing her in place. Next, I aimed at the connected part of our braids, frowned as it solidified, and smashed it apart. All the fat and pimples that had unfairly landed on me vanished, and I was finally free. I no longer had to be anyone else.

My boyfriend stared at us shocked, while my sister smirked mischievously. Then, while he wasn't looking, she quietly swiped the jewelry he was wearing and transferred it through our braids right into my mouth. I was horrified, but she never seemed to tire of these games.

No matter how desperately I begged, she remained cold and indifferent, exhausted, yet eerily satisfied. She even brought my husband to my so called funeral. My husband, overwhelmed with grief, wept uncontrollably as he said his final goodbye. He removed our wedding rings, placing them delicately on my Tombstone. Throughout this, my friend played the comforting role, pretending to ease his pain. Back at home, every object reminded him of me, his sorrow only deepening. But thankfully our daughter stayed by his side to comfort him. This, however, interfered with my friend's plan. She tried distracting my daughter with a piece of candy, hoping to keep her occupied. But as soon as my daughter tasted it, she knew something was off. Quietly, she spatted into a flower pot nearby. The plant instantly withered. Fuming with rage, my daughter took my friend's purse, opening it to uncover a shocking truth. My friend had secretly been in love with. My husband raged, she angrily threw a book into the toilet, stabbing at it repeatedly. Then she emptied the contents of my friend's perfume bottle and filled it with toilet cleaner, even adding some stray hair from the bathroom. Still not satisfied, he added dirty water from the toilet brush. Determined to make her suffer, my friend stormed into the bathroom only to find her purse sitting there. Without hesitation, she sprayed the perfume on herself, but the results were instant and horrifying her. Face swelled up, grotesque and unrecognizable. My daughter, hidden in the background, smiled with satisfaction, unaware that her actions would set the stage for something far worse. In the dead of night, my friend crept into my daughter's room, locked the door behind her, and attempted to smother the sleeping child with a pillow, using all her strength to silence her forever.

But to survive, Pat still took a position at the fish cannery. He figured if he worked carefully enough, maybe, just maybe, he could keep all 10 fingers. One busy afternoon, a single drop of water fell from above his right index finger, slipped straight into an empty tin can. Before he even realized what happened, the can holding his finger had already been dumped into a mountain of other cans, loaded onto a truck and shipped off to supermarkets nationwide. Regret crashed over him. Pat wanted that finger back. Every day after work, he would visit supermarkets and shake cans one by one, listening for even the slightest odd noise. He even borrowed cash from his boss just to buy more cans. But the fingertip never surfaced. Death Sprit. Pat drove from town to town, hoping for a miracle. When his first passenger boarded the bus, Pat immediately asked if he'd seen a finger in a can. The passenger said no. Pat kicked him out on the spot. He questioned someone else on the road, but again got nothing. Afterward, he pulled over, rummaging through a roadside trash bin, only broken dolls inside, not a single finger. That night, exhausted, Pat fell asleep in his dream. He prepared to hang himself until a voice called out. He opened his eyes to see a lizard spirit telling him, check the minimart. The next day, while buying a drink at that minimart, He suddenly heard tapping from a corner shelf, the same rhythm he used to knock before dinner. Grabbed the can and shook it hard. The sound grew clearer, undeniable. His severed finger was still tapping, just like always. He spent his last few coins to buy the drink, sprinted home, cracked it open, and there it was floating quietly inside. Hands trembling, he pressed it back onto his hand and unbelievably, the wound healed itself instantly. But the next day at dinner, the finger kept crawling toward his nostrils like it had a mind of its own. Just as he was losing patience, a familiar tapping echoed beside him. His coworker lifted his right hand, and an index finger dangled right in front of his nose. That's my finger, Pat shouted and lunged forward. The two brawled wildly, ripping each other's fingers off in the struggle.

When he got back home, he felt his body swelling with strength, growing so much that his clothes were practically ready to burst. The next morning at school, when a friend asked him to fix her bike, he accidentally crushed the wheel. With nothing but his hands, surge of electricity like energy raced through him. So he spent a fortune having a hammer custom made to mimic Thor's. He tossed it into the air, trying to summon it back like in the legends, but no matter how many attempts he made, the hammer refused to return. After hiking down the mountain to search for it, he found it lying nearly three kilometers away beside a small stream. He carried it to a shop and showed it to the old woman there. She explained that Thor's real hammer was the mightiest weapon of the ancient world, and no ordinary Smith could ever craft such a thing. She told him that a flame had been burning for hundreds of years, never dying out, and that this eternal fire might be the only way to forge a true hammer. Suddenly, the boy noticed a shadowy figure spying on them through the window. The old woman whispered for him to meet her on the mountain at sunrise, and then she vanished without a trace. When he returned home, he realized his brother still Hadn't come back. While searching for him, he stumbled across a strange fire burning deep in the forest. Meanwhile, the old woman confronted the same man who had been watching them earlier. Understanding the threat, she bowed her head, kissed the pendant on her necklace, and in the blink of an eye, transformed into a falcon before soaring into the sky.

She never ate the prison food. She collected food scraps to smear on the walls, using salt from soup to corrode the plaster. Then she dug with a homemade iron spoon. Trapped in a prison surrounded by water on all sides, to avoid detection by guards, she tore pages from books, soaked the paper in water, and covered it with MUD to match the wall's color. She pasted these papers over the hole to buy more digging time. She never went out for recreation and told the guards she preferred reading in herself. Three months later, she dug a tunnel over 500 meters long. On the day the prosecutor came to inspect the prison, she knew this was her chance. The warden arranged a performance to welcome the officials. Since she hadn't been out in so long, her cellmates hadn't seen her either. The guards paid no attention to her movements. She walked back to her cell in full view. The guard delivered her meal as usual, assuming she was reading in her cell. The guard knocked but received no response. He quickly opened the door, only to find the cell completely empty. He rushed over and sounded the alarm. The performance halted to ensure the official safety. The warden personally escorted them out. Upon returning to the cell, the warden angrily berated the guard in charge. Enraged, grabbed a book and hurled it at the wall. The book struck the paper. Covering the tunnel entrance, the warden peeled back the paper and discovered the tunnel. In that instant, he seemed to understand. He immediately ordered someone to crawl inside. After a grueling crawl, he finally reached the tunnel's end. But he found it was a dead end. So how did that woman escape?

Along the way, he saw a cactus And had an idea. He pierced it, letting the milky sap leak out. The warrior noticed the sap and found one of John's discarded sandals, believing John was nearby. But John had already circled around, and he took the warrior down with a single fifth strike. After three days without food, John decided to hunt. He threw his spear and brought down a small deer. But as he rushed to claim his kill, a lion had already beaten him to it. Thirsty, hungry, and exhausted, John knew his fight for survival wasn't over yet.

After a thorough check, she shaved off my black hair and I trembled in fear. She tossed me a white wig and warned me that no trace of black was allowed anywhere in the villa. Despite the strict scrutiny, I had my own agenda. Each today, I pretended to work diligently, but secretly I searched for clues to locate my mysteriously vanished twin sister. A month earlier, my sister had come to the villa for a job interview. After extensive modifications, she was rejected by the mistress simply because of a black mole. Since then, my sister had disappeared without a trace. I later uncovered the mistress's strange preference. She despised all things black, yet craved only black soup. Just as I was about to serve it, the soup vanished. Mistress offered to fetch it herself on the condition that my eyes remained covered. She was extremely cautious, personally guiding me the whole way and forbidding anyone else from approaching while she wasn't looking. Memorized every turn along the path. When we finally arrived, I eagerly removed the blindfold, only to be stunned. My long lost sister lay on the bed. It wasn't the moment for rash action, so I prepared in secret for a week. That night, after the mistress fell asleep, I crept toward the mysterious room. Just as I was about to open the door to rescue my sister, I Overheard voices. It was the mistress. Inside, I saw she had aged terribly overnight. She drank straight from a large tub of black broth and instantly transformed back into a young girl. Even more terrifying, two identical mistresses appeared in the room. Listening to their conversation sent chills down my spine. Their next target was me. The person responsible for turning the maids wasn't the mistress either. I finally understood they drained young girls blood to preserve their youth. Early the next morning, I brought her the black broth. While she lamented her poor complexion, I secretly smeared a streak across her face. She screamed, her face and hands erupting with age spots. The mistress realised I had tampered with it and furiously threw me to the ground. At that moment, the mistress was knocked unconscious. To my surprise, it was the maid, once allied with the mistress who saved me. She suggested we seize the villa together. But my sole goal was to rescue my sister. As I prepared to leave, the maid attacked me from behind. When I woke again, I was lying in a mysterious hut, tubes attached to my body and the nanny was draining my blood. I quickly surveyed the area and grabbed a hose. Then the mistress suddenly tackled the nanny. I seized the moment, escaped and called the police. The villains finally faced justice and I was finally able to rescue my sister.

But instead of gratitude, he was met with arrogance. They started demanding Robert give them free food, refusing to lift a finger to work. When it came time to harvest the sugar cane, Robert was left with no choice but to ask for their help. He promised double pay for their work, but they turned him down immediately, claiming they were now equals and that Robert had no authority over them. They even had the audacity to demand extra food at night, and maybe even some wine. Robert was furious. He had freed them out of pity, hoping they'd work and earn their own way. But they had no intention of ever working again. Frustrated and powerless, Robert walked away. And that's when the mocking began. They called him a white monkey and laughed at him for getting entirely who had given them their freedom. But Robert, despite everything, still held on to hope. The next day, he raised the rent, thinking it would force them to work. But what Robert failed to realize was that they had no intention of paying rent. They tore up his notice without a second thought. And then their leader gathered the group together. He declared they were done living in straw huts. They wanted to move into the warm villa. He told Robert to clear the rooms because they were moving in tonight.

Nobody knows what to do with or wants to deal with. The boss suddenly shift gears tossing out a random question. Hey, you know what school Art Schlichter played for? One inmate shrug, Football's too violent. But the boss insists, come on, you know who I mean. Still nothing. He groans that if he asked these guys to remember what the man's backside like, they'd recall that fast. Even tries asking the so called brain trust of the crew. No luck.

And just like that, the moment in the boss waves them on muttering that they're all useless and it's time to get move.

Dad compliments the performance, but as a lawyer, he warns her that selling anything even vaguely resembling medicine is a legal minefield. She asks if they're the good legal landmines. He says no. She's teaching kids to take a pill every time they feel bad. He asks what happens when a kid downs a handful of his mom's valium, thinking he's eating feel betters. She instantly panics.

He claimed she'd flirted with him over lunch, over conversation, even over casual greetings. Jack was stunned into silence. Before he could Defend himself.

Then she massaged his eyes, the only reason being to test if the old man was truly blind, for his bedroom window had a hole made from the outside.

But whenever the nanny opened the door to check, there was nothing there. In this house, it was just her and the old man.

Every night she feared sleeping, staring at the door and at every sound outside. She grabbed her dagger, opened the door, saw nothing, and slammed it shut, fearing something might enter and harm her. But this time, as she turned around, she suddenly discovered the old man lying in bed, the light from the hole shining directly into his eyes, making him appear horrifying. The nanny trembled with fear, closing her eyes instinctively. When she looked again, the old man was no longer in the bed, and outside the noise resounded once more. She spun around, terrified, but knowing she needed to uncover the truth to sleep peacefully in the future. She lit an oil lamp, grabbed a lantern, and approached the old man's door. With a wet fingertip, she made a small hole in the door, beginning to observe his movements. But inside it was too dark, she could see nothing. She had no choice but to bring the lantern closer to see clearly.

Lisa goes straight to hospitals to buy discarded embryos. Yes, that's the primary ingredient in her dumpling filling. Anyone who eats them can instantly shed 10 years off their appearance. One day, a wealthy woman named Anna came searching for Lisa. A friend told her Lisa's dumplings could reverse aging. So Anna decided to try them herself. When Lisa saw Anna, she almost burst with excitement. She had grown up watching Anna on television. Anna had once been a rising star, a screen beauty who became famous overnight. Because of that fame, she met Mark, a rich businessman 10 years older than she was. Anna believed she'd found true love and married him at 20 without hesitation. Then came the luxurious life of a wealthy wife. At first, Mark was attentive, but as Anna aged, he slowly lost interest. He returned home only once a month to hand her living expenses, spending the rest of his time with his secretary. Learning this broke Anna's heart. Determined to win him back, she turned to Lisa for help. Hearing Anna's story, Lisa felt sympathy and walked into the kitchen, beginning her craft. She chopped the ingredients, mixed them with pork and Cabbage and cracked an egg for richer flavor. Soon, a plate of dumplings worth $60,000 was ready. Even though the placenta was wrapped inside, Anna still trembled with fear. Lisa noticed her hesitation and urged her to be brave. Driven by that encouragement, Anna finally lifted a dumpling to her lips. But the moment it touched her tongue, she gagged, spitting it out, disgusted. The fishy stench was unbearable. Even Lisa's dog, after sniffing it, instantly backed away in revulsion. But then Lisa whispered a single sentence and it reignited Anna's determination in an instant. Just think of what you'll become after you eat it.

Me dragging myself out of bed, stretching my back like a retired gymnast, and tiptoeing over to check whether my 80 year old, insanely wealthy wife has finally crossed the finish line of life. Spoiler alert, she never does. She wakes up every day stronger than my will to live, leaving me trapped in the same slow motion misery I've endured for 25 years. Growing up, like, wasn't exactly a fairy tale. When I was 10, my dad worked non stop double shifts, overnight shifts, anything that paid. One night, exhausted beyond reason, he fell asleep at the wheel and plowed straight into our house like a budget action movie stunt. After he died, bills piled up, food got scarce, and childhood disappeared overnight. But I did learn one thing. Hard work is overrated. The world doesn't reward effort. It rewards strategy. Shortcuts aren't cheating. They're survival. Ten years later, I dedicated myself to a very specific dream. Being rich. So I studied the wealthy the way scientists study insects. I lingered in expensive clubs, memorized their habits, practiced my smile and reflective elevator doors. And then, on my 20th birthday, destiny waved at me from across a private pool. She was 55, newly single, childless, worth more than entire cities. And her health. Well, let's just say her warranty was expiring. I dove in, swam over like the human version of a magazine cover, and delivered the cheesiest line of My life. She laughed, I won. And before I knew it, I had a mansion, a chauffeur and a last name that people actually respected. Fast forward 25 uneventful years. Today's our anniversary. She gifts me yet another million dollar watch. Nothing to her, everything to me. I put on my award winning fake smile as she waits, hopeful, like we're still the couple she thinks we are.

Interestingly, the first to try was an ancestor of Gorlock the destroyer. But when the prince attempted to place the ring on her finger, it didn't even go halfway through. The prince immediately exclaimed, get lost now! Next, a tiny baby girl came forward, but for her, the ring was far too big. After that, many girls took their turn, but none of them could fit the ring. Since the prince was the wealthiest man in the entire kingdom, every girl dreamed of marrying. Finally, the prince asked his father, how is this ring even may? It doesn't fit anyone. But the clueless king had no answers. Just then, a mysterious girl walked in, dressed in rags made from donkey skin, refusing to show her face. When the prince asked her to hold out her hand, the ring fit her finger perfectly. At that moment, the girl removed her disguise and revealed her true identity. She was Sydney Sweeney, a true and beautiful princess.

They repeated the same method with bundle after bundle, each Bill soaked, clipped onto a drying line, and finally blasted with a hair dryer until every trace of moisture vanished. They put in all this effort to age the bills because every last one of them was fake. Compared to crisp new notes, weathered cash made people lower their guard. To see how convincing their counterfeits were, the two stepped into a small neighborhood shop. Riley offered one of the bills to the shopkeeper as payment. The shopkeeper glanced at it once and immediately sensed something off. Riley froze in terror. Jack realized the situation was spiraling and rushed forward, grabbing Riley and yanking him out of the man's. Thankfully, the brothers slipped away through the confusion of the crowd. They had believed counterfeiting would be simple, yet their first batch fell apart almost instantly. Jack stared at the failed bills, rethinking everything from the ground up.

The students didn't care about discipline. They just wanted front row seats to watch him gag. So for the first time ever, they actually united. Whenever someone felt the urge to start chaos, the others yanked him back immediately. As the minutes drifted by, the milk carton slowly disappeared and the chalkboard filled up with line after line of notes. The kids didn't even notice it happening. They had unintentionally paid attention the whole period. A few even raised their hands, eager to answer questions. Because of this one teacher, the school's worst class transformed into the top performing honors group. But just when Mister Clark thought he finally found his rhythm, he got fired for refusing the principal's plan to hike tuition. Parents rallied to keep him, but the principal wouldn't budge. Left with no other choice, Clark packed his bags and headed to New York in search of a new job. Reality hit him fast. Big city schools didn't want a rural teacher anywhere near their staff. Still wanting to stay close to the job he loved, he picked up part time work while hunting for any Teaching opening he could find. One morning, on his way to yet another interview, he spotted a teacher locked in a heated argument with a student. Clark rushed over to break it up. The conflict finally ended when the principal arrived right as the furious teacher quit on the spot. You can deal with these little terrors, the teacher snapped. I can start right now, Clark replied. After reviewing Clark's impressive record, the principal offered him the honors class. But Clark was staring into that classroom, realizing something.

Before anyone could recover from the shock, her clothes spontaneously caught fire. She collapsed again, desperately rolling on the floor to extinguish the flames, completely ignoring the child she was supposed to be protecting. The scene was so disturbing that it left everyone frozen in fear, pale faced, unable to react. After a brief moment, she calmly wrapped herself in a blanket and walked quietly into the bathroom. And then the truth was revealed. She wasn't pregnant at all. That so called pregnant belly was nothing more than a fake belly strap. She had been pretending to be pregnant for attention and sympathy. The reason behind it was even darker. Few months ago, her boyfriend had cheated on her and left her heartbroken, leaving her to face loneliness. But one day a stranger mistakenly thought she was pregnant and Instead of being rude, he smiled at her, something she hadn't felt in a long time.

Because of this, her classmates labeled her as something strange, something to avoid. Everything shifted the day the new school year began. At a small street crossing, Jenny noticed a boy heading in the wrong direction and softly pointed him toward the school. What stunned her wasn't the correction, it was the boy's reaction. Jack didn't recoil from her appearance like everyone else. Instead, he stepped closer with a warm, easy smile. The moment Jenny saw that smile, her heartbeat stumbled. She wanted to speak but couldn't form word. Then pedals drifted down from the cherry trees above, few settling in her hair. Jack gently brushed them away. It was the first time anyone had approached her without fear or hesitation. Jenny studied him with wide, curious eyes. In that brief moment, her long held anxieties evaporated. Yet she convinced herself it was nothing more than a fleeting fantasy. Someone like him would never truly see someone like her. What she didn't realize was that this was only the beginning. Once classes officially started, they were placed in the same homeroom. Jenny often caught glimpses of Jack's smile across the hallways, and each time her gaze lingered a little longer. Like many girls, she fell for him quickly. But in her heart, she believed they came from two completely different world.

It was a predator. Once it locks onto someone, that person is firmly trapped. Only when the demonic box is passed to the next person can the holder gain freedom. When the doctor first saw the box, he said something was a miss. However, he didn't take it too seriously, only instructing his assistant to monitor the box closely. However, the assistant accidentally fell for a trick. He was coerced by the box's current holder into taking the box and it immediately locked on to him. When the assistant realized something was wrong, it was already too late. He watched helplessly as the box's two previous holders dissolved into starlight and vanished without a trace. This time, the doctor was. The assistant had already passed the box to a lizard man, and the doctor finally spotted the box's trail again. He was surprised and contacted his assistant. However, the assistant was despairingly speaking his final words, I wouldn't let him down, before also dissolving into Starlight. The doctor then realized the situation was extremely critical. The lizard Man noticed the Doctor's special attention and wanted him to take the box. The doctor remained highly vigilant. A woman standing nearby witnessed the confrontation between the two. She suddenly stepped forward and snatched the box. The next second. What's this? The woman was controlled by the box and a lizard man instantly came to his senses. He didn't Know what he was doing, only that he was about to disappear. Before the doctor could say goodbye, the woman was about to rush out the door to continue spreading the box. The doctor immediately opened the box to try and save her and was stunned to find that the box contained a miniature planet. Furthermore, the box spoke, please reseal the Starseed containment unit within 20 seconds or the current carrier will be disintegrated.

He laughed, his friends laughed, and for a moment he felt like the king of mischief. But the universe had other plans. When the final bell rang in the classrooms emptied, the teacher appeared in the doorway and quietly asked Jack to stay behind. No shouting, no frustration, just a calm request that somehow felt more intimidating than anger. Jack sat alone in the dim classroom, scribbling a self reflection he didn't believe would matter. When he finished, the teacher told him to spit out his gum. Jack sighed, ready for the scolding. But instead he watched in disbelief as the teacher picked up the gum and placed it into their own mouth, chewing it with an almost satisfied calmness. The bizarre moment stunned him senseless. Yet the strangest part came after. Instead of handing out punishment, the teacher walked Jack to the office and had a genuine conversation about his future, about who he could become if he stopped hiding behind jokes. Jack had never been spoken to like that. Something began to shift inside him. The next morning at the school assembly, Jack surprised the crowd by engaging confidently with the teacher. His classmates whispered behind him, noticing the sudden change when someone peeked at his test paper. Their eyes widened at the encouraging note Written by the teacher, personal, unexpected and strangely moving. A few days later, during another assembly, Jack's voice boomed from behind the curtain, stirring curiosity and disbelief. The principal hurried forward and ordered the curtain raised. There he stood, spotlight overhead, silence around him. Then applause erupted, rolling through the hall like thunder. And in that moment, Jack understood the boy who once lived for pranks had become a symbol of change for the entire school.

Raising her phone, she aimed it at the man, eyes locked on the distance, reading ticking down on the screen. Security shouted, ma'am, stay where you are. But she kept moving until the No. 73 yards, the exact point she'd been waiting for. Then suddenly, the mysterious old woman appeared beside the man. She murmured a few words and his eyes went blank, as if his spirit had slipped away. He spun around and bolted. And even with 200 tactical officers on site, no one could catch him. Soon after, he announced he was permanently withdrawing from the presidential race, asking the public to leave him alone. From that moment forward, he vanished completely. Meanwhile, the woman, guided by her sharp mind and the old woman's uncanny powers, quietly, invisibly save the world. Forty years passed. Her hair turned white and she blended into the crowd as just another elderly lady. No one knew what she had once done. But near the end of her life, she saw the old woman again, this time stepping beyond the 73 yard limit, walking straight toward her. As the old woman was about to turn her head, memories from decades flooded back. In the next instance, she found herself standing in a barren wasteland, and ahead of her was her younger self. Everything suddenly made sense. The mysterious old figure who kept appearing had always been her future self. And Now she, too, possessed the power to make others disappear. She waved desperately at her younger self, trying to draw her attention, because only together could they complete their mission and save the world once more.

In front of a full crowd, she lifted a gun to her own head. People screamed, but the shot didn't come from that gun. It came from the weapon hidden in her other hand. In the same instant, her accomplices splattered fake blood across the curtains, selling the perfect illusion of a bride who ended her own life. They placed a pre staged corpse on the floor, position just right. And within minutes, the entire venue believed the new bride had died in front of everyone. Hours later, long after police closed the scene, Amelia, still in her wedding dress, walked calmly down a quiet street. No tears, no hesitation. She found her cheating husband and shot him dead without mercy. Then in front of shocked witnesses, she drifted back into the fog like an avenging spirit, leaving behind the chilling legend of the Ghost Bride. But what no one knew was that this was only the first layer of her plan. To prevent investigators from ever discovering the staged body, Amelia made the most brutal choice of all. She ordered her own accomplices to kill her for real, then replace the fake corpse with her actual body. When police returned, the death scene matched perfectly. No contradictions, no holes, just a mystery that felt supernatural. From then on, her partners kept the legend alive. At night, they hunted unfaithful Men murdering them under the cover of the ghost bride myth, the town spiraled into fear. Rumors spread like wildfire. Homes locked their doors before sunset. Even couples stopped trusting each other. With no leads and rising panic, the police finally called in Sherlock Holmes. When he examined the bride's body at the morgue, he was stunned to find her tied down with thick iron chains. The staff insisted this was the only way to stop her spirit from killing again. Holmes shook his head. A ghost who needs chains? That's not superstition. That's a cover up. And with that, the real investigation began.

Mike played it cool, unwrapping it right in front of the guard, who saw nothing but ordinary ground beef and walked away satisfied. Once Mike confirmed the cell block was unobserved, he quickly thawed the meat, pulled out the hidden saw blade and began prepping for his escape.

Asked why the woman seems so indifferent, the experienced nurse replied, she grew up in an orphanage. Her husband never stayed by her side, always out having fun. She probably never knew what it felt like to be cared for. But to others, she came across as rude and uncivilized. She smoked in front of other pregnant women and didn't even stop her child from urinating in public.

That mysterious man made her long dormant heart begin pounding violently against her chest. At first, she thought it was an illusion, but upon stepping outside, she saw him. Immediately after speaking, she discovered it was Jack, the cousin of the deceased girl. But Jack coldly rejected her, believing Anna had come out of greed. Anna hurriedly explained she was there to comfort Lisa, but Jack refused to listen. With no other choice, Anna politely took her leave. Just as she was walking away in low spirits, Jack suddenly rushed after her. He apologized for his harsh words and offered to drive her home. Anna verbally declined, but still opened the car door. Then the unexpected happened. During their conversation, Anna again felt her heart raging wildly. She remembered her brother's words, a heart transplant might make you inherit the donor's emotions. Clearly, the original owner of this heart had loved Jack. Realising this, Anna hastily exited the vehicle. But at that moment, her ex boyfriend appeared, accusing her of dating so late at night. His vulgar behaviour made Jack lose control and he taught him a lesson. Seeing Jack standing up for her, Anna felt deeply guilty and tenderly treated his wound. Watching her focused expression, Jack also began finding her intriguing. As he was leaving, Anna was apologizing when he suddenly turned back. The moment their eyes met, Anna knew with certainty she had finally fallen. For this man.

The missing red umbrella was sitting right on my chair beside it. A card. A gift for you. I spun around and saw someone slipping out the door. I chased them instantly, but they were gone. A police officer came over, asking what happened. I made up an excuse, but inside I was spinning. When did Lisa get a police friend? I tried contacting the female officer handling Lisa's case, wanting to tell her about the umbrella. But she didn't answer. Not once. When I reached my home, my heart dropped. Jason was standing at my doorstep. Was it you? Did you do this? Did you leave That umbrella at Belinda's service. What are you talking about? He looked genuinely confused. He said he'd come to tell me he'd found an eyewitness. Police's death. But I didn't believe him. I didn't want his help. I didn't want anything from the man who once tried to kill me. He looked regretful, but I still shut the door on him, locked every window and curled up on my bed, shaking, terrified, barely able to breathe. But I knew hiding wouldn't save me. Jason had shown up. The umbrella had returned. Everything pointed one way. Jason was the killer. So I turned to Lisa's police friend, Jack. The moment we met, I laid out every suspicion I had. And that's when things took an even darker turn.

Tiny strands had started pushing through his skin and the boy nearly exploded with excitement. His father, tired of hearing neighbors call his son the shiny headed kid, was thrilled, too.

At school, classmates whispered that he must be wearing a cheap looking wig even during lessons. His hair stretching longer, eventually sweeping across his entire face.

Every morning, parents woke early just to manage the wild forest growing out of his head. But the situation only got worse. A strong breeze could yank his hair into bushes or wrap it around roadside plants like living vine. Eventually, his father Made a decision, one that was equal parts practical and absurd. If the boy's hair was going to grow without limits, they might as well use. So he brought his son to a wig factory, where workers laid the child across the production line like a human resource machine. His endlessly growing hair became the factory's freshest supply of material, spinning into wig after wig as the boy lay there, Botham and provider of an unlimited harvest.

Standing barefoot on the trembling fabric shell with no Protection at all, he slammed his heels against the valve, kicking again and again until it finally cracked loose. A blade of icy wind ripped across him, making his entire body tremble beyond control. To keep the valve from freezing shut, he jammed his boots into the opening, then pulled out his knife and sliced the laces, forcing the shoes deep into the narrow gap. But in the brutal cold and thin air, his strength collapsed. He dropped hard onto the balloon's skin as the unrestrained craft began drifting downward, its envelope slowly deflating, dragging his body toward the edge. The abrupt shock of falling snapped him awake. He clawed at the surface, finding nothing to hold on to, helplessly watching himself slide off. When his eyes opened again, he was dangling upside down, 10,000 meters high, saved only by the hemp rope tied around his waist. He remembered his partner inside the basket and screamed for help, but the man had already passed out from the altitude. As expected, he had to rely on no one but himself. Swinging his body with every scrap of strength, he finally managed to hook the rim of the basket and dragged himself back inside.

She looked around, sensing how everyone had become strangely unique in those months. And Jack, the boy, kept circling through her thoughts over and over, like an echo that wouldn't fade. The sunlight remained fierce that season. The sun kept blazing again and again as if it refused to set. They were trying to take a picture for the skate crew right in front of the school.

The he had first picked up the ketchup bottle froze, stunned watching the impossible unfold right in front of him. He warned his son to stop immediately saying he had just drenched himself in ketchup. But the boy stared at him like he was making no sense at all. He tried explaining the bizarre rewind, yet his son only blinked at him and confused. With a long exhale, he wondered whether his mind was simply playing tricks on him. But their strange exchange hadn't gone unnoticed. A police officer seated nearby watching intently and a cold shiver crept through his spine. They left the restaurant heading down the highway and that uneasy feeling grew even heavier. His son turned on some music to calm him down, but as he pressed the accelerator, something fell off. He told the boy to slow down, yet the kid raised the camera instead insisting on capturing his nervous face. Then it came piercing wail of sirens behind them. They pulled over. He told his son to stay composed and be respectful. The window slid down. Polite Smile form and standing there was the same officer from the restaurant. He quickly explained they were simply.

Their goal was to move him to a federal holding facility without a hitch. But just as the convoy paused at an intersection, a colossal magnetic force clamped onto the transport truck. Every SWAT weapon was yanked straight onto the roof and John, backed into a corner, had no choice but to order a counterstrike. Rounds fired in rapid succession, yet the low trajectory barely scratched the armored shell, forcing the team to watch helplessly as the prisoner transport was dragged away. To track him down again, they pulled the footage from a garage surveillance feed where Jack could be seen holding Richard hostage while boarding a heavily modified Chevrolet. With this crucial lead, John initiated a citywide manhunt, even dispatching helicopters to sweep the skies. It didn't take long before the enemy's location was pinpointed and the Intel was passed straight to John. He ordered roadblocks to be thrown up and immediately. But no one realized the hostage in the vehicle still carried a walkie talkie and every word of their strategy was clearly intercepted by Jack.

Not just over her face, but over every emotion she felt. Yet somehow she still fell for that silver haired guy from her class. Just as she gathered the courage to finally speak to him, he beat her to it, but not in the way she'd hoped. You're the kind of person I hate the most, he said coldly. She stood frozen, completely speechless. Later, when their teacher asked them to write mutual impressions, she stole a glance in his direction, only for him to slide a note to her first. Her blood ran cold the moment she opened it. You always hide your heart behind that mask. He had seen right through her all along. At lunch, hiding alone in a corner, a paper airplane landed softly in front of her. Inside was the evaluation she had written for him. He draws amazingly and everyone likes him. When she looked up, he was staring right at her, eyes full of contempt. You've never really seen me, he said. That's exactly why I can't stand people like you. When the school arts festival approached, as class president, she was put in charge of rehearsals. But on the day of the event, no one showed up. The empty room echoed the hollowness in her chest. In moments like these, she couldn't stop the urge to hurt herself. But suddenly a hand gripped hers firmly. It was him. The guy who claimed to hate her. Without A word! He pulled her into the broadcasting room, grabbed the mic, and commanded the whole class. Everyone get back to rehearsal in three minutes or face the consequences! His icy voice echoed through the entire school. Within seconds, their classmates rushed back, clearly intimidated. Seeing everything returned to normal because of him, she tried to slip back into the shadows, but he walked straight up to her. Stop making that tragic heroine face, he said, his voice low but clear. If you have something to say, say it properly.

It wasn't plugged in, yet it still worked, and for just 25 cents, it claimed it could grant any wish. He kept thinking about how he could have ridden the roller coaster with the girl he liked. But the staff stopped him at the gate because he wasn't tall enough. So Josh dropped a coin into the machine and made his wish. As the coin fell into the slot, a small card popped out. On the back. It said his wish had already been granted. Josh didn't take it seriously, thought it was just someone's silly prank. He had no idea this would be the start of something unbelievable. That night, strong winds swept through the sky and thunder echoed outside. Josh fell asleep very late, but his body had already begun to change. The next morning, he got up like he always did, though something about his body felt heavier. He walked into the bathroom to wash his face and froze when he saw a strange staring back at him in the mirror. He could not believe his wish had actually come true. The 12 year old boy had suddenly aged ten years overnight. Josh grabbed a few clothes from his father's closet. After getting dressed, he rushed out the door. He wanted to find the wishing machine and change himself back. But when he rode his bike to the amusement park, all he saw was a pile of Trash. The entire park had moved away. With no other choice, Josh went back home. He hoped his mother would believe he was still Josh. He told her his birthday was November 3rd and that he had scored 60 on his last test, November 3rd. Hearing a stranger talk about her son in such detail, his mother thought he had kidnapped Josh. She screamed and forced him out of the house. Shocked and terrified, Josh ran away. He went to school and found Billy, his best friend. But Billy didn't believe him either. So Josh started singing the song only the two of them knew. So Josh started singing a song only the two of them knew. Down, down, baby, down, down the roller coaster. Jimmy! Jim, call my mom, Jimmy. Why? I meant it. I said I told my mama's credit. I'm cool. I'm hot. That finally convinced Billy. Josh begged him for help because he had nowhere to go. Billy brought some of his father's clothes and met Josh near an old pipe tunnel. He suggested that Josh explore the city.

Examinations revealed she was three months pregnant. In that instant, David, the nurse who had cared for her, became the prime suspect. Yet no one at the hospital could believe he would harm her. David had long publicly declared he was gay, and he was known for his kindness, not just to colleagues, but to patients as well. For four years, David stayed by her side every day. He carefully cleaned her body, massaged stiff muscles, did everything he could to care for her. Even her father had praised him for his devotion. But the investigation uncovered a troubling fact. The girl had not had her period for three months, and David had neither reported it nor explained the situation. One colleague even overheard him quietly speaking to her about his hope that she would recover and be with him. Faced with the accusations, David offered no defense. Ultimately, he was arrested and imprisoned. What no one realized was that David had been in love with her long before, even before she became a patient in a coma. He had glimpsed her dancing and was instantly captivated. From that day, he would watch her dance whenever he could, his feelings deepening over time, unable to bear the thought of her suffering.

Yet even so, she quietly fell for the silver haired boy in her class. And just when she finally gathered the courage to speak to him, the boy beat her to it, only to tell her she was the person he despised the most. She froze on the spot. Even after being rejected when the teacher asked them to write impressions of each other, she couldn't help sneaking glances at him. But the next second, the boy slipped her a note. First, when she opened it, a chill crawled straight up her spine. Written in bold letters that she always hid her real heart behind her mask. Only then did she realize he had seen through her long ago. Later, while she ate lunch alone in a corner, a paper airplane landed at her feet. Inside was the evaluation she had written about it, great artist, very popular. She looked up in shock. The boy was staring at her, his eyes filled with cold disdain. He said she had never truly looked at him and that her shallow assumptions were exactly why he couldn't stand her. As the art festival approached, the girl, being class rep, had to organize the rehearsal. But on the day of the event, not a single classmate showed up. Her heart collapsed in that empty room. Moments like this always pushed her toward hurting herself, but just Then strong hand grabbed her wrist. It was the same boy who claimed he hated her. Without a word, he dragged her straight into the broadcast room, switched on the mic and commanded the entire class to gather within three minutes or face the consequences.

This way he could effectively block and disrupt the tracker signal hidden deep inside his body. Then he carefully pulled out all the disassembled gun parts from his backpack and swiftly assembled a full Barrett sniper rifle. With practiced precision, he opened the powerful 8X scope and calmly aim straight at the drone hovering in the sky above. The drone had come specifically to attack and eliminate him. Without the tracker signal, the soldiers could only command the drone to fly blindly around the valley, searching desperately for the target's exact location. They didn't realize the target had already begun fighting back with deadly intent. After firing two clean shots in a row, Jimmy confidently put away the sniper rifle. He didn't even need to turn his head to confirm the drone had already crashed. But to avoid raising suspicion at headquarters, he immediately removed the frying pan. After regaining the tracker signal, headquarters quickly sent another drone to bomb him. But Jimmy had already prepared a meticulous plan. Back at the small remote cabin, he endured intense pain and dug out the tracker from inside his own body, then placed it directly inside his mouth. This way it would stay consistent with his body temperature and headquarters wouldn't detect anything unusual for the time being. Then he deliberately laid down in the freezing snow and took out the bloodstained gauze. The strong scent Of blood quickly attracted a vicious harving wolf. Seeing the man's weakened and fragile state, the wolf bared at sharp fangs and lunged violently at him. Jimmy instantly activated the trap he set in front of him and captured the wolf in one move. Then he stood up and used his pistol to drive away. The other wolves still wanted to approach him. Now Jimmy just needed to insert the tracker inside the wolf's body and he could successfully avoid the drone bombing. This was a wild and aggressive animal, after all. It took a full 10 minutes before Jimmy managed to force the tracker into its mouth. By that time, the drone had already arrived directly above him. He ran desperately, trying to put as much distance as possible between himself and the tracker. Unexpectedly, the wolf kept chasing stubbornly behind him. After locking onto the target, the drone immediately dropped a bomb. Fortunately, Jimmy ran fast enough and wasn't affected by the explosion at all. The reason the CIA wanted to kill Jimmy was because they had secretly used drugs to create a batch of enhanced super soldiers, and Jimmy happened to be one of them. His special ability was extreme cold resistance. He could not only survive in snow at minus 200 degrees.

He walked over and asked, is anyone sitting in this chair? The girl immediately poured water onto the seat. But he was so taken by her looks, he sat on the wet chair anyway. A moment later, the waiter came over and said, what happened here? The guy named Dustin said, sorry, man, I spilled some water. Then he ordered two coffees. Chloe started laughing non stop. She wrote her number on a napkin and handed it to him. Dustin felt excited, thinking this girl might actually be easy to get to know. But that excitement vanished instantly when Chloe rolled up in her wheelchair. Chloe smiled and said, let's grab coffee tomorrow. Dustin nodded, but once she left, he dropped the napkin. He had no intention of dating a disabled girl. A few weeks later, Dustin landed a job as a driver for a billionaire businessman. The boss told him, your job is to drive my daughter to the hospital for treatment every day. The moment Dustin saw her, he froze in embarrassment. It was the same girl he had rejected. But Chloe acted like she had never seen him before, as if nothing had happened. Dustin felt guilty. During the drive, he tried to talk and said, I was just about to call you. But Chloe cut him off. That wasn't even my number. I always give fake numbers to guys like you. I know they want call and I'm tired of waiting. Dustin felt even more ashamed when they reached the hospital, pulled out her wheelchair and tried to help her, but she refused. After her treatment, Dustin tried to cheer her up with an ice cream, but it melted and spilled on her clothes. He panicked and apologized over and over, but Chloe blushed because no one had ever done something that thoughtful for her. When they got home, her dad was waiting, ready to hear yet another complaint. He had already fired dozens of drivers, but this time, he was stunned. For the first time, Chloe actually approved of someone. Later, her dad set her up on a blind date with the son of an awkward real estate tycoon. Chloe wasn't impressed at all. Dustin could clearly see she didn't want to be there. Just then. Dustin showed up and reminded her about her treatment appointment, but her dad stopped her and said, you need to start taking marriage seriously. Chloe stayed quiet for a moment, then suddenly said yes to marrying that awkward guy. Dustin was completely confused.

She never understood why until the day Charlie noticed her sister's face full of swollen blemishes, raised a finger to press 1 and watched the imperfections sink into her skin, sliding down the braid and landing straight on her own face. Terror washed over her completely. Meanwhile, Charlie pulled back the blanket and found her sister's thighs coated in grease and her feet riddled with fungal rot. Mortified beyond belief, her sister pushed both palms against her thighs and shoved hard, forcing the oily mass upward to her stomach. Then she yanked her belt tight and the excess fat traveled through the braid, pouring directly into the girl's abdomen and legs. She witnessed every horrifying second. Then her sister pressed each of her five fungus infected nails onto her fingers and every disease nail regrow on her own hand. She finally screamed, realizing the braid was the true source of all this. She grabbed Scissors to cut it, but the blade snap instantly. Without panicking, he lit the braid on fire. Flames shot several meters high, triggering the smoke alarm. The downpour from the sprinklers was useless. Taking advantage of the chaos, she sprinted out, trying to wedge the braid into the door frame. Ears spilling at last. Then she spotted the fire extinguisher. A brilliant idea flashed. She rushed back inside and saw her sister's face twisted with rage. Without hesitation, she froze her with the Extinguisher then blasted their intertwined hair, turning the braid into icy spikes. All those unfair burdens, the fat, the blemishes, vanished instantly. At last, she was free, no longer a dumping ground for someone else's bodily waste. Naturally, her sister returned to her dreadful original form. For a moment, everything seemed right again, and her sister's boyfriend immediately ran for his life.

Every time I started dating someone, she quietly sabotaged it, stealthily stealing my boyfriend's watch or jewelry. And more awkwardly, my boyfriend couldn't hold it when nature called. And she always seemed to succeed at the most inconvenient moment. What made things worse was the fatal flaw in our bond. We shared everything we ate. One time my boyfriend tried to feed me steak, but I refused since I was dieting. So he turned and fed it to my sister under the table. She swallowed it in one bite, then tossed the braid and a steak traveled right into my body. I let out an awkward burp, not wanting to waste food. Then my boyfriend handed all the leftovers to my sister, and she happily gobbled it all up for me, the dieter. All that food ended up in my stomach. My boyfriend stared in shock while my sister smirked mischievously. Then when he wasn't looking, he quietly stole the jewelry he was wearing, transferring it straight into my mouth through our connected braid. I was horrified, but she never seemed to tire of her game. While shopping with my boyfriend, my sister took a liking to some jewelry in a store. I had to drag her away, pulling her with our braids. What hurt the most was the growing suspicion that my sister and my boyfriend were Secretly involved, especially after what happened in the fitting room, which confirmed all my worst fears. In a fit of rage, I grabbed my boyfriend's clothes, yanked hard and severed the braid that connected me to my sister, quietly slipping away from all the drama. As for my ex, he laughed as he was wrapped in a curtain. After all, my sister and I could always rebraid our hair later. Now it was time to start looking for the next one.

Next, he poured cold water on the front door, which quickly froze into a thick sheet of ice. He also used a hose to spray water on the icicle hanging from the eaves, making them strong and sturdy. Everything was set up in no time. Soon enough, two clumsy burglars arrived at his house. Their car immediately slid on the ice and crashed into a street lamp. But the thieves didn't give up. Disguising themselves as Santa Claus, they prepared to sneak inside. However, things weren't going as planned. Still, they pressed on, running in place on the ice. At that moment, the boy flashed his headlights, terrifying them into raising their hands in surrender. When the light went out, they resumed moving. This back and forth action went on about 100 time. Finally, one of the men reached the door and saw a stack of cookies, a glass of milk with a note that read for Santa. The man thought, this must be for me, picked up a cookie and took a bite, the spicy cookie. He immediately set his throat on fire, forcing him to gulp down the milk to cool off. Turned out the milk had been tampered with as well. Left with no other option, he shoved his head into a snowbank. The man eventually managed to sneak into the house, but as soon as he Entered, an alarm went off. He rushed to turn it off, only to find a nail placed on the. But at that moment, the boy appeared, weapon in hand, and the man was knocked out cold. Next, the boy placed a VR headset on the man. When the man woke up, he found himself standing on the edge of a sheer cliff face.

He intended to dash to the emergency room, but the next instant, a searing pain tore through his gut. Determined to thwart his wife's scheme, he gripped his abdomen in anguish and moved to leap from the building, wanting his wife to drown. In lifelong remorse, though the wife now played the grieving widow, the man felt no forgiveness in his heart. He jumped without a second thought. But as the wife glimpsed her husband's remains, a twisted smile flickered on her lips. She hurried back inside, frantically booted up his computer and entered the passcode, hoping to seize all his wealth. Unexpectedly, the system demanded not just a pass word, but also facial verification. She raced back to the terrace only to find the fall had shattered his features beyond recognition. Lisa plunged into immediate despair, yet she wasn't ready to surrender, for she knew a sculptor who could bypass the security. At dawn, she visited his studio, claiming her husband had died in an accidental fall. Arthur showed no suspicion and offered condolences. Pressing her advantage, Lisa pleaded she was consumed by grief and begged him to craft a hyper realistic sculpture. Confronted with her desperate appeal, Arthur found it impossible to decline. Just then, a peculiar sound echoed from the upper floor. Lisa scanned the room but spotted no one. Unbenounced to her, every word had been Overheard by Arthur's apprentice as Lisa's car disappeared down the road.

The old man raised his rifle and aimed at the sneakers hanging high. The bullet hit its Mark and the shoes instantly split open, pouring white powder down, covering the back of the van. Completely unaware, the two men drove straight toward the heavily guarded border. However, during the inspection, police dog suddenly stopped sniffing the back of their vehicle. The officer noticed the irregularity and immediately signaled his colleague to search the van. Before the men had time to react, the police swarmed in and swiftly subdued them.

I chose a dress and stepped into the fitting room, dragging my sister, of course, because we were permanently attached like an unfortunate two headed octopus. As I was pulling the curtain closed, my boyfriend cleared his throat. I'll wait outside. But the moment I lifted my shirt to try the new outfit, I felt a suspicious tug on our braids, my sister's signal for trouble incoming. Before I could react, she suddenly yanked me backward, almost knocking me into the mirror. Then horror. She leaned toward the curtain and whispered, come in, and he did. My heart nearly exploded. My boyfriend slipped inside with the subtlety of a burglar, holding a necklace he'd picked out for me. But instead of handing it to me like a normal human, he reached past me straight toward my sister. She smiled at him like she'd been waiting her whole life for this exact moment. I stared frozen, caught between jealousy and rage. The worst part, before I could say a word, she leaned forward with dramatic flare and using our cursed braids like a conveyor belt, sent the necklace sliding into my mouth. I gagged so hard I nearly swallowed the entire pendant. My boyfriend blinked at me in confusion. My sister blinked at him in triumph. And I blinked at both of them, wondering how my life turned into this living soap opera. When he finally left the fitting room, I spun toward her. What are you doing? She just shrugged. Then she smirked with that same infuriating, mischievous look and whispered, I'm protecting you from him. That was the moment I realized my sister wasn't just sabotaging my relationships out of jealousy or boredom. No, she had her own plan. And I had no idea how terrifying it was until the night she tried to cut our braids and tie them to someone else.

Jenny's hands shook as she fumbled with the door lock, trying desperately to get out before Anka reached her. The lab lights flickered, casting distorted shadows across the walls. Anka's voice, or what used to be her voice, gasped and stuttered in a guttural tone, completely unlike her usual speech. The worm, now partially visible, crawling under Anka's skin, pulsed rhythmically, as if sinking with her heartbeat. Jenny's mind raced. She remembered the containment protocols for biohazard organisms, but this was unlike anything she had ever encountered. Throwing herself against the glass, she banged and screamed, but the reinforced window barely budged the creature through. Anca moved closer, tilting her head unnaturally, bearing with a horrifying mix of human and insect like intent. Suddenly the worm's body expanded beneath Anca skin, causing her limbs to convulse violently. Jenny stumbled backward, knocking over a tray of lab chemicals. The liquid spilled across the floor, hissing as it met the floor, the sharp smell of awkward fumes filling the room. Anca screamed, not with her voice, but something that sounded like a chorus of insects. Jenny realized she had only one chance. She had to sever the worm's connection to Anca before it fully took control. Grabbing a metal scalpel from the counter, she steeled herself. Heart pounding, she stepped closer, knowing one wrong move could mean death or worse for both her and Anca.

A shiver ran down my spine. But what really made my heart skip a beat was the shadow in the corner of the bathroom. My son was standing there, but his eyes, they weren't innocent. They glowed faintly in the dim morning light. And a strange, knowing smile curled on his lips. Mom, he whispered. Why do you hide from me? I froze, gripping the edge of the tub. I, I'm not hiding, honey. My voice trembled. He tilted his head unnaturally. You don't understand. I've been waiting, watching, learning. Before I could react, he slipped into the tub with me, the water instantly turning icy. I felt a weight pressing me down, but it wasn't him, with something else, something that made the very air feel heavy. I looked up, and for a fleeting moment, his face flickered back and forth between the child I knew and a grown man's face with eyes full of cunning malice. You can't keep secrets from me, mom, he hissed. Voice layered with my son and someone else. Then, just as suddenly as it started, he was gone. The water drained itself, and my son stood at the doorway, smiling innocently again like nothing had happened. My heart pounded. I knew this wasn't over. He was hiding something inside him, something older, something dangerous. And I didn't know if my family would survive the night.

After all, he had already performed emergency coral surgery, clamshell extraction, and starfish powered liposuction. A poke wasn't going to shatter his dignity now.

Then front oil whispered, horrified, wait, are they going to get addicted and come back for more? As if answering her question, dozens of starfish suddenly floated to the surface, all staring at her with unblinking enthusiasm. The man's eyes widened. Run! Front oil shrieked and sprinted down the beach. The man grabbed his improvised surgical tool kit and charged after her. Yeah! Yelling, don't stop! If they catch you, they'll turn you into a snack bar! Behind them, the starfish army flopped across the sand with terrifying determination. And just when They thought they had escaped. A massive shadow rose from the water. A giant starfish. 10 times bigger than the others. Its eyes locked onto front oil, and it started moving toward her.

His breathing turned rapid, wet dripping down his forehead. Lisa panicked. She tried to hold him, but the closer she got, the weaker Jack became. Terrified. She backed away and instantly Jack's breathing steadied. That's when the truth finally hit her. She was the problem. The next morning, Lisa secretly visited another doctor, hoping for answers. When the results came back, the doctor frowned. Your body emits an unusual hormone, pheromone, that over stimulates certain men. Too much contact will exhaust them, sometimes fatally. Lisa froze. Her mind went blank. The doctor continued, your husband loves you deeply, but if his body keeps weakening like this, he won't last long. Lisa staggered out of the clinic, tears blurring her vision. All she could think about was Jack's smile, Jack's warmth, Jack's promises. That night she sat beside Jack while he slept, gently brushing his hair and made a decision. The next morning, Jack woke up and found Lisa gone. Only a note remained on the pillow. Jack, to protect you, I have to stay away. Please live. Jack tore out of the house, searching for her everywhere, calling her name in the street.

The chief shot an arrow, then unexpectedly let it fly freely. The farther John ran, the more exhilarated the tribe became. But as soon as he passed where the arrow landed, a warrior sprang after him. Though John was strong, the heat was unbearable. Within 10 seconds, the warrior closed. Seeing John falter, the warrior hurled a spear, which missed, then drew a knife. But John reacted swiftly. He overpowered the attacker, grabbed his gear and kept running. More warriors joined the chase, but before long, one collapsed from a heart attack. John seized the opportunity to vanish into the woods. There, he crafted sandals from grass and spotted a giant snail, cracked its shell and ate it to regain strength. Just then, a third warrior crept up behind him. John noticed in time and bolted. Spotting a cactus along the path, he had an idea. He pierced it, letting the milky sap seep out. The warrior discovered the sap and one of John's discarded sandals, realizing John was near. But John had already circled around He took the warrior down with a single shot after three grueling days.

He walked away calmly and headed straight to the hotel room beside the pool. The moment he saw the messy sheets, he was certain his wife had truly betrayed him. That evening, when she returned home, he intentionally stepped forward and gave her a warm embrace. But that didn't mean he would tolerate her infidelity. He wasn't just planning to expose her mask. He meant more than that. Missus Smith, I'm sorry. Don't be. Gunshot startled the gardener outside. Urgent knocking followed immediately after. Yet he remained completely composed, firing several shots toward the window to scare everyone away. Then he dragged his wife's body aside, picked up the spent shell casings, and rearranged the entire crime scene. He removed the shirt that might have been stained with blood and tossed it into the fireplace. Finally, he scrubbed himself with hot water again and again, washing off any trace of gunpowder residue. Then he sat down quietly, waiting for the police to arrive.

The paper absorbed the liquid almost instantly. He lifted the note out and unfolded it with care. What had been a crisp, freshly printed Bill now looked naturally aged and weather worn. They repeated the same routine with bundle after bundle. Note dip hung along a string to dry, then blasted with a hair dryer until it looked convincingly used. They went through all this trouble for one reason, every single Bill was fake and worn out. Cash, unlike flawless bills, didn't attract suspicion. To see whether their creations could fool anyone, the pair headed into a tiny corner shop. Riley handed one of the notes to the shopkeeper to buy a small item. The moment the shopkeeper glanced at the Bill, his expression tightened. Something felt wrong. Riley froze, panic rising in his chest. Sensing danger, Jack acted fast. He grabbed Riley's arm and pulled him away. Before the shopkeeper could react, they disappeared into the crowd, escaping by pure luck. They had assumed counterfeiting money was simple, but their very first attempt had collapsed in seconds. Staring at the rejected bills, Jack began to reconsider everything they had been wrong from the very beginning. Real Indian currency used a unique cotton based substrate, a texture completely unlike regular paper. It also produced a sharp, distinct snap when handled. Then there was the color shifting ink changing shades at different angles and the embedded security strip woven into the Note, if they truly wanted believable imitation, they would have to overcome all of those challenges. Even the intricate designs surrounding the portraits would have to be recreated manually, because scanning real bills only made the microscopic text work and expose itself as fake, no matter how expensive the printer might be.

Instead, he rolled the sheets into tiny pellets, soak them in water, squeeze them dry, and press them together with toothpaste until they hardened into a solid plug. That plug was the heart of his escape plan. During meal, the guards unlocked his cuff only for a short window, and the moment one looked away, he slipped the paper plug into the lock. After the guard closed the door and walked off, he gave it a light push. The first door slid open. The second door used an electronic keypad, but he had already prepared for that. The guards never bothered taking the milk cart, so he crushed his flat on the ground, peeled off the transparent plastic sleeve. That sleeve became his second key. After the guard entered the code, the man's fingerprints stayed on the plastic, feeling a four digit sequence. But that still wasn't enough. Four digits could be arranged 24 different ways. He needed time to test them all. Unfortunately, he hit the correct one. But he didn't bolt. He first tapped into the security feed, then calmly returned to his cell. Because this was only phase one. To fully break out, he needed far more Intel. From day one, he stayed quiet, played fragile, made the guards assume he was harmless. Truth was, he was memorizing their footsteps, their rotations, and when they got lazy. After two weeks, he finally spotted a rhythm. Every time yard time ended, his guard called the guy in the control booth, and the two stepped out onto the roof for a quick smoke break. Five minutes up, five minutes back. Those five

It was already past midnight. Panic struck her for the first time that evening. The rain was coming down harder now and the streets were slick. Her parents, blind as they were, were out there searching, desperately calling her name into the storm. Anna's boyfriend grabbed her hand, worried we should go back, he said. But Anna shook her head, no, they'll just lecture me again. I can't go back yet. Hours passed. Anna eventually grew tired and cold, sitting under a flickering street lamp. The pager her mother had destroyed still in her pocket. She hadn't thought about her parents fears or the bell they had attached to her backpack all those years to track her. Meanwhile, her mother and father, soaked and exhausted, called her name over and over. Her father's hands trembled as he reached out, hoping somehow Anna might hear him despite her distance. Finally, Anna's pager, miraculously still functioning despite her mother's attempts, buzzed softly in her pocket. The faint vibration reminded her of the life she had left behind, the parents who loved her unconditionally despite their blindness and her rebellion. Heart racing, Anna realized how reckless she had been. She stood up, shaking and whispered into the rain, I'm coming home. Her parents hearing her voice faintly through the storm, felt a spark of hope. They called out again, louder this time, their hearts pounding. Anna ran toward the voices, tears streaming down her face. The bell On her backpack, jingling faintly as if guiding her home. That night, the rain didn't just wash the streets, it washed away a part of the distance between her and her parents, at least for now.

Lisa, oblivious to the subtle shift, hugged her daughter tightly, tears of relief streaming down her face. Daughter's gaze lingered on Lucy, sharp and calculating. She whispered a single word, almost too quiet to hear why. Lucy felt a shiver as the room seemed to tighten around her. The experiments, the serum, the countless nights spent meddling with life and death. It all felt suddenly fragile and perilously close to being exposed. Lisa, still holding her daughter, turned to Lucy. Thank you for saving her, she said earnestly, unaware of the darker truth behind her words. But the girl's eyes never left Lucy. It was as if in those brief moments of death and revival she had glimpsed something beyond life, something that made her understand more than anyone should. Lucy's lips parted, wanting to speak, but no words came. The house felt different that night, quiet yet charged, as if the air itself was aware of what had transpired. And somewhere deep inside, Lucy realized that she had awakened something far more unpredictable than she could ever control.

He didn't ask a single question. He simply lunged at Ian and beat him down. Mickey tried to defend him, but his father took him out as well. Then the man dragged in a woman, ordering her right in front of Ian, fix his son and make him normal. Ian froze, completely forced to watch the person he loved being humiliated. Later, he went to see Mickey, but Mickey shoved him away. He said it was to keep him safe and ended their relationship right there. Soon after, Mandy told Ian that Mickey was getting married. Ian was furious, marched straight over to confront him. Mickey offered no explanation, just threw a punch at Ian's face, closing the door on them once and for all. On the wedding day, Ian showed up again. Their eyes met and the feelings were still painfully real. But Mickey held to his choice, saying it was better for both of them. The ceremony went on. Ian watched Mickey hold someone else's hand, knew the story had truly ended. So he walked into a military recruitment office, signed his name and chose to leave everything behind.

These three dogs had their own system. The biggest one stayed right by her side while the other two were stationed at the door. Like vigilant sentries, they remained on high alert, watching over her until the late hours of the night. Finally, after the danger had passed, all three would head back to the bedroom, one on the bed, one under it. And the third kept guard outside the window, making sure the ex wouldn't pull any tricks. Just as they were about to relax, suddenly loud knocking echoed from downstairs. The frantic banging on the stairs was almost relentless. But as soon as the knocking stopped, everything fell into eerie silence. The dogs were quick to act. One remained posted at the stairs while the other two rushed back to check on their owner. It was a false alarm, but they weren't taking any chances. Even in the dead of night, at least one dog stayed awake. Any sound, any movement, and they were up patrolling the hallway. At this point, not even a mosquito could get past them. As dawn broke, the owner was still sleeping soundly while the German shepherds lay exhausted. To reward them, she decided to give them a special breakfast that day. These hard working bodyguards deserved nothing less. First came the steak, each dog getting a fresh piece of raw Beef next, chicken legs followed by chicken necks for that extra crunch.

That searing metal served as the trial of courage. The master's voice echoed. Why do you refuse to bow? The boy answered clearly, fear has no hold on me. The master then raised a bubbling bronze kettle, sending tea leaves swirling into faze cup. Though all present mastered combat art, when scalding water filled their vessel, none could withstand the blistering heat. Only this youth remained unflinching, for he was forged of different metal. The master commanded him alone to drink the boiling brew. Without a heartbeat's pause, he drained the cup, pride flashing in the master's eyes. He who brings me the Northern Sea Chieftain's head shall emerge victorious from this contest and shall be named my heir. I shall elevate him as my crowning glory. Though the master trusted no mortal soul, he soon placed absolute faith in this young warrior. When the boy confronted the Northern Sea Lord, he faced no common opponent. Decades of blade mastery flowed through the chieftain's vein. Countless rivals had knelt before his steel, yet the boy stood firm. He met every lethal strike head on. Though youth graced his features, his skill surpassed time earned prowess until the chieftain gathered the boy's weapon, leaving him disarmed. Still, the youth advanced, bare hands seizing the humming blade. He slid forward, delivering a jaw shattering strike, then launched into the air, striking pressure points at stunned neural pathways. Wrenched the sword and hurled It into the void. The chieftain survived, saved by a girl's sudden intervention.

Though Boba didn't comprehend the Tuscan Raiders tongue, he felt the searing anger in every guttural cry. Just as the sparring session was about to resume, this instant thunder shattered the silence. The sand people erupted into chaos, snatching weapons and forming defensive circles. Even the bands grew agitated and restless. Only Boba remained standing in confusion, unable to grasp their terror toward a passing train. It wasn't until bodies started dropping at the horrifying truth dawned on him. He desperately pulled two children behind sandstone cover. Gunmen aboard the train kept firing relentlessly, using the tribes for target practice. The Sand People returned fire with primitive rifles, but against the relentless blaster barrage, their weapons proved nearly useless. The slaughter continued until the train vanished, leaving the desert strewn with casualties. The horrific scene hammered at Boba's conscience. Did inferior technology justify using them as living targets? Not even the children were spared.

That was him. He had once been a respected major in the Special Forces until a brutal encounter with Sub Zero, where his arms were frozen solid and shattered like glass. From that moment on, his world collapsed and he became a broken soldier. Sub Zero didn't even look back. He simply walked away without mercy. But fate wasn't finished with him. Liu Kong arrived in the final seconds and dragged him back from death. His life was saved, but his arms were lost forever. While he lay unconscious, his squad attached a pair of mechanical replacements to him. When he finally opened his eyes, the first sight that greeted him were those cold metal limbs. Sonia tried to lift his spirits, but the uneasiness in his heart never faded. The hands he once took so much pride in were destroyed beyond repair, and in their place were fragile, clumsy machines. In that instant, despair crushed him from the inside. He pushed himself back into training, desperately trying to recover his former strength. But the arms couldn't keep up. Slow, stiff, and pathetically weak. These weren't an extension of him. They weren't him at all. And when the enemy stormed the temple, he couldn't even defend himself before the war hammer strikes sent him collapsing to the ground.

But when she saw it, she thought it looked far too small. She asked him to stand up and turn around, and when he refused, her worry grew. Suddenly, the man froze. No matter how she called out, he didn't respond. Only then did she realize the network signal was bad, and she hung up. In reality, the pattern on the back of the sweater wasn't finished yet. A while later, sensing something was off, she video called him again. Just as she did, a wig slipped onto his face. The wife instantly noticed the strange situation and was about to question him. But once again, the man froze completely motionless. Villagers behind him held their breath, unsure what to do. Assuming the network had frozen again, she walked around the house looking for a signal. After repeated attempts failed, she hung up. Only then did everyone dare to breathe a sigh of relief. The truth was far more astonishing. The husband had lied all along, claiming he was studying art in a big city, when in reality he was teaching in a remote Mountain Village. Every time she called, he pretended to be at a city landmark, relying in entirely on the villagers to maintain the illusion. But one day, while visiting a newly opened resort, curiosity LED his wife to glance at a notice board at The Village Entrance, something covered it, but she lifted the cover and was shocked to see her husband's photo posted there. She froze on the spot, then marched straight to his workplace. The villagers were terrified by her sudden appearance. One person hastily put on a wig, trying desperately to keep up the charade.

He had made a bet with a notorious group of troublemakers. If they could stay quiet for the entire period, he would chug a whole carton of milk in one go. The students, initially just wanting to see him throw up, found themselves working together for the first time. Whenever one of them was tempted to disrupt the class, the others stopped him immediately. Minutes passed, the milk on the desk vanished and the notes on the chalkboard multiplied. Unknowingly, the students were paying attention throughout the entire lesson. Some even raised their hands to answer questions. Against all odds, the worst class in the school became the top honors class. Just as Mr Clark felt he had found his rhythm, he was fired. The reason, he refused the principal's plan to raise tuition. Though parents begged for him to stay, the principal insisted. Left with no choice, Clark moved to New York to find a new teaching job. Reality hit hard. Schools in the big city weren't keen on hiring a teacher from the countryside. Determined to stay close to his passion, he worked part time while searching for a full time opening. One day on his way to an interview, he saw a teacher arguing with a student. He rushed over to calm the situation. The conflict ended only when the principal arrived. Frustrated, the teacher quit on the Spot you can have the little bastards, he muttered. I can start right now. Impressed by Clark's record, the principal offered him the honors class. But Clark's eyes were on the classroom across the hall, a room no one supervised. Inside, the kids ran wild, every action a testament to years of bad behavior. The principal never expected Clark to choose that class.

Before I even set foot in the classroom, my students had pranked me. But what they didn't know was that beneath my calm exterior, I was a Navy SEAL operator. And this class the most notorious in the entire school. 20 teachers had already fled in fear. I wasn't about to be one of them. The next morning, I strode into the classroom. Good morning, I said, projecting my voice like a drill sergeant. For a brief moment, the room seemed calmer, but reality quickly hit. Students were sprawled across desks, some munching snacks, other, there's asleep, a few glued to their handheld consoles. They ignored me completely. I introduced myself, hoping to make a connection. Nothing. They assumed I was just another weak teacher, destined to crumble under their chaos. What they didn't know, though, was that I had a surprise. I grabbed a rubber band and a piece of chalk from the desk. In a flash, every single one of them was soaked, chalk dust clinging to their hair and clothes. I stood under an umbrella, arms crossed, a satisfied smile tugging at my lips. Welcome to my class, I said, calm but commanding. Even after the little lesson, their interest in learning was minimal. To reach them, I had to meet them where they were. I allowed smoking in class, but with a catch. Whoever correctly answers three Questions can leave immediately, I announced. I pointed to one student and held out a pack of cigarettes. Tell me, what. What are cigarettes made of? The student hesitated, muttering nicotine and burnt oil. A grin spread across my face. These kids thought they were untouchable, but in my classroom they were about to learn discipline the hard way.

In that moment, I understood the owner of this body had been a thrill seeker, world record holder in 10 extreme sports. And the challenge he had signed up for was to free fall from over 10,000 meters without a parachute and land precisely on a marked spot. If I pulled it off, I wouldn't just set a new world record, I'd also win a staggering $5 billion. At that moment, the entire nation was watching live, waiting to witness a legend rise. The thought of earning 5 billion. The moment I touched down instantly sharpened my focus. I pushed every skill in this body to its limit and dived straight toward the target zone on the ground.

Would you dare to take on such a challenge? But here's the catch. There's no internet, no entertainment of any kind, just one double bed for the two of you to share. The only food provided is a nutritional drink supplied by the organizers. And the game must be completed together. If one person can't endure and gives up, even if the other lasts until the end, they'll only receive $1 million. When the man pressed the red start button, the countdown officially began. Thinking about the $5 million they could win after 50 days, the two cheered with excitement. In their room, they started planning what they would do with the money, dreaming of a bright future ahead. At first, the new environment felt fresh and interesting. But as the days went by, they realized the game wasn't as simple as they had imagined. Every night, the lights would turn off at a set time to ensure they rested. At sunrise, they were woken up on schedule. Their food was always the same, an unpleasant nutritional drink.

Inside the car, the big star, Lena, deliberately refuses to roll down the window. She even stops her assistant from bringing Jade a blanket. The assistant watches in pity as Jade gets soaked to the bone, but is powerless following Lena's orders. Lena, on the other hand, sits comfortably, warming herself with the heater in the car. No one cares about this newcomer's feelings. By the third take, Lena becomes even more cruel. She can't even be bothered to say her lines, just watches as Jade shivers in the rain. It's as if Lena is intentionally tormenting Jade, like she's torturing a helpless animal. And when Lena catches the anger on Jade's face, she seems to take pleasure in it.

Doctors once use their hands to help patients with hysteria relax. But due to the heavy workload, their hands would often experience spasms. Moreover, the patients they treated didn't improve. Instead, they became more agitated and excited. To improve efficiency, Mortimer invented a machine that could replace human hands. He called in a severe case patient to test the machine's effectiveness. The woman lay on a chair, lifting her feet and covering herself with a blanket. Since this was the first time using the machine, Mortimer wasn't sure of the appropriate speed. He turned it up to the maximum and the woman screamed loudly, her cries echoing through the building. Just when Mortimer thought the experiment had failed, the woman expressed immense satisfaction. After the successful test, Mortimer went to the hospital director to present his invention. He predicted that the machine would make a lot of money in the future and asked for investment. However, the director didn't believe him. After all, he had worked in this field for years and couldn't accept something new. The director then brought in another severe case patient and told Mortimer to treat her. This woman was a soprano singer, and the more successful the treatment, the more beautiful her singing would become.

Every time the boss walked across the glass floor upstairs, it creaked loudly under his feet, and even the metal framework beneath seemed to bend and strain. All these signs clearly suggested that his boss's weight was far beyond normal. What was even stranger was that whenever the boss went upstairs to his office, two employees had to support him as he climbed. But the moment he stepped onto level ground, he could move with surprising agility. The boss also had an unusually sharp sense of smell. So sharp that he could tell from hundreds of feet away exactly which employee had eaten garlic. He'd immediately order that person to go wash thoroughly from head to toe. All of these bizarre, almost inhuman behaviours didn't escape the attention of Jack. When Jack noticed that the second floor floorboards were made entirely of glass, a bold idea crossed his mind. If the glass under the boss's feet were to shatter, the boss would fall through, and Jack could finally confirm whether his boss was truly human or not. To test how much weight it would take to break the glass, Jack quickly built a small computer program. But while he was running his experiments, his boss suddenly appeared behind him. Thinking fast, Jack explained that he was just developing a gravity game. Surprisingly, the boss seemed intrigued and even told Jack To finish the game overnight. The next day, after testing the game, the boss decided it would become the company's next big project. Just like that, Jack, who was supposed to be laid off, suddenly found himself favored by the boss.

She kind of pulled up her little shorts and said, mom, look, this is my sleeping sticker. I was like the what? When Lane's mom Lisa saw the sticker, she thought it was strange and asked her daughter about it. And the teacher gives it to you where she put it on my eye and what's it look like? Um, sleeping with a moon on it like. Lisa's dad says he's known something was wrong since school first started. They never notified the parents. So Lisa took matters into her own hands. She reached out to the other parents in Lane's class and sent them pictures of the patch to see if their kids were getting the stickers too. I showed it to my 4 year old and she said, yes, that's, that's the sleepy sticker. And if you read the ingredient ants on them, it has a lot of, I mean, it's just things I've never even heard of. And they're giving him drugs to make him sleep to keep him quiet. Nagla Abdullah tells us she noticed changes in her son who told her he'd been getting the stickers too. She says he'd been crying, stopped eating.

Let's go. Defense block. But Carl didn't back down, plowed through the defense like a bulldozer. The stands erupted in cheers. What the hell is going on here? Yes, the ball was back in the green team's hands. The kids raced downfield, weaving through defenders. Carl poured everything into the game. The red team coach squirmed in his seat, fearing another surprise move from Carl. His nerves stretched to the breaking point. The green team spotted an opening and the ball found its way back to Carl. Crown on his head, he charged full speed. Ball arked through the air, the entire field holding its breath. The trajectory was precise. The ball landed perfectly in Tony's hands. He poured every ounce of strength into charging toward the end zone. Just as he was about to cross the goal line, a defender lunged forward and tripped him. Tony tumbled, crashing heavily to the ground. Victory just inches away.

In this way, Luke successfully escaped from prison. He began living under a hidden identity. However, his peaceful life was soon broken. One day, several gangsters came into his store. They wanted to collect Protection fees. Give us the money. Luke warned them to leave immediately. However, the gangsters mocked him fiercely. I can't, not the way I want to. I kill you.

It was their family tradition. To them, this game mattered even more than the wedding itself. Looking at my husband's grave expression, this uneasy feeling started rising inside me. But he didn't explain much. Innocent me just thought it was some kind of party game. I headed to the hall. Pretty quickly, my husband's father started explaining the rules. We were playing a card drawing game. Whatever card you drew, you had to play it. No refusing allowed. The game officially began. I confidently drew a card. It said hide and seek. Suddenly, everyone in the room went completely stiff, like this was the card they dreaded most. I had no clue what this card meant. I thought it was just regular hide and seek.

He suddenly made a sharp drift and stopped the car on the side of the road. Only 14 seconds were left. The man, not knowing anything, was still fighting with the bees. One bee landed on the car. The man took off his shoe, ready to give it a fatal hit. From afar, the killer thought his plan had worked. But to his surprise, the man standing by the car was totally unharmed. The man, still clueless, proudly thought it was because of his own strength. Helpless, the killer had to continue his assassination. The next day, he fired several shots at the man's car. Finally, one bullet hit the gas tank. Gasoline sprayed out instantly. But the man, still unaware, kept driving. While talking on the phone, he picked up the lighter, but it was broken. We casually threw it out of the car. Unexpectedly, the gasoline on the ground caught fire. The unlucky killer drove straight into the flames. Almost roasted alive, he quickly jumped out of the car. The Jeep then crashed off the cliff. The killer never thought this mission would be so hard. Meanwhile, the man kept driving the leaking car. The boss, angry at the failure, decided to Send the top assassin. Soon the man drove into a gas station. The top assassin was already following him. He lifted his arm and a sharp dagger instantly popped out. He showed the scars on his arm, proving his victories. For him, this mission was nothing. But the man still had no idea of the danger. Gas station workers saw the small hole in the car and simply plugged it with chewing gum. The man stood nearby using an air gun to blow dust off his head. He didn't know the assassin had taken out a special drug. The assassin quietly approached from behind, but the drug was blown away by the air gun and flew straight into the assassin's mouth. Once again, the lucky man escaped. A few hours later, the assassin woke up. Unfortunately, he triggered the daggers mechanism. The top assassin was dead. The boss realized the problem was serious. He sent five agents and they finally caught the man. They even arranged guards to watch him. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly burst out with strength. He broke the ropes in an instant and jumped out the window. But there were also heavy guards outside. The man raised his hands to surrender. Unexpectedly, that move worked out perfectly and he escaped.

As soon as the plane entered the primeval forest, the boy threw open the lid and there, trapped inside was the president. If he could rescue the president, he'd earn $5 million. At that moment, the plane was cruising at an altitude of 10,000 meters. Just as they thought they'd succeeded in getting the president out, they suddenly spotted something below. The pilot quickly opened the cabin door, leaned out and was shocked to see a boy clinging to the top of a refrigerator. So upon seeing this, the pilot prepared to hurl the boy into the forest below. The boy could do nothing but cling tightly to the rope. Even the slightest slip of his grip would have sent him hurtling downward. Yet the forest below was dense with trees, and the pilot kept a close eye on what was happening below because they couldn't risk dropping the president. At that point, the boy told the president to hold onto the rope. The president was suddenly thrown forward and out of the plane. When the boy scrambled back to his feet, he realized the plane he'd been on was gone. Without a second thought, he charged forward and yelled at the president to jump down immediately, otherwise they'd likely Be captured again. When the mercenaries saw the boy fleeing, they launched an attack on him at once. But the forest was full of cover, and the boy dodged every shot. Frustrated, the pilot decided to land the plane to finish off the boy first, and that gave the boy an opening.

He reacted in time, using the plane's momentum during a climb to pull the copilot back to safety.

Thinking the orca didn't know how to eat fish, he picked up the fish and showed it exactly how to devour one. Only the orca shook its head, then opened its massive mouth. Boy realised it wanted to be fed directly, so he tossed the fish into its jaws. Watching it eat obediently, he timidly reached out and inched closer. The orca sensed his intention and lifted its head to cooperate. When the boy prepared to go to school, the orca didn't want him to leave, swimming alongside him. As the boy turned to look back, the orca mirrored him in the water, rolling onto its side to show its white underbelly. Curious, the boy turned back and held out his palm. The orca raised its fin, swinging it in sync with his hand, even spinning in the water as if following his cue. Their playful tongue sticking antics made the zookeeper chuckle. But when the keeper tried to feed the orca, it dove underwater at the sight of the stranger, slapping its tail so hard that water splashed all over him. Clearly, the orca didn't trust him. The keeper begged the boy to help train the orca before school started, hearing the boss would sell it. Under the keeper's guidance, the boy began daily training, and the orca complied eagerly. Within days, he could ride on its back and even put his Hand in its mouth, feeling its unique tongue, their bond deepened. The boy would sit by the orca, pouring out his troubles, and it listened like an old friend, often responding with gentle noises. The boy missed his mom, knowing the orca missed its own family, too, hoping one day it would reunite with its

The captain, however, stayed calm and reported the situation to the control tower, requesting an emergency descent and landing. But before they could finish their exchange, the windshield shattered completely, nearly costing the co pilot his life. Hearing the distress over the radio, air traffic controllers immediately sensed something was very wrong. Fragments of glass had fallen into the engine, causing violent turbulence that the cabin crew could instantly feel. They rushed to the cockpit door, trying to make contact, but both pilots inside were already in deep crisis. The captain tried desperately to pull the co pilot back into the cockpit, but the air pressure outside was too strong. The turbulence grew so intense that passengers in the cabin began to panic. The captain quickly regained his composure and stabilized the plane, unaware that this maneuver would cause a sudden loss of cabin pressure. Crew members who weren't buckled in lost their balance and fell to the floor. Oxygen masks dropped down from above and passengers quickly put them on. The control tower kept calling Flight 8,633. There was no response. The aircraft had already lost contact and drifted into military controlled airspace. The Air Force command center detected the situation immediately, but unsure of what was happening, decided to monitor for the moment. Determined to save his co pilot, the captain made a bold move. He initiated a rapid descent at nearly 2,943 meters per minute. Just as the plane was about to crash into a mountain, he reacted in time, using the plane's momentum during a climb to pull the co pilot back to safety. Meanwhile, the reserve captain fought his way toward the cockpit with the help of passengers inching forward through the chaos. He finally made it inside, and as he slammed the cockpit door shut, cabin pressure began to stabilize. He quickly placed oxygen masks on both the captain and co pilot. At the captain's signal, the co pilot sent out an emergency code.

We opened the hatch and there were people down there, pale, staring like they've never seen daylight. Inside, a family of six spanning three generations has lived underground for decades, believing the world above was unsafe. My parents locked us in during the Cuban Missile Crisis. We didn't know it was over. Surviving on preserved food and rainwater, they maintained a strict routine, unaware of the modern world. We're working with social services, uh, to help them adjust. Uh, they're in shock. Uh, they're in shock but healthy. Emerging into 2025, the family is stunned by simple things like bright sunlight and fresh fruit. They tried an apple and cried.

This is Micah when he was a kid. Which one? All of them. This, this is his bedroom. This is our bathroom. We bought him those outer space jockeys when he was 11 years old. So who the hell took these? Michael was found dead at home by a neighbor, who immediately called 9 1 1. Since the scene looked like a suicide, the SVU at first had no idea why they were called in, until they noticed several photos scattered across the floor, images of young boys with their faces obscured. And one of them even had a message on it, I'm sorry, Michael Foley was a, was a pedophile. Looks like it finally caught up with him. Detectives quickly began searching for the children in the pictures. They Learned that Micah used to run a teen reading group at the library and often interacted with minors. So they suspected the victims might be boys from this group. All the parents were brought to the precinct to help with the investigation. Most of them said their sons weren't in the photos, but one father feared his child might have been abused. Just then, Micah's parents arrived. That furious father even lashed out at them right in front of everyone.

After examining her, the midwife realized the situation wasn't simple. The baby weighed at least 8 pounds already. She advised the woman to cut down on her food intake, but the woman proudly said that she had already given birth to two children. One weighed nine pounds, the other nine and a half, and they were both now beautiful and healthy. The midwife then suggested that she give birth in the hospital, as it would be much safer for both mother and baby. But the woman insisted that she would deliver at home. Hospital I face sick people. Babies should be born at home. So the midwife had no choice but to visit her regularly for home checkups. During the visits, she discovered that the woman had been drinking sugary drinks constantly, one cup after another. She also controlled everything in the household, and her husband listened to her completely. Only then did the midwife understand how her stubborn personality had been formed. Back at the dormitory, the midwife discussed the case with the head nurse. The woman might be suffering from gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that can appear in women during late pregnancy. It can cause excessive weight gain and lead to a heavier baby, increasing the risk of complications during delivery. Unexpectedly, trouble soon arrived when the woman went into labor. The midwife rushed to Her home to prepare for the birth. At last the moment of delivery came. But no one expected the labor to be so extremely difficult.

He had even called his mother to let her know he was fine and spent some time on his phone while lying in bed. But shortly after he suddenly lost consciousness. Doctor Young realized he had made a terrible mistake and rushed to the observation room. The female doctor was still performing CPR.

But unfortunately the 80 year old rich granny is still alive today. And I've been living this simple and boring life for 25 years. When I was 10, my dad worked day and night and one day while driving past our house, he crashed into it from falling asleep at the wheel. يا ولد after my dad passed away, life at home got even harder. That incident made me understand something about life. Working hard doesn't always lead to good results. Taking shortcuts is the safest way. Ten years passed quickly and I kept working toward my dream. I hung around all kinds of high end clubs every day and on my 20th birthday I finally found the target I've been looking for, for my buddy. I Learned the rich lady was 55 this year. She had just divorced and had no kids. And most importantly, she owned the biggest supermarket chain in the entire country. Her assets were too many to count. I got excited the moment I heard it. Old but loaded and her health wasn't great. She was literally the woman of my dreams. Without hesitation, I jumped straight into the pool, then swam over to her to show off my strong body. Oh, I think I'm making you wet. And just like that, I married into a wealthy family. 25 years passed in the blink of an eye. Today was our wedding. Anniversary, she gave me another one million dollar watch. It wasn't expensive, but I still had to pretend to be happy. Then she looked at me with anticipation. That's when I realized I completely forgot about the anniversary, let alone preparing a gift for her. Luckily, I reacted fast and I lied that I had a surprise for her, but she had to go pick it up herself. Hearing that made her very.

Every time the boss walked across the glass floor upstairs, it creaked loudly under his feet, and even the metal framework beneath seemed to bend and strain. All these signs clearly suggested that his boss's weight was far beyond normal. What was even stranger was that whenever the boss went upstairs to his office, two employees had to support him as he climbed. But the moment he stepped onto level ground, he could move with surprising agility. The boss also had an unusually sharp sense of smell. So sharp that he could tell from hundreds of feet away exactly which employee had eaten garlic. He'd immediately order that person to go wash thoroughly from head to toe. All of these bizarre, almost inhuman behaviours didn't escape the attention of Jack. When Jack noticed that the second floor floorboards were made entirely of glass, a bold idea crossed his mind. If the glass under the boss's feet would to shatter, the boss would fall through, and Jack could finally confirm whether his boss was truly human or not. To test how much weight it would take to break the glass, Jack quickly built a small computer program. But while he was running his experiments, his boss suddenly appeared behind him. Thinking fast, Jack explained that he was just developing a gravity game. Surprisingly, the boss seemed intrigued and even told Jack To finish the game overnight. The next day, after testing the game, the boss decided it would become the company's next big project. Just like that, Jack, who was supposed to be laid off, suddenly found himself favored by the boss.

She quickly asked the customer why. The customer told her the filling was delicious, but locals did not like thick dumpling skins. Only then did the woman realise she had been using her hometown's recipe, which didn't match local tastes. When she got home, she started testing different methods. She rolled each dumpling skin 15 times until it became big, thin and even see through. But when she sold dumplings again, still no one bought them. The stall next to hers was full of customers, while her stall stayed empty. No matter how loudly she called out, it didn't help. By evening, the dumplings had lost their flavor. She held back tears and dumped the entire tray into the trash. But she didn't plan to give up. She let her landlord try the dumplings, but the landlord still said they weren't as thin as the local wonton wrappers in Hong Kong. The next day, the woman took her dumplings to a wonton shop to ask for advice. The shop owner said her dumplings were good, but to make the skin as thin as local wonton wrappers, she needed to add alkaline water. The woman went home and gave it a try. She added one bowl of alkaline water to the dough. Sure enough, the dumpling skins came out big and thin. But when she took a bite, she immediately spit it out. The dumplings had a Strong, bitter taste from the alkaline water. Then she saw some salt on the table. She added salt to the flour and slowly added the alkaline water in small amounts. She mixed it well until the flavors balanced. Finally, the thin dumpling wrappers were a success. When she brought the new dumplings back to the market, she received praise from the locals. The dumplings sold out quickly, but this drew the attention of a local gang leader. They came to collect Protection fees and even try to take her daughter. She grabbed a kitchen knife and stood in front of her daughters, ready to fight the gang leader.

That's how she got the supervisor's fingerprints. Her teammate then made an identical finger mold. Later, Lisa made her way to the bank president's office. Once the guard left, she pulled out a U V. Light from her bag and quickly scanned the painting on the wall. Lisa was pretending to be an art authenticator, but she was actually planning to rob the bank's vault. Nick recorded Lisa's every move on video, then slowed down the playback speed. He used this footage to replace the bank's surveillance feed. Lisa took the opportunity to locate the safe and attached an unlocking device to it. Meanwhile, the guard was staring at Lisa on the monitor, completely unaware that Lisa had already cracked the safe. After Lisa got the vault key, she immediately started laser scanning it. Nick received the data and used 3D printing tech to create an exact replica of the key. Once Lisa was finished, she put the key back in its original spot. But just then, the bank president walked in, completely messing up their plan. If the video loop ran out of time, the president appearing on the surveillance would definitely raise suspicions. So Lisa pulled out her phone and asked the president to take a work photo of her. But when he took the picture, he was still in the frame, so Lisa had to ask him to step back. A little more. The president backed up a few steps and walked out of the camera's view just as the video loop ended. This trick the security chief's eyes. At that point, Mike disguised himself as a janitor and entered the conference room. He used a scanner under the table to map out the vault structure below. But halfway through the scan, a group of people suddenly came in for a meeting. Mike got trapped under the table, and two documents fell from the table surface. Mike had no choice but to crank the scanners power to maximum. This triggered the alarm, and all the staff got up and left. Everyone gathered in the main hall. The military units across the street immediately mobilized and surrounded the entire bank. Lisa had just finished scanning the second key, but didn't have time to put it back in the safe, so she had no choice but to take it with her. Mike came to the stairwell for backup, and when no one was looking, Lisa quickly tossed the key to Mike. Mike immediately returned to the office and placed the key back in its spot. Just then, a security guard entered the room and Mike pretended to get startled. He explained he was wearing headphones and didn't hear the alarm. He successfully fooled the guard and escaped.

At that moment, the lights in her hand suddenly lit up. She was thrilled this meant her son could hear her. She asked if he was still alive. The lights flashed once. Her heart finally relaxed. But when she asked if he was safe, the lights flashed twice. Her hope shattered in an instant. To learn more about her son's situation, she quickly covered the wall with even more lights. Then she pried open a paint bucket and wrote all 26 letters of the alphabet at the positions corresponding to the lights. She asked him again, where are you now? Then the letters started to spell something. Good, good, good, good. That's good. Come on. Come on. I, g, ush, the ush, e, r, e, right here. The mother didn't understand what right here meant, so she asked again. Desperate, she still couldn't figure out what her son was trying to say.

En su lugar, fui a la habitación de ambos. Vi el dormitorio hecho un desastre. Mi corazón se hundió al instante. Mi esposa no tenía ni idea de que yo ya había vuelto antes de tiempo hasta que cayó el sol. Mi esposa regresó a casa apresuradamente. Cuando me vio, se quedó asombrada y me abrazó nerviosa, preguntándome con preocupación por qué había vuelto antes. No respondí directamente, sino que le pregunté dónde había estado. Al ver que mi esposa seguía mintiendo, decidí darle una última oportunidad, pero ella aún intentaba evadir la verdad. Desenmascaré su secreto, saqué la pistola con determinación y apreté el gatillo sin dudar. El disparo alertó al trabajador de afuera. Corrió a golpear la puerta, preguntando qué había pasado, pero disparé dos veces más hacia la ventana, asustando al trabajador que huyó de inmediato. Luego disparé una vez más al aire y moví el cuerpo de mi esposa a otra posición. Recogí los casquillos, borré las pruebas y los arrojé de nuevo al suelo. Me quité la ropa y la quemé. Finalmente, me lavé con agua caliente para eliminar toda evidencia del asesinato. Después de completar todo esto, no elegí escapar, sino esperar la llegada de la policía. La policía llegó rápidamente la escena del crimen. Tomé el teléfono con calma y solicité que un oficial llamado Nick entrara a negociar. Este hombre estaba confundido porque él no era un negociador experto. Ambos bajamos nuestras armas. Nick era precisamente el hombre que había tenido una aventura con mi esposa, pero él no me conocía en absoluto. Sabía quién era la mujer en la villa. Hasta que vio las fotos en la pared. No se dio cuenta de que era mi esposa. Corrió rápidamente hacia ella y descubrió que aún respiraba. En ese momento levanté la pistola de nuevo. Nick sintió un escalofrío en la espalda, me quitó la pistola de un golpe y me tiró al suelo. Los demás policías entraron en masa y lograron someterme. La policía comenzó inmediatamente a rescatar a mi esposa. Los ojos de Nick estaban llenos de odio y en ese momento, sentado en el coche patrulla, le mostré una sonrisa siniestra. Todo estaba saliendo según mi plan. La policía recopiló pruebas suficientes en la escena. Nick estaba decidido a no dejarme quedar impune. Encontró al fiscal a cargo del caso y entregó mi declaración mientras repetía la situación en la escena, el joven y prometedor fiscal le aseguró que no se preocupara porque en este campo tenía una tasa de condena del 97%. Al día siguiente, el fiscal comenzó a organizar los documentos relacionados. Pensaba que este caso era pan comido.

En ese momento el asesino sacó su arma. Cuando él apuntó a la niña, vio la cámara en su pecho. Ese segundo de duda le dio tiempo para escapar. Ella corrió hacia una casa y pidió ayuda gritando. El dueño abrió la puerta, pero una bala lo alcanzó. Antes de decir una palabra, el hombre reaccionó al fin. Retrocedió dentro de la casa y encontró las dos balas que le quedaban. Las cargó rápido. Cuando el asesino empujó la puerta, él disparó. Le dio al asesino, pero no fue un tiro mortal. Su arma solo tenía una bala más, pero el asesino no lo sabía. La tensión congeló a los dos. Nadie se movió. El hombre rompió el silencio. Le dijo al asesino que se fuera, que ya había llamado a la policía. El asesino salió, pero solo para buscar un teléfono.

Para estar seguro, el hombre hizo que la niña se escondiera en el baño. Él bajó con dificultad a revisar. No vio a nadie. Estaba a punto de relajarse cuando pisó unas botas. Luego escuchó pasos lentos. Viniendo de arriba, entendió que el asesino probablemente ya había subido. Fue afuera rápido y vio una escalera.

Comprendí que los policías venían por mí. No dudé ni un momento. Dejé el tenedor sobre la mesa, pagué la cuenta y puse las manos sobre la mesa.

Pero no dije nada. Solo observé cada detalle de la comisaría. Mi comportamiento enfureció al jefe, quien decidió encerrarme en una celda. En ese momento crítico, un detective negro intervino. Este detective, que parecía confiable, me llevó a una sala de reuniones y me explicó la situación. Resultó que anteayer por la noche hubo un asesinato violento en el pueblo. La víctima recibió dos disparos en la cabeza. Después de confirmar su muerte, el asesino no solo recuperó las balas, sino que también golpeó el cuerpo durante mucho tiempo.

Viajar 800km con un equipaje tan simple para honrar a un difunto resultaba difícil de creer. Así que antes de encontrar una coartada, el detective me encerró.

Looking at the adorable little girl, even he couldn't help but smile softly. Soon the train arrived at Hell Station. The guilty souls around him were being pulled down by some unseen force. He tried to reassure the little girl with his eyes, telling her not to be afraid. It was just a game. What happens next left him stunned. The little girl's parents suddenly began floating upward before being sucked into hell. His eyes widened in disbelief. He'd always believed that such a happy family of three would surely end up in heaven together. He immediately scooped up the frightened little girl and got off at heaven station. The security angel explained that the baby's pure soul could enter directly without screaming. As the staff carried her away, she kept smiling back at him. All he could do was wave back, his heart heavy. Meanwhile, the parents who Denard Hellworth frantically searching for their daughter. Instead, security sent them straight to the lake of fire. They struggled to climb out, refusing to accept their punishment. The just wanted one answer. They did never committed any crimes in their lives. Why were they being sent to hell? Sure, life had been tough and they'd been forced to make that choice. To help them understand, the staff played them an audio recording their final conversation. Before death. But their daughter, at even a month old, couldn't speak or understand what they were saying. The staff used the translation device to interpret for them. It turned out their daughter had wanted to keep living, but they'd made the decision for her that was their greatest sin.

Elderly patients soaking in Neal water could reportedly heal injuries, attracting numerous wealthy individuals, even those with advanced cancer. Strangely, this clinic draws many visitors daily, but no one never leaves. This mysterious clinic is nestled atop the Alps. John, traveling 6,000 kilometers, arrived, seeking to save his company's stock, which had plummeted significantly. Only the CEO's return could stabilize the situation, but he was told the visitation hours had ended. The nurse refused to allow him to see anyone. Frustrated, John reported to his superiors outside, but surprisingly, there was no cell service whatsoever. An elderly man accidentally kicked a ball into the bushes. John, being helpful, went to retrieve it and heard strange noises coming from a nearby vet. Without further thought, John departed by car, planning to return the next day. However, a girl was standing on the roof, watching him intently. Wherever John went, he could see the girl in his rearview mirror. Before John could react, he woke up three days later with both legs in plaster casts. The clinic's director was waiting in his room, having completed his checkup. The director instructed him to rest, and a nurse brought him a glass of water. The director insisted he drink it completely. John drank the water, but discovered a wriggling worm clinging to the glass.

I'm here to babysit your son Tyler. Tyler's just in the other room taking a nap. I brought some toys for him to play with when he wakes up. I'm hungry. There better be some pie left. Is that Tyler's brother? No, that's Tyler. Um, how old is he exactly? 14. But we don't trust him to stay home alone. Oh, hold on. I'm not sure. There's a few basic things you should know. He can't drink pop or he will freak out. And absolutely no ice of any kind or he will freak out. And he has to put on his pull UPS before bed. But you can't call him diapers or he will freak out. They're his space pants. Oh, uh, one more thing. Tyler thinks he's babysitting you and if he finds out that you're babysitting him, he will freak out. Big freak out. Tyler, what you watching? We make a party. You know, you were not allowed to watch that stuff. You're not in charge. I am. That's right, Tyler, you're in charge. And as my babysitter, you shouldn't let me watch that stuff. Then go to bed. I don't have a bed, so why don't I sleep here on the couch? Will you stop whining? What's that? My ortho says I have to wear this at least 10 hours a night. Is there anything special you need to wear at night? No, I'm gonna let You in on a little secret? I'm a bed wetter. Every night before I go to sleep, I put on my high techs face pants. You're a nerd up there and a nerd down there. All right. I'm taking it from here. Going home. Okay, Tyler, time for bed. Turn off the TV. Dad, are you okay? Nope. That kid freaked.

They didn't dare to act recklessly and had to confirm if she was really blind. That made them completely drop their guard, so they started stealing without hesitation. Lisa had no choice but to look for a chance to call the police. I wanna order pizza. It's just a pizza. Yes, everything is correct. Hearing the call, the two men relaxed even more and kept searching for valuables. They told me to say faster. Oh, I know the system. We need the owner's phone to open it. To open the safe, they needed Lisa's phone. Lisa failed to block their move, so she had to pretend to stay calm. It needs her face. John grabbed the phone and tried to unlock it. Lisa quickly put on a face mask, which drove John crazy. Sam used the unlocked phone and managed to open the safe. Seeing the pile of cash inside, the two of them were thrilled. But Lisa grew more anxious. She came up with a plan. Dancing my whole life. Shower time. John was stunned by what he saw. Hey, where are you going? We got the money. We gotta get out of here. Blinded by lust, John followed her, unaware that Lisa was in full control. Let's take a look at the new hair. Beautiful. She's not blind. What the hell?

Nick pulled back the curtain, only to see that the person before him was disabled. Mia looked at Nick with joy, but was met only with mockery. It seems that the Baesler is not very happy with his choice. Mia had to ask if he had really chosen her. Yes, I did. But there was one more selection around the head dancing. Even though Nick knew Mia couldn't stand on her own, he still deliberately made things difficult for her. The other women joined in with his taunts. Mia tried to enter the ballroom, but they stopped her. He made up the dance round to get rid of you. He wants to carry a girl in his arms because he's in love, not because her legs don't work. Faced with ridicule from everyone, Mia refused to give up. She was determined to fight for love and join the dance. Without hesitation, she appeared in her own unique way, catching Nick's attention immediately. He was moved by her courage. Shall we dance? If you catch me, it's your last chance. I caught it. The two began to lose themselves in the dance. Nick looked at Mia with a different kind of gaze, one filled with curiosity and understanding. I think we can all go home. Well, no, this damn cripple can't win over me. But Mia had no idea that danger was approaching. She was still lost at that moment. While Lisa began to make her move, the Bachelor should consider every girl. I think the Bachelor has already made his choice. He hasn't received a gift from me yet. Lisa kept trying to seduce Nick, even though he rejected her. She used the rules to force him, leaving Nick no choice but to walk away. For the moment, Lisa took advantage of it and sent all the other women away. You won't choose the either because you won't be here anymore. She walked up to the curtains, pulling out a lighter. Mia's.

A 450 pound competitive eater was heading home, completely unaware of the dark shadow flashing behind him. The next second, his entire body convulsed violently. His body shriveled up right before his eyes. And within moments, he turned into a mummified corpse. According to the autopsy report, his heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys had all been crushed. This bizarre manner of death caught the FBI's attention. Agent Dean discovered the victim had just won a competitive eating championship. The only person who had beef with him had an airtight alibi. Just when they hit a dead end, another body turned up at a gym. The victim looked eerily similar to the competitive eater. Actually, the identical would be more accurate. Both victims had a red suction Mark on their back.

Couple swayed passionately on the dance floor, while she stood alone in the corner, drenched in loneliness. Suddenly she caught sight of her husband walking upstairs with a strange woman rushing after them. The scene that greeted her shattered her heart completely. Tears streaming down her face, she fled the ballroom in anguish. Once he had sworn to stay by her side forever, but now he openly embraced another. She could not bear the betrayal.

That day, a 450 pound competitive eater was heading home, completely unaware of the dark shadow flashing behind him. The next second, his entire body convulsed violently. His body shriveled up right before his eyes and within moments, he turned into a mummified corpse. According to the autopsy report, his heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys had all been crushed. This bizarre manner of death caught the FBI's attention. Agent Dean discovered the victim had just won a competitive eating championship. The only person who had beef with him had an airtight alibi. Just when they hit a dead end, another body turned up at a gym. The victim looked eerily similar to the competitive eater.

They not only beat her until her nose bled, but they even threw her out of the door. At first, Catherine didn't understand why, but soon she realized it was all done under Peter's orders. The reason, she had simply displeased him. Just a few days earlier, Peter had shot her pet brown bear at a party and Catherine had been furious, so she slapped Peter across the face right then and there. That slap embarrassed Peter in front of everyone. So afterward, he punished her harshly and warned her to watch her behavior. Catherine wasn't the type to just stay quiet. She began plotting to escape the palace secretly. Peter found out almost immediately, which made him despise her even more. He decided to stage an accident, get rid of Catherine and marry a more obedient queen. Many ministers tried to plead for her, but Peter rejected them all without hesitation. Catherine, however, had no idea she was in danger and was still enjoying her time in the palace. Fortunately, one minister stepped in to warn her. I told her she needed to start appeasing Peter right away or she'd lose her head. First, Catherine didn't believe it until she saw her maid being whipped. Only then did she realize how serious the situation was. That very night at the banquet, Catherine apologized to Peter in front of everyone, promising she would learn to be an obedient wife. Her Humility pleased Peter greatly, and he forgave her on the spot. Little did he know this was all part of Catherine's plan.

The biggest lottery winner of all time. This is Edwin Castro. And in 2023, his two dollar winning powerball ticket won him over 2.2 billion dollars. After paying taxes, Edwin only took home 800 million dollars cash, paying nearly 1.3 billion in tax. He could care less, wasting no time when it came to spending his cash. Edwin first bought three 13 bathroom mansions in Hollywood and Los Angeles, totaling up to 67 million in houses alone. He also started expanding his million dollar car collection, such as multiple different vintage Ferraris and Mercedes. He even got a girlfriend who was a model. But there was a massive problem Edwin was facing. Despite being the luckiest man on earth, another man by the name of Jose Rivera filed a lawsuit against Edwin after he cashed the ticket, with Jose claiming that he stole the ticket from him and that he was the rightful owner. Custer's gonna raid it. He's not pained for what he's done. The case went on for over a year until it was dismissed by a judge in court on October 1st, 2,024, ruling that Edwin was the rightful owner of the ticket, being able to keep every penny of his fortune. As of today, Edwin keeps out of the public eye.

The girl who went viral nearly a year ago for saying this. Oh, you gotta give him that hock too and spit on that thing. You get me. This is Haley Welch. And in summer 2024, she sent shockwaves across the internet after a clip of her giving a crazy response to a question asked by an interviewer garnered hundreds of millions of views. People online then went on to find the girl in the original video, leading them to Haley Welch's TikTok and Instagram. With her accounts gaining millions of followers overnight, Haley knew she had a massive opportunity to capitalize on her fame. So she started to take social media more seriously and built a massive following, launching her own podcast called talk to a, as well as several merch lines containing her iconic catchphrase, making her millions of dollars in the process. But she would soon make a career ending decision after this. In December 2,024, Haley partnered with some shady investors and urged her fans to buy her new meme coin called Hawk. Upon its launch, it accumulated over $500 million in market value until the majority of it was sold by her and the investors she partnered with, making it an illegal pump and dump scheme. People online were outraged.

However, its greatest function is not to eat. It's a fortune teller. Just eat in the direction of the sushi's fall, and it will guide you to whatever you want. But ordinary people can't even eat two meters of it. To make this sushi, Toriko went to a dirty sushi master, Masuko. Because Toriko's wish was too big, Masuko doesn't have the ingredients to make sushi. Toriko set out to find the ingredients. First, they went to New Energy Village. They shook a turtle and got seaweed. Then they caught a ten billion dollar mermaid fish. Then they went to Ogima to get the rice vinegar for sushi. Risking death by stench, he brought back a nuclear durian with a terrible stench. Finally, Toriko had gathered all the ingredients. But looking at Masuko's creepy face, Toriko was worried that the food would be ruined. But now it's too late for him to regret. The villagers are carrying a huge plate. The giant plate is 100 meters long, 50 meters wide. It looks 10 times bigger than a wrestler's ring. And Masuko is ready to try. Picks up a piece of fish that weighs more than he does and throws it to the center of the ring. As the bell rings for the match, Masuko begins his performance. He leaps up! He leapt up and hit the fish with a flying pounce, followed by a backbreaker to fish Before fish could react, Masuko used his sauce coated crunchy wounds. Masuko's sauce coated crunches on the fish. As Masuko punched the fish again and again, the flesh of the fish really becomes more delicate. It's so clean and hygienic. And then Masuko took out the nuclear durian and the mackerel using the same technique as before. Finally, he relaxes the seaweed all over that. That's all. The cooking continues from day to night and from night to day. After three days and three nights of training, Masuko was drained of his last ounce of energy. The divination sushi was finally completed. The huge sushi was like a pillar in the sky. Even the clouds in the sky were pierced by it. Toriko made a wish to find the forest food temple. The giant sushi began to sway. Finally, the sushi falls. Now, if Toriko finishes the sushi, Toriko will find the legendary forest food temple.

She had planned to prank me, but she didn't expect it would expose my secret instead. But then I quickly came up with an idea and I started laughing loudly. Why are you laughing?

He was about to drive out, but the next second, he noticed something wrong with the tire. So he quickly got out to check. Soon he found a nail stuck in it. Seeing my plan succeed, I hurried over to him. You know what? I have a friend who runs a repair shop nearby. I think we should take you there. And Gail, buddy, you're a lifesaver. Yeah, no problem. Thanks. I'll, I'll take care of everything. He didn't think much and agreed right away. Once we got to the repair shop, I said I needed the restroom and snuck into the office. Then my friend and I stuffed all the fake cash into the tire. After we were done, we pushed the tire back. Then we told the workers to install it immediately. When we returned home with the repaired car, I quickly told the rich man to go rest. I had no idea he had already fallen into my trap. Once he entered his room, I immediately took the tire off again and I quietly Walked over to the safe. Next. I used the tools I brought to get his fingerprints. But the first time I entered the code, the alarm went off. It scared me half to death. Luckily, it didn't wake him up. Unwilling to give up, I tried again and somehow I actually guessed it. Right after opening the safe, I grabbed all the money. Then I put all the fake bills from the tire inside. Once everything was done, I was about to put the tire filled with real cash back on the car. But at that moment, the rich man suddenly woke up. He found me and said his safe had been robbed. I was stunned, too. I clearly put all the fake cash into it. How could it be empty? So I followed him to the safe and sure enough, all the money was gone. Then he said that money was extremely important. It was supposed to pay for his daughter's treatment. But I didn't believe him. For someone like him, that amount was basically pocket change. But then he told me he was already bankrupt. Even the house wasn't his anymore. He couldn't even afford his daughter's medical bills. Seeing how pitiful he was, I couldn't bear to steal from him anymore. So I went back to the garage and retrieved the money hidden inside the tire. Then I explained everything to him. But it seemed he already knew all along. I know. And the thief, by the Way already has been caught. Caught? Mm hmm. What do you mean caught? How? Where? Don't you recognize your partner?

But he made a mistake. He accidentally swallowed a nail. Suddenly, he felt like throwing up. And then something unbelievable happened. He didn't throw up the nail. He threw up an egg. The crowd was stunned and started throwing money at it. The boy couldn't believe it. His very first show had just paid for half a month's expenses for him and his mom. Excited, he ran home and shouted, mom, shake me! And when his mom gave him a little shake, coins started falling out of his body. Seeing her smile, the boy made a promise. Someday he'd turn those coins into gold. But as he grew up, he Learned the hard truth. Doing street magic barely bought three meals a day. He felt ashamed because he couldn't keep that childhood promise. Meanwhile, a magician named Houdini was doing a handcuff escape act when a cop suddenly stepped forward to challenge him. He locked real handcuffs on Houdini and said, let's see you get out of these in front of everyone. But Houdini stayed calm. He pulled out a wire from his belt, and in just seconds, he broke free. The crowd went crazy. And that's when Houdini had a big idea. The next day, he walked into a police station, got all his savings, and made a weird request. The warden agreed and punched him with a blow so strong it could knock out an Elephant! But Houdini didn't cry. He smiled as if he liked it. Embarrassed, the warden locked him up. But that was exactly what Houdini wanted. His real plan? Escape from jail and become famous. Before entering, Houdini's wife kissed him and passed something to him. The warden got suspicious and checked Houdini's mouth, but found nothing. Still, he warned, if you escape, I'll make sure you're arrested for real. Once everyone left, Houdini began his real magic. And soon he escaped. Overnight, Houdini became a star. But he needed something bigger. Something that would blow up his fame. So he went to the toughest prison in the world and made a bet. Chain me in a thousand pounds of steel, I'll still escape. The guards sealed his mouth, took pictures and bragged about their perfect security. But the second they walked out, Houdini used his sixth finger and vanished. In three minutes, only the chains remained. That escape earned him a new title. The King of escapes. But Houdini wasn't done. Next, he had himself locked upside down inside a tank of water, hands chained. No way out. This wasn't just a trick. If he failed, he'd lose both his life and his fame. Five minutes passed, then 10, then 25. The crowd panicked. No one can hold their breath that long. People screamed. Break the tank! Save it! The assistant called the fireman. They smashed open the. But it was empty. Houdini's legend grew even bigger soon after the President of Germany invited him. And there Houdini performed a trick no one had ever seen. He stood between in two targets and announced, I'll catch the bullet with my mouth. The soldier hesitated, but fired. And yes, Houdini caught the bullet. But here's the secret. He had placed a magnet inside the gun. It stopped the bullet and the soldier had actually fired blanks. Simple trick, world changing fame. Next, the Russian royal family called him. Houdini told everyone, write your wishes on paper. The princess picked one. The queen read it out loud. And then a bell rang outside the palace. The same bell that hadn't wrong in hundreds of years. Its rope had snapped long ago, but somehow it rang. Everyone in the royal court fell to their knees. They called Houdini the god of magic. But what they didn't know was that Houdini had already planned it. He had a sniper with a silenced gun hidden across the street. And when the princess pulled the rope, the sniper shot the well. After that, Oudini's fame spread across the entire planet. And finally, he kept that childhood promise. He earned enough money to give his mother everything she ever wanted. But times change. Technology advanced and people stopped coming to magic shows. Now they were drawn to cinema, laughing non stop at Charlie Chaplin. Houdini hated it. So he made a bold decision. He took his magic show out of the theater and onto a frozen lake. He chained himself up and jumped from a 100 foot bridge into icy water. Underwater he unlocked the chains.

The job is super simple. All you have to do is feed the aliens. Safety isn't an issue. The facility uses reinforced specialized glass. As long as nothing goes wrong, you won't be in any life threatening danger. Even though these creatures come from outer space, their diet is easy to manage. The eyeball monster is parasitic inside a sheep. So feeding the sheep is the same as feeding the eyeball monster. Next up is a creature that looks like a man eating plant.

Her aunt insisted that she marry her own son. Seeing the reluctant look on Teresa's face, her aunt began to belittle her outright. We don't even know who your mother was. Illegitimate, have been dealt an unlucky hand. We should consider ourselves lucky that you have come here. Teresa had been fostered at her aunt's house since she was a child. She never dared to express her true thoughts. Faced with her aunt's request, she could only endure it silently. Although she became Camille's wife, Camille did not change his attitude at all. After the marriage, he did not show her any extra care or affection. Every time night fell, Camille completely ignored her feelings, fell asleep immediately as soon as he lay down. No matter how Teresa called him, Camille remained indifferent. The double torment of mental and physical suffering made Teresa fall into melancholy. She was unwilling to live such a lifeless married life, until one day a friend of Camille's came to visit their home. Lauren was a philandering painter. Just one glance exchanged between Teresa and him ignited the desire in her heart. As someone who was well versed in romantic relationships, Lauren naturally understood what Teresa was thinking. So when he was painting a portrait of Camille, he deliberately told stories about his romantic adventures. These teasing words made Teresa's heart no longer calm. It was not until her aunt walked in that she pulled her thoughts back. After the portrait was finished, Camille was overjoyed when he looked at it. He decided to buy a bottle of champagne to celebrate and left only Theresa and Lauren behind. Lauren ordered Theresa to take off her clothes, and Theresa had been waiting for this moment for a long time. The two fell in love with each other after that. The two often secretly met in the attic. Although Teresa did not know how long this relationship would last, she clearly knew that she was only happy when she was with Lauren. When Teresa returned home, looking at her weak husband lying on the bed, her heart was filled with disgust. Camille sensed the change in Teresa. He thought the reason why his wife was starting to distance herself from him was that she did not like the life in the city. So he decided to move back to the countryside. But this threw Teresa into a panic.

I have a man's lung in my hand. We're working as fast as we can. How long do you need? 15 minutes 15 no more. I found him in 0 R2 0 r two. We evacuated that floor ages ago. We're in the middle of the thoracotomy. Hey, Maggie, can you take over for him there? You need some oxygen? Not until my patient's stable. You okay? Yeah, I think so. You sure? Yeah. Look, I'm sorry if I scared you. I'm I was fine. I'm fine. It's just you're gonna need to breathe when I when I tell you what I have to tell you. So take a deep breath for me so I know that you can. What do you mean? What do you wanna tell me? Okay, so remember the dream where they come back to us? HM Derek forgets his keys and Megan goes for for coffee. Yeah. What about what about it, Nathan? They found Megan. She's alive. That's not funny. The army called Owen this morning.

What would you tell to the university students who is trying to advocate for that, um, in their university to make a change? Yeah, I mean, boy, it's a tough question. I would, I would try to graduate as quickly as possible, get the degree, stand for your own beliefs and your own conviction. These institutions, if they keep on doing d I and CRT, their money is going to dry up. President Trump is gonna defund schools like this if they keep on doing affirmative action. Yeah, he signed the executive order not gonna put up with it. And there's a lot of federal money that, that comes into these institutions. So try to graduate as quickly as possible. Thank you so much. Under Trump's administration, uh, how is energy production gonna benefit us the most? Well, we're gonna drill, baby, drill. Um, and we are going to fix the strategic problem patrolling reserve. One part of this that we're gonna, we're gonna lower gas prices. But think about what's actually raising gas prices. In addition, it's actually not as bad as it was cause Biden has opened up the strategic patrolling reserve to, to lower gas prices for the election. Um, and the Russian Ukrainian war, that war is artificially boosting gas prices. And also make sure we don't go to war against Iran, which would be a profound mistake for Our country. So that that's a really, really important thing. Drill, baby, drill domestically, peace in the Middle East, peace with Russia, Ukraine. You'll see gas prices go down to 30 bucks a barrel. Charlie, what does that mean? Dollar seventy five a gallon. That's what it means. Okay. Because, wait, can you be racist against white people? No, bro. I'm a cracker, bro. What the fuck? No, you can't be racist towards my bro. There's so many crackers here, bro. Haha. What is racism? Oh, it's discrimination based on the color of the skin. Based on the color of the skin. Got it. Thank you. So isn't it racist then to then penalize white people to come into college or to get jobs based on the color of their skin? Wouldn't that be racist? Your world view is indistinguishable from the KKK that you want that you want to organize the world based on skin color. We want to organize the world based on merit and character. I think that all communities will do even better when we stop living under the soft bigotry of low expectations. Inherent in your argument is that we have to pander to certain communities based on the color of their skin because they can't do as well as white people. I want to thank you for something. Oh, yeah. You, you are a perfect reminder why we won a November. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

Thank you. Yeah, okay. Thank you for letting me speak I'm studying abroad from Italy for this semester. I sorry, yeah, from Roma. I I've seen your videos online and I really respect what what you're doing here I have a question cause in Europe we are facing the same problem with illegal immigration and what are your stance on illegal families who came here many years ago and now are working and paying taxes in your country? Every person who has come here illegally must be returned to their country of origin and and I completely agree with you um, I'm here to say something I really like the speech that JD Vance did in Munich after the terrorist attack do we like JD Vance? Everybody isn't JD great well, I'm not American, but I like him too if I were American, I would have voted for him however, um, in in Europe we are having a a big problem with illegal immigration people are coming they don't they don't respect our laws that raping women stabbing is dangerous to go around so it I don't understand when people come here to talk to you liberals and Democrats saying that they want to welcome them because you don't know who's entering in your country amen and I'll tell you we need more legal immigrants like you in this country I'll tell you what and it makes me upset that for me for me it's difficult I'm Respecting the law, I'm here. If I, I have to be here legally, I'm gonna go back to Italy cause I cannot work. And it makes me upset seeing someone that comes here illegally and does whatever he wants. That's it. God bless you. You want a hat? If I can have a white one, because I already have a white one. Alright. Make Italy great again. Okay, very good. I wish, unfortunately, with welfare, you can get more money for single mother assistance. This is very true. And, and so we. Right. You agree. We're actually subsidizing single motherhood more than we are subsidizing family formation. The No. 1 objective of any social welfare program should be how do we keep the family together and put dads back in the family? that is the No. 1 priority.

That attitude is why we're $35 trillion in debt. Secondly, which is very important, if you analyze Doja's savings, you know how much they're on pace to save this year? A trillion dollars. One trillion dollars. Which would then get us on path for a balance budget. They're on pace because you say, oh, it's only a billionaire. They've been in for six weeks. They've already saved $100 billion. Yeah, but by December, they'll be at a trillion. Our deficit is 1.6 trillion. We're gonna lower our deficit in such an increasingly important way, and you're gonna learn that you actually don't need these government agencies to run a country, that these people are unnecessary. It's bloated. These bureaucrats don't do anything all day long, and we need to right size it because we're a nation in debt. We know we're $35 trillion in debt. Yes. In debt. Yes. And the only way we're gonna get out of it is if we're honest. Be like, how about no more empty buildings? No more $115 for equity assessment? The way we get out of it is by biodiversity in Nepal. $19 million. Again, those can be important. You guys are like, those could be helpful. Okay, so how could biodiversity in Nepal for 19 million bucks? We spent $20 million for a new Sesame Street in Iraq. It's true. You guys can look it up. $20 million for new Sesame Street in Iraq. And because no one has ever had the courage, To look through the books and look and examine the expenditures. That's not what's happening. No, it has happened. No, Biden, Obama, they never look through any of the federal expenditures, and we got to $35 trillion in debt. This is the first time in my lifetime we have an administration going after the waste, going after the size of government to balance the budget so that you guys don't live as indentured servants and Russian serfs for the rest of your life. Tell him, Charlie. Tell him. Well, I just want to say, like. What? Never mind. Go ahead. You don't need to interrupt people. Thank you. The point is when you, when you want to deal with this problem, you can either increase taxes or cut spending massively. Like, the point is that, like, these programs aren't, aren't efficient and helpful for getting to that goal. Yes, they, I, I just proved to you that they're on pace. Trillion dollars a cup. Like, but. But even if it's only a billion or two billion, that's admirable and noble. That's my. Just so you understand, just so we're clear, it's your fault. You have to do. You have to both justify that these programs are bad and then. No, you can just. You can flash. This is a program. It cost this much money. We should admit it. That's not an argument. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia. Again, you can say that. You can say that. Do Do. Do you know anything about Liberia? I mean, like. I mean, no. I mean, I happen to know a lot about it. Again, that's a separate issue. But it's not about what I know. It's about the people in the government making these decisions. Yes, and they. They have proven themselves to be robber barons over the last 20 years. That they. That they have been spending your money with reckless abandon and total indiscretion. And it's time that this is what's important. It's we the people, not we the government workers, and we've taken back the government. The government. The government workers are also American people. Yes, but who works for who? Do we work for them or do they work for us? They work for us. They work for us. Which one? Yes, they work for. They work for us. Obviously they work for us. Yes. So we voted in November, by popular vote and electoral vote landslide, that this crap is over. And that's what we're doing. We. We overwhelmingly spoke. And so we're gonna go piece by piece, department by department. And this is why it's important. You guys deserve a future where you don't have $35 trillion in debt when you don't have a trillion dollars in debt. You're not solving that problem by doing this again. I have. Again, a trillion dollars. You have to address this. They're on pace to cut a trillion by December. That's big. Big. That's. That's. That's 75% of Our deficit. Okay, but my point. My point is that, like, you have to meaningfully increase taxes or cut. No, you don't like cuts. Yes, you do. Well, I know that's what he's doing. They are meaningfully cutting spending. Do you have to get the tax. Is it either raise taxes? No, you don't. Or cut. Or massively cut spending. Got it. Let me just. Let me just. Let me just ask one. One final question. Yes? If Trump and Elon get this done and balance the budget and cut all this, will you give them credit? It depends on how successful. But. Wait, I am not finished speaking. Oh, my god. It depends on how successful the country is afterwards. It depends if you make a lot of cuts and the country becomes worse that you didn't do your job. Okay, we'll see what happens. Thank you.

To answer your question, a country that ceases to secure its own sovereignty and does not think I care more about my own people and the foreigners ceases to be a country. You're a colony and you're something else. And we are seeing our generosity be taken advantage of. I am all for American charities going down to pan Panama and helping out. I'm all for people giving to charity, when you start to see the government give preference and priority to not even on taxpayers, that's why you get the rise of Trump. So we should reallocate US spending towards things that are actually effective for evil in and outside of our borders. Well, so then we don't have people coming into our borders and then we can help our people. Well, No, the way. Again, if they come to the border and the border is closed and you say, Asta LA Vista, go back to Nicaragua. We. We spend in Central America. They don't have to come to the US. No, and then we have a better US. That's the same amount of spending. No, no, it's the first of all, if you. To solve the problems of the Third World would cost trillions of dollars and that would all be laundered and not even work. And again, it's not the position of the American government to go throw money around in the Southern Triangle. Instead, it's our country's closed. We're not open for looting anymore. Don't make Nicaragua great again or go do what El Salvador has done. El Salvador is now a safe and stable country and they're seeing their GDP go up and it's not because of us. Yeah, it is. We put $4 billion into Central America. Hold on, hold on. And you know, Buchanan barely took the money. You know why it's safe? Bucarelli has turned El Salvador safe cause he locked up all the criminals. He locked up 40,000 criminals and put them in prisons. And El Salvador is now safer than America. El Salvador was the murder capital of the world. And now El Salvador is much safer than America. I think it's wrong if you guys are afraid to walk the streets of Denver at night. I wouldn't walk the streets of Denver at night. Would you guys? No, that's A breakdown of the fundamental role of government. Would you guys walk the streets of LA at night? No. The streets of San Francisco? No. We can't walk our own greatest cities at night. And we want to bring in more people from the Third World? Hell, no.

Five years, I think I was in every country, but France was the best. Italy would be second for me. Russia is not desirable. Ukraine, it's okay. So, uh, when do you get out? When it is discharged. Even my captain gets transferred. The end of my second war. Jesus. I'm going home now. Manheim. I'll take this one. Cost got bitter. Okay. Hey, Webster. My relief. Don't salute the Germans. Oh, come on. I said to get a kick out of it. Anyway, I got me a new winner. Jacks 75 points. How about you? I mean, you're a Tacoma guy, right? I'm a new guy. Wouldn't you like to know? Discharged, huh? Go ahead, take off. It's my turn. Okay. See you back at the farm. 81. I have 81 points. Hahaha. Is that good enough

Well, we only go there once a year, so it's not that big of a deal. Tammy, I love your necklace. Oh, I got this on my first trip to Hong Kong. You know, next time you get pearls, you've got to get them in Hong Kong. You save so much money, it pays for the plane ticket. It would have to. Haha. So what do you do for fun, Mike? What do you mean? You know, fun. Uh, I play tennis, some extreme skiing. Uh, I don't know. I like extreme TV. Also, I like the barbecue. I love barbecue. Do you have a smoker? Uh, only when the grease builds up on the grill and it catches fire. Ah, well, you have to get a smoker. They can be a little expensive, but they're worth it. Wait till the end of the season, though, when they're marked down. You can get one for a couple of thou. So, pretty slim hotel pickings here in Gumpford, huh? Yeah. Where are you guys staying? Oh, with sue and Lexi. Oh, you're so lucky. A sleepover? Oh, I just knew we would love you. And I do. Don't we just love them? Uh, let me have another beer before I decide if I love him. Oh, he loves you. Haha. Again?

There's no way these people would eat at some dumpy barbecue joint. I mean, we would, but you must be the hex. Oh my God. I love your Son. I love your daughter too. Get up. Get up. I'mma hug her. Oh, hi. Hi. Hi. Oh, I hope you didn't want to go to someplace fancy. We just love the barbecue here. They have Flint stone sized ribs here. I love a hunk of meat that'll tip your car over. No, are you kidding? This is great. Sorry we're late. We were at the game. What an ending, right? Yep. Uh oh. Check it out. Tam. Tam, we're already a beer behind. Not Fair, Mike. Frankie, I gotta brag about your son. Axel is the perfect gentleman. You did something right. What is it? Tell us. Haha. we had him up to the lakehouse last weekend and he was such a helper. It was amazing. I just love that about Axel. I wish she was that way around our house. Yeah. Hey, tell you what, you take Lexi, we'll take Axel and we can report back to each other about how great our kids are. Deal. Cheers to that. Cheers. Yeah. So, Mike, what kind of work do you do? I work at a quarry. No kidding. See, Tammy, this guy is salt of the earth. He got a man's job. I like that. I spend half my time on airplanes. Listen, we're trying to decide between granite and marble for the bar in the game room. What would you do? Well, granite, stronger, depends on how many bar fights you plan on having. Haha.
