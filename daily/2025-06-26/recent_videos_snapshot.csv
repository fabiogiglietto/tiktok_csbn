I'd be willing to pay you for your time and inconvenience, because I moved out of there rather quickly, and it was a quick sale, and, you know, I got everything moved into my new place, and I realized I didn't have some very valuable items. Wondering if I. What kind of. Okay. Why do you keep on saying the word zoom? Do you know what that means? Oh, yes. It means to dig something up. Right. But it usually means to. To dig up a body. Like a dead body. Oh, Oh, okay. Well, then maybe I should change my wording so that it's not so parent, I mean. Anyway, I'm so sorry. Um, yes, I need to dig up something in the backyard that I buried there. Did you say you need to change the wording so it's not so apparent? Oh, no, no, I. Well, if I said apparent, I didn't mean apparent. I meant so. Well, I guess there's another word for it. It wouldn't be so obvi obvious. No, that's not. Maybe not the word. Anyway, nothing. Nothing like that. There's just some very valuable things to me that are buried in the backyard, and I'd like to be able to come by and dig them up and take them home with me. How big of a hole do you need to dig? Well, between five, seven, and six feet. I don't know exactly, but yes, that's about the size of the hole I would need to dig. Okay, now this is sounding even more creepy. All right, you just got. You described it. The exact specifications of a person. What is very back here. Many things are 5 8. Between 5 8 and 6 feet. For example, like, a door could be 6 feet tall. What door is six feet tall? It sounds like you murdered someone and buried them in the backyard. What the is going on? I'm so sorry if it's coming across as murderous. I didn't mean it first come across that way. No, it's just some cans of stew. Cans of stew? Yes, just some cans of stew. Didn't want anybody be able to find my stew. Okay, now you're sounding like you're using the word stew in both the name stew and the actual food stew. And it's even creepier. You're telling me you buried cans of the food stew? Okay, that's it. I'm calling the cops right now. Okay, don't do that. This is actually Jubal from the Jubal Show doing a phone prank on you and your girlfriend set you up. Are you serious? It's a joke. She said that you just bought a new house and wanted to creep you out. Hahaha! Okay, well I'm definitely never having stew again, that's for sure. Hahaha!

It's way more embarrassing for her. Jenna, are you still on the phone? Oh, Jenna, I am. Hi. How many shades of red are you right now, Jenna? About a million. Um, like a whole rainbow of red. I do not remember saying that, Brandon. I thought I remembered everything that happened that night, but apparently I was wrong. How do you not remember that? You must have said it like 30 times in 45 minutes or so. Like, you don't remember this? That you wanted me to call you Mrs. Cratchit the whole time? Haha, tight. Tim and Mrs. Cratchit. It was weird.

But you could have, like, I don't know, said, hey, you owe me a coffee, and then, like, us have a conversation about it instead of just ghosting me. Like, I thought, you know, like, whatever. If you don't wanna do that thing again, that's fine. But I thought if you don't wanna role play Tiny Tim and Miss Cratchit in the bedroom. She has a very good point, Brandon. I'm sorry. I'm. I'm a Pretty honest person. And it just is what it is. Like, we had a connection, and now we don't have a connection. I'll be honest. Like, I don't feel that great about it. Um, well, then you're obviously, like, kind of a dead inside jerk. I mean, what? How can you just, like, have a connection and then be like, no, no, never happened? Like what? Like, you either have a real connection or you don't, or you're dead inside, which you're. You're obviously dead inside. So, Brandon, I would love to ask if you will go on a second date with Jenna. Wow. We will. We will pay for it. Oh, god. I don't think I can sit at a table and look her in the eyes at this point. Wow. So that's a no? You know, I. Honestly, it's just. It was too weird for me. You know, like, we were these characters and in. In this play, and then you go back to my place, and all of a sudden, it's Trinity's. Him and Mrs. Cratchit hanging out in bed naked. It's too weird. It's really weird. But an interesting continuation to the whole thing. All right, well, Jenna, I'm sorry you didn't get your second date. Yeah, I'm not sorry. And, you know, obviously this jerk doesn't understand, like, what happens when you get wasted and have some fun. Yeah, some. Sometimes you get wasted and you hook up with Tiny Tim. So gross, man. Yeah.

I was looking for Frank. Speaking. You're calling from where? Netflix. Netflix, yeah. First, first of all. Okay. I wanna thank you for being a valued customer. Um, I'm kind of okay with what I got right now. I really don't need anything new or extra. No, no, no. I'm not trying to sell you anything. I just need to talk to you for a second. I'm with the customer care division. Um, and there's. Alright. There's another reason that I'm calling. It's because we're actually a little concerned about you. Excuse me? Yeah. We're a little concerned. Okay. About what? Well, we keep track of how much Netflix you're watching. What you watch? How much you watch. And we believe that you've actually been watching an unhealthy amount of T V. You're doing what? You're. You're tracking what I'm watching? Yeah, we do that for research and everything else. And then every once in a while, we'll notice somebody like you who's been watching a lot of T V. And just as a service, we'll call them to be like, hey, it might be time to think about adding some other things to your life. Like maybe getting out, meeting some friends, doing some. Wait, wait, wait a minute. It's my business, what I do in my house. I'm paying for that service, right? So, yes. I don't need you to be telling me what I should be doing in my own House, when I'm paying for it? Well, it's kind of. It's our new initiative. See, we're trying to help people get a little more active, sort of get a life and, uh. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What are you. What are you, the active police? People binge watch Netflix, so. Yes. Freaking what? They don't do it quite on your level though, is what I'm saying. Well, because I'm watching it, I'm paying for the service. Yes, but we've been calling some of our lazier customers, trying to help them. Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on a second here, alright? You're now calling me out of the blue, disturbing my day, and you're telling me that you're watching what I watch, and now you're calling me lazy? I. Are you out of your mind? I think I misspoke. I think I misspoke. I didn't wanna say that word, but let's be honest, I mean, you've been sitting around doing nothing but watching movies. Has there ever been a. How the hell do you. How the hell do you know that? Well, because we track that. Has there recently been a change in your relationship status? What the hell does that have to do with anything? Whether I have a change in my relationship status or not? Well, what does that have to do with me watching Netflix? I've, I've seen it in the past when people kind of become losers who sit on the couch all Day and watch TV a lot of times there. Wait a minute. First I'm lazy, and now I'm a loser couch potato? Is this your idea of customer service? I thought you guys want my business. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I did not mean to say that. Listen to you. If you think I'm lazy, you're an asshole for calling me up on it. you know what? I deserve that. I shouldn't have said those words. I was thinking it. I didn't want to say it, and I'm sorry. But what I'm basically saying is you've been watching a lot of TV, and I wouldn't be surprised if your wife or your girlfriend or whatever left you because you're not paying attention to them. So maybe. Holy shit, I. Okay, look, I'm about to blow a gasket here. You're. You're now assuming, making some assumptions because I watched it on a lazy loser cash potato and I got dumped and this. What are you supposed to do? Try to console me and make me feel better? No. Is this your idea of customer service? I just think maybe making a friend that isn't the TV could help you a little bit, you know? I mean, how the hell do you know whether I have friends or not? Well, I'm just assuming because you've been watching a lot of Netflix. I. We. I see here. I'm not watching Netflix with a friend. How the hell Do you know what? Do you have cameras? Are you spying on me? Are you looking through my walls? Now? I see here that you. I see here that you watched Hot Tub Time Machine Part 2 the other day. I mean, anybody's gonna do that has no friends. Clearly, dude. So I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna cancel your subscription. How do you like that? So I don't even watch anything anymore. Sir, please. I'll just go somewhere else. Please don't. And who's your supervisor? Cause I wanna tell him to fire your sorry ass. Please don't cancel your account over a prank phone call. I wouldn't recommend that. No, it's not. Yes it is. No, man. Yeah it is. You're just trying to get. You're just trying to back pedal. No, I'm not. Your pal Damien set you up. Dude, it doesn't work for Netflix. I know. He emailed me to call you. He says that you're always watching Netflix and he rips on you for it. Are you serious?

Hello? Hi. May I speak to James, please? Yeah, speaking. James, how are you, man? This is Jubal from the radio show Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, your radio show? I am not one myself, but I am on a radio show. I'm calling you because one of our listeners actually sent us an email, and they wanted to see if we could get you on the phone. Uh, okay. Who is it? Well, it's somebody that you met this weekend at a Halloween party. Met a lot of people. It's a big party. Can you just hurry up and tell me who it was and stop trying to be, like, Mr. Radio man? I would love to do that. I like your new title, though. Yeah, I do. Mr. Radio man. I like it. Thank you, James. Appreciate it. Um, I'm gonna guess that you remember her because you guys hooked up. Um. Oh, uh, yeah, I know what you're talking about. Ha ha ha. All right. Uh, okay. Ha ha ha. Well, we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody or hook up with somebody at a Halloween party and that person doesn't call you back, you can email us and we'll get Them on the phone and ask what happened. So Haley, she wants to know why you won't answer any of your text messages. What do you mean why? She's taken. She's, she's definitely not taken. Yeah, no, she's very single. She's like, as single as they come. What? No, no, she, she is taken. I, I, trust me, she's taken hundred percent. What? So wait, you think she's in a relationship is what you're saying? I know she's in a relationship. How do you know that? Cause her boyfriend came up to me afterwards and was giving me crap. That's why we, we, we had a scrap. We had a full scuffle about it in the backyard. What? Wait, what? You had a fight with a guy who said that he was Hailstorm's boyfriend? I don't know, like the hailstorm, whatever that is, but yeah, after I went downstairs and I almost had a fight with a guy in the backyard dressed like the Incredible Hulk. You almost. You're dressed like a pirate and you almost had to fight the Incredible Hulk. Whoa! No, I did fight the Incredible Hulk. Oh, dude, it started swinging at me. Okay, this sounds like a bad memory for you. This. I think this is a really cool memory. Sounds like something cool that happened. Yeah, seriously. I wanna see it in theaters. Okay, I know you guys are based at the costumes, but, like, we. Haley is a person that calls into our Show every so often. And although she's wild, a little wild child, I get that. But, like, she doesn't have a boyfriend. Like, there's no way she has a boyfriend. Well, if she doesn't have a boyfriend, then why did the Incredible Hulk try to fight me and tell me that I was messing around with his girlfriend? I don't know. And he got confused. There's something missing here. I don't know what happened. I just. He came up to me afterward, he said, why are you messing around with my girl? I said, what girl? He said that she was his, and he was drunk. Next thing you know is, we're swinging, and I was pushed him off. Everybody was coming around me like, hey, break it up, everything like that. And I was like, you know what? This isn't worth it. I'm out of here. This is. This is not even worth it. I already got humiliated by a government, getting walked in on. And come downstairs, and I'm this big Old Green guy trying to get up in my business. It just wasn't working. Some people like when a big green guy got to get up in their business. Side note, anyway, sorry about. They had to deal with that, but she's been texting me. Why wouldn't you just text her back and say you have a boyfriend, you're a cheater, or whatever you wanna accuse her of? I don't wanna encourage her. I just. I'm out. That's It. I am out. Yeah, it's understandable. I mean, you were just, like. You met her, what, like, an hour before you guys started messing around? Yeah. Besides, I mean, I didn't even get her number or anything, so I've just been getting, like, random texts from this number. I didn't know who it was. I just was not. Ignored it. Okay, well, you're not gonna be able to ignore it now, James, so much, because she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. Hey, James.

Not since like the 50s, or even earlier, the 20s. He was out dancing with a girl and some guy came up and asked to cut in. Really? And he stole her time? I didn't know that still existed. I didn't either. What's up, Charlie? How are you? Hey, I'm. I'm doing all right. I'm. I'm doing okay. Thanks for your email, man. I appreciate it. No problem. Thanks for calling me. I really appreciate this. No problem. We'll get into the whole cutting in thing, cause I thought that was weird. But first of all, tell us about the girl that you wanna call today. What's her name? Our name is Summer. Summer. Alright. And where'd you meet summer? Set up by a friend of a friend. Was it a blind date that you were going on then? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never met her. Um, but my friend said she was real nice and cool and that I should, so I said sure, why not? And was she real nice and cool? Yeah, she. She was really pleasant. Pleasant? No one wants to be described as really pleasant. That's why you starting a sentence with bless your heart. You sure you wanna do a second date update and try to get another date with her? Yeah, I do, I do. I mean, she. She's stunning. That's the thing. There you go. Was She more stunning or more pleasant? I can't figure out with you. Well, she was pleasantly stunning. That's okay. Pleasantly stunning. That's a nice way to describe her. So what did you like about summer so much? Why was she so pleasantly stunning? Well, I expected her to be blond, you know, with a name like summer. But she had jet black hair. And you, tall and fit and just everything a summer was not supposed to be. She was it. She was like a naughty summer. The hottest summer ever. The hottest summer on record. And you got a date with her? Yeah, I got. I got pretty lucky. So were you nervous when you saw her? Like. And, I mean, you were obviously taking it back with how beautiful she was. Well, yeah, it was just. I wasn't even sure if it was her, really. I just kind of made eye contact. I thought about it for a second, and I was thinking, just. Just do it, man. Just go approach her. Just ask if her name is summer. And it was nice. Awesome. So you're. You're summer. This is it. Email said that you guys hung out at a bar and did some dancing, and there's some point where a guy cut in on you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we went to this bar, and there was a live music, and it was nice, and conversation started a little slow. We got to know each other, and Then we started dancing. And were you, like, grinding dancing, or is this like pear dancing, like the foxtrot or. I don't know. It was just regular old dancing. Not like 1940s old dancing. Okay. Like now old dancing. Okay. Just normal dancing. All right. And how did that guy cut in on you? I didn't think that happened anymore. I haven't heard of that in a while. Yeah, it was. It was pretty awkward. We were, you know, we had taken a break for a second, went back to the bar to get some water, and this guy comes in and approaches me first. Before he approaches her, he says, hey, I saw you guys dancing over there. You guys are. You're really good couple. Could I answer there for a second? Cause I haven't had any good partners. Whoa. Sure, sure. That's strange that he even realized that you guys were together and then wanted to dance with her. Yeah, he was probably, like, watching us for the whole night. It would have been better if you camp was like, hey, I see you guys are a couple. Um, excuse me, do you mind if I dance with this fella over here? And then you would have had to go dance with him. That was not gonna happen. So why didn't you say no to him? I mean, when he asked to dance with her, just be like, nah, we're good, man. Thanks. I didn't want to. Look, Like I was possessive on the first like night. Uh huh. It. First impressions are so important. So I didn't want to like freak her out or anything. So I said, sure. Should have just cracked a beer bottle over his head right there. That would have impressed her. In another universe. I did. What did. What was her response to all this? When the guy asked the question? She looked surprised and kind of looked like she said sure. So I just stepped out. Okay. Okay. So how long was this dude dancing with your date? It was a good 3, four songs. It just kept going on and on and on. Alright. What were you doing? Just hanging out at the bar. Being awkward. Yeah. Yeah. You know, check Facebook, check Instagram. How do you pretend? I had some email. Now that sucks. You're like, yeah, go ahead, dance with my date. I got some work I need to do anyway. Pretty important. Super busy over here. So do you think that she's not calling you back because she liked that guy more than you? I'm worried that she might think I'm like some spineless little kid or I couldn't stand up for myself. I couldn't fight the big bad intruder or anything. Anything like that. So she probably thinks I'm a pretty much like a weenie. Yeah. Okay. How did the date end with her then? Did you ever get her back after that guy stole your Date away? Uh, yeah, yeah. She eventually cut off and came back to me and said, hey, how you doing? I was, you know, I was pretending, playing it off like, oh, yeah, no, I. My job, that my boss is always sending me these late night emails, but, um, we should get out of here. And she said, yeah, yeah, yeah. We went out and we got, like, a little nightcap, like, a slice of pizza, and then she called an Uber, and she gave me a, like a. Like a polite kiss. Like, on the cheek or something? No, no, no. Like, on my lips. Okay. It was okay. It was polite. So it wasn't like a passionate, I like you a lot kiss? It was like, thanks for a fun night and the pizza. And then she just got in the car and left. Yeah. Did she ever ask you why you didn't cut in? Uh, no, she didn't, but I could tell that she really wanted to ask. Yeah. So how many times have you tried to get a hold of her since that date? I've been calling her a few times, you know, sending her a few texts for the past, like, 2, 3 weeks, and, um, she only replied once, which is when I just kind of gave up what she said, and she told me she was gonna be out of town for two months and that she was gonna be disconnected. So That sounds like a blow off and a half. Like, hey, I've got. I'm gonna be gone for about two months, so hopefully you'll forget about me by then. Is that what it feels like? Yeah. All right, that's what it sounds like. I've disconnected for eight weeks. Sorry. I'm moving. Well, we're gonna play a song, come back, call her, and get your second date update, all right? All right, thanks. All right, man. Hang on.

Hi, can I speak to Ricky, please? This is Ricky. Hey, Ricky, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. This is what? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. The radio show. What is that? The radio or the radio show? Cause the radio is a device that you can listen to a lot of things on music programs. I know what a radio is. Why are you calling me? Oh, I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us about you. Somebody that you know very well. Okay. I mean, you have a puppy with her. You should know who it is. What? Why are you asking all these questions? Well, I'm asking you because we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. So you recently went out with Becca. Okay, yeah. Becca. All right. Uh huh. Okay, that sounds funny to you? I don't know why? And she emailed us because she said she's been trying to get a hold of you since you guys hung out all day. You bought a puppy together, you spent the night together, and then you were gone. And she doesn't know why you're not calling her back. Okay. And now you just want to talk about this? Well, yeah, cause. Yeah, pretty much. You're not. She doesn't know. She doesn't know what's happening. She thought that. I don't know, that something maybe bad happened to you. She Wants to know why you're not calling her back. Well, I mean, does that even matter? Of course it matters to her. It matters for sure. You guys, like, you bought a puppy together? Yeah. All right, I mean, that's my thing. What do you want me to say? What do you mean it's your thing? You stayed the night and you wrote her a note that said, Love, Ricky? Yeah, I mean, that's kind of guy I am. You know, you might get a puppy. You're probably gonna get a puppy. I'm so confused. What? I don't. All right, I mean, if you. You gotta know, like. Yeah, I like to buy girls puppies. Wait a minute, though. That doesn't make any sense. You kept the puppy? Do you have like 80 puppies at your house? I don't know. It's my move. It's what's what? You know, it's my thing. You want me to talk about it? I mean, what, you never heard of something like this? No, I've never heard of a dude that just meets women and buys them puppies. Of course he didn't, cause that's what I do. Okay, wait, okay, well, how do you. What do you do with the puppy afterwards, though? That's the question you took. She told us that you spent the night and then you were gone, and so was the puppy. Yeah, I have this arrangement with my friend. He works at a pet store, you know, and It's. He sees me walking with a girl at the pet store. He knows that there's a particular puppy, you know, and I give her the puppy. Works every time. Wait, I don't get it. Works for what? You. You know, you pick. You want to pick up a girl, you give her a puppy. Hahaha, it's true, I guess. But it doesn't make any sense. You were already out to lunch with a girl before you bought the puppy. I mean, you already picked her up. It's a first date move, though. Like, you know, you know you're gonna seal the deal if you give her a puppy. It works like a charm, honestly. They love it. Oh, so wait, you're trying to get off a puppies? I'm not trying to. I do. Yeah. I mean, we only know one person that's come in contact with you, and it worked with them. It always. It always works. Oh my god, dude. Okay, that is evil. You are using puppies. What? I mean, dudes walk dogs and they get to meet girls when they're walking the dog. I mean, I just give them the dog. Oh, I'm cutting out the walking part. What happens to the puppy though? You know, in the morning, I bring the dog back. I bring the dog. I bring the dog back to the pet store. Yeah, my friend takes it back. Oh my god. What? Am I gonna take care of this thing? You're Crazy. Bring it back. But Ricky, do you understand what you're doing? Like, you're doing more than just getting laid. Like you are roping these women into believing that you wanna have a future with them. Whatever. If we went out to dinner, am I making a commitment to eat dinner with you for the rest of my life? No, but you're not taking care of dinner for the rest of your life together as a. Like, it's joint custody of a puppy. Come on, if you believe that we're gonna have a whole life together just cause I gave you a puppy. I mean, in honesty, that's really stupid. Oh my god, now you're calling her dumb? I mean, come on, you just meet this guy in the first day, you're like making plans for the rest of your life based on a puppy. I mean you. You have to be a moron. Well, Ricky, after that, I would like to tell you that somebody wants to talk to you because Becca is on the other line and she just heard everything you said. Mike.

Well, let me finish. I just want to say I'm honored to be on the phone with you, and it's been a pleasure to be your employee. Cut to the chase. Cut to the chase. What are you calling me? Why is there an emergency? Okay, so I'm not very good with computers, and I was logging onto my work computer for the first time, and for some reason I was bored and I, you know, the junk mail keeps popping up. You know, junk mail and the scam and. Please, what happened? Sorry. Okay, okay, so I'll speed it up. So anyway, I clicked on an email about some like, Nigerian prince who was giving out a bunch of money. What? Cause I heard. Listen, I know those are fake, but I heard one out of 20 of them are real. Do you know that? What's wrong with you? There's a lot Of money in Nigeria. There's. There's no money in Nigeria. What did you do? What happened? I'm just telling you. You're probably not gonna like this, but I don't like that. I don't know what happened. I've been talking to you already for 5 minutes. Could you please tell me what's going on? Okay, well, I took a chance and I clicked on the one email, and a bunch of windows popped up, and some noise I never heard of came out of nowhere. And something said it was installed. Are you kidding me? And something said it was installed. And something said it was installed. And something said it was installed. And something said it was installed. And something said it was installed. IT guy says, I got a Trojan horse virus. You downloaded a virus into our software? I didn't download it. The Nigerian prince downloaded it, and that's why it's on your computer. They sent the email. There's no Nigerian prince. This could be coming from. You don't know where this is coming from. Technically, you don't know that. He could be a techie prince, but the point is, is I kind of goofed up. It's a little bit of a whoopsy daisy. And apparently everything on the servers got deleted. Are you kidding me? You know how much this is gonna cost me to get that back? It's not gonna cost you anything, sir, because they said it's completely unrecoverable, you idiot. How weird is it? That this happens. I mean, this is my first job ever using a computer. Why the hell would she hire somebody with no experience? I know Lisa. She wouldn't hire an idiot. Well, I would have had experience. Experience. But I was in jail for a few years. So what? I didn't tell her that, though, so don't worry, she didn't know. Where's Lisa right now? I don't wanna talk to her anymore. Put her on the phone. Yeah, no, she left. She was really upset and she was yelling like, she's firing me. She's firing me. Yeah, she damn straight. You know, she's not gonna fire you. I'm gonna fire you. I me, the owners gonna fire you. Technically, you can't fire me. Lisa's my manager. I'm the owner of the company, you idiot. I can fire whoever I want. Oh, my god, you're right. Well, damn right I'm right. Can I at least make this up to you before you fire me, sir? So I can get at least on good terms or fix this? How are you possibly gonna make this up to me? So it had told me that we lost everything. And apparently you've had like 20 something years worth of data on here. At least 20 years? Yeah, and that's all gone forever. That's what they said. Shut up, you idiot. How can you click on some fucking. Who told? That was in the past, sir. We're in the present now and we're looking Towards what? The future. Exactly. So the only future you have is your getting hit by the door on your way out. Unless I fix it. If I fix everything right now. Just hear me out. I doubt it. If you could just tell me all of the data you remember in the last 20 something years, I can type it in right now. My listening. Are you kidding me? As long as you're willing to pay me for overtime, I think I can do it. Overtime? If that's okay with you. What kind of an asshole are you? I'm actually not an asshole. Oh, I am an idiot, though. But this is Jose from freaking Jeffrey in the morning doing a phone tap on you. What? This is not real. This is a prank phone call. Your manager, Lisa actually set you up. Oh my god. Oh. She mentioned to us you were, like, backing up data for the first time at your company. We were talking about this a few months ago. Yeah, that's. She said you guys should probably back up your data just in case. I guess I should have listened to her. But if seriously, if you wanna start at the A's, I can start putting this data right back in.

And it's like, my brother, you are about to catch a Mike Tyson left hook from me. Or better yet, I'll say, okay, and then she thinks I'm giving her attitude, and it's like, yo, mom, news flash! I'm not just gonna be like, affirmative, mom, with a big, fat, fucking jolly smile on my face. And don't even get me started on when parents say, don't talk back to me. What the fuck are you talking about? Like, I don't know if you knew this, but we are having a conversation. Talking back to each other is how this whole thing works. And if you ask me if I understand, and I hit you with the yes, and then you hit me back with the no, you don't, why the fuck are you even asking me then? And I cannot stand when they tell me to watch my tone. Like, hey, dumbass, all I said was okay! In a monotone voice. Y'all ever be doing something? your parents ask you to do the thing that you're already doing, and it's like, I don't wanna do this shit no more. Now you'll forget to do the simplest thing, like just Taking out the trash, and here comes your mom talking about some, oh, I guess I'm a bad mother. Nobody cares about me. And it's like, motherfucker, what? Nobody said that. And last but not least, the ultimate form of rage baiting is when you're walking away from them and they whisper behind your back like you can't hear them. Like, how about we hop in the ring right fucking now and handle this like men?

Hi. Is this Bryce? Uh, yeah. Who's this? Oh, hello, Bryce. My name is Juniper, and we share the same space, I guess, in a way. Hmm. Okay. What? I'm sorry, what do you mean, what? Um, well, you just recently purchased a new, fabulous home. Yeah. How are you liking it? Hmm? It's. It's great. What. What. What is this about? Yes. That third doorway is kind of sticky, isn't it? Yeah. Who. Who is this? Oh, my name is Juniper, and I used to own the home that you just purchased. Yes. And so I thought I'd give you a call. OK? Yeah. And. Oh, well, uh, it seems, as in my hasty get away from that house, I forgot something there, and so I was calling to see if maybe I could come by and examine it. I'm sorry, did you say zoom? Yes. If I could just zoom my property, be very grateful. I'd be willing to pay you for your time and inconvenience, because I moved out of there rather quickly, and it was a quick sale, and, you know, I got everything moved into my new place, and I realized I didn't have some very valuable items. Wondering if I. What kind of. Okay. Why do you keep on saying the word zoom? Do you know what that means? Oh, yes. It means to dig something up. Right. But it usually means to. To dig up a body. Like a dead body. Oh, Oh, okay. Well, then maybe I should change my wording so that it's not so parent, I mean. Anyway, I'm so sorry. Um, yes, I need to dig up something in the backyard that I buried there. Did you say you need to change the wording so it's not so apparent? Oh, no, no, I. Well, if I said apparent, I didn't mean apparent. I meant so. Well, I guess there's another word for it. It wouldn't be so obvi obvious. No, that's not. Maybe not the word. Anyway, nothing. Nothing like that. There's just some very valuable things to me that are buried in the backyard, and I'd like to be able to come by and dig them up and take them home with me. How big of a hole do you need to dig? Well, between five, seven, and six feet. I don't know exactly, but yes, that's about the size of the hole I would need to dig. Okay, now this is sounding even more creepy. All right, you just got. You described it. The exact specifications of a person. What is very back here. Many things are 5 8. Between 5 8 and 6 feet. For example, like, a door could be 6 feet tall. What door is six feet tall? It sounds like you murdered someone and buried them in the backyard. What the is going on? I'm so sorry if it's coming across as murderous. I didn't mean it first come across that way. No, it's just some cans of stew. Cans of stew? Yes, just some cans of stew. Didn't want anybody be able to find my stew. Okay, now you're sounding like you're using the word stew in both the name stew and the actual food stew. And it's even creepier. You're telling me you buried cans of the food stew? Okay, that's it. I'm calling the cops right now. Okay, don't do that. This is actually Jubal from the Jubal Show doing a phone prank on you and your girlfriend set you up. Are you serious? It's a joke. She said that you just bought a new house and wanted to creep you out. Hahaha! Okay, well I'm definitely never having stew again, that's for sure. Hahaha!

Hi. Is Rachel there? Ah, this is Rachel. Hey, Rachel. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, it's a morning radio show. Um, I don't. I'm not familiar. Do you own a radio? Uh, yes, in my car, I do. Cool. Well, sometimes we're on that thing. One of our listeners actually emailed us asking if we could call you. Okay. Who. Who is that? His name is Oscar. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, you're so excited. Leading up to it. And Oscar told us about how he finally got up the nerve to ask you on a date the other day. Yeah. Mm hmm. And he told us about your date, and he thought everything went great, but now, apparently, you're not calling him or texting him back, and also, you're avoiding him at work, so he asked if we could get you on the phone and find out if he did something wrong. Cool. Um, I sense the sarcasm there. Yeah, this is kind of a weird situation. Do you mind telling us what went wrong so that we can let Oscar know and maybe at least make things a little less awkward at work? Oh, I just. I just don't know what to say to him, you know? I don't. Well, I don't know what to say. If you say it to us, maybe we can say it to him in a way that won't hurt his feelings. Uh, alright. What did he do? The date sounded super sweet. The ice skating? Yeah, I mean, I had a great time on the date. It. It wasn't necessarily the date that was the bad thing. So what was the bad thing then? Well, you know, we work in the same office, so I just kind of found out some information about him that kind of freaked me out a little bit, to be honest. Oh my gosh, shut up! You heard office gossip about him? I did, I did. Uh. Oh, from who? Was it someone that you consider like a friend? was it someone who you think would be jealous that you guys went out? No, it's my friend and she's happily married, so I believe her. So what was the office gossip? Uh, I don't wanna tell you guys cause I don't wanna embarrass him if it's not true, you know? Come on, like I said, if you tell us, maybe we can find a creative way to tell him. That doesn't make it super strange. Plus, if there was something going around about you at the office, you'd wanna know, so at least you could clarify whatever it is. That's true. That's true. Um, so, you know, all of our co workers knew we were going out. So of course when I came back, my one friends like, how did it go? And I was just telling her it was good. It was, it was A nice date. Yeah. Okay. And. And then she, of course, started asking more detailed questions. And she said, did he do the thing? Did he do the thing? Wow. Sounds like he's got quite a reputation. Yeah, he has a thing. I don't know about Oscar. When Oscar takes ladies out, he does this thing. Did he do it to you? He's done it to all of us in the office. No, no, it wasn't like that. It was that. So what. What's his thing, then? Well, I kept asking her, and she said, well, did he do the hot cocoa thing? This is sounding even worse and worse in my mind. Or better and better, depending on what you like. Yeah, I mean, I don't know, whatever your flavor is. Hot cocoa. That's true. I mean, it goes with the date. Um, so I'm like, oh, no, we didn't have any hot cocoa. And she goes, no. Did he bring the cups? And so apparently, oh, my gosh, I don't want to tell this. Um, apparently he has been collecting, you know those plastic cups when in the break room where you get coffee and stuff? Yeah. Um, he's been collecting the ones that I'm drinking out of. Like when we'll have a nice conversation at work. And writing the date on the. What? Yeah. Weird. He's been collecting your coffee cups? Yeah. Oh, my god. What was so. Okay, so what was the hot cocoa thing? I Mean, that's weird already, but yeah, I think he was gonna, like, serve us hot cocoa out of the cups that he collected. And, like, weird and unsanitary. I know. So, wait, was she not freaked out by this? She thought it was gonna be something cool. I mean, she thought it was cute. I mean, she also thinks he's like Teddy bear Oscar. You know, she's good friends with him, okay, so in her mind, he can't do anything creepy, right? She's like, oh, he's showing his affection, but to me, I'm like, that's a little weird. Yeah, it's basically like taking locks of your hair. Yeah, exactly. Right. It's like taking my DNA. Maybe he's trying to create a new you in a petri dish in his apartment somewhere. You know what? Maybe that's the gossip going around. Come on. No, if you backed up and you took her criticism of who he is. He's obviously a nice guy. It sounds nice, but at the end of the day, he's literally going into the trash can and collecting the coffee cups I drank out of. Okay, yeah, I know. I tried to spit it for him, but I don't know that I can. I know. I don't think anybody can. I wonder if Oscar can even save himself. And, Rachel, I do have to let you know that you did actually say it to Oscar, cause he's on the other line. Oh, my god, listening. And wants to Talk to you? No, you guys

Hello? Hi. May I speak to James, please? Yes, speaking. James. How are you, man? This is Jubal from the radio show Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, your radio show? I am not one myself, but I am on a radio show. I'm calling you because one of our listeners actually sent us an email, and they wanted to see if we could get you on the phone. Uh, okay. Who is it? Well, it's somebody that you met this weekend at a Halloween party. Met a lot of people. It's a big party. Can you just hurry up and tell me who it was and stop trying to be like Mr. Radio man? I would love to do that. I like your new title, though. Yeah, I do. Mr. Radio man. I like it. Thank you, James. Appreciate it. Um, I'm gonna guess that you remember her because you guys hooked up. Um. Oh, uh, yeah, I know what you're talking about. Ha ha ha ha ha. All right. Uh, okay. Ha ha ha. Well, we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody or hook up with somebody at a Halloween party and that person doesn't call you back, you can email us, and we'll get them on the phone and ask what happened. So Haley, she wants to know why you won't Answer any of your text messages. What do you mean? Why? She's taken. She's, she's definitely not taken. Yeah, no, she's very single. She's like, as single as they come. What? No, no, she, she is taken. I, I, trust me, she's taken. Hundred percent. What? So wait, you think she's in a relationship is what you're saying? I know she's in a relationship. How do you know that? Cause her boyfriend came up to me afterwards and was giving me crap. That's why we, we, we had a scrap. We had a full scuffle about it in the backyard. What? Wait, what? You had a fight with a guy who said that he was Hailstorm's boyfriend? I don't know, the hail storm, whatever that is, but yeah, after I went downstairs and I almost had a fight with a guy in the backyard dressed like the Incredible Hulk. You almost. You were dressed like a pirate and you almost had to fight the Incredible Hulk. Whoa, no, I did fight the Incredible Hulk. Oh, dude started swinging at me. Okay, wait, this sounds like a bad memory for you. This. I think this is a really cool memory. Sounds like something cool that happened. Yeah, seriously. I want to see it in theaters. Okay, I know you guys are based at the costumes, but, like, we. Haley is a person that calls into our show every so often, and although she's wild, a little wild child. I get that. But, like, she doesn't have a boyfriend. Like, there's no way she has a boyfriend. Well, if she doesn't have a boyfriend, then why did the Incredible Hulk try to fight me and tell me that I was messing around with his girlfriend? I don't know. Maybe he got confused. There's something missing here. I don't know what happened. That's just. He came up to me afterward, he said, why are you messing around with my girl? I said, what girl? He said that she was his, and he was drunk. Next thing you know is we're swinging, and I was pushed him off. Everybody was coming around being like, hey, break it up, everything like that. And I was like, you know what? This isn't worth it. I'm out of here. This is. This is not even worth it. I already got humiliated by getting. Getting walked in on. And come downstairs, and I'm this big Old Green guy. Try to get up in my business. It just wasn't worth it. Some people like when a big green guy got to get up in their business. Side note, anyway, sorry about. They had to deal with that. But she's been texting you. Why wouldn't you just text her back and say you have a boyfriend, you're a cheater, or whatever you wanna accuse her of? I don't even wanna encourage her. I'm just. I'm out. That's it. I am out. Yeah, it's understandable. I mean, you were just like. You Met her, what, like an hour before you guys started messing around? Yeah. Besides, I mean, I didn't even get her number or anything, so I've just been getting, like, random texts from this number. I didn't know who it was. I just was not. Ignored it. Okay, well, you're not gonna be able to ignore it now, James, so much, because she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you.

Hey, Aaron, I don't want to try to blow up her spot like this. Not. Might not be a bad thing. How long have you guys been together? Cause she could. It could be that you just recently met a guy or whatever. No, you know, it's not even possible. You. We've been together for a long time. On and off.

Not hard to hear, but it's doesn't make sense. It's not even possible. Aaron, a guy emailed us and he's been texting with Isabella. They met at a party a few weeks ago, hung out, had a good time. He thought that she was into him and then she said, don't text me anymore and stop texting him. That's why he wanted us to call, right? But I'm on her phone now. I've checked her phone. There's no text messages from any guy. Okay, I can assure you that you check her phone all the time. Enough. We trust each other. Whatever. You know I like trust. Two weeks ago, were you guys together or on a break? Cause you said you guys have breaks. Look, it's really none Of your fucking business at this point. It's not. You don't even want to know if maybe your girlfriend is cheating on you. Who the fuck are you? I've already answered all of your dumb questions, so I think you need to fuck off. I'm just trying to help you get to the bottom of it, because this is the phone number that we got from another dude who said that he met Isabella. Look, if you have some guy that's calling you, then why don't you tell him he's mistaken and he's got the wrong person and she's got a boyfriend and to just, like, back off and stop harassing her? Okay? I'll do that for you. Hey, Jake, back off. Isabella has a boyfriend. His name is Aaron. This is so uncomfortable. Aaron. Jake, the guy who says he met Isabella is actually on the phone with us right now. Jake, say hi to Aaron. Hey. So how long have you guys been dating? You never really answered that question. Who the fuck are you? I'm not even gonna answer this. I don't even know who you are. I don't want to know who you are. You sound like a little bit of a dweeb. And I don't think she has. I, I met Isabella. Chill, dude. Oh, here's the deal. We hung out for the whole night. She stayed in my bed. But it doesn't sound like you guys are really into each other. You won't even Say how long you've been dating. All right, dude, here's the deal. I don't know who the fuck you are. I don't have a problem with you, but you keep pushing down this road, we're gonna have a problem. You need to back off. I don't know. What are we going on? You've made a mistake. All right, Jake, why don't we. Why don't we just ask Isabella who she wants? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Oh, god, this is so uncomfortable, Aaron. I mean, I know you have her phone right now, but how can we get a hold of her? I'm not gonna give you any of your info. Where is she? She must be coming back soon. This is ridiculous. I am with Isabella. We are together. No, you can't talk to her. No, we're not gonna go through. I'm not gonna listen to this pseudo shrink try to tell me that my relationship isn't working out. All right, you may maybe. Radio show. Maybe. You guys weren't together two weeks ago. It was two weeks ago, Aaron. That's when Jake says he met Isabella and she spent the night at his house. In his bed. In his bed.

Hmm. Okay. Is this true, Robert? Is this girl using you? I mean, uh, no, I don't think so, bro. How much money has she borrowed from you in the past three months? I mean, no, no, no. Did you forget that? How much is in the past week? Has she even paid you back? Dude, she's my girlfriend, and I'm. I'm gonna spend money on her, you know? I mean, I'm gonna take her shopping and stuff. Yeah. Is that all that this is about, Jason? Is he spends too much money on her? Uh, no. I understand that you're gonna take your girlfriend out to dinner and shopping and things like that, but, uh, I mean, the first of all, he shouldn't be paying her rent. And second of all, she shouldn't be cheating on you. She shouldn't be cheating on you. No, exactly. That's really what we're calling to find out is if she's cheating on him. You know, if she's loyal to him and he feels like spending all his money on. What are you gonna do? That's. That's his prerogative. But if she's cheating on him, at least Jason hopes this will open Robert's eyes a little bit. So we are about to call Steph, okay? The girlfriend, and we are going to play This stupid voice, Scotty of the balls. Silly voice of the naked game. I love it. I love it. Good, then give me some dialing music. Dialing at random. I'd ask you all to please be quiet until we begin the naked game here on Scotty the ball. Hello? Hey, good morning. Is this Steve? I'm sorry, what? I said, is this Steph? Yes. Who is this? Steph, this is Scotty and the buzz from 98.6 FM. Scotty and the Buzz Morning Show. How are you today? Sounds like we just woke you up. Yeah, you did.

You're not. Why aren't you ready? Well, to be completely honest, I'm kind of broke. That first date kind of tapped me out, and I'm trying to save up enough money to take her on a second date. Oh, no, dude. Levi. Oh, man. Why are you paying for all this expensive stuff if you don't have the funds to do that? Like buying her the makeup and the shoes? Oh, she told you about all that stuff, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we talked to her about your date. She said you guys went to a really nice dinner, and then afterwards you took her to the mall and you were like, throw it in the bag, girl. Whatever. No, look, it's not really a big deal. Guys, I got a second. Um, I got a. I'm. I'm driving for Uber now, and so between that and my real job, I really think that, you know, it's gonna be easy to take her on dates like that. I just wasn't planning ahead cause I didn't know I was gonna meet her, you know? Did you say you just got a paper job? Wait, Levi, you took a second job in order to take Cassie out again? Yeah. Oh, man, that is so sweet and so wrong all at the same time. Yeah, no, it's not right. I mean, look, let's be honest. What's money for if not to, like, spend it on people you like? Sounds like money for You should be to save it. But yeah. You realize when you go out on a date, you don't have to break the bank, right? Well, you don't know Cassie, but she's definitely worth breaking the bank. I mean, I'd even rob a bank. Not a big bank, like a small bank. Not a big bank, but a medium sized bank. That's illegal, but sweet. Yeah. If you don't have the bank, don't spend it. No, no, I get that. It's just. I think today, nowadays it's just a nice concept to be able to take somebody out. And if I'm the one asking them out, I wanna be the one who can, like, you know, make it a date. Okay, I agree with you there. I do. I think that if you're the one that's asking, then you should be the one that treat. But she likes you for a lot of reasons. And there's a lot of other less expensive date options than taking them to the mall. Like, you could go, I don't know, to coffee man. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. In the dating climate nowadays, I think too many guys are content just being, you know, typical. And I wanted to wow her. And I still want to wow her on our next date. That's the point.

And she said that we should chat about the playlist a little bit. Little chickadee chat. Yes, we should definitely chat. I really want. This is going to be a very classy wedding. Um, you know, that's right. She said you had some concerns. I do have some concerns. Okay. You know, why don't you. Why don't you lay them on me a little bit? Okay. Okay. Uh, Mark, you need to stop talking over me, cause I'm actually trying to tell you what I need right now. Whoa, apologies. Sorry. Just trying to be polite. So just let me tell you what it is that I. I'm worried about here. Her cousin recently got married, and there were some. Really? Oh, that's sweet. That is sweet. Okay, you're doing it again. I'm doing what? I'm sorry, I was just. You're talking. You're talking over me. I'm trying to tell you. Oh, well, I was just trying to be polite about the cousin getting married. That is awesome. I love to hear people in love. Get it? Love, love. It's a double shot of love coming your way. Okay, Mark, I've got a lot of concerns just based on this conversation right now. About what kind of music you might play. Do you. Do you have. Oh, I'll be playing from. I'll be playing some of the best stuff. You talking to 80s, 90s, today, tomorrow, yesterday, Tuesday, next week, even. I'm playing hits from the future. I know. I need to specifically know what it is you're gonna play. Specifically, what are some of the songs that you have lined up for this? Because I don't want any disgusting rap music or things. Oh, hey, now. Hey now what? Hey, now, there's some good rap songs out there. We don't have to put all those in the bag, do we? No. This is a day about romance and love and commitment and family, and we're gonna have a. Well, I got you, I got you, I got you right there. I'll see your rap music and saying it's not about romance at all, and I'll lay a little Nelly on you. Hot. And her. It's getting hot in here. Take off all your clothes. Yes. Okay, okay. Absolutely nothing about taking clothes off. Absolutely. Well, but it's a fun song. Nothing. I think you're missing the fun. No, it is not fun. It is not fun. That is not fun for me. Do you understand me? Regardless of whether Susan hires you, I can fire you, Mark. Do you understand? Whoa. Hey. Wouldn't be the first time I've been fired from a DJ gig. I used to have a morning show in Tampa? Oh, my god. that doesn't surprise me at all. All right? Back in the 80s, it was huge. You know, I'm. I'm thinking, this is not gonna work out, all right? I'm gonna just have to tell Susan. We did this funny thing. We did this funny thing. Let me tell you a little bit about it. I'd be like, good morning. And we do fart noises on the tens, and I can absolutely not. Well, that's disgusting. I'm just telling you about my radio show I had back in the 80s. There will be no fart noises. I'm talking about my daughter's wedding. I don't want to hear about your gross radio show in the 80s. This is a wedding. A wedding about love and commitment and. And people committing their love to each other for the rest of their lives. This is not something to be made fun of or bye, hubs. Bye, hubs! Or dirty. My lovely lady humps. My bumps! My bumps! My lovely lady bumps. Check them out. I am appalled. This is appalling. I cannot believe. Hey, did you. I got a. I got something to lay on here. Did you say you're a Paul? Hey, you're a Paul. I'm a Mark. DJ Mark of the dark? Yeah. Do you think you're funny? If you think I'm sexy and you want my body, you're a horrible DJ, and you're not coming anywhere near my daughter's wedding. Oh, I'll have you know, I've been called one of the best DJs in the country. Yeah, by who? Yourself? That it was a small Tampa newspaper back when I had a morning show in Tampa. Right? Did I tell you about my morning show in Tampa? This conversation is over. You are officially fired. I am making my decision right now. You will never hear from me or Susan again. That I should probably tell you. You got a phone prank to the face right now. I got a what? That's right, a double side of phone prank coming at you. Is that another one of your stupid ass songs? No, this is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning doing a phone tap on you. Jubal who? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show and your daughter Susan set you. I don't wanna hear about your stupid 1980s radio gig. No, I don't have a stupid 1980s radio gig. I have a stupid one right now. Currently. What the hell are you talking about? Your daughter Susan told me that you were worried about the music at her reception, so I figured I would call you and be an obnoxious wedding DJ. Wait, wait, So this whole thing is a prank? Yes, it's a joke. Well, it's not funny, alright? This whole thing, absolutely not funny. Well, you should maybe talk to your daughter. And you might think it's more funny when she breaks It down to you. Why don't you tell my daughter she can have fun paying for her own wedding, alright? Cause this is the final straw. She has put me through enough. This is bullshit. It was just a joke to try to lighten the mood a little bit. Well it's not funny. Come on, gared. Come on buddy.

Okay, E, what can we do for you on this dirty work Wednesday? Okay, so you know how sometimes you guys like, call like two people at the same time, but there's really a third person on the line too? Like, and it's a total surprise? Yeah, like a Three Way call. Yeah. Well, yeah, I need you to do that. Okay, so who are we calling and why? Okay, so like, I work in a big office and I don't wanna say where cause I'm skipping work today to do this, so. Oh wow. Okay, so you're. So you're skipping work so you can call dirty work Wednesday? Dude, I'm desperate. Okay, go ahead. Okay, like, so in this office, there's a bunch of people and I'm friends with most of them. And one of the guys I'm friends with is Ryan. He works in IT. He's a. He's a really nice guy, but he's got the biggest crush on one of our co workers named Katrina. Okay, so Brian likes Katrina. Brian loves Katrina, okay? Loves her. But the problem is he's like zero self confidence. So instead of actually telling her anything, he leaves her these little anonymous gifts and surprises at her desk. Like one day it's flowers, or they write her a poem and get her coffee from Starbucks. But she doesn't know where it all comes from. In fact, Nobody does. Well, you do. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, so. So me and him are the only ones that know. And I tell him all the time to just talk to her, but he won't do it. It's almost like he's catfishing her, but without making up a fake person. Okay, so how long has this been going on? It's been going since Christmas. Like, I mean, it started at Christmas. He got her this little Monet calendar for her desk, cause I guess she likes Monet or something. So this has been going on for 6 months then? Wow. Okay, so what do you need us to do? So what I wanna do, I wanna talk to him and once again try to tell him to just tell Katrina how he feel. But I thought you could have her listening, you know, on the other line, so when we talk about it, she can hear what's going on. And then finally she'll know the truth and you won't have to keep like. Yeah, I don't know, man. This sounds like a bad idea. I mean, is there. Is there a reason he hasn't told her already? I mean, like I said, he gets like zero self confidence. He works in IT, so he's like, kind of nerdy, but not like dorky nerdy. He's just. He's just smart. Just a smart guy, you know? He's a little overweight. Not like gross overweight. Or anything. Okay, well, I mean, what happens, like, if we get her on the phone and then she hears it's Brian and she rejects him? I mean, have you thought about that? Yeah, I have, but we gotta do this now. It's now or never. Okay, why after six months does it have to happen now? Cause there's a guy. Can I swear? Yeah, go ahead. There's a total head in our building named Decker, and he asked her out on Monday. Now, this guy is a complete D bag, and all he's gonna do is date her, try to get in her pants, and brag to his D bag friends here at work about it, and then just dump her. Okay, so we gotta do this now, or else she ends up with Decker, the D bag. Exactly. Eric, how hot is this Katrina girl? Like, on a scale from 1 to 10? I mean, she's pretty hot. Everyone here at work dresses up. Still at work, she's like a 9. I don't know what she's like at home in sweatpants. Okay, so you would be willing to risk your entire friendship with Brian to put him on the spot like this? Expose this secret love he has, and then pray to Jesus that she thinks he's dateable? Yeah, I would. Okay, and just so you know, if she rejects him, it's all out on the air, like, making it 10 times worse for him. Like I said, I got no choice. Okay, well, this is. This is either going to be amazing radio or what I imagine the Hindenburg sounded like when it exploded. But either way, it's coming up next.

I have been dating Andrew for about eight months now, and I'm in a situation that's making me question everything. When I met Andrew, he mentioned early in our conversation that he was born in Mexico but moved to the US when he was 12. I was immediately interested because I love practicing my languages. But for some reason, I hesitated to mention I spoke Spanish. It wasn't a deliberate choice at first. The topic just shifted, and then the moment passed. On our first date, he got a call from his mom and spoke to her in Spanish. When he hung up, he apologized and explained that he always speaks Spanish with family. I almost told him then that I understood everything, but he looked so comfortable having this private connection to his heritage that I didn't want to take that away from him. So I just smiled and said it was no problem at all. Looking back, this was my first mistake. As we continued dating, it became this weird, unspoken thing. The longer I went without mentioning it, the more awkward it felt to bring up. Hey, by the way, I've understood everything you've been saying to your family for the past three months isn't exactly casual conversation, so I just didn't say anything. At first. It was innocent enough. When his mom would call, he'd speak Spanish and give me a summarized version. Afterward, I'd nod along, even though I understood his mom asking if I was the kind of girl he could bring home and him saying I was different from the others in a good way. It actually made me feel special hearing how he talked about me when he thought I couldn't understand. But about two months ago, things started getting weird. Andrew's cousin Manuel moved in with him temporarily while looking for a job. And suddenly I was hearing a lot more Spanish conversations. And they weren't always flattering. One night, while I was making dinner in Andrew's kitchen, I overheard him and Manuel talking in the living room. Manuel asked when Andrew was going to get serious about finding a real partner instead of wasting time with white girls who don't understand our culture. Andrew didn't defend me. Instead, he said something like, it's not serious with Gianna. She's fun for now, but obviously I'll end up with someone my parents approve of eventually. I nearly dropped the spatula I was holding. We had talked about meeting each other's parents just the week before. He told me in English he was excited for me to meet his family. The disconnect between his English persona and Spanish persona was jarring. After that, I started paying closer attention. When his sister visited and asked in Spanish if I was as boring in bed as I looked, Andrew laughed and said, definitely not, but I'll tell you about it later. When His mom called and asked if I was still too skinny. He agreed and said he was working on getting me to eat more. The final straw came last weekend. We were at a restaurant with Manuel and Andrew's friend Diego. While I was in the bathroom, apparently, Diego asked if Andrew was planning to bring me to his cousin's wedding next month. When I returned to the table, Andrew and his friend switched from Spanish to English so smoothly. I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't caught the tail end of Andrew's response. She's just a placeholder until I move back home. My parents would disown me if I brought home someone who doesn't speak Spanish and doesn't understand our traditions. For eight months, I've been falling in love with someone who saw me as temporary, as less than the placeholder. All because he assumed I couldn't understand what he was saying behind my back. I excused myself, saying I suddenly felt sick, which wasn't a lie, and took an Uber home. Andrew texted me all night asking if I was okay, if he should come over, if I needed anything. I didn't respond until the next morning, when I asked him to meet me at a coffee shop near my apartment. When we sat down, I started the

So I was about 12 at the time and on vacation with my family at this beach resort in Florida. We'd rented a condo right on the beach for two weeks, and I was absolutely obsessed with building the most epic sand castles possible. Wake up every morning at like, 7:00am, grab my bucket and tools, and claim the perfect spot on the beach before it got crowded. This particular day, I'd spent almost four hours building what I considered my masterpiece. We're talking multiple towers connected by walls, a functioning moat system that filled and emptied with a tide, and even a little village area with tiny sand houses. Other families were stopping to take pictures with their kids. Parents were complimenting my architectural skills. I felt like the king of the beach. Then disaster struck in the form of this group of teenagers, probably around 16 or 17. They've been walking down the beach being loud and obnoxious, but I didn't think much of it until they stopped right in front of my castle. Dude, look at this nerd castle! One of them said, loud enough for everyone nearby to hear before I could even react. Biggest kid in the group just walked up and punted my main tower like he was kicking a field goal. Sand exploded everywhere. Then his friends joined in, stomping and kicking until my entire four hour project was just a Pile of scattered sand and broken shells. They walked away laughing, while I just stood there in shock. Other families were looking at me with sympathy, but nobody said anything to the teenagers. I too young and too stunned to even think of a response. That night, I was furious. My parents tried to comfort me, but they just gave me the typical some people are just mean lecture. I decided I needed a better plan than hoping adults would intervene. The next morning, I started building again, but this time with a secret weapon. I found the heaviest, most angular rock I could carry, about the size of a softball, but with really sharp jutting edges. I buried it deep in the centre of what would become my main tower. Position perfectly at kick height. I built around it, carefully making sure the rock was completely hidden, but would take the full impact of any kick. The rest of the castle was just as elaborate as the day before, maybe even better, since I'd Learned from my previous design. Sure enough, around noon, the same group of teenagers showed up. I pretended to be busy.

Her name is Patty. All right, yeah. Yeah. And Patty told us a little bit about your date. She said that she liked you a lot, but apparently you canceled on her before you guys were supposed to go out again, and now you're not really getting back to her. What? Okay, um, is that not true? I mean, yeah, that. That did happen, yes. You okay? Were you planning on getting back to Patty and rescheduling and actually going out with her? Um. I mean, to be honest, no, not really. Was there, like, a specific reason, or do you just not feel it? I mean, this is really weird. I'm sorry. Uh, I mean, it's kind of A personal thing, to be honest. Like, I don't even think she'd really want me to share with you guys though. Well, I can understand that. But she also asked us to make this phone call and we tell everybody who does one of these second date updates that they have to be prepared to hear whatever it is the person on the other line says. So. Yeah. Do you mind telling us? Cause she's just confused. Oh, she. She asked you guys? Oh my gosh, yes. Um, she wants you to share whatever you think she doesn't want you to share. She wants you to share that. Well, alright. Well, okay. She's like a little older. Um. I don't know if you guys know, like how much you guys know, but um. Yeah, she's very proud that she's a cougar.

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me. And I never received a single rejection email, either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones. Like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes, like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to. University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. Plus, I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just Two weeks of applying, they told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. Did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't wanna be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. But then I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study. How my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me. That I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect. But a week later, I got the email from U N C. Charlotte. There it was, in plain red Ariel Font. Rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades. Just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything. Found a tiny school three states away that she'd never heard of. Applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first Few weeks. She called me every day, but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording. It was five minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for. And my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward five years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we'd never get into college when she asked what my GPA was. 4.2 DASH. What? She exclaimed, how the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know a Zephyr? Encounter my name. At this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling. I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was So good. Why didn't she get

Okay, wait, before we get any further, are you still talking to Scott, who you actually went out on a date with? I mean, he texted me a few times, but I don't know, I just. He's just really not my type, so I haven't really responded, so. Okay, let me just tell you what Vic told us. Vic told us that, you know, He showed up and it was awkward or whatever, he says that he felt like you were flirting with him the whole time while you were out with his coworker. Is that true? Sounds like it's true. Well, I don't think it was the whole time. Okay, dude, if you were flirting with any man that was dressed as a clown for any amount of time, I feel like that means that you must like him a lot, because clowns are not easy to be attracted to. Unless you have a clown fetish. Susan, do you have a clown fetish? No, no, he was really cute. He wasn't wearing the nose or anything. Oh, my god, you sound excited. Um, I don't know. I just. I had a really good time. Um, and if you talk to him, could you tell him my mashed potatoes were running? Your mashed potatoes were running? Yes. What does that mean? That's not what I mean. Hold up. It was just. It was just like an inside joke between us. Could you tell him that? Sure. Susan, shouldn't you tell him, like, you'd like to see him again or something? Not your mashed potatoes were running? Yeah, I just. I just want him to know because we were talking about it for a while, so. He'll get it. He'll get it. It's funny. It's funny.

Well, I guess, but, like, then he would say stuff like, how much do I have to pay you to teach Emily to dance? Like, you? And he would tell me about, like, how sexy I look in certain outfits. Oh, just weird stuff like that. Okay, so. So now we're. We're way beyond the whole I think you're a great person neighborhood. Yes, definitely. When he said this stuff, Was his girlfriend ever around? Like, did he say any of it in front of her? No, it was always when she wasn't around. Okay, and now they're in a relationship and he. And he's still doing it? Yeah, and it's, like, actually getting worse. And he keeps playing it off like he's just joking, but, like, I really don't think he is. Have you told your friend about all of this? I have, yeah. And I told her she needs to be careful, cause I might not be the only one he does it to, you know? What did she say? She just said I have to get to know him and, like, his sense of humor is different. But you don't buy that? No, no, I. And I don't think she believed me even when I told her, you know? Okay, so you'd like to expose this guy? Maybe turn the lights on for your friend here? Yes. I mean, what you really need is for her to hear one of these conversations this guy has with you. Yeah, I. I agree. You know, maybe what we can do is we can put Emily on, and then we'll just tell her, listen. Listen for a second to what you're about to hear, and we'll. And then we'll call him up and Samantha, you can see if he does this whole creepy flirting thing without knowing that she's listening. That you have both Emily and her boyfriend's phone numbers. Yeah, I do. Okay, so what we'll do when we come back is we'll put Emily on, and we'll just have her listen. We won't. We won't even tell her what she's gonna be listening to. We'll just say there's something you need to hear. And then we'll call this Josh guy. We'll see if he acts the way you say he does when he thinks it's just the two of you on the phone. We'll do that when we come back. Next, before we call Josh, we're going to bring on his girlfriend, Emily, who's going to hear everything. Now, she doesn't know why we called her, so this should be pretty interesting. What line is she on? UH2. Okay, so let's bring on Emily to the show this morning. Good morning, Emily. Good morning. And now you know who we are. And Shaggy said you're okay with us putting you on the air today, correct? Yeah. I mean, I guess so. Okay, so without going too much into it, um, somebody who cares about you very much called us and thinks that there is something you need to hear. Okay? Okay. Okay. We're gonna ask that no matter what you hear, try not to interrupt until we ask you to, okay? Okay. Okay. So let's make a little phone call here.

I definitely don't have a girlfriend or a wife. So, Tommy, you recently met a girl named Mary Ellen, right? Yes. Yes, I did. Why? How do you know that? Well, I know that because Mary Ellen emailed us to see if we could get a hold of you because apparently you've scheduled a date with her twice now and blown her off each time. Okay, is that. Is that what she said? That's what she said, yeah. And so we're getting you on the phone to find out why you keep blowing her off. To be honest with you, I've just been really conflicted about it. Um, and why is that? She thinks, just so you know, that you're probably either married or have a girlfriend. Haha, no, I'm not. Wait, is that a nervous laugh cause you're lying to us, or is that a nervous laugh because you're surprised she thinks that? No, I swear to god, I definitely don't have a girlfriend or a wife. Okay, so that's a good start. We got that out of the way. Why won't you go out on a date with her then? Why do you keep scheduling and then bailing? You know, I. It's, I. It's my own insecurity, to be honest with you. Um, I just. I don't know. I just didn't feel comfortable with it when I thought about it. Male pattern baldness? What are you. Is that what it is? Hey, women are okay with that. No, I'm. I'm not balding. Okay? Okay. Oh, I. You said insecure and that's instantly where I went. I was like, he's got to be balding. What? No, that. No, I. That is not the case. Oh, how. How can you be insecure? You're the guy that walks into a bar, asks a hot bartender out, and she actually says yes to you out of the thousands of guys that hit on her all the time. To tell you the truth, I'm not usually that impulsive. And I. I only did that because I. I really was drawn to her. Maryland is really interesting. She's really lovely. And, you know, I. I thought she was great. Yeah. Sounds like the kind of girl that you wanna blow off while she's on the way to a club to meet you. Usually when you describe somebody like that, you're like, I can't wait until they just get right to the door of where we're supposed to have a date and then tell him I'm not showing up, you know? Listen, in all sincerity, I know that in the end, she probably wouldn't be happy with this. Why? So? What is wrong with you? Uh, alright, so you want. You want to hear the. The whole truth, then? Yeah, that'd be great. I'm assuming she probably does too. Yeah, um, we talked on the phone for quite a while the night, uh, that we met, and it Was great. It's really wonderful conversation. And after I got off the phone with her, um, I looked her up on social media. Uh huh. And, uh, I thought she was a lot older than she actually is. Okay. Um, she's 23. Okay. What's wrong with that? It's kind of young. How old are you? I'm 42, and I'm divorced in a couple of years. Um, okay, so you're almost 20 years older than her? Yeah. And that bothers you? Yes. Some girls, like most guys, are like, yeah, Jackpot. It's not me, it's for her. I don't. I don't want to do that to her, if that makes any sense. You don't want her to date a geriatric. Haha, yeah, yeah. It's so many words. Thank you. Yeah, but come on. I mean, shouldn't you leave that up to her? She's gonna have to explain this to, you know, her friends that we go out with and her family, like, meeting her parents. I never for a million years thought that I would ever be that guy, you know, like it. Yeah, the parent. I can. I can see what you mean there a little bit. It would be awkward to be 20 years older than the girl that you're dating and be like, okay, I've officially become like, midlife crisis, man. Yeah, but if you guys have a real connection and you think that she's sophisticated and intelligent, then why not? I think that's kind of A simple way of looking at it. And it is really a lot more complicated than that, especially on. On my end, you know? Okay. Wouldn't. Wouldn't you be curious to find out what she thinks? Not really. I'm not exactly proud to be in this situation. I think she's just kind of going to mock and ridicule me. Um, can you guys just. Can you guys just tell her? Okay, well, how about I just tell you that you actually kind of told her because she's on the other line listening and wants to talk to you.

When you were gone, your dad looked me straight in the face and he said, look, we really hope you're the last boyfriend we have to meet, because we're really tired of meeting all these other guys. What? Are you serious? Yeah. And I was taking it back from it and I was like, well, how many are we talking? And they're like, I don't know, 13, 15, 18. But they didn't even know.

Oh, because Anna emailed us asking for our help to get you on the phone cause you're not answering any of her phone calls. Okay. Okay. So we told her that she could use our phone line to call you as long as she confronted you about the break that you put her on in a segment we call the Awkward Tuesday phone call. What? Yeah. Oh, my God, Anna, are you serious? Yeah, well, I was out of ideas, and I needed to know what was going on, so, yeah, I did.

Yeah. Yep. Mary Ellen. Hi, Tommy. I thought this was. I thought she sent an email. I didn't know that this was a phone thing. I thought she wrote a letter. She did. And then we got her on the phone and told her to hang on while we talk to you to see if we get the answer. And now it's time for her to talk to you. Yeah. Haha. It's one way to sum it up. I'm not really sure how to take this. Oh, man. Um. You know, I, uh. Did you hear the whole thing? Did you hear everything? Yeah. You don't look 42. That's a nice thing. Yeah, kind of.

And you sound more mature. I didn't mean to think that you, you know, look like some old broad. That's not. That's not saying that at all. Uh, no, you're amazing. And you're beautiful, actually. And you're. When I was 23, I. You would. You. You were. Would be the one. I would. Jump about. I tell you what, Mary Ellen, if I were 20 years younger, the things we do. Mary Ellen. Does it bother you that he's 42? I mean, I'm just surprised that he wouldn't have told me that ahead of time. It. In all fairness, I didn't think I had to. Like, I had no idea. I mean, like when you looked me up on social media and you found that out, you could have texted me or said something. Like given me the. The. The respect at least to say something so that I'm not sitting here wondering and trying to figure out what's going on. I'm sorry, I just. I've never been in this situation and I honestly was really desperate to avoid having this conversation. Here we are! Here we are! Here we are! Here we are! But wasn't it kind of a clue when she said her favorite DJ was in town and she wanted to go dancing? That she wasn't 35? Alright, so now you know why I wanted to cancel. Oh, alright, so you're like, who's this Tiesto guy? I knew if I was gonna go there that night that I was just gonna embarrass myself. Hey, Ben, this doesn't sound like Jimmy Buffett at all. This is terrible. I'm not that old. Come on, Tommy, you're not a parrot head. A parrot head? He's more of a grateful dead guy. I just wish that you would have given me the option. And the choice of whether or not I wanted to go out on a date with you because of your age. Well, Tommy, how about this? Would you like to go out on a second date with Marianne? And we will pay for it? Come on, what could it hurt? You know what, though? If she can't really make this decision, and. And don't. And I don't mean this to say in any kind of. Any way, but you don't know what I know. Like, I know what you're going to discover. You're gonna discover that I go to bed really early compared to you. Ha ha ha ha. You're gonna discover. And that I like going to bed at 9:00 o'clock at night. And. Can I interject here for a second? Honestly, I can't drink. Oops. Sorry. Go ahead. Sorry to interrupt you. Um, I. Honestly, I don't know if I wanna go on a second date anymore. Really? Whoa. Yeah. After listening to all this, like, you can't make the decision for me and you. You think you've got it all figured out, and if that's the case, I. I don't wanna deal with that anyways. Wow, that's a good I. It kind of sounds like I'm gonna respect a daughter and her dad. Are you? You don't know. How I feel. I know everything. You think you know everything. Oh, my dad is in his 40s, so that's one thing. Oh, my god, this just keeps getting better.

Yeah. That's what this is about? That's just from. Yes, this is about somebody named Kayla, not somebody named Leslie. Oh, my god, is she listening to this? Kayla? No, Kayla is gone. Because, dude, I mean, we called for a second date update. She wanted to go out with you again, and then she heard you call somebody, like, somebody named Leslie a bitch, and she hung up and isn't interested in doing the second date update anymore. But I want to know who Leslie is now. Me, too. Is it, like, some stalker you have or something? Like, for free? Honestly, you really don't? Like, it's a long story, and it is not, uh, not a good time. Did Leslie happen before the Kayla date or after the Kayla date? It was after Kayla. Like, honestly, I just want to. I just want to forget about the whole thing. It was really. And, like, I just wanna move past it, you know? You don't have to tell me. But maybe if you do tell me, then I could explain to Kayla about the situation with Leslie and help her understand that so that maybe she wants to go out with you again. Yeah, um. I mean, like, I could tell you guys, but, like, I don't want you to go and tell Kayla, cause it's like. It's real. It's like a really weird story. Like, I don't want her to know that. That I. I won't. I don't know. I won't tell her specifics about this Leslie girl. And she's got to be understanding. I mean, she said that she's gone on some pretty horrible dates. From the same site you guys met on, too? Yeah. Okay. We. At this bar, we drank way too much. We wound up hooking up in a Wendy's bathroom. And. And then. And then she bit me. Okay. She bit you when you're in the Wendy's bathroom? She bit me. I got stitches for it, and that's. I'm just gonna leave it there. Where did she bite you? You don't need to know. And so she bit you so bad that you had to get stitches? Yeah. So you see why I don't want to talk to her, right? I guess, yeah. Seems like you could have seen that one coming. If you're hooking up with a girl in a Wendy's bathroom. Yeah. She's crazy. And now she. She's calling me and texting me. won't leave me alone now. So that's what happened. Does that answer your question? Yes, it definitely does. So I won't give Kayla all those details. Thank you. You're. You're welcome. I won't give them to her because you actually just did. Kayla is still on the phone listening

No, I just couldn't do that to her. Alright, well. Oh my god. And that's it? That's the only reason? That is the biggest reason? Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Oh yes.

Well, I guess, but, like, then he would say stuff like, how much do I have to pay you to teach Emily to dance? Like, you? And he would tell me about, like, how sexy I look in certain outfits. Oh, just weird stuff like that. Okay, so. So now we're. We're way beyond the whole I think you're a great person neighborhood. Yes, definitely. When he said this stuff, Was his girlfriend ever around? Like, did he say any of it in front of her? No, it was always when she wasn't around. Okay, and now they're in a relationship and he. And he's still doing it? Yeah, and it's, like, actually getting worse. And he keeps playing it off like he's just joking, but, like, I really don't think he is. Have you told your friend about all of this? I have, yeah. And I told her she needs to be careful, cause I might not be the only one he does it to, you know? What did she say? She just said I have to get to know him and, like, his sense of humor is different. But you don't buy that? No, no, I. And I don't think she believed me even when I told her, you know? Okay, so you'd like to expose this guy? Maybe turn the lights on for your friend here? Yes. I mean, what you really need is for her to hear one of these conversations this guy has with you. Yeah, I. I agree. You know, maybe what we can do is we can put Emily on, and then we'll just tell her, listen. Listen for a second to what you're about to hear, and we'll. And then we'll call him up and Samantha, you can see if he does this whole creepy flirting thing without knowing that she's listening. That you have both Emily and her boyfriend's phone numbers. Yeah, I do. Okay, so what we'll do when we come back is we'll put Emily on, and we'll just have her listen. We won't. We won't even tell her what she's gonna be listening to. We'll just say there's something you need to hear. And then we'll call this Josh guy. We'll see if he acts the way you say he does when he thinks it's just the two of you on the phone. We'll do that when we come back. Next, before we call Josh, we're going to bring on his girlfriend, Emily, who's going to hear everything. Now, she doesn't know why we called her, so this should be pretty interesting. What line is she on? UH2. Okay, so let's bring on Emily to the show this morning. Good morning, Emily. Good morning. And now you know who we are. And Shaggy said you're okay with us putting you on the air today, correct? Yeah. I mean, I guess so. Okay, so without going too much into it, um, somebody who cares about you very much called us and thinks that there is something you need to hear. Okay? Okay. Okay. We're gonna ask that no matter what you hear, try not to interrupt until we ask you to, okay? Okay. Okay. So let's make a little phone call here.

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? She was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue? No, I would.

She lied. She lied about what? Actually, let me rephrase that. She wasn't 100% truthful with me. Okay. Okay. Who is on a first date? Let's be honest. Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay, okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder? Yeah, well, number one, I don't know why someone would do that, but I. I can think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex, or she doesn't want people to know. Or she doesn't want Her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out. Why. Why is that a big deal? Yeah, well, yeah. Our name is summer. Our name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants. And if. Yeah, if we were to, I don't know, like, long term relationship, get married at some point, her name would be Summer Pants. Come on. That. That is the dumbest. I think that's amazing. Yeah, I. I would love that. Well, I would not love that. It make me very uncomfortable knowing maybe people are making fun of her behind her back or something like that. Oh, my god.

The person that you want to be around all the time? No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay, but you are so many assumptions here. One, that she would even take your name when you got married. Like, a lot of women keep their last name. And that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry to take your Last name? Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is, I'm living it. Hahaha. But you're Daniel Pants. And you don't think Summer Pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Alright, well. Oh my god. And that's it? That's the only reason? That is the biggest reason? Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Oh yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing. And years of great jokes. Yeah, yeah, that's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge. No, I'm allowed to. Okay, you're allowed to.

Is this some sick joke that you're trying to pull? No. Hello? I gotta speak to Mike, please. Speaking. Hey, Mike, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning on moving 92.5. How you doing? Uh, I'm okay. How'd you get my number? Uh, just, uh, from some friends. Okay. Specifically one friend. You know what? This is not really a great time for me to talk right now, okay? No, you don't. You. Can I just steal a minute of your time? I don't have a lot of it. I mean, what's this about? We do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. What that is, is where if somebody goes out on a date with one of our listeners and then they get blown off, they email us to call that person and ask why. So somebody went out on a date with you recently? Okay, well, I, I. It's not actually the best time, okay, to talk about this. Can you just give me a second? Can I just ask you real quick if you remember meeting a girl named Jen? Yeah. Is she. Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine, but she's wondering why you stopped responding to her. Okay. Okay. It's fine. It's fine. Just let. Look, just let Jen know that I'll just text her later on tonight, okay? Okay. That's fine. I'm not running out of Safeway. Do you want me to grab you anything while I'm there, or, uh, can you just give me some milk? Okay. No. Do you need some shaving cream or something? No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's like one. One percent. Okay, 300. I'm just talking to my mom. Oh, Melissa. Yeah, hi, Melissa. Ask her if she's gonna come to brunch with us. Who's that in the background? Mike. Hey, Mom, Sally wants to know if you're coming to brunch with us. Is that. Say, yeah, we'll be your mom. That's fine. Hey, real quick, though, son. Hey. Yeah, who's. I think she hung up. Hello? Oh, my god. Did you hear? I wanted to find out more about Mike and the situation. Dinner you wanted to go to brunch on Sunday is what you wanted. Who was that? Mike, are you there? Hello? I think we've been hung up on. You think? Yeah. I don't even know what to say. I'm. I wanna throw up. Well, now I think you're jumping to conclusions, Jen. No, I don't think she is. Jubal, stop. I'm gonna. Let's try to call him back. I'm gonna try to call him back. Oh, man. You guys. No, she was leaving for the store. That's what I heard. So maybe she's gone now. Oh, Gosh, I'm just so sorry. Listen man, just stop. Don't call me anymore. You know? It's cool. Hey, who was that though, in the background? No, no, it's just a telemarketer. She's nosy. Please do not call me anymore. She's okay. I don't wanna be harassed anymore like that. Does she do that every time you answer the phone? Jeez. Oh man. Mike, you there? Oh man. Wow. Gosh. You know, I don't know. Now I'm maybe starting to believe you guys that it could be a girlfriend or a wife or something. Yeah, you think? I don't even have words right now. Can you guys call that up back? Because I do actually have something to say to him. Yeah, how about this? Hey, Jen, Jen, how about this? I'm gonna call him back, but I'm not gonna say anything. You can just start that way. You can yell at him right away if you want to before him. Cause you know he's gonna hang up if I start talking to him. Is this a good idea? Of course it is. No. Haha. I guess we can leave a really awkward message on their machine. No, I got it, I got it. I told you. Hello? Hello? Hey, who's. Who's this? You know, we're on a do not call list, you know? Who, uh, who is this? What's your name? We are on a do not call list. I registered to the internet and you know, now I've told You not to call, you could get reported. No, that's. Hey, I'm not.

What? You want to do what? What are you doing? Is this for real? Hey, are you guys screwing with us right now? Hello? Hi, is this Liz? Yeah, who's this? Hi, Liz, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Oh, I don't know who that is. Oh, it hurt my ego a little bit there. This is. This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning, the radio show. Oh, alright. Good for you. Yeah, thanks. I like it. That's funny, Liz. Listen, Liz, I know it's probably weird to receive a phone call from a radio program, but we recently got an email about you from one of our listeners and they asked us to call you. Really? Yeah. His name is Travis. Travis? Yes. Really? That guy called you? He did. I'm gonna. What did he say? What's. He's emailing you about me? What do you say? He is? I'm gonna take a stab in the dark and say that you probably remember going out on a date with him. That guy's an idiot. That's a lot nicer word than I would have used. So Travis emailed us to get a hold of you because you're not answering any of his text messages after your date. Understandably. He told us about your date. He said that he started like he got upset with you in the car and you guys argued and then He ended up kicking you out of the car. He actually told you that? He did. He told us all about the date. And he wanted us to get you on the phone to tell you that he feels really bad. Oh my god. And would like an opportunity to try to explain to you what happened. It was just so weird, cause, you know, we got along and I thought, you know, it's like the end of the date, and we got into this big fight, and I just. I end up having to call myself a cab from a gas station. Do you mind talking to this for just a second? To explain the date in your words? Cause he said that he came back and a guy was hitting on you, and that's what started the argument. I'll tell you what happened. I'm sitting at the table, he gets up, this guy comes over from bar and starts talking to me. He's not being gross or anything, he just starts chatting with me. And we were just talking, you know, I was just trying to be kind of friendly or whatever. And Travis came back to the table with drinks, and there was kind of an awkward moment there, but then it was fine. And, you know, the date went on and we kind of had a good time. And then nothing happened until the car when when we started fighting. Tell us how that happened. We Got into the car, and he basically said, you should have said something to that guy. And I said, well, you know, if you wanted him to leave, why didn't you say something to the guy? And then he came back with something else. Come on, Liz. You should have said something to that guy. Travis, you're supposed to wait. What? I can't wait with all this bullshit flying around. Come on. Hey, Liz, Travis is on the other line listening. That. That's Travis. He's been listening the whole time. Yeah, he has. It's part of the whole thing that we do. But Travis just ruined it. Way to go, Travis. Well, listen, this is. This is why the call, I. I wanna say that I am very, very sorry. I just got. I lost my temper a little bit. That's not who I am. Whatever. Come on, Liz. Shit happens. You should have sent that guy packing. Maybe I should have, and maybe things would have been different, but that's just not what happened, so. I know. And listen, I'm really sorry. And all I've been able to do is think about how bad I feel. And I just wanna make up for this. I want. I want a second date. What? What makes you think you deserve a second date? Because on a second date, I think I would make you feel really good. Whoa. You deserve to go out on a second date with a real man. What are you talking about? I was on a date with you. You're right. We did go on a date. And sometimes real men get upset. But a real man also knows how to take care of business when the time is right. Oh, gross. I just, you know, I was so attracted to you that half of me wanted to scream, and they're like, the other half of me wanted to make out with you. What did you just say? I said I couldn't decide whether I wanted to just yell at you or, like, you know, pull you in the back seat and just start making out. What? You wanted to make out with me? Yes. I was super attracted to you. Yeah, I. Anytime I want to make out with a girl, I always end up kicking her out of my car. What else did you want to do to me? Whoa, okay, did this just, you know, anything you were up for? Like what? Are you actually attracted to him still? I don't know. What did he want to do?

So somebody emailed us about you. Oh, who? Her name is Lindsay. You served her some coconut shrimp and then just sort of disappeared on her? Um, I don't know if I'd characterize it that way, but, yeah, I, I, I kind of know her. Kind of know her. Okay, that was kind of a happy laugh. Uh, what's that? I mean, you sound positive about Lindsay. Oh, no, I, um. I didn't think that she was that into me, given how we last interacted. What. What do you mean? Well, I mean, we, we, we met at this party that I was working, right? And we were friendly and chatty, and I thought, you know, there's a possibility that something will happen. And then, you know, she invited me to this party at her house, which I thought was a good time. And she said it was like a. Not like a full dinner party, but there's gonna be some food and friends.

Oh, no, I had no problem with her friends. It was the way she ran the thing that sort of ticked me off. What she do? Yeah, she actually made you mad? For a little bit. She asked if I would, like, go by the grocery store and pick up a couple of things on my way over, which, you know, it's fine. I suppose it hit the pot luck kind of thing. Um, such. So I, you know, I go to the grocery store, I get to her house, and she and her friend are still, like, decorating and putting the place together, and she shows me to the kitchen and says, all right, you know, sort of get started. I'll, you know what, be in and, you know, check on you. What? Oh, wait a minute. She made it sound like she invited you over early so that you guys could have some one on one time before the party. Yeah. Not so that you could do her work. Yeah, there was not a whole lot of one on one time aside from her coming in and, like, tasting the things that I was trying and making suggestions on how to fix it. Like, you know, a little more red pepper, a little less salt, Things like that. So it's one on one time with you and a stove making food for her friends? For the most part, yeah.

Like a ridiculous amount. And at first I was like, who is this girl that keeps texting you? And he told me he was asked to train her and if she had any problems or questions, she was supposed to call him and reach out. Okay, no problem. But now the problem is that it seems like she's texting him a lot. Like it is increased, it's a lot more lately. And it's not always during work hours. So he always says something like, oh gosh, this girl has a lot to learn or something to that effect. And now I'm not sure, it's always work stuff that they're texting about, cause he's. It's all the time. So you think maybe this work relationship is now more of a. What, a romantic one? Yeah, I. She's not just reaching out 9 to 5, so I don't know, I. I just feel like she text at more random times, not just during work times, you know? Yeah, but have you asked to see any of the text messages? Like, have you been like, what's so important that she has to text you on a Saturday? Not really. I mean, okay, he is my boyfriend, but he is not my husband. I feel like if we were married, I'd be like, alright, give me your phone right now. We're not. Have you met this Other girl? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We once ran into her and her friends. Okay. And, I mean, she's not ugly, she's pretty. Okay, I, I don't really like her that much. Why is that? Does she give you, like, a bad vibe? So she was really, really excited to see my boyfriend Kirk, but when he introduced us, she was just kind of like, oh, hey, and blew me off. What is this girl's name? It's Jasmine. Okay. And Kurt. You said that's your boyfriend's name? Yeah, yeah, his name is Kurt. Okay, so what do you want us to do? You want us to find out if this work relationship is something more than just work? Yes, but here's the trick. I don't want either of them to know that I'm involved. I don't want to come off as Crazy Girlfriend, so I'm just trying to keep everything on the down low. Okay? I got you. Well, that's pretty much what dirty work Wednesday's for. So do you have this Jasmine girl's number? I don't know. Okay, okay, so texting her is out, and obviously calling her is out, too. I, I mean, I can try and get it from him, but I feel like that would be weird, and he would ask me why I wanted it. No, no, no, it's okay. I mean, we can go a different route then. Um, maybe we just call him instead. What, what is he up to this morning? Is He around or no? Yeah, he should be around. I'm pretty sure he's off today, so. Okay, then let's call him. Let's. Well, what are we thinking of saying here? I say we run the old birthday gambit on him. Uh, okay. What's the birthday gambit? I, I'll explain it to you during the break, cause you're actually gonna have to be the one that does it. Uh, okay, yeah, then I'm definitely gonna need you to explain this to me. Okay? Yeah. Steph, hang on a sec. We'll get Kurt's number from you, and then we'll call him when we come back next. All the hits, Z 1:04. So let's see how this works out. Hello? Hey, I'm calling for Kurt. Yeah, this is Kurt. Hey, Kurt. Um, listen, I'm not sure if you remember meeting me. Uh, my name is Natalie, and I'm a friend of Jasmine's. Oh, hey. Yeah, I was with her when we ran into you one night when we were out. Anyway, there's a reason I was calling. Do you, like, have a quick second for me? Yeah, sure. so a bunch of us are planning a birthday party for Jasmine coming up, and we're putting together a guest list. Anyway, we were trying to figure out who to invite, because we want, you know, make it special, a great night for her. And so we were like, hmm, you know, who would Jasmine want at her party? And my friend Kara said, Just grab her phone, go through her contacts. So that's how I got your number in. A little random, but I just wanted to. I know. I just wanted to know if you wanted to come to the party we were planning for her. Yeah, sure. When is it? Well, we're still trying to figure that part out, but I'll put you down on the list of people.

Her name is Mia. And recently, Mia's husband told her, after 27 years of marriage, that he was leaving her for his new mistress. Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what that feels like. 27 years of marriage. God! He also informed her that he would be kicking her out of their house, which they had purchased together as newlyweds, and the mistress would be moving in. Out with the old, in with the new. Mia, do not lay down and take that. So Mia was obviously devastated, especially because she had raised kids in that house and made a lot of memories there. Yeah, and it's her home. That's her home, man. Not anymore. New lady's home. Mistress is home. Gross. But her husband made her a financial offer that she couldn't refuse. So she accepted the money deal and agreed to move out so that he could have the house with his mistress. Alright. And on her last night in the home, Mia decided to celebrate with a huge bottle of champagne and a giant platter of shrimp, caviar and oysters. Ooh, way to go, Mia! Might as well go out with the party, you know? Hello. Yeah. The next day, Mia's husband and his young mistress moved in. And things were going perfectly for about a week. Uh huh. And then something changed. Uh oh. That's when they started noticing an awful smell. Oh, No. Throughout the entire house. Oh, what you do. It was pungent, rotten, and ammonia scented, they say. Oh, like chemically. It was in every single room of the house, too. What? And they couldn't figure out what was causing it. At first, they thought maybe an animal had gotten into the attic and died. Uh huh. So they brought in exterminators and found nothing. Then they thought maybe it was mold, so they brought in a mold specialist, and no mold was found. Okay, that's already a lot of money there. It. Yeah, right. Like, they're in debt big time at this point. They're spending a lot. They cleaned all the carpets, replaced the entire central air and heating system. Again, it's expensive. Wow, that is expensive. It replaced it all. I thought for sure it was like fish in the ventilation system, and that didn't even work. They even installed an expensive ozone generator for the air filter to try to get rid of the smell. But no matter what they did, nothing got rid of the stench. And soon the husband and his mistress were having fights because of it. Yeah, I mean, nobody. Can you imagine living with a set? I mean, they described it as a set of a dead animal in your house 24 7. And obviously for a while, if they got all that work done in the meantime. Right. The only thing that's changed is you moved in. It's gotta be you. I didn't know you smelled like rotting animal. Uh, they were frustrated and disgusted, obviously, because they couldn't figure out where the smell was coming from or why it smelled so bad. So they decided to put the house on the market and just move on. Oh, my god. And that's extreme. Well, and how do you sell a house that stinks? That's exactly everyone that comes in. I mean, you're not gonna be able to sell it for any money. It's exactly what the real estate agent told them. The horrible stench, it's gonna be a major problem for perspective buyers. Yeah, and would drive the price down considerably. But they didn't care. They just wanted to get out. There's a sign outside. Must have no sense of smell. Right? Right. Hazmat suit available. Here's your gas mask to tour the home. Finally, they got an offer on the house. It was extremely low, but they needed the funds to move out and had no other offers, obviously.

What? Your dad made me promise not to go through with the wedding. Please tell me you're lying. No, Justin, that's the most bullshit excuse I've ever heard. What really happened? He. He met me the day of the wedding, and he said that if I didn't go through with marrying you, then he would give me $80,000. And he wrote me a check. Awkward. What? Oh, my god. What? Shut up. What was that? Oh, hey, what's up, Justin? How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Excuse me. Yeah, Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. You familiar? Claire? Who? What's going on? Claire? Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, Claire's still there. Justin? Justin, this is Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show, and we do a segment called The Awkward Tuesday Phone Calls, where if you want to confront somebody about a difficult issue or you just have kind of an awkward conversation, you can email the show and we'll give you some advice on how to handle the conversation, as long as you make a very awkward phone call. And that's why we're on the phone now, is Claire wanted to call you and ask why you ditched her on your wedding day on our show. Claire, I'm on the radio. Who cares about that? Did you just say hear dad, he wrote you a check for 80 grand? Yeah. Why would he do that? What? Why? And you took it? My dad would never do something like that. Okay, I don't believe that. He did. Give us a reason. Give us something. Look, I wasn't going to take it. I tried to say no, but he made me promise. And, you know, I've never had $80,000 before. I couldn't turn him down. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, my god. So you are telling me that you didn't marry me for $80,000? I'm worth $80,000 to you? I mean, no, no, it's not. It's. It wasn't about that. It's that your dad convinced me. He. He talked me into it. He said it was the right thing to do, you know, so I. I figured, you know, maybe he. He's right, so I took the money. It's the right thing to do. To leave his daughter, literally minutes before you're supposed to get married, in exchange for $80,000? Look, it was a tough choice. It was a tough decision to make, but, you know, what was I supposed to do? Marry her? I figured, you know, maybe he. He's right, so I took the money. It's the right thing to do. To leave his daughter, literally minutes before you're supposed to get married, in exchange for $80,000? Look, it was a tough choice. It was a tough decision to make, but, you know, what was I supposed to do? Marry her? Not take the 80 grand? You could not take the 80 grand and married her. Yeah, look, I. I tried to. I tried to say no, but, you know, he just talked to me into it. And then next thing I knew, I was already gone. I was already driving down the street. Oh, man. Man, I couldn't take it back. I don't know who's worse for you, Claire, your dad or him. I can't. Like, this is too much. Oh, my god, I. I can't believe what I'm hearing right now. Look, Claire, I. I don't know what else I can say other than I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. You know, to be honest with you, he did me a huge favor by not marrying an asshole like you. Justin, you put an 80 thousand dollar price tag on my head? How dare you? To be fair, he's the one who came up with $80,000. So, you know, I just. I just said yes to it. You know, he didn't put the price tag on. You didn't call your own price. And Justin, how stupid are you? If you're marrying into this rich family, you could have had way more money when her dad finally kicked the bucket than $80,000. You are such an idiot. Well, you know, he probably wouldn't have left me anything. A guy didn't like me.

Okay. Can. Can you be more specific? Sure. So, like I said, we got married almost a month ago, and the actual wedding was smooth, and the reception was nice and all that. I still remember, though, at one point, late in the night, we were trying to get all the bridesmaids together on the dance floor, and we couldn't find my friend Amy. Like, she was nowhere to be found. So I thought, well, maybe she's in the bathroom or something like that. Maybe she went outside, you know, who knows at that point of the night? So the next morning, we had a little breakfast gathering with all our friends, and I asked if anyone had seen her, and someone said that she left the reception early, and it looked like had. She had been crying. And I was like, should I text her? And, you know, everybody was like, I'm sure it was nothing. Go have fun in your honeymoon. Yeah, sure. Okay. So we went on our honeymoon, and we were gone for, like, two weeks. I remember posting a bunch of pictures and seeing who liked them, and I noticed that all of my friends were liking our pictures, but not Amy. So I'm like, hmm. And so one of the pictures, I was doing the whole swim with the dolphins thing, and so I actually tagged her in the picture. I wrote, hey, Amy, this dolphin asked for your phone number, and I was waiting for her to respond. No response. Aha! The plot thickened. So we got home from the honeymoon, and the entire next week, we're busy moving into our new house. But I keep trying to reach out to Amy, and she won't text me back. So I text one of my other friends who knows her and asked, you know, if she knows what's going on. And she tells me that Amy said, tell her to ask her husband. I'm sure he got the pictures and text messages on his phone. Oh, boy. So what did your husband have to say about like that? He had no idea what she was talking about. Hmm. Okay, so she left your wedding early, crying. Then she doesn't show up for the breakfast thing, then she won't talk to you or respond, and she says your husband knows what's up? Yeah, I mean, I think that's what she's implying. Well, did your husband ever, at any point date this Amy girl? No. Were they particularly close friends? No, he barely knows her. Oh, wow. Okay, so it has something to do with text messages and pictures? I guess that's what she told one of my other friends. And she won't tell you anything about it? No, but I want to. Know, I mean, for one thing, it's leaving kind of a stain on the memory of my wedding night. And second, if you're gonna bring my husband's name into this, you better be able to prove what you're accusing them of. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Okay, so she wouldn't talk to you about. Do you think she's gonna talk to us about it? Like, whatever it is? I mean, that's what I'm hoping for. Okay, um, so let's put you on hold for a second. You can give her number to shag. We'll try calling her when we come back, and then we'll see if she can get her to talk to us about whatever it is. When we come back, darling. At random. So this will be Amy's phone number, and she will. We know she ain't gonna talk to Gabrielle, but maybe she will talk to us. Hello? Hi. Good morning. I'm calling to speak to Amy, please. Um, can I ask who's calling? Yeah, this is the Z Morning Zoo radio show. Nick, Shaggy and Ashley on Z1O4. Oh, are you serious? Yes, I'm sure. Is this Amy? Yeah. Yes, this is Amy. Hello, Amy. How are you this morning? I'm good. How are you? We are great. Um, so, listen, I don't know if you've been listening to our show at all this morning. Have you managed to catch any of it yet today or. Oh, I haven't, actually. I'm sorry. No, that. That's okay. Um, so Anyway, what we've been talking about this morning is what is your worst experience at a wedding? And somebody texted us. I mean, they've been. They keep texting us going, you seriously need to talk to my friend Amy and ask her what happened at the last wedding she was in. Um, who texted you that? Well, we're. We're not sure. We. We get the text messages. They have numbers, but we don't have names that go with them. Did something bad happen? I mean, yeah. Yeah, something pretty bad happened, but I really

That's all you're gonna say, huh? Uh, after all this time, I call you, and you have nothing? Yeah. This is weird. Like, I don't really know what you want from me.

Cause I guess that's less weird. Oh, well, that's kind of sweet. Oh, my gosh. I was thinking to text him, too, but I thought it would be kind of weird. Okay, wait, before we get any further, are you still talking to Scott, who you actually went out on a date with? I mean, he texted me a few times, but I don't know, I just. He's just really not my type, so I haven't really responded, so. Okay, let me just tell you what Vic told us. Vic told us that, you know, he Showed up and it was awkward or whatever. he says that he felt like you were flirting with him the whole time while you were out with his coworker. Is that true? Sounds like it's true. Well, I don't think it was the whole time. Okay, dude, if you were flirting with any man that was dressed as a clown for any amount of time, I feel like that means that you must like him a lot, because clowns are not easy to be attracted to. Unless you have a clown fetish. Susan, do you have a clown fetish? No, no, he was really cute. He wasn't wearing the nose or anything. Oh, my god, you sound excited. Um, I don't know. I just. I had a really good time. Um, and if you talk to him, could you tell him my mashed potatoes were running? Your mashed potatoes were running? Yes. What does that mean? Hold up. It was just. It was just like an inside joke between us. Could you tell him that? Sure. Susan, shouldn't you tell him, like, you'd like to see him again or something, not your mashed potatoes were running? Yeah, I just. I just want him to know because we were talking about it for a while, so. He'll get it. He'll get it. It's funny. It's funny. Okay, well, hey, Susan, hang on, hang on. Let's see if he gets it. Hey, Vic, her mashed potatoes are running.

Hi, can I speak to Ricky, please? This is Ricky. Hey, Ricky, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. This is what? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. The radio show. What is that? The radio or the radio show? Cause the radio is a device that you can listen to a lot of things on music programs. I know what a radio is. Why are you calling me? Oh, I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us about you. Somebody that you know very well. Okay. I mean, you have a puppy with her. You should know who it is. What? Why are you asking all these questions? Well, I'm asking you because we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. So you recently went out with Becca. Okay, yeah. Becca. All right. Uh huh. Okay, that sounds funny to you? I don't know why? And she emailed us because she said she's been trying to get a hold of you since you guys hung out all day. You bought a puppy together, you spent the night together, and then you were gone. And she doesn't know why you're not calling her back. Okay. And now you just want to talk about this? Well, yeah, cause. Yeah, pretty much. You're not. She doesn't know. She doesn't know what's happening. She thought that. I don't know, that something maybe bad happened to you. She Wants to know why you're not calling her back. Well, I mean, does that even matter? Of course it matters to her. It matters for sure. You guys, like, you bought a puppy together? Yeah. All right, I mean, that's my thing. What do you want me to say? What do you mean it's your thing? You stayed the night and you wrote her a note that said, Love, Ricky? Yeah, I mean, that's kind of guy I am. You know, you might get a puppy. You're probably gonna get a puppy, huh? I'm so confused. What? I don't. All right, I mean, if you. You gotta know, like. Yeah, I like to buy girls puppies. Wait a minute, though. That doesn't make any sense. You kept the puppy? Do you have, like, 80 puppies at your house? I don't know. It's my move. It's what's what? You know, it's my thing. You want me to talk about it? I mean, what, you never heard of something like this? No, I've never heard of a dude that just meets women and buys them puppies. Of course he didn't, cause that's what I do. Okay, wait, okay, well, how do you. What do you do with the puppy afterwards, though? That's the question you took. She told us that you spent the night and then you were gone, and so was the puppy. Yeah, I have this syringe kit with my friend. He works at a pet store, you know, in A. He sees me walking with a girl at the pet store. He knows that this particular puppy, you know, when I give her the puppy, works every time. Wait, I don't get it. Works for what? You. You know, you pick. You want to pick up a girl, you give her a puppy. Hahaha, it's true, I guess. But it doesn't make any sense. You were already out to lunch with a girl before you bought the puppy. I mean, you already picked her up. It's a first date move, though. Like, you know, you know you're gonna seal the deal if you give her a puppy. It works like a charm, honestly. They love it. Oh, so wait, you're trying to get off a puppies? I'm not trying to. I do. Yeah. I mean, we only know one person that's come in contact with you, and it worked with them. It always works. Oh my god, dude. Okay, that is evil. You are using puppies. What? I mean, dudes walk dogs and they get to meet girls when they're walking the dog. I mean, I just give them the dog. Oh, I'm cutting out the walking part. What happens to the puppy, though? You know, in the morning, I bring the dog back. I bring the dog back to the pet store. Yeah, my friend takes it back. Oh my gosh, what am I gonna take care of this thing? You're crazy. Bring it back. But Ricky, do You understand what you're doing? Like, you're doing more than just getting laid. Like you are roping these women into believing that you want to have a future with them. Whatever. If we went out to dinner, am I making a commitment to eat dinner with you for the rest of my life? No, but you're not taking care of dinner for the rest of your life together as a like, it's joint custody of a puppy. Come on, if you believe that we're gonna have a whole life together just cause I gave you a puppy. I mean, in honesty, that's really stupid. Oh my god, now you're calling her dumb? I mean, come on, you just meet this guy in the first day, you're like making plans for the rest of your life based on a puppy. I mean you. You have to be a moron. Well, Ricky, after that, I would like to tell you that somebody wants to talk to you because Becca is on the other line and she just heard everything you said.

Hello? Hi. May I speak to James, please? Yeah, speaking. James, how are you, man? This is Jubal from the radio show Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, your radio show? I am not one myself, but I am on a radio show. I'm calling you because one of our listeners actually sent us an email, and they wanted to see if we could get you on the phone. Uh, okay. Who is it? Well, it's somebody that you met this weekend at a Halloween party. Met a lot of people. It's a big party. Can you just hurry up and tell me who it was and stop trying to be, like, Mr. Radio man? I would love to do that. I like your new title, though. Yeah, I do. Mr. Radio man. I like it. Thank you, James. Appreciate it. Um, I'm gonna guess that you remember her because you guys hooked up. Um. Oh, uh, yeah, I know what you're talking about. Ha ha ha. All right. Uh, okay. Ha ha ha. Well, we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody or hook up with somebody at a Halloween party and that person doesn't call you back, you can email us and we'll get Them on the phone and ask what happened. So Haley, she wants to know why you won't answer any of your text messages. What do you mean why? She's taken. She's, she's definitely not taken. Yeah, no, she's very single. She's like, as single as they come. What? No, no, she, she is taken. I, I, trust me, she's taken hundred percent. What? So wait, you think she's in a relationship is what you're saying? I know she's in a relationship. How do you know that? Cause her boyfriend came up to me afterwards and was giving me crap. That's why we, we, we had a scrap. We had a full scuffle about it in the backyard. What? Wait, what? You had a fight with a guy who said that he was Hailstorm's boyfriend? I don't know, like the hailstorm, whatever that is, but yeah, after I went downstairs and I almost had a fight with a guy in the backyard dressed like the Incredible Hulk. You almost. You were dressed like a pirate and you almost had to fight the Incredible Hulk. Whoa! No, I did fight the Incredible Hulk. Oh, dude, it started swinging at me. Okay, this sounds like a bad memory for you. This. I think this is a really cool memory. Sounds like something cool that happened. Yeah, seriously. I wanna see it in theaters. Okay, I know you guys are based at the costumes, but, like, we. Haley is a person that calls into Our show every so often. And although she's wild, a little wild child, I get that. But, like, she doesn't have a boyfriend. Like, there's no way she has a boyfriend. Well, if she doesn't have a boyfriend, then why did the Incredible Hulk try to fight me and tell me that I was messing around with his girlfriend? I don't know. And he got confused. There's something missing here. I don't know what happened. I just. He came up to me afterward, he said, why are you messing around with my girl? I said, what girl? He said that she was his, and he was drunk. Next thing you know is, we're swinging, and I was pushed him off. Everybody was coming around me like, hey, break it up, everything like that. And I was like, you know what? This isn't worth it. I'm out of here. This is. This is not even worth it. I already got humiliated by a government, getting walked in on. And come downstairs, and I'm this big Old Green guy trying to get up in my business. It just wasn't working. Some people like when a big green guy got to get up in their business. Side note, anyway, sorry about. They had to deal with that, but she's been texting me. Why wouldn't you just text her back and say you have a boyfriend, you're a cheater, or whatever you wanna accuse her of? I don't wanna encourage her. I just. I'm out. That's it. I am out. Yeah, it's understandable. I mean, you were just, like. You met her, what, like, an hour before you guys started messing around? Yeah. Besides, I mean, I didn't even get her number or anything, so I've just been getting, like, random texts from this number. I didn't know who it was. I just was not. Ignored it. Okay, well, you're not gonna be able to ignore it now, James, so much, because she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. Hey, James. Oh, my god.

Kim, listen, this isn't the front desk. This is actually the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O four back in Virginia Beach. And I'm afraid you're on a segment we do called dirty Work Wednesday.

Why would you do something like this? Because I'm sick and tired of you trying to hide the fact that you and your boss are sleeping together. I needed proof, and I got it. Kim, hold up. What makes you think I'm sleeping with my boss? Okay, well, that just answered my question. You're staying in his room, right? Let me talk to him. Hold on a second. I'm down here for work. I told you that. Yeah, I thought you're putting in some serious work on your boss. Probably last night. Are you. Are you serious right now? I can hear him. He's right behind you right now. Kim, we are in a meeting right now, and you're embarrassing me in front of everybody. Yeah, let me. Let me talk to your little boyfriend. There. Put him on the phone. Yeah. Hello? Oh, hey, boss. I hope you're having a great time with my wife. I want you to enjoy your little time with her, because when she gets back, she's gonna need a place to stay. Also, you should know, like, this little slutty phase that she's going through, it goes away real quick. And then you're stuck with this spoiled little princess who won't compromise in anything and.

You got this all wrong. She deserves to be treated better than that, too, buddy. And Bruce. And you know what? You're right. So I'm gonna let you take over. You obviously can treat her a lot better. Can you tell her? Tell Kim it's been a great three years. Actually, you know what? Don't tell her that. Tell her the first year was great, but then the rest of it sucked. You guys can hang. You guys can hang up on them now. I'm done. Are you talking to us or to them? You want us to hang up? Yeah, you can hang up on. On. On Blood, Faith and Bruce. Oh, okay.

And that. That confirmed. I mean, they were in the room together. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Oh, I'm not. I mean, I'm. I'm glad it's over. I know the truth.

Hi, can I speak to Lizzie, please? Uh, this is her speaking. Who's calling? Hi, Lizzie. This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. What. What is this? It's a radio show. That's odd. I've never been called by radio before. Well, cool. There's a first for everything. Any idea why I'm calling you? No idea. Okay, well, contemplating hanging up. No, please don't. Please don't hang up. Yeah, don't hang up. You're gonna be very interested in this phone call, okay? Because it involves, I'm sure, one of the many men that's vying for your attention, beating down your door. I guess you're implying that I go on lots of awesome dates. Well, I heard you're as beautiful as a snail, so I figured you're probably going out on a lot of dates. Hmm. Sounds vaguely familiar. Uh. Oh, does it remind you of somebody named Mark? Yeah, actually, that's not a bad giggle. That is kind of a positive giggle that you have right there. Well, I mean, that was kind of cute. Cute? It was cute. Okay, I did. So, yes, Mark is the guy that asked us to call you. He says that you met after one of his poetry readings, and he really enjoyed spending time with you. But now you're not answering any of his phone calls or text messages, and he was hoping we could find out why. Well, it wasn't, like the best date ever. Okay? Okay. He Said he thought that you liked him until he said the line about being as beautiful as a snail. Um, I mean, the snail thing, I was like, what? That's weird. Um, but it was like. I don't know. I guess he was just trying to be, like, dorky and poetic and find. Find meaning and nothing and then make it something. Okay. So I was like. I was like, oh, you know, like, he's trying, so that's nice, but. So wait, it wasn't the snail line? No, it wasn't the snail line that got me. Was the date already bad before the snail line? Cause he thought that that was the turning point. No, no, no. I mean, he made fun of me. What? Like how? Oh, we were just talking about poetry and stuff. You know, like, you do it places where people go and talk about poetry. Um. And makes sense. Yeah. So he asked me, you know, what my. Who my favorite poet was, and I told him, and he just laughed at me. Just make fun of me and for it. So I thought, wow, this guy is kind of a joke. Oh, wow. So you brought up your favorite poet and he laughed at your taste? Yeah, just shut me down. Like, that's messed up. Did you tell him that? We talked about it. We kind of felt like we were arguing and going back and forth, and it was just not comfortable and I like how he asks your opinion and then says, uh, that's a bad opinion. Yeah, maybe he thought I was joking, but I definitely wasn't, because my answer was one of my biggest inspirations. So when he shot me down, I was like, wow, this guy's an ass. Wow. Yeah. Okay, well, who's your biggest inspiration? So I said that my favorite poet was Dr. Seuss, and he laughed at that. That's awesome, though. And now the guy in the background is laughing. Great. Yeah, you don't expect, like, people to talk about great poets and then. I mean, maybe you do. I don't know. I'm not a big poetry guy, but I wouldn't think Dr. Seuss. Like, I thought she's kidding. See? Yeah. I mean, like, it doesn't matter. Like, anytime I bring it up, everyone's gonna think that I'm kidding. Like, it's a joke. And. See, he's laughing again. Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, my god. I can tell you, you're frustrating, you're getting upset, and Jose laughs at everything, so don't worry about that. Okay? He laughs at everything. But I will tell you this. Mark is actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Oh, my god. Are you serious? Yes. Yeah. Sorry if that makes you even more upset. Oh, my god. Sorry, Doctor Seuss. That's what this is about.

Uh, okay, uh, I kind of don't listen to the radio, so I. I've never heard of you guys. Sorry. But that's okay. It's all good, man. I'm calling you today, though, because we actually got an email into our show about you. What? Yeah, it's a segment we do on our show. It's called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they can email us and we'll get that person on the phone and hopefully find out why they're not calling them back. And you recently met a woman named Olivia? Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay, wait, wait a minute. She emailed you about me and her? Yeah, she told us about how you came over to work on her house because you do landscaping, right? Yeah, but apparently you do more than that. No, we heard full service. We heard you are hot. Yeah, well, I. But like, why would she call the radio show? I don't know. Cause she wants to see you again. Yeah. She said she really enjoyed your initial experience. With her when you came over to work at her house. And then she said she liked hanging out with you at the bar, but that you just disappeared, and she hasn't heard from you. Yeah, but I just don't get why she would want to make this business public. I don't think that she's ashamed by any of it. Okay, no, no, That's not what I mean. Um. What do you mean? I mean, I. I just don't know why she would want that out there, but. All right. Um. Sounds like it was fun. I mean, it was until, you know, we're at the bar later on, and we're shooting some pool, and I went to go get some. Another round of drinks, and this guy comes up to me, you know, never seen this guy before in my life, okay? But he. He bows up on me and he says, I know you slept with my wife. Wait, what? Drinks. And this guy comes up to me, you know, never seen this guy before in my life, okay? But he. He bows up on me and he says, I know you slept with my wife. Wait, what wife? Yeah, exactly. I'm like, what? I don't know what you're talking about. This guy says that he followed her to the bar from the house, saw her hanging out with me, knew that something had happened. Whoa. And, like, I. I was like, you Know, I was questioning it. It's like, is this guy messing with me? You know? So I asked him some questions, you know, I asked him a little bit about the house. He knew everything about the house. He knew everything about the lawn, you know, and I. Wow. But that's. So you think Olivia is married? Yeah. So why would she call us? I now have the same questions that you do. Yeah. Why would she want this out there? What the. And that's what I'm saying, I. I have no idea why she would want this out in. In public unless she, you know, I don't know. But there's gotta be more to the story because she would have seen. I mean, if she is, in fact, married. I don't know for sure that I even believe that yet. If she is married, she would have seen her husband at the bar talking to you. Thing is, the pool is in its own area in the bar, so it's, like, in another room. So she might not have actually seen him. That would be so weird for him to just approach you and not approach her. What kind of self control do you have to have? I don't know. Maybe she. Maybe he did, but he was basically just talking to me. And, yeah, he threatened me. He basically said, you know, you're not seeing her anymore. You're not talking to her. What? He basically said, That I couldn't, like, landscape at the place anymore. Oh, damn. You lost a client, too? After all that? Like, I don't want to get any more trouble with my job, so I. I took off. Yeah, understandable. But why didn't you respond to our text messages? Like, hey, I'm not group riding back because you have a husband. I'm not getting in the middle of that. I get, like, I didn't mean to get in the. In the middle of it in the first place, but. Yeah, after I met the guy, it's like, no, I'm not gonna be texting with his wife. I have a. That is awful, Austin. I feel like she can't be married. Yeah, she's willing to do a second date update with us and everything else. There's got to be more to the story. I don't know. I know, I know. Who does know? It's Olivia, and she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Unless she's hung up. What? Olivia, are you there? Yeah, I'm here. What are you doing

I mean, legal. Yeah. Okay, the woman on the phone for a second date update today refers to herself as a cougar. Oh, but apparently one of the cubs has left the den and mama needs to find him. That's why she's on the phone for a second date update. Her name is Patty. What's up, Patty? Hi. Hey. Whoa, Patty, are you excited about that intro? That was a really good intro. Okay, so you embrace all of this? Absolutely. Okay. Alright, well, tell us about the cub that's run away from you and you need to track down. What's his name? His name is Martin. He's in his early 20s and I met him online. I love cougars cause the first thing they always bring up, his age. Yeah. What's your guys's age gap? Um, well, I will say roughly that I'm over 10 years older than him. Nice. Okay, good. Significantly. So, um, I'm not gonna be specific because a lady never tells. Okay. Alright, so you met him online, and what did you guys do when you met up? Well, we met up at a bar. And I mean, it was really cute. He was carded because I was next to him. I was carded too. I'm normally not, so I thought that was adorable. And yeah, he was just like. He was this cute little cub. And we talked about like, you know, going to the gym and Stuff we joked around cause I, I don't know, I thought it was hilarious cause I think it's ridiculous when people get on the elliptical and put on like the lowest level and then they look like they're flying on the elliptical cause they're not actually supposed to. Yeah, they're just going super fast. Yeah, it looks so stupid. And we just like laughed about gym stuff. And we found out that we actually go to the same gym. Wow. Can't wait though. Can we rewind just a second? It sounds like you were turned on that he was carded because he looks so young. Like, how young? Do you like your men? I mean, legal. Yeah. That's a good thing. Okay. I just is like. Do you guys have things in common? Like besides the gym? Did you find other common ground? I mean, yeah, like absolutely. We both like having fun. We like to both like having fun. I mean, like, you know, ziplining, bungee jumping, stuff like that. Like, definitely. Like the fun stuff going on, you know, vacation and. Alright. So you're pretty interested in him? Yeah, absolutely. He's just. He's a lot of fun. He's really funny. He was really, really cute. And he was cool with your age difference? Uh, yeah. I mean, he did know that I was older going into it, but, you know, he was a little bit reluctant. I mean, he was a little shy and maybe a little nervous. But, you know, I made him feel at home, made the cub feel comfortable. Well, doesn't sound like you made him feel comfortable enough, cause now he's not calling you back. Oh, well, I to say, I mean, we did talk about kids. Um, he asked me if I had any kids, and I told him I didn't and I wasn't interested in having them. Uh huh. I don't know. Maybe that might have been too early to have that conversation, and maybe that made it a little awkward. Or maybe he's looking for a partner and he's not just looking for a fun night out. I mean, maybe a partner that wants to have kids with him. I'm sorry, you can have partners without kids. But you know what I'm trying to say. Yeah, no, no, I totally get it. I think that's totally legitimate. I do. But he's so young, right? Did you talk to him that way, too? I'm sure you're so young, you don't know. Yeah, you don't know what you want. You don't know what you want. Well, I try to keep it fun, I try to keep it simple. Because sure, you might be looking for a miss forever and settling down and whatever, but I mean, like, you haven't found her yet, which means that you're single till then. And we could have fun in the meantime. Okay? You know, and I could teach him a lot. I mean, I have experience. I Mean, I'd be a great teacher. Oh, you mean like teach him in the bed? Okay. Hey. Oh, I mean, I can teach him in any room, not. Not just the bedroom. Okay, that's awesome. I like you, Patty. Oh my god. Alright, well, how did everything end with you and Martin? Well, after like the bar and everything, he walked me to my car and I thought that he was having a great time, especially because like, right then we started making out and it was hot. It was awesome. That's good. You know, it's passionate. Yeah, absolutely. And you know, like, I kind of was like, hey, well then why don't you just like, come over and check out my place and we can, you know, start our first lesson. Did you say that? No, but I was just like thinking about it. Okay, okay. You know, like, young guys are so inexperienced and I can help them out with that. So what did he say to that? Did he go back to your place? Well, no, he actually kind of got a little bit more nervous and I just don't think that he was ready cause he was just like, you know, but this is our first date. And I was like, well, it's really not that good big of a deal. Cause I wanna establish what I want this to be. Be immediately. Right? Which is fun. And that's what I like, that's what I think Any guy would like. Especially. No strings attached, no pressure. Um, yeah, so we had a another date set, and he canceled like a couple hours before. And I kind of feel frustrated because I just don't think he realizes the benefits of, like, you know, dating a cougar. Yeah, and there's the teaching. There's the teaching that you can do. Oh, there's definitely the teaching. Alright, well, there's definitely the teaching. We will play a song, and then we'll come back and call him and get your second date update. Okay? Great. Alright, hang on.

You're planning on proposing? Congratulations. No, I'm kidding. Uh, so. But you were planning on proposing the idea to be in a relationship, then? Yes. Okay. What's her name? Her name is Brooke. Okay. And how long have you guys been dating? I'm just. I'm kind of curious of the time frame. We've been dating since the beginning of the summer, so around early. Early July. Okay. And you got this great girl, you're gonna ask her to be your girlfriend? What's the problem? Problem is, last weekend, she had a friend stay with her at her apartment. A guy. And it's. It's bothering me because I don't know exactly what went on while he was here. Oh, so another predator enters the scene here. Who was this other guy? His name is Lucas. Um, he's one of her best friends from college, and I guess he just went through a really bad breakup and wanted to get away, so he came into town for the weekend. And let him stay at her apartment. Right. Just speaking from a experience, Austin, after a really rough breakup is not the time that you want some guy crashing at your girl's place. I know, right? That's what I was trying to say to her before he showed up. We kind of got in a fight about it. Okay. So hold on. So this guy who's one of her best old friends comes into town after a rough breakup to stay with your girl, and at this point, you decide to start a fight right before he shows up? That's bad strategy, brother. Bad strategy. I know, I know. And she said he was just staying on the couch and nothing was gonna happen. Yeah, I just still didn't feel good about the idea. Yeah. You know, you should have told her that he could stay at your place. That would have been like, you know, like the right move. Then she thinks, oh, wow, you're helping out. You're such a great guy. Yep. But now she just thinks that you're being, like, jealous and selfish. So I'm gonna take a wild guess here. Austin, say you wanna know if anything happened between this Lucas guy and Brooke. Yeah, but I need a way to find out without thinking I'm spying on her or. Well, that's where we come in. Um, now, I'm sure you have Brooke's number, but do you have this Lucas guy's phone number? No. No. Okay. Uh, alright. Uh, hey, any ideas? Anybody? Uh, you know, it's actually been a while since we played our favorite game. The Naked Game. Oh, yeah. Ah, the Naked Game. Yeah. You know what that means? If we do the Naked Game, it's the return of everybody's favorite completely fake morning show. Oh, God. Scotty in the bus? No, So. Okay, listen, Austin, stand by. We're gonna run the naked game. This is a good idea. We'll run the naked game on Brooke when we come back. Okay? Hello? Uh, good morning. I'm calling to speak to Brooke, please. This is Brooke. Hey, Brooke. This is the Scotty of the buzz morning show on your home of the most music, 98 6 FM. How are you this morning? Uh, I'm good. Fantastic. So, listen, we're smack dab in the middle of one of our most popular games right now, and it's called The Naked Game. Now, I know you're probably freaking out, wondering how this works, so I'm gonna let my co host, Tiffany, explain the rules. Okay, so we have somebody you know very well on hold right now, and he claims that if we ask you the question, who was the last person to see you naked, you would answer him. Right. And now, before we get your answer, what's on the line here, buzz? Well, Buddy, a romantic, all inclusive getaway for two to Paradise Island Resort. Everything's paid for by us. Scotty the bus. This should be an easy question, Brooke. So here it goes. What is the name of the last person to see you naked? And you can't say yourself? Okay, this is really embarrassing. Well, remember, he just saw you naked. I mean, it doesn't mean anything happened, right? Right. So. Right, right, right. Who was the last person to see you Naked. Okay, and you just need a first name or a last name, too. No, no, first name is fine, I guess. But if you can't remember their last names. Like, how many people have you seen you naked this week? Okay, buzz, time to shut up over there. Um, okay, Brooke, we need an answer.

Nice. That's okay, Jen. I might wanna crawl under a rock and die. And she's worried that that might have scared him off, because after she sent the picture, he stopped responding to her. Right, Jen? That's the shortest, harshest version. Poor girl. Poor Jen. Tell us a little bit about the guy you want us to call today. His name is Mike, and I met him a little over a week ago. I was out with my girlfriends one night, and he was having, like, a guys night out. We're at the same place, and our groups just kind of naturally merged. Okay. And him and I hit it off, and we kind of branched off by ourselves and started talking. And chemistry was there. Totally great. He did this really cute move that kind of melted me. We're talking at the bar, and he points over my shoulder. He goes, oh, my god, look at that gorgeous girl over there. I turn around, it's a mirror. What are you. And you. That. That actually worked on you? I melted. Oh, I thought that was awesome. And then that's when you send him the sex message, right? No. Oh, you make me sound terrible. We're just giving you a hard time, Jen. So he used his little mirror line on you, and it worked. It worked. But we already had chemistry before that happened. So we exchanged numbers, and for the next few days, we were texting pretty heavily, back and forth, flirty, whatever. And it didn't feel unnatural to send that pic, right? With the conversation we were having at that time. We've been texting a lot. That's pretty good. There's some girls that will, like, Jose talks to girls. Literally same day, I was like, seriously, what do you think of this? Yeah, look at my fake boobs. I'm cool. And I will say, Jen, I'd say if you felt comfortable with yourself and him, then there's nothing wrong with it. Yeah, except that he didn't respond. Like, that was the. So you sent him that picture, and that's the last thing he's ever said to you? Like, he didn't? Yeah. And I gave it lots of time, and, like, you know, when you do something like that, you're kind of in a light state of panic because, you know, you don't know what the response is gonna be, and, oh, yeah. Response. And there's no response. I, like, I was so embarrassed, and so I apologized. I was like, I'm sorry. I just thought that, you know, it's one of those situations where you're looking at your phone, you're like, maybe something screwed up. I'm gonna text one of my friends, see if they text me back. Nope. Damn it. It's working. Where is he? Have you tried calling him at all? I've tried a couple of times, but, um, there's No answer. And it's just one of those generic voicemails. Okay, so my mind is going a million miles a minute trying to figure out, like, is it a picture of me? Is it? So I. I would rather just know what it was. 100% focusing on the one thing and feel crappy about that one thing. Then right now, I feel crappy about every single impossible thing to do with myself. So I'm dying. I want to call into a rock and die. And you're sure the conversation was leading to that point? Like, it wasn't like, hey, you want to meet up for dinner sometime? Sure. What do you think of this? It was dessert. No, it was, um. It was leading to that point, and I didn't initiate the flirtation in that direction. That heavy? Heated. All right, well, we're gonna play a song, come back, call him, and get your second date update. Okay? Okay. Alright, hold on. Moving. 92.5 Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Second date update. I'm gonna call this second date update the curious case of the poorly timed sext message. No, I'm so glad I didn't read that. Nancy Drew when I was younger. That's a good one. You should check it out. Jen is on the phone. She emailed us about a guy she met named Mike. Mike stopped responding to her after she sent him a dirty picture. Oh, and now she's wondering why. That's. That's a tough one. You know, because maybe he didn't like the way you looked. Or it could be cause he's just really modest. I, I'm not gonna even bother. Yeah, because. No, I'm not gonna. Yeah. Apparently you've tried calling a cell a bunch of times with no answer. Even today. Producer Boyd told me that you've, you actually tried to call him this morning because you weren't sure about doing the second date update. Right. So you have another number that you want us to try to call? I do now. I was told this is his landline. How'd you get this number? One of my girlfriends hit it off with one of his friends. They've actually done really well dating or been out a couple of times since, so she ended up getting this number. Okay. Okay. Are we gonna like, ambush the guy at work or something? I was told it's a landline, not a work line. Okay. Okay. We're gonna call this number, see if we get them on the phone and get your second date update. You ready to go? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Hello? Hi, can I speak to Mike, please? Speaking. Hey, Mike, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning on Move 92.5. How you doing? Uh, I'm okay. How'd you get my number? Uh, just, uh, from some friends. Okay. Specifically one friend. You know what? This is not really a great time for me to talk right now, okay? No, you don't. You. Can I just steal a minute of your time? I don't have a lot of it. I mean, what's this about? We do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. What that is, is where if somebody goes out on a date with one of our listeners and then they get blown off, they email us.

Her name is Mia. And recently, Mia's husband told her, after 27 years of marriage, that he was leaving her for his new mistress. Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what that feels like. 27 years of marriage. God! He also informed her that he would be kicking her out of their house, which they had purchased together as newlyweds, and the mistress would be moving in. Out with the old, in with the new. Mia, do not lay down and take that. So Mia was obviously devastated, especially because she had raised kids in that house and made a lot of memories there. Yeah, and it's her home. That's her home, man. Not anymore. New lady's home. Mistress is home. Gross. But her husband made her a financial offer that she couldn't refuse. So she accepted the money deal and agreed to move out so that he could have the house with his mistress. Alright. And on her last night in the home, Mia decided to celebrate with a huge bottle of champagne and a giant platter of shrimp, caviar and oysters. Ooh, way to go, Mia! Might as well go out with the party, you know? Hello. Yeah. The next day, Mia's husband and his young mistress moved in. And things were going perfectly for about a week. Uh huh. And then something changed. Uh oh. That's when they started noticing an awful smell. Oh, No. Throughout the entire house. Oh, what you do. It was pungent, rotten, and ammonia scented, they say. Oh, like chemical. It was in every single room of the house, too. What? And they couldn't figure out what was causing it. At first, they thought maybe an animal had gotten into the attic and died. Uh huh. So they brought in exterminators and found nothing. Then they thought maybe it was mold, so they brought in a mold specialist, and no mold was found. Okay, that's already a lot of money there. It. Yeah, right. Like, they're in debt big time at this point. They're spending a lot. They cleaned all the carpets, replaced the entire central air and heating system. Again, it's expensive. Wow, that is expensive. It replaced it all. I thought for sure it was like fish in the ventilation system, and that didn't even work. They even installed an expensive ozone generator for the air filter to try to get rid of the smell. But no matter what they did, nothing got rid of the stench. And soon the husband and his mistress were having fights because of it. Yeah, I mean, nobody. Can you imagine living with a set? I mean, they described it as a set of a dead animal in your house 24 7. And obviously for a while, if they got all that work done in the meantime. Right. The only thing that's changed is you moved in. It's gotta be you. I didn't know you smelled like rotting animal. Uh, they were frustrated and disgusted, obviously, because they couldn't figure out where the smell was coming from or why it smelled so bad. So they decided to put the house on the market and just move on. Oh, my god. And, well. And how do you sell a house that stinks? That's extreme. That's exactly everyone that comes in. I mean, you're not gonna be able to sell it for any money. It's exactly what the real estate agent told them. The horrible stench, it's gonna be a major problem for perspective buyers. Yeah, and would drive the price down considerably. But they didn't care. They just wanted to get out. There's a sign outside. Must have no sense of smell. Right? Right. Hazmat suit available. Here's your gas mask to tour the home. Finally, they got an offer on the house. It was extremely low, but they needed the funds to move out and had no other offers, obviously because the place smelled so bad. So they took that extremely low ball offer. Oh, my god. And it turns out that offer was from Mia, the ex wife. Shut up. Who wound up purchasing her house back at a huge discount. Oh, my god. And also remember, he made her a financial offer. So the money she's using to buy the house was the money he gave her to leave her house so the mistress could move in. He bought Her, the house, and this is pretty much all legal. And Mia. You're so smart. I love her. The day Mia moved back in, she also

We're in the break room together the other day, and if you remember that, um, we were just kind of, uh, you know, you're pouring some coffee, and I was just wondering, you know, maybe. Maybe you would, uh. You would wanna do something if I wanna do something? Like in the break room at. No, no, not in the break room. I mean, like, we could do what we do. I mean, we could get coffee. Like, that's something that we could do if you like coffee, cause you, you always drink coffee, right? Uh, like to get coffee to talk about work stuff. No, no, no work. Let's forget about work. Let's, you know, I mean, let's not forget, like, we work, but like. No, let's. I'm, I'm asking if you wanna get, like, not related to Work? Like, we can talk about, uh, things that you like. I don't know, I'm not sure what you like, but we can figure out what you like. You know, we could talk about it, you know, like, the way people do. Hold, hold on. What is going on? I mean, this is kind of weird. I, you know, just wanted to give you the opportunity for us to hang out, you know, just one on one, you know, kind of like. Did Ryan, like, kind of like. Like. Is this. Is this some kind of joke? No, this isn't a joke. I just thought. Well, okay. I mean, okay, I'll be honest with you. Um, so last week, I heard what you said. I don't know if you know that. Um. What do you mean, what I said? Well, you know, I mean, last Wednesday, I think you went out. You know, there's a lot of the conversation you had is like, a lot of hip hop music playing. Wait, what are you talking about? What conversation? We never spoke. No, yeah, we. We didn't speak, but I. I accidentally heard you speak. Um, it was a 1 am. You called me, but you weren't talking to me. Uh, wait, I didn't call you last week. You. You did. Um, you might have butt dialed me, which would explain why you weren't talking to me, but, uh, I inadvertently accidentally heard the conversation that you had, and, um. Wait, I heard some. I butt dialed you, and you continued to listen to my conversation. Like, why didn't you just hang up? Well, I was going to, but then I heard my name, and then I kind of was curious what you're saying about me and my arms. You know what you're saying about me and my arms? I, I, I never spoke about you on Wednesday. Like, you didn't come up in the conversation that I was having that night. Well, you definitely did. I heard my name, like, several times. You kept saying, Max has, you know, strong arms. Max has good Cologne. You said that if we were together alone, that you would want to, you know, make a move. So I'm asking you out. Oh. Oh, my god, Max!

Why do you have to be such a. I'm. How are we already starting like this? Alicia? I'm not Alicia. Hold on. I just. I need to refresh everybody's memory with what happened. Okay, you first came on the show because an ex boyfriend came back into your life and asked you out to dinner, and you weren't sure if you should tell your husband or not that you agreed to go out with him. He wanted to take you to. No, I wasn't gonna tell my husband. It wasn't a big deal, okay? Until you guys made it a big deal. Right. So you came on the show, ask us for our advice, and then your husband heard that on the show and then emailed us so that he could call you. In an awkward Tuesday phone call, he got you on the phone, and then this happened. I never should have called you guys in the first place. You know what, Alicia? You're actually right. Well, you never should have lied to your husband in the first place. Yeah, and then none of these phone calls. I don't lie to my husband, Ben. Well. Oh, my god. So, Alicia, after being on the show yelling at us twice, saying that we were horrible people, and then hanging up on us both times. Yeah. Why are you back on the show today? Because after all the bullshit you guys put on the radio, and. I don't know, How you did all this editing to make me sound like a jerk. My friends and family are like, you're kind of a bad person. And I'm not a bad person. I'm calling to freaking set the record straight, Alicia. You remember that you actually went out with your ex boyfriend, lied to your husband, told him that you were going to see your girlfriends, and then. I didn't lie, I just didn't tell him cause I didn't want him to get upset. How many times do I have to tell you that? So you're. So you're just. You're angry with us and you want to come back on the show and just yell at us some more? Is that what's going on? Well, I just. No, I want set the record straight. I want you to call this guy that I went out with, Brad. What? And because now my husband thinks something else happened because all of the crap that you put on the radio and you made me come off bad in your editing. Now my husband is questioning whether or not I fucked up with this guy, which I absolutely did not. Alicia. Okay, Alicia, we didn't edit those like crazy to make you sound, yeah, you know, bad. Whatever. I don't know. Look, I just know what reality TV does to people, and I'm pretty certain you do the same thing. Right? So you wanna do. So you wanna do a second date update with The guy that you went out with? No, see, this is why you're a. No, I'm not doing a second date update. It wasn't a date. Okay, but the segment that we're doing right now is called A second date update. This is. Then I want to be on a different segment. No. Well, this is where we could fit you on. Do you want to clear the air or not? I want to clear the air, but it wasn't a freaking date. Okay, yeah, but remember, Alicia, you told us that. That your ex actually hit on you at the restaurant? Yeah, maybe it was a date to him, but it wasn't a date to me. Okay, so then we'll do it in a second date update that you get your point out no matter what. This is just. Whatever. Alicia. Alicia, you'll get your point out no matter what. All right, so what do you wanna do then? You wanna call this guy? And what are you hoping to get out of it? I'm not the bad person here, okay? He's the one that was suggestive. He's the one that contacted me to begin with, and I'm the one that left when he started getting weirdly flirty. I need that to come out so everybody knows that I didn't freaking sleep with him. Okay, so you wanna just prove that you didn't do anything wrong while you're out with this guy? And you want everybody to hear it? Everybody who's already judged you from hearing you on the air, your family, your husband, all that, right? I'm innocent. This time is to blame. But do you think I am an innocent party? Do you think that people are judging you because they think that. That you hooked up with your ex? Or do you think that they're judging you because you weren't honest in your relationship and if. And refused to take. You guys made it seem like I wasn't honest. You guys made it seem like I was a liar. Okay? Like, what I said was taken out of context, and I don't know how you edited it to make me sound like an ass, but I'm not an ass. Okay, but didn't you, like, to your husband's face, tell him that you were not going out with your ex, that you were going out with girlfriends? Wasn't that actually the case? I didn't lie. I just didn't tell him. Okay, that's completely different. So a second. We're gonna play a song and then come back and call this dude that you went out with. We're gonna call him. I wanna talk to him a little bit and hear it from him that he hit on you and your side of the story is true, and then you can talk to him. Okay? I don't need to talk to him. I need you to prove that I'm a good person. Okay, I'll. I'll help prove that you're A good person and clear the air with everybody involved. Everybody that you wanna clear the air with. Okay. It's about time you did something right. Thank you. Can you just not. Can you just not call me an ass for a second? You really make it hard. She does have a point, alright? I mean, that was the one thing I'll back her on. Okay, I'm gonna play a song, we'll come back and then we'll call. Brad is his name right? I fucking said his name 57 times. Have you listened to the word I said? Like, I'm sorry. I realized that you're angry with the show because you feel like we made you look bad. No, I don't feel like that. I know you made me look bad. Alright, well, we made you look bad. So we'll play a song, come back and then we'll get your second date update. Okay? It's not a second date. I, I realized that, okay? But the segments called that, so I have to say that. Just do it. Okay? We'll do it next.

Hi, can I speak to Ray, please? Yeah, this is Ray. Hey, Ray, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Okay. How's it going? Fine. Any idea why I'm calling you? Uh, no. We recently got an email about you from one of our listeners. Okay. Her name is Maggie, and you recently went out on a date with Maggie. Okay. Okay. Do you remember that happening? Yeah. Okay, well, Maggie emailed us because she's wondering why you haven't given her a call back, especially at the end of the date when you were, like, talking about maybe meeting up for dinner or something. She hasn't heard from you, so she asked if maybe we could get you on the phone to find out why. Oh. Is there a reason you're not calling Maggie back? Uh, I mean, it's just. It's probably not gonna work out. Oh, Man. Ray, why is that? Uh, I don't know. I just. I don't think we're. I don't think we're a good match. Is there a specific reason why you think that? Um. Ray, you're a hard guy to read. I agree. You do? So what if. What? Why don't you. Why don't you think you guys would be a good match? I don't know. I mean, Maggie, she's a really nice girl. Probably one of the nicest girls I've met in a little While here. But she just. She likes to do a lot of stuff. What do you mean by that? Like drugs? She. She didn't. Yeah. What do you mean by she likes to do a lot of stuff? Well, she just, like. I don't know. We're. We were talking about stuff, and she was saying all the things she likes to do. She likes to take cooking classes, and she, like, rides a bike, and she. I don't know, he's. Goes out with her friends. And she sounds like a fun, interesting person. By the things that you just said, you sound like normal interests to me. You're right. She's totally interesting. Normal person. I'm the one. I'm not very normal. Like when she asked me what I like to do, I don't really like to do very much, and I don't hold up against her. So you don't have any hobbies or interests? I mean, I like watching TV, you know, hanging around the house. And maybe she. Maybe that's one of the things that she likes to do, too. Did you talk to her about that? Well, I think probably she does, but I don't know if I could keep up with all that other stuff. You don't have to go biking with her or hiking or whatever she likes to do. Go hang out with friends. Yeah, I don't know. I could just tell. I think. I think she deserves someone really amazing. Do you just have Like, I don't know if I'm really up to snuff. You just sound like you just have really bad self esteem, buddy. No, I mean, I'm. It's not my fault that I'm like this. It's just. I was probably the way I was raised, but I don't have a problem with it. I just don't think it maybe matches up with her lifestyle. Okay, but don't you think that's a decision she should make, not you, for her. Cause you don't know how she feels. Well, she might even be okay with it now. But I know that in a little bit she's gonna see like what I see now, which is that. I mean, she's not gonna like it. I mean, for instance, I don't wanna be expected to do things. Hey, look, I am 100% with you on that, Ray. Whenever I'm in a relationship, it's the worst when you're expected to do things, like, but you don't know if she's gonna ask you to go bike. You can, you know, both have your own separate lives. We're just two totally different people. I mean, she's fun, she likes to do things, and I'm not. I'm just boring. Well, maybe. Have you thought about this? Maybe if you date her, you could learn to do some activities that you like. Hmm. See, that sounds like a lot of pressure right there. All right, well, Ray, if that's. If that's not enough pressure for you, here's some more pressure. Ray, she's actually on the other line listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you.

It's, it's baffling. I don't know what's going on. And how long have you guys been together? We've been together two years. And it's been great the whole time, pretty much, you know. Wow, two years? Yeah. And when I saw your email and you said that she stopped talking to me, I figured it was like an early relationship. Two years is a long time to just stop talking to somebody and not know why. Yeah, right. How long has she not been talking to you? A week. Whoa. Yeah. A week of nothing. Literally nothing. That's a dog house. Has this ever happened before? No, never. Okay. Cause I had a girlfriend that used to stop talking to me all the time, for days on end, and I would never know why. And then after a certain point I was like, eh, alright, she's doing it again, I'll just go play golf. She was like, what? That's actually kind of nice. Yeah, if it's like, how can I make that happen more often? If it's not a common thing, you know, you did something really wrong then. Yeah, or something. I'm wondering at this point, like, did she meet somebody? I, I don't. I don't even know. And so what's your guys's situation? Are you living together, you're living apart? No, we don't live together, but we hang out a lot. Like, she's over my house all the time, I'm over at her house. I mean, we spend probably, like, three, four nights a week with each other, so we. We see each other a lot. Uh huh. So let's see if we can piece it together, then. What happened leading up to the point where she stopped talking to you? I think really, like, she was over at my house, and, you know, I. I didn't notice anything was. Was wrong. Like, it wasn't like I said something or did something or she found my giant stash of porn or anything where she would, you know. And, like, literally the next day, I text her just in the morning, like, hey, what's going on? And she text me back, and she said, I can't even talk to you right now. So I tried to call her, she didn't answer, and that's the last I've heard from her. Wait, so there, when she was at your house, there was no fight? There was no argument? No, there was nothing. Wow, so you don't even know if you have a girlfriend anymore? Right now, yeah. I'm like, wow, maybe she met some guy, like, swept her off her feet. I don't know. I tried to talk to her friends to be like, hey, you know, what's going on? Or whatever. Her friends won't even talk to me. Like, whoa, they're not even responding. Whoa. And what did you do? You did something? What did you do? I've been, like, racking my brain, like, trying to Figure out the. Literally the only thing that I can think of. And this isn't even that big of a deal. We were talking about one of her friends, right? It's like her best friend and she's single. And I was like, why is she single? She's really cute, blah, blah, blah, you know? And it wasn't even like a big thing. Like, I'm not trying to pick her up or anything, I was just asking like, why is she single? She's cute, you know? Like, your friend Brittany's single. What's up with that? Cause I'll tell you what, if we weren't together, I'd be all over that. Like white on rice or me on Brittany. Yeah, I didn't even say it. I didn't even say it like that. It was like completely harmless. That's the only thing I can think of. Is she. Is she a person with jealousy issues? She hasn't been. Okay, she's been hiding it really well. If she is for two whole years, I can't imagine that being it. Weird, I. Yeah. I don't know. Did she get a new haircut and you didn't notice? Not that I noticed. That'd be pretty extreme to stop talking to you for a week when she's never done it before. Yeah, and like, my only thought is maybe that you guys can get her on the phone and I can try to talk to her and see what's going on, cause I have no idea. Okay. Pre text, What was the last thing she said to you? Oh, my god, I don't remember. I mean, good night. I don't know. I don't have a good, like, a great memory with that sort of thing, but, like, it wasn't anything. Like, I would have known if something was off. Yeah. Have you thought about just sending her texts, apologizing for different things, saying if eventually you hit the right one? Well, I. I even went over to her house. Her car was in the driveway. Knocked on the door, and she wouldn't even answer the door. What? Oh, wow. Yeah, like that. And you swear she's normally a rational person? She's super rational. Which is why it makes this all the more weird, and I'm starting to, like, freak out because this has never happened before, and this is, like, so out of character for her. And you haven't, like, slept with her mom or something, right? That. Should I not have done that? Yeah, that'd be a. That'd be a bad thing to do in a relationship. I'm a. I'm a good guy. I haven't cheated or anything. Like, I'm a. I'm a. I'm a nice guy. Okay, well, we'll play a song, come back, and then you can make your awkward Tuesday phone call. Okay? Okay. Thank you.

Oh my gosh! Thomas actually had a pact with his friend when they were younger. They said by the time we get to 30, if we're not married, we'll marry each other. Today is her 30th birthday and he wants to ask for her hand. Hey, and maybe since it's her birthday, she'll be drunk enough that she'll actually say yes to you. Well, I hope it's not a drunk yes, but a real yes. I just think this is so crazy. Like, I had this packed with one of my friends. We made it when we were 18, cause like we thought we could actually marry each other. And then when we became adults, we realized that would be a horrible idea for us. Well, I guess my love story is just a little better than yours. Hahaha. Yeah. Yeah. If it works out, I. I will be shocked and congratulate you till the end of the day. Alright, you ready? Let's go.

I can't believe you would even remember that. Of course I remember your 30th birthday. Yeah. I mean, thanks. How have you been? I'm good. Uh, single. You know, my marriage from earlier did not really work out, but I'm happy right now. Um. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's. It's old stuff. I don't even remember her name, to be honest, but, uh. Wow. Yeah. Um, what about. What about you, though? Like, how. How are you doing, Nikki? I'm good. I'm single. Also doing the whole dating scene. Yeah. Kind of putting the 20s behind you maybe, right? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's crazy, right? We haven't talked in so long and. Remember the old days, though? Remember high school? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you know, I. I still remember it like it was yesterday, you know? I mean, you remember. Remember the graduation party? Bobby's house? Remember that? Oh, my god. Vaguely. I mean, like, a lot has happened since, you know? I mean, I. Yeah, it was such a good night. And, um. Remember. Remember the, uh. The conversation we had in the car? Um, not really. Are you talking about something specific, or. Yeah, I mean, remember we were just, like, talking, and then we got really, you know, emotional about your school ending, and we made. We made a pact. Oh, my god. Remember it? Are you serious? You know, you are 30, and, you know our Pack. Did. Did agree. You know, 30 would be, you know, for both single. No way. I, like, totally forgot about that until just now. Well, I actually didn't forget about it. You know, like, so much emotion. Stop it. Are you calling me to propose? I mean.

Oh. Um, which was like. Yeah, which was like about a month ago. And so now I keep getting the feeling something happened between them. Okay, so Ryan is the fiance, you said you ran into his ex? Yeah, it in Nashville. Okay, there was different bachelor party. I'm going. I'm going later there this summer for my birthday. The difference is, if I ran into one of my exes, they would probably stay. So what is the ex's name? It's Kimber. Ugh, Kimber. I already hate her. Yeah, alright, so what makes you think something happened between them? Yeah, well, so first of all, he never told me he ran into her while he was there. I found out because one of his friends posted a picture of them together doing shots, and then he took down the post like 10 minutes later. Yeah, okay, see, that's not good. No. Second thing is, um, I asked him about it, and first he lied and said she wasn't there. Then when I told him I saw the picture, he was like, oh, yeah, she works at one of the bars we ended up at. She bought me a shot to congratulate me. Yeah, I'm sure she did. Right. And. And then the third. The third thing, and this is the one that bothers me the most, is she put something on Instagram the night they supposedly ran into Her. And it said, quote, had to remind him that he still has options. Dot, dot, dot. Oh, wow. That's conceited. Wait, so was this written under a picture of the two of them? No, it was just the words. It was like a meme, but with no picture. Huh. I see. So it. It could have been innocent. Or maybe not. I doubt it was innocent. Okay, so our job is to find out if something happened between him and the ex. Yeah, well, did you ask him about the post that the ex left? I showed him, and he got all defensive and was like, I have no idea what that's about. Yeah, I'm sure he doesn't. Okay. Right. So did you want us to call Ryan and try to find out the truth? Well, I did some digging, and I got Kimber's phone number, actually. Okay, so you want us to call her? Wait, isn't she in. Is she in Nashville, though, you said? Yeah. Okay. And she works at a bar. I guess so. Okay, yeah, so they're an hour behind us. If she worked last night at a bar, she probably is not waking up for us. She probably won't recognize the phone number and will probably put us to voicemail. I mean, I don't. I don't care who you guys call, I. I just want to know the truth. Okay, and you don't think you're gonna get it from your fiance, who is supposed To be marrying you in a few months. It sounds bad when you say it like that, but no. Okay, I'll tell you what. Why don't we try. Let's. Look, let's try calling her first. If she answers, I have a plan. If she doesn't answer, we move on to Plan B. Which is? To call Ryan. Okay? Yeah, sounds good. Okay. Hello? Good morning. Can I speak to Kimber? Actually, is it Kimber or Kimberly? It's Kimber. Hey, Kimber, this is James Hetfield from Nashville Night's Magazine. Um, we're publishing an issue in August about Music City's hottest bartenders, and your boss actually recommended you as one of our featured interviews. I know you're probably busy right now, but would you be okay with a quick interview piece? Sure, go ahead. Okay, great. So how long have you been bartending in Nashville? Has it been one month, two months? Longer? No, it's been longer than that. I moved here last year. Okay, gotcha. And do you like living here? Yeah, of course. Great. Okay, here's a fun question about you personally. Um, which phrase are you more likely to say? Um, sorry I'm so early, or sorry, I'm late? Sorry I'm late. Okay. Yeah, that's goes for me, too. Um, okay, so somebody's gonna be calling you soon, so we can come down to your bar and do a couple of photos with you on the job, if that's okay. We gotta clear it with your boss and stuff. Do you mind taking a couple of action shots for the magazine? No, that's cool. Okay, great. Well, have a nice day. We'll talk to you soon, okay? Okay, we're gonna call Ryan now. What are you gonna do? We're gonna use her audio to make it sound like, um. Well, here. Let's call Ryan.

So in a second, we're gonna call him and pretend to be from a pickleball resort. Which does exist. It does, because he's gotten really into pickleball, and he just joined a pickleball club. And we'll say that because he's a new member, he won a prize. Go to an all inclusive pickleball resort in Miami, and you can take a guess with him, and we'll see if he chooses Bella or somebody else. But before we do that, Bella, why don't you refresh our memory on why you think Greg might be cheating? Oh, he has never been active. Like, not an active dude. And all of a sudden he's obsessed with pickleball. He's. He's now going multiple times a week. And he got a text from some chick named Jenna, who apparently works at the club, and it just seems pretty sketchy. Like, all of a sudden, not only is he into pickleball, but now he's, like, getting random text that he doesn't want to talk about. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that's the weird part. All right, well, are you ready for us to call him? Yeah. Yes. I'm just scared, but yes, I am. I know I am. No, I. I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, here we go. Hello? Hi, this is Gordon calling from. I was looking for our new member, Greg. Uh, yes, this is him. Hey, Greg. How you doing today? I'm, I'm good. How are you? Good. So that you just signed up and hope you're loving it. Uh, yeah, it's been pretty cool so far. I really enjoy the course. Uh, I feel like that my game's gotten a lot better just being a member of the club. So. Great. Yeah, I'm pretty excited. Guess what? It's about to get a lot better because congratulations, Greg. I'm actually calling to tell you that you're the big winner. What? What am I winning? We are doing a contest where one of our lucky new members is going to win an all inclusive trip to Miami at a pickleball resort. It's an Oceanside pickleball resort. It's really a cool experience. You get training, you get. It's four days, you get all kinds of training and coaching and things like that. And it's nothing but pickleball for four days by the beach in Miami. And I won! Yes, you did. Congratulations. Oh snap! Like. Like, for real? Yes, for real. Congratulations. Yeah, it's just our way of saying, you know, thank you for. Thank you for joining and thank you for being a member. And thank you for using all of our services that we offer. Cause I know you've been doing lessons and stuff too. Yes. This is so cool. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. And it is a plus one. So you get to take somebody with you. And we'd like to extend the offer of Inviting that person by sending them some flowers and a. And a card. Invite them. Oh, okay. Okay. Uh. Um, I've been talking to this chick, Jenna. Um, and so I actually met her at the club. Oh. And I. Wait, yeah, yeah. Our Jenna? Yes, yes, yes, yes. You've been training me. Oh, okay. Yeah. If I want to thank her. Like, you know, we've been only kind of seeing each other for a short time, and I haven't really had a chance. I see Jenna every day, and I haven't heard that, so that's exciting news. I was. So if that's possible, I would love to take her. Yeah. Um, that is not possible at all, actually, because this is actually the Jubal Show. It's a radio show, and your girlfriend Bella is actually on the phone. What?

It's been six months and I mean, he left minutes before you guys were supposed to get married. So I'm guessing in your head you've gone over exactly what you wanna say. You know I have, but I think it's all gonna go out the window once I hate that I get him on the phone. As soon as you hear his voice, you're just gonna start screaming. I know it. Yeah, or crying. I mean, how heartbreaking. Yeah, it's either scream or cry. So we'll see what happens. Combine the two. Alright, well, I'm gonna dial his phone number right now and hopefully he answers and you can make your awkward Tuesday phone call. You ready? Okay. Hello? Hi. Hi. Do you know who this is? Oh my god, Claire. How did you get this number? Well, I, um. I hired a private detective to find you and track you down. Well. Well, you found me. I guess that's it. That's all you're gonna say, huh? Uh, after all this time, I call you and you have nothing? Yeah. This is weird. Like, I don't really know what you want from me. Well, I would like some answers to start. What happened? Why did you leave me the way that you did on our wedding day? Um, I guess it's a little complicated. I can't really talk about it. Justin, what you did to me and all my friends and And our families, I mean, was awful. You owe me some kind of explanation. Look, I'm, I'm sorry, okay? I feel, I feel bad, but I, I just, I, I don't want your sorry, your apologies. I honestly just want answers. I mean, is there another woman? No, no, it's not like that. Okay, so was it a man? I mean, did you leave me for a guy? Just tell me. No, no, it's nothing like that. I promised I wouldn't talk about it. What do you mean you promised? Who did you make a promise to? I can't talk about it. I can't tell you what happened. All I can say is I feel terrible, I really do. But I can't, I can't, I can't tell you. Justin, that's bullshit, okay? You're a liar. And I don't understand why you would go through all of that trouble to get engaged and, and plan a wedding with me. I mean, you have to admit that you leading was not just cold feet. It was a lot more than that. So I deserve to know what the promise is. Who the hell you promise what? Because you not get on an altar and promise me anything. So you better give me some answers, alright? But you can't, you can't tell him I, I said anything, okay? Who do you, who are you talking about? Who can I tell? I, I don't know what you're talking about. Who is he? Your dad? What? Your dad made me, uh, promise not to, uh, go through with the wedding. Please tell me you're lying. Yeah. No, Justin, that's the most bullshit excuse I've ever heard. What really happened? He. He met me the day of the wedding, and he said that if I didn't go through with marrying you, then he would give me $80,000. And he wrote me a check. Awkward. Oh, my god. What? What? Shut up.

Yeah, she. Well, she told us at the end of the date how you said something like, I always enjoy meeting new friends, and then you took off. And she also said, when you text her, you call her bud.

I mean, the thing is, Michael, nobody's on dating apps to be friends. Like, they're looking for dates. I guess that's true, but, like, you know, sometimes you meet someone who you. Who you click with on more of a friend level, and, you know, you. You don't necessarily want to date them, but you want to continue being friends. Like, I think men and women can be friends, so, you know. Well, I don't. I don't think there's any possibility of men and women ever being friends. Ever. You do not believe that. The bottom line, you just feel like you guys are better off being friends, and that's it. Yeah. She's very cute, you know, she's just not quite my type, I would say. Okay, so what's your type? Uh, I mean, my friends always make fun of me for it, so, um. Yeah. Make fun of you for it? Yeah. Why? They make fun of your type of person you like to date? You know, everybody has their type, and I just have A different type than a lot of people. I'm dying to know. Is it an eye patch thing? Oh, god, I love people with eye patches. It's always been my thing. Tell me it's eye patches. Uh, no, not quite. I don't have a thing for pirates. I promise you, we won't make fun of you if you tell us what your type is. I can trust you? No, of course you can't. But you should tell us anyway. Yeah. Is it, like, a physical thing or a personality thing? No, it's. It's physical. Okay, so what is it?

I was 12 when Brian joined my class. He was tall, played sports. He should have been liked and popular, but instead, the whole class went ghost white as soon as he walked in. The teacher even went pale. I was clearly the only one who was out of the loop. I sat down next to him during lunch either way, and everyone, including Brian himself, gave me a weird look. You actually wanna be my friend? He asked, all surprised. We spent our whole day having a blast. I didn't have any friends at the time, so I went home excited to tell my mom about the new one I had made. But when I told her his name, her face went white. Stay away from that kid. Him and his dad are monsters. They beat and hospitalized their mom. I was shocked. The next morning, mom drove me to school instead of letting me walk. He marched right up to my teacher and whispered something that made missus squelch nod grimly. When I tried to sit near Brian in class, missus squelch moved my seat. I took one look at Brian from across the classroom, and I saw him nearly tearing up. During recess, he stood alone by the fence while everyone else played. And after school, I saw why. Brian's dad pulled up, and the entire pickup area cleared out. Parents grabbed their Kids and speed walked to their cars. One mom actually said, don't look at him, sweetie, to her daughter. Brian's dad just sat there with his head down while Brian climbed in. Everyone treated him like they were awful, but it didn't add up. Brian's dad would pack Brian extra granola bars for kids who forgot lunch money. And Brian voluntarily stayed after school to help with tutoring special needs kids. It was just. No way this was the family who beat their own mother. Then came the day I realized who Brian and his father really were. I was walking home, counting the $50 my grandma I gave me for my birthday when three eighth graders surrounded me. Look at the rich boy, the biggest one said, and shoved me to the ground. They grabbed my money, and one of them kicked me in the ribs. I curled up, waiting for more, when suddenly they all scrambled away. Brian's dad stood there, not touching anyone, just standing. You okay, kid? He asked before helping me up. He walked me home without saying much else. When I told mom what happened, she completely lost it. He approached you? What if he'd taken you somewhere? She called the school immediately. A known abuser confronted my son, she kept saying. By the next day, the whole school knew. The principal sent out an email banning Brian's dad from school property. Parents shared it on Facebook, calling him a predator who lurked around Children at school. Brian looked destroyed. He sat with his head on his desk most of the day. When I tried to slip him a note saying thanks for his dad helping me, he pushed it back. Please don't, he whispered. You're making things worse for him. Two weeks later, I saw Brian crying in the library. He was trying to hide it, but his shoulders were shaking. I sat down anyway. A spray painted predator on his car. Brian said he lost his job because of it. We might lose our apartment. He wiped his eyes hard. Everyone hates him, but they don't know anything. What do you mean? I asked. Brian looked around to make sure we were alone. He then

For context, I graduated high school four years ago, and back then Eric was the class clown. Like, not just someone who made a few jokes, but the guy who would do anything for a laugh. He once filled the principal's office with ping pong balls that poured out when she opened the door, convinced the lunch staff he was allergic to the color green, and even streaked across the football field during a rival game with Go Tigers painted on his back. Everyone thought he was hilarious, even the teachers secretly. Except Miss Harrison, who hated him with a burning passion. Anyway, I hadn't seen or heard from Eric since graduation. We weren't close friends or anything, just classmates who occasionally talked. I honestly kind of forgot about him until yesterday when I went to my cousin Britney's wedding. The ceremony was beautiful, but during the reception I noticed this super quiet guy sitting alone at one of the tables, barely touching his food and not talking to anyone. Something about him seemed familiar, but I couldn't place it. Britney came over and was like have you talked to Eric yet? And I was genuinely confused because the only Eric I knew was class clown Eric. And this serious, withdrawn guy looked nothing like the wild person I remembered, but OMG it was him! Same person, completely different vibe. I went over to say hi thinking maybe he just didn't recognize Me! He mumbled a hello and I sat down trying to make conversation. The whole time he kept glancing around the room like he was checking for exits or something. His hands were shaking slightly when he picked up his water glass, and I noticed a small scar across his knuckles that definitely wasn't there in high school. I asked how he knew Britney. Turns out his mom and her mom are friends and tried to bring up some of the funny stuff from high school. Like remember when you put all those rubber ducks in the swimming pool during finals thinking it might make him smile? His reaction was so weird. He didn't laugh or even smile. He just stared at me with this empty look and said that was a different person in this flat voice. The conversation was super awkward after that. I asked what he'd been up to since graduation and he just shrugged and said not much. When I pressed a little, he mentioned he'd been away for a while but didn't elaborate. I asked if he was in college or working and he just said neither right now and changed the subject to ask about me. Then Randy, another old classmate, spotted us and came over all excited. Holy shit! It's the Eric! He practically shouted, slapping Eric on the back. Eric flinched so hard at the contact that he knocked over his water glass. Randy didn't notice and kept going on about the Good old days. And asked Eric to tell the story about the time he stole the mascot costume before the championship game. Eric just stood up without saying anything and walked outside. Randy looked at me like WTF? And I just shrugged because I was equally confused. I found Eric about 20 minutes later, sitting alone on a bench in the garden area. I sat down and asked if he was okay, and he didn't answer for a long time. Then, without looking at me, he asked if I ever thought about Lisa. Lisa was in our class. She was quiet, kind of a loner, but super smart. I hadn't thought about her in years tbh. And I told him that. His jaw tightened and he just nodded like I'd confirmed something for him. She was the only one who ever called me out, he said. Everyone else just laughed or looked the other way. I had no idea what he was talking about. Called him out for what? His pranks? They were harmless. Everyone thought they were funny. When I said this, he finally turned to look at me and his eyes were intense, like he was seeing right through me. You really don't get it, do you? He said. None of you ever did. I asked what he meant, and he just shook his head and stood up to leave. But then he paused and said something that has been echoing in my head ever since. You know, What happened after graduation? Life happened. Reality happened, consequences happened. Then he walked away. I was completely confused and kind of freaked out. So I went to find Brittany to ask what was up with Eric. She pulled me into an empty hallway and lowered her voice to tell me the story. Apparently, two months

I quit working at McDonald's about a week ago and I still have my work uniform. I was wondering what would happen if I walked into a different McDonald's than the one I worked at and started working. Would I get into trouble with the law or would they just tell me to leave if they noticed? I don't want a job, I just want to do it as a prank. The McDonald's I worked at had a fingerprint system you used to clock in. I was just planning on walking in, pretending to clock in, wash my hands, put on some gloves, and then start working the grill. I don't want a job, I'm just doing it for shats and giggles. Update seven days later so I went to a McDonald's in a nearby town around 4:00 PM yesterday. I parked at a nearby store with a good view of the drive through. I waited until the drive through was very full to go to the McDonald's. Since they would be too busy to pay attention to me, I casually walked in and pretended to clock in. I washed my hands and put on my gloves. There were only three workers in the grill area. Two. Two of them were busy online and the other was frantically dropping 10 point ones. When they saw me, they told me to drop nuggets. I dropped nuggets, restocked the Little freezer by the fryer and continued working. One of them asked me if I was new. I just told him it was my third day and he didn't question it. After a while, once things calm down, one of the workers started teaching me how to do the line. I just pretended like I had no clue what I was doing. Even though I did. I occasionally made simple mistakes, like putting diced onions on Quarter Pounders. Things went downhill once the manager asked us what breaks we'd taken and which we hadn't. I stayed quiet, hoping he wouldn't ask me directly. The manager looked at me and said, and you? I told him I hadn't had any of my breaks. He asked if I was new. I said yeah and gave him a fake name. Bradley Johnson. He looked through his list and told me he couldn't find my name on the schedule. I said, huh, that's weird. I'm scheduled to work today from four PM to nine PM. He then left to check the system, so I continued working. Once he got back, he said, who are you? We don't have you in our system. I told him that there must be a mistake since I already had my orientation on Wednesday and I also worked on Thursday. He left to double check. Once he returned, he told me that I wasn't in the system or on the schedule. I told him I had no idea what Was going on, and that I was as confused as he was. He was already kind of pissed at this point, and he called the hiring manager, as you could already guess. He found out I wasn't an employee, and he told me to get the fog out, or he was going to call the police. I left, and the crew members were just talking with each other about what had just happened.

But then I handed her the video I'd taken 20 minutes earlier and watched her face as she realized everyone now knew the truth. My little sister was born two months prematurely, came out bluer than a Smurf, and spent the first three years of her life hooked up to tubes and machines. Naturally, my parents were super protective of her. They'd stay by her side, buy every toy she wanted, and demand I ditch hanging with friends to babysit her. At first, I thought this was right. She was my chronically ill baby sister. But then she got older, she got healthy. She no longer needed tubes or machines and could live normally. However, by this point, she had Learned that being sick got her whatever she wanted, whether that be materialistic things or just sympathy and attention. It started with her headaches mysteriously coming back whenever she was doing homework. My parents would take the homework away before replacing it with ice cream. And by the time Emma turned 11 and I was 16, she had perfected her act. And that really bothered me because her pain only struck during my moments. When I made varsity soccer, she developed mysterious stomach cramps that required my parents to leave my first game early. When I got accepted into college, she collapsed during my Celebration dinner, and we spent the night in the ER, where doctors found Nothing wrong. The worst part was how she'd smirk at me when our parents weren't looking. She even practiced her pain faces in the mirror. I tried showing my parents once, but Emma had already told them I was jealous of the attention she needed for her condition. My boyfriend, Jake lasted eight months before Emma got to him. She created fake screenshots of messages where I supposedly called her a faker and wished she would just die already. The breakup happened at a coffee shop. Jake slid his phone across the table, well showing me the evidence Emma had compiled. He said he couldn't be with someone who treated their sick sister so cruelly. Emma texted me a selfie wearing the hoodie Jake had given me. That was my breaking point. For five years, I had watched her steal everything. So I started watching her closely. Way more closely than anyone ever had. And I noticed a pattern. Every time she was in pain, she always grabbed her right side. Whether that's her head, her kidney. Always right side. She always called specifically for mom, always rated her pain between 8 and 10, and always recovered in exactly two to three hours, which was just long enough to ruin what I had planned. Once I knew this, I developed my plan. And last Sunday, it went down better than I ever could have hoped for. We were having our monthly family dinner with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins. Twenty minutes before dinner, I went up to the bathroom, where I recorded a video. I explained in the video that I was about to make a fake announcement about getting promoted at work. In this video, I predicted exactly how Emma would react. I said she would wait for the applause to die down, then grab her right side and whimper for mom. She would rate her pain as an 8, 9, or 10. She would need to lie down immediately, and she would ask mom to take her to the hospital if the pain doesn't get better within 20 minutes. At dinner, I stood up and clinked my glass. I got everyone's attention, then announced I had just been promoted with a huge raise.

I taught my daughter about being kind to everyone. I never thought it would save multiple lives. My 15 year old Emma came home last Tuesday acting weird. She kept checking her phone every few minutes and seemed nervous about something. When I asked what was wrong, she just said, nothing, mom, and went straight to her room. She barely touched her dinner that night, just pushed the spaghetti around her plate. The next morning, she hugged me extra long before school. She never does that anymore. She's usually rushing out the door complaining about being late for first period. I thought maybe she had a big test or presentation. Something felt off, but I couldn't put my finger on it. She even forgot her favorite water bottle on the counter. Around 10 a m. I got a call from the school. My heart stopped when I saw the number pop up on my phone. The principal's voice was shaky as she said there was an emergency and all parents needed to come to the school immediately. She wouldn't tell me what happened over the phone, which made my panic even worse. I raced to the school and saw police cars everywhere. Ambulances lined the street with their lights flashing. Parents were crying and hugging each other in the parking lot, some still in their pajamas from rushing over. My hands were shaking as I searched Frantically for Emma, I found her sitting with a police officer. They're in the main office. The officer asked me to sit down. I knew this couldn't be good news. For the past three weeks, Emma had been sitting with this quiet kid named Marcus at lunch. He always looked sad and

He wasn't ready for my brother's reply. I was 12 the first time my uncle made a comment about my body. It was during Thanksgiving, and he's made one every year since, always with a smirk, always just loud enough for the table to hear. This year, I reached for a second piece of bread, and he goes, better slow down there, kiddo. Boys don't marry girls with thunder thighs. Everyone at the table laughed except me and my little brother. I felt my face go red. My hand froze over the bread basket. I didn't even like bread that much, so I decided to skip dinner entirely, hoping it would keep him from making further comments. My mom looked down like she didn't hear it. She always looks down. She grew up with him, and I think part of her still believes what he says or fears him. My dad isn't in the picture, so it's just us and him. That's when my little brother, only 14 years old, put down his fork and said, Uncle Rick, haven't you been divorced three times? Maybe don't give out dating advice. Everyone went quiet. Someone's knife clinked on their plate, and Uncle Rick just stood up and walked out. Didn't even take his leftovers. My brother didn't gloat or smirk, just passed me the bread basket and said, eat whatever you want. You're perfect. I cried in the car later. Not because Of my uncle, he's always been awful. But because that was the first time someone stood up for me like that. He was 14 and I was 16. But that night, he felt like the big brother. And I haven't skipped the bread since.

There was this kid at my high school named Connor who thought he owned the place. His dad was some big shot lawyer and his mom ran the PTA, so he basically got away with everything. Connor was team captain, had perfect grades that his parents probably bought, and a group of friends who kissed his ass constantly. His favorite target was this old janitor everyone called Mr. Pete. The guy was probably in his 70s, moved real slow, and barely spoke any English. Connor would walk by and accidentally knock over trash cans, then watch Mister Pete slowly bend down to clean it up. He'd throw food on the floor during lunch and say stuff like, oops, looks like Pedro has more work to do. Even though the guy's name wasn't Pedro, the teachers saw it but never said anything. Connor's parents donated too much money to the school. Plus he was headed to some fancy college on a football scholarship, everyone just looked the other way when he was being a complete dick. On Monday, our principal announced we had a new student shadowing classes for the week. This guy walked in, and he was definitely not your typical high school kid. He looked maybe 19 or 20, kept to himself, and had this long sleeve shirt. Couldn't quite hide what looked like tattoo edges on his wrists. Nobody really talked to him. He just sat in the back of Classes, took notes, and minded his own business. During lunch, he'd eat alone while watching everything going on around him. That Wednesday, Connor was having one of his usual fun sessions with Mister Pete. The old man was mopping the hallway when Connor walked by and slipped, grabbing the mop bucket and spilling dirty water everywhere. Mister Pete just stood there looking defeated, while Connor and his friends laughed their asses off. The new kid was sitting nearby and watched the whole thing. He didn't say anything, just kept eating his sandwich. But his jaw was clenched tight. Later that day in gym class, Connor was telling his buddies about the mop incident. He started doing this fake accent, making fun of how Mr. Pete talked, calling him names. I won't repeat. The whole time the new kid was doing

I've had a copycat since the day I was born. My younger brother, chase. And I don't mean that in the cute ah, he looks up to you kind of way. I mean it like, if I breathed, he tried to breathe harder. If I said I liked blue, his whole wardrobe turned blue. If I started skateboarding, he showed up two days later with a better board, newer shoes, and a GoPro strapped to his chest like he was about to film Tony Hawk Pro Skater 8. It started small, funny even. Like when I got my first CD player, chase begged my mom for the same one for his birthday. Down to the same color and headphones. I didn't care. I thought it was just brother stuff. But by the time we hit high school, it got weird. I joined the soccer team, chase tried out, made the team, then told people I only made it because he vouched for me. Cool. I dyed my hair once just to try something new. Chase bleached his two days later, then told people he done it first. I was copying him. One time I told my friends I wanted to start a YouTube channel. Chase beat me to it. Same niche, same style. He even named it something like mine, but better. I wish I. Just kidding. But I still tried to Be chill. He was my brother. Whatever. Let him do his thing. But then came the turning point. I started dating this girl named Natalie. Sweet, Smart, into photography. Totally my type. Chase started bumping into us wherever we went. One time, we were on a picnic, middle of the park, no one around. Suddenly, here comes chase, jogging up like, oh, didn't know you'd be here. In jeans. Then he started talking to Natalie's best friend, Tara. Started copying our inside jokes, mimicking our date ideas, using my Spotify playlists on his dates. The worst part? He told Natalie, my girlfriend, that he worried I wasn't serious about her, that I jumped from thing to thing. He wanted her to be careful. That was it. I snapped. Not publicly, not loud, but I made a plan. If chase wanted to copy me, I'd give him something to copy. Something too big to handle. So at our family's Thanksgiving dinner, I made an announcement. Big, dramatic. I've decided to become a father. I said dead silence. I explained how Natalie and I had been thinking about it for a while, how it was early, but we were ready. I even passed around a fake ultrasound I printed offline and edited with Photoshop. My mom started crying. My dad gave me a backpack like I just won the Super Bowl. Chase. Frozen utensil halfway to his mouth. The look on his face. Worth everything. Two days later, I saw his Instagram. Post black and white photo him shirtless, hand on his girlfriend Tara's stomach. Caption starting a new chapter. The comments unbearable. Omg congrats! You guys will be amazing parents! We knew it! Tara reposted it saying they just found out last.

They'll finish the entire series, shut the TV off, look you dead in the eyes and go, anyway, I think I want a lavender oat milk latte. I'm sorry, I'm not ready for that.

Growing up as one of the only Asian kids in my small town, my mom always made me go to Mandarin school on weekends. I hated it. Every Saturday morning, while my friends were watching cartoons, I was stuck learning characters I'd never use. By high school, I barely remembered anything except basic phrases. But then Jessica transferred to our school. She was this super popular cheerleader who always had perfect hair and designer clothes. And for some reason, she decided to make my life hell. She accidentally knock my books over in the hallway or whisper about my clothes to her friends when I walked by. Classic mean girl stuff. But what really got to me was how she'd mock Asian accents whenever I was around, thinking she was hilarious. One day, I was working my shift at the local bubble tea shop when Jessica walked in with her friends. I sat at a table right by the counter, and I heard her say, uh, I can't believe they let these people handle our food. That's when I had an idea. See, two of our regular customers were these sweet old Chinese ladies who came in every Tuesday for their weekly gossip session. They always ordered the same thing. Jasmine tea with Boba, half sugar. The next time Jessica came in, I waited until Mrs. Wu and Mrs. Zeng were there. As Jessica ordered, I spoke to Them in my rusty Mandarin, loud enough for Jessica to hear. This girl at school loves making fun of Chinese people. She thinks we can't understand her. Mrs. Wu's eyes lit up with mischief. For the next 20 minutes, they had the loudest conversation in Mandarin, pointing at Jessica and laughing. Jessica kept glancing over nervously, clearly uncomfortable. This became our weekly routine. Every time Jessica came in, I tell the ladies something new about her. How she cheated on her math test. How her designer bags were actually fakes from the mall. They'd react dramatically, gasping and giggling. Jessica started coming in less and less. When she did, she'd grab her drink and practically run out. But then came the day of the big cheerleading competition. Jessica and her whole squad came in for pre game bubble tea. Mrs. Wu and Mrs. Jang were there as always. This time, though, Jessica marched up to me and said,

Out of pure horn enos, I went down on my younger cousin during quarantine. I don't regret it. I live alone, so I got quite lonely several weeks into quarantine, which worked out perfectly because my younger cousin Liz, who is a freshman in college, needed a spot to stay due to school canceling from the virus. I had an empty room left when my ex wife moved out and got divorced with me. The last time I saw Liz was about eight years ago when she was 11. She's 19 now. I remembered her as lanky and awkward. She was like a small girl growing into a spider's body, all limbs. I thought it would be awkward before she showed up, but it turns out we share a lot of common interests, so we got along easily. Movies became a nightly tradition pretty quickly. Around 6, we would each pick a movie we thought the other person might like. Watch one, make dinner, and watch the other. Honestly, my favorite part of Liz being there was the help in the kitchen. It felt like I had a mini Gordon Ramsay in my house. The food was so good. I had my fair share of junk food and pre made pizza making because my ex wife grew up eating cereal, junk food, and frozen dinner. Dinner with Liz Each night was the beginning of the end for me. I would constantly catch myself Reaching out to touch her lower back like I had with a few times I did with my wife. Or just staring at the back of her neck, her hair tied up, while she focused on some mundane task like chopping up an onion and resisting the urge to gently kiss her on the shoulder. Last Monday was the first time I caught an idea that she might be interested in me. After the first movie of the night, Liz left to take a shower to wash off after a run she had taken earlier that day. While I threw together a pizza right after her shower, she surprised me by WA

To collect your child. My eight year old son, Jake, discovered the school's dress code loophole and exploited it like a tiny lawyer. Our elementary school had this super strict uniform policy. Navy pants, white polo shirts, black shoes only. No exceptions. The principal, missus Rodriguez, was notorious for sending kids home over the tiniest violations. Last month, Jake got in trouble for wearing sneakers with white stripes instead of solid black. I had to leave work to bring him new shoes. The week before that, his polo had a microscopic logo, which apparently violated the no brand markings rule. Another trip to school. I it's getting fed up with these constant calls. Especially since I work hourly and can't afford to keep leaving. That's when Jake, being the smart kid he is, actually read the student handbook they gave us at the beginning of the year. Tuesday morning I got the call. Hi, this is the school office. You need to come pick up Jake immediately. There's been a dress code situation. I sighed, grabbed my keys, and drove over, expecting another tiny violation. But when I walked into the principal's office, I couldn't believe what I saw. My son was sitting there in the most ridiculous outfit I'd ever seen. He had on navy blue swim trunks, a white polo shirt that was clearly meant for a grown man, and black cowboy boots that came up to his knees. He looked like a tiny businessman who'd gotten dressed in the dark. Missus Rodriguez looked absolutely defeated. Your son claims this outfit follows all dress code requirements. Jake grinned and pulled out a crumpled copy of the handbook. Mom, look what I found! It says navy pants or navy bottoms. Swim trunks or navy bottoms. It says white polo shirt but doesn't specify the size. And it says black shoes with no height restrictions. I tried so hard not to laugh. Where did you even get these clothes? Dad's closet and grandpa's garage, he said proudly. I measured everything this morning to make sure it was the right colors. Missus Rodriguez cleared her throat. While technically correct, this clearly violates the spirit of the dress code policy. That's when Jake hit her with the real kicker. He flipped to another page and

Maybe. What kind of car do you have? I have a Civic Type R. Looks normal, but it's actually pretty fast. Interesting. Way better looking than my ex's. Really? You must have had something basic, right? His car was kind of weird. Could your car drive in the rain? Yes, of course. Every car drives in the rain. Not my exes. We never went out when it was raining. It was unbearable because I love going out. Why? Was he afraid of a little rain? No, he said the rear would slide out of nowhere. Let me use the Cantina app to chat with roast bot to help me here. My girlfriend said her ex never drove in the rain because the car would slide sideways. Help me roast her ex. Her ex is so weak he thinks the rain is a new level of Mario Kart. Oh no, I'm gonna spin out! What a quit! He probably uses the umbrella to protect himself from his own imagination. Ha ha ha! Your ex is so weak he thinks the rain is a new level of Mario Kart. Oh no, I'm gonna spin out! Ha ha ha! That was good. What car was it? I don't remember very well, but it had two doors and an animal logo. Ah, it must have been a Mustang. The one with the horse on the front? Maybe, but his car didn't have a horse. I think it Was another animal. Then it wasn't a Mustang. I don't know, but I remember the car even had a nickname. What nickname? He called the car Shelby. Shelby? Yes. By any chance, was the logo a snake? Yeah, that's it. But the worst part was the noise it made. It sounded like the car was meowing. His car was a Ford Mustang. Shelby GT500. Yeah, that's exactly it.

One. Sometimes when we pee, we get more than one pee stream, just like you two. Randomly. You're just sitting there and a bunch of pussy juice decides to come out for no reason and it feels like you pissed yourself, but you just gotta act like nothing happened. 3. Our favourite bra doesn't get washed as much. 4. When we are on our period we can feel when a clot of blood comes out, but we don't randomly tell you guys because it might ruin the current conversation. 5. My wife confirmed a post I saw a while back on Reddit that I never knew. Apparently when a girl farts, sometimes the fart rolls into their vagina instead of backwards. You'll never be the same now. 6. Hormones not only mess with us during our period, but they mess us up the week before too. Premenstrual hormones, for me anyway, almost affect me more than the hormones during the cycle. 7. How painful taking out a dry tampon is. Feels like your insides are being scraped out. 8. When I wear my hair in certain ways it means love. Not gotten the chance to wash it in a while. 9. Specifically what was discussed in the bathroom. 10. We remove hair a lot more than just our legs. Bikini, under armpits. It differs for us all. Stomachs, sideburns, upper lip, chin, nose, nipples, chest, feet, toes, arms. Pretty much anywhere men grow hair We got it. Always great when it's just peach fuzz, but not always the case. 11. When our period is over. If they found out that I'm on my period yesterday, I'm not telling them it's over today. I can use it as an excuse for not going out or exiting bed. 12. Your looks are almost never the problem when we don't want to go further with you.

I'm literally just trying to eat Hot Cheetos in peace. And now I'm bleeding like I got stabbed by Mother Nature's middle finger. Mood swings don't even talk to me. One second I'm crying over a TikTok of a dog reunion, and two minutes later I'm ready to fistfight the toaster because it burned my bagel. And don't get me started on pads and tampons. Pads feel like you're wearing a goddamn diaper made of sadness, and tampons are like, hey, shove this cotton stick inside yourself and pray you don't sneeze. And the worst part? You have to act normal. You're at school trying not to murder everyone in your radius while also making sure you didn't just leak through your jeans. Like a ketchup packet in a backpack. Just carry an emergency kit. Cool, let me just carry a pharmacy in my bag, Janet. Also, cramps. Cramps? Why does it feel like a tiny dragon is doing karate in my intestines while my spine slowly disintegrates? I didn't sign up for this. Periods are a scam and if I ever meet the person who designed the female body, we're throwing hands.

What are soccer fans not ready to hear? One. Soccer is a snooze fest. Watching grown men kick around a ball for 90 minutes for the score to end as a 0 0 draw just doesn't cut it. Two. Soccer games are flop city. The players get brushed and flop around like they're auditioning for a Hollywood movie. In basketball and football, toughness and resilience are valued over the theatrics of diving. 3. It lacks physicality. Finesse and skill are fine, but the game is just too soft. 4. The passing is excessive. You're just passing the ball all back and forth for hours on end. No wonder your fans come up with elaborate chance. Probably to cure their boredom from all the passing. Five. The level of external investment in soccer is on a whole other level. You have no right to talk about the NFL being a corporate charade when your teams are owned by Saudi oil billionaires who plaster their names on your jerseys. Six. Soccer is one of the least athletic sports on earth. You don't have to be strong, fast, or have any other real athletic talent to make it in the professional leagues. Just look at Messi. 7. The only reason your sport is the most popular is because of how accessible it is for people in poorer countries to start. American football requires thousands of dollars in equipment, which is why it doesn't get the same global reach. 8. College football games Are louder and have better atmospheres than most of your finals. Nine. We only care about soccer once every four years. 10 if we put our best athletes in soccer from a young age, the U S. Would dominate on a global scale and win the World Cup. 11 just because it's the most popular sport in the world doesn't mean it's the best. 12 it's called soccer.

One. I love Asian girls. They remind me of children. Two. Midday, he placed his hand on my stomach and said, my son will grow here. Three. Called their mom in front of me to say they met a real winner and how they were done with their ex. Not sure if this counts, but it was really uncomfortable. Four I told this guy I played the piano, and like half an hour later, he said if I wanted you to always remember me, would break your ring fingers, you know, cause they don't heal well. And then you'd always think of me when playing. Suffice to say, I left the restaurant fairly quickly. 5 friend told me the guy not only asked for a selfie, but posted on Facebook with the caption my queen. First time meeting. 6 he wanted to go for a walk at the park with me at 4:00am. So when I said no, he said, don't worry, I won't rape you and gave me a twisted smile. Seven invited my ex to join us for lunch. 8 this is not my story, but my mother's. My mom was. Was a pioneer in online dating. She was really interested in finding someone special. She agreed to meet a guy for dinner. First mistake. And went in to be seated prior to him arriving. He came in, the waitress brought menus, and he set down his Menu and the first words he spoke were asking my mom if she has ever known anyone who had a penis enlargement. He then went on to explain that he had flown Cross County for this operation and it had gone wrong. He went into great specifics about just how wrong.

I wrote an answer that was so bad they had to modify the textbook. Took a class on Greek history my senior year in college because my roommate said the professor was cool and the class was easy. Well, cool and easy. A relative, my roommate, was a classics major and knew Greek history inside and out. He was also a genius, so everything was easy. We had our first test that covered everything we Learned so far, like chapters one through eight in the textbook, or so I thought. It was also on the intro to the textbook, even though we never reviewed or discussed it in class. Apparently, the professor emphasized this in the class before the test, but I wasn't there. I stay up all night cramming for the test and feel great as I'm taking it the next day. Until I get to the last essay question, which was worth 25% of the grade, and said something like, according to the textbook intro, there were five reasons why scholars debate whether Crete was one of the locations in the Odyssey. Name one and explain it. Crap. This never came up in class or in the rest of the textbook. So I rack my brain for something even remotely coherent and remember an episode of jeopardy! About when Crete was supposedly discovered or something. So make up some nonsense about how because the Odyssey was Written around 800 BC, but Crete wasn't discovered until later. Then it couldn't be Crete. Thought I might get points for writing more than 100 words, but fully expected to max out at a C the following week. The professor is giving out the graded tests. He's making a bit of a show of it, commenting on how the class did overall and calling out a few people that really whiffed in a kind of funny, not too harsh way, but still pretty embarrassing. And he's given out everyone's but mine. And then we have Mr. Davidson. Mr. Davidson didn't show up to the last class before the test, and apparently didn't talk to anyone that did. How do I know this? Because his answer to the last essay wasn't even close to anything that was in the book. The whole class is looking at me. My roommate is trying to contain his laughter. A girl I was into was giving me a sad, pitiful, must suck to be you face. I'm beat red at this point. However, after rereading it a few times, I was curious, so I handed it to the chair of the department and asked him to read it. He laughed because the answer was just, well, dumb, but then started to scratch his head. You see, while Mr. Davidson didn't do the assigned reading, he has identified a sixth and perhaps better answer than what was in the book. So reluctantly, I'm giving him full credit. And we reached out to the author and suggested he include an update in the next edition. Next time, though, Mr. Davidson, please just do the reading. It was great. The best part was that my roommate missed something minor and wound up losing a few points. So I pulled a better Mark.

When my wife and I went on our first date 45 years ago, she looked breathtaking and made me so nervous that I accidentally put Sriracha on my eggs instead of ketchup. As someone with zero heat tolerance, I took one bite and my mouth was on fire. When she asked about the Sriracha on my eggs, I panicked and tried to play it off cool, telling her, growing up in an Asian household, we had a lot of spicy dishes, so the taste of spice reminds me of home. Oh, man, do I regret saying that. The date went great, and soon after, we moved in together. That's when she started making me breakfast every morning, always with a generous drizzle of Sriracha on my eggs. She'd grin and say, gotta start the day with your favorite. I choked it down, my mouth burning and stomach twisting, but I always told her it was perfect. Over the years, she began gifting me fancy hot sauces, excitedly asking how they compared. I've eaten eggs covered in sauces labeled with skulls and flames, all while wishing for just plain ketchup. But every time she hands me that plate, she looks so proud and cheerful. It's been 45 years, and every single morning I brace myself for another fiery breakfast. I've kept the lie up for so long that I could never confess. She's still giddy whenever she surprises me. With a new level of heat and despite the burn, I wouldn't change a thing. Seeing her happy is worth every scorching bite.

One. Freshman year of college, walk into the kitchen area late at night, and there's my girlfriend sitting on the counter kissing one of my good friends. I just left quietly without them noticing and cut off all contact with both of them. So pretty sure I wasn't supposed to see that. Saw them both together about 20 years later at Costco, so I guess it worked out for them. 2. When I started a new job, someone had left a bunch of HR files on the computer I was given. I opened one up, not sure what it was, and I got to see every employee's salary in the company, even the CEO. The next day it was gone. My boss realized his mistake and logged into my system and deleted the files. It was a memorable experience. Three. I was about 8 or 9, and my parents were going to be out of town, so they had me and siblings stay with a family from our church. Once we got to the house, which was really nice by the way, they had one rule. You can play wherever you want, but the basement is off limits. Me, being the little brat that I was, snuck down there first chance I got and was supremely disappointed to only find rows and rows of plants growing under lights. Four. When I was 14 and friend hosted a birthday Party at his house with all the parents invited. Needed to use the restroom, but the main one was occupied, so my friend told me I can use the one in his mom's bedroom. As I walked up to the door, I could hear somebody in there, so I decided to wait until whoever was in there was finished. A good ten minutes later, my friend's mom, who was hosting the party, and another good friend's stepfather walk out and see me standing there all confused. They asked what I was doing there, and I just said I was waiting to use the bathroom. Surprisingly, they played it cool and just said I can use it now and walked off. 5 one Christmas Eve, I couldn't sleep at all, so I went to the kitchen to get some water or something, and out in the living room were my parents setting out presents and eating the cookies I had left out. They said that Santa was running late and was in such a big hurry that he just dropped off the presents and asked them to put them out for him.

One. We snuggled all night watching a movie together. Then when he went to leave, I tried to kiss him goodbye, but he rejected it and drove away dejected. I went back to my room to sulk. He calls me 10 minutes later asking to meet me outside. I get outside and he shouts in disbelief wait, were you trying to kiss me? Does that mean you like me? Boy had legit driven away and called his friend because he was confused and thought I was giving mixed messages about liking him or not. Two I bartended and I waved the tab of a regular and when I told him his drinks were on me he made the joke bet you say that to all the pretty girls. I said drinks are only waved for hot people the bartender has a crush on and he looked so confused and said he was honored to be the exception to that rule. 3. My mother in law met my father in law when they both worked at a pizza place as teenager. She was really into him so she'd go in on her nights off to help slice tomatoes and onions and dropped hints to him for months, but he never picked up on any of it. One night she brought Hershey Kisses and went to put them in the cooler and asked if he'd like his kisses cold. He said, actually, I prefer warm kisses. So she said okay and kissed him. That was when he realized she liked him. She blushes when she tells the story, as she admits that was very unlike her, but her gut said to go for it. They've been married for 40 years. Four. Well, in high school, my hints were to act like I couldn't stand the guy and that they were the person I found most annoying slash uncrushable in the whole school. Shockingly misinterpreted every time. No idea why. Five. Not me, but an old best friend and roommate girl that had a crush on him came over to our place to use the pool. After the pool, she used his shower and left the door slightly open. She mentioned that it's really hard to wash the middle of her back. He went into my bathroom, grabbed my long handle scrub brush, and literally tossed it in the bathroom and shut the door. She finished her shower, walked up to me and handed me the brush and left. I went into his room and asked him why she just handed me my scrub brush and he told me she needed something to scrub her back. I told him that she meant he should go scrub her back. Dude seriously looked me right in the face and said, but she had the brush. I sent her a text that said, my boy is unfortunately touched in the head. You need To be direct with him, she texts back, good to know. He comes bursting into my room a few minutes later and hands me his phone, and it says, on my way over, be naked. I let him have the place and went to see a movie.

In second grade, I had a No. 2 pencil that was getting uncomfortably short, but alas, it was my only one. To save from the embarrassment of asking someone for one to borrow, I decided to sharpen it when it broke. Now we had one of those electric pencil sharpeners that turned on when a pencil was inserted, so I begin as the eraser head disappears into the sharpening hole. I was beginning to panic when I realised I had a green coloured pencil on me as well, so I figured I'd push it all the way in and hope the original pencil would disappear. Now here's where it gets interesting. One of my classmates had a weird thing for abnormally short pencils and everyone knew it. As the eraser metal embeds itself in the sharpener and makes a horrible screeching noise, my teacher runs over and asks what I did. I pulled my green pencil out and said nothing. It just started making that noise. After some investigation, she finds the eraser metal and I tell her I didn't have a pencil that day. That's why I was sharpening my green pencil now. It's at this point I seize my opportune moment and state student always use a short pencil, as to which my classmates agree, which is the nail in the coffin for this poor student. He states that he likes short pencils, but it was not him. Teacher Gets fed up because the sharpener is now trashed and sends him to the principal. I sign my name with my green pencil and continue on the assignment. Thirty minutes later, student enters the room in tears with the principal and is forced to apologize to the teacher for lying, then to the class for ruining the pencil sharpener. And so the story ends. Or so I thought. I changed schools to public a few years after that. Then in college, through friends of friends, myself and Student X arrive at the same party and proceed to catch up. Five beers and I mention the above story. He stands up, mouth agape, and lets out you absolute scumbag! I apologize, A smile creeps across his face and we laugh until we cry.

So then I go over to Kat and I'm like, Yo, Kat, I gotta talk to you. I don't have a Twitter page. And he's like, so what they ship, pal? What are you trying to say? I don't. Like, I'm trying to say, I don't have a Twitter page. He goes, so that's not unusual. I don't have a Twitter page, either. What?

I stood up in place kind of. It was one of those long bench seats and I couldn't push it back cause other people were sitting on it. Then her sister says, oh, there are no secrets in this family. Speak your mind! People then laugh again and everybody starts making jokes about not having secrets. And this man who married into the family somehow tells me that he remembers being in my place and he says, let me give you some Advice the best thing to do right now is speak your mind and be honest. Then others join in and echo his sentiment. All jokingly, I think. Dot. So I looked at my date, and she says something like, you can tell me anything here. We're all family. She also, I think, was joking.

One. I gave up my first class seat to a soldier in uniform. When the flight attendant came by and coach asking for our drink orders, I. I said, whiskey and Diet Coke, please. He said, you know, I'm going to have to charge you for that because you are no longer in first class. I literally said, are you kidding me? I have done this over 100 times and never has a flight attendant insisted I pay. I once even got a whole bottle of wine signed by the flight crew. He insisted I pay. The guy behind me said, I will buy his drink. I said, that is okay. I have a whole stack of free drink coupons from Delta. I gave him one and had my drink. But when I deplaned, I asked to speak with the captain, who was himself a veteran. He was pretty pissed off and said he would have a word with the FA. 2 I was downgraded on a flight because both first class and business class was full. I was given a premium economy seat near the bulkhead. During the flight, the curtain opened and I saw a flight attendant who was dead heading, sitting in a business class seat. I took out my phone, walked up, took her picture, then took pictures of the other cabin crew. I made sure I got their name tags. In the pictures, I asked the head of purchasing for our bank to call their counterpart at the airline and explain what happened and provided their names. I got a very nice apology letter from the airline, but my staff flew another airline internationally for the next three months. 3 I was 19 years old and boarding a plane that had a flight time of two and a half hours. I walked to the very back of the plane and sat in my seat. I was a nervous flyer and was dreading the flight ahead. A man walked up to me and told me I was in his seat. It wasn't a packed flight, and I was definitely in the correct seat. A flight attendant was right by us and could tell the man was not the kindest. So what she did next was awesome. She had me move a row back, and then once everyone was situated, she LED me to a row of three empty seats near the middle of the plane. The man who was being rude was kept in his seat with other

One. My son was in the fourth grade when his science teacher called, furious that he had been disrespectful in class. I asked her what had happened. She said, I was teaching the students the difference between mammals and fish. I told them that sharks are mammals and whales are fish. He interrupted me and told me I had made a mistake. I, of course, told him I was right and he said, who gave you a diploma? I told her I would talk to my son about his rudeness. I then called the principal and made an appointment to see him and the teacher together. In the meeting, I asked her to repeat her story and she did, still insisting that whales were fish and sharks were mammals. The principal just shook his head and said, and I hired her. I did talk to my son about being polite to everyone, even if they are wrong. 2. My son was in fourth grade. He came home with a math paper that was marked F. I read through the problems and realised the answers were all correct. I called the teacher and he said that my son needed to show his work on the paper. I replied, he didn't show his work because these problems are easy and he did them all in his head. I told him that if he wanted to take off some points, For not explaining that was one thing, but an F was completely unacceptable. In the course of the conversation, the teacher said son needs to recognize that two plus two does not always equal four. I almost choked on my drink spitting out on my think it does always equal four. The teacher went on a long rant about how he was an engineer who quit to teach math and that I probably couldn't understand something so complex, but that he could write some computer modeling that would show that 2 plus two did not always equal four. I took a deep breath, thought thank you for mansplaining, and said, interestingly enough, my career is one of a system engineer. I spend my days creating and running computer models. I can assure you that if you input the same data each time, you will get the same result. I. E. 2 + 2 will always compute to 4. It's only if you change the input data that you will get a different result. Of course, then that will be a new algorithm and not the original 2 + 2. At that point I knew 4th grade math was going to be a lost cause for my gifted and talented 10 year old and told him to complete the work accurately and don't worry about the grade 3. We had just moved back to Wisconsin from living abroad. I was called by my second grade son's teacher at his new school To inform me that he wouldn't stop lying about living on a fictional island called Sipan, we came in to pick him up from school. The teacher pulled down a scroll map and showed us that he was pointing to an empty spot in the middle of the ocean called Sipan. We had the pleasure of informing her that her map was wrong and that indeed there is an island exactly where he indicated called Saipan, where we had just relocated from. Awkward, to say the least. 4. My daughter was in the third grade and came home with a math assignment having to do with exponents. Now, I am not a math person. The job belongs to her dad, who is a chemical engineer. I did notice, however, that she appeared to have confused the term cube as being to the fourth power instead of the third. When I pointed this out, she insisted vehemently that her teacher had taught her cube was to the fourth power the very day. So though my head was exploding, I could see that there was no point in arguing with her. It was time to hand this educational debacle over to the chemical engineer. My husband also did his best to convince our darling daughter of the fact that cubed is indeed to the third power, but to no avail. At this point she was very upset and tearfully said, daddy, if I do it the way you say, I will get It wrong, and I don't want to get it wrong, her father assured her.

My ex and I divorced on pretty good terms, which was great since we were sharing custody of our four year old daughter, Kayla. But about a year after we split, my ex started dating this guy, Gordon. We agreed on a policy where we had to date someone for six months before they were allowed to meet Kayla, so I wasn't worried about him at first. I figured either he wouldn't be a good match and my ex would end it before the six months, or he'd last that long, which must mean he was a good guy. I trusted my ex's judgment, but I actually ended up meeting him just a couple months after they got together, just by chance. I was at a restaurant, and my ex and Gordon were there on a date, and she introduced us. The second I laid eyes on Gordon, I had a bad feeling. I honestly don't even know what it was, but it was like my blood ran cold when I saw him. I actually wondered if maybe I was jealous, even though I was completely over my ex, and I'd met another one of her boyfriends since we split, and it hadn't bothered me. But then Gordon started talking, and I knew the problem wasn't me. It was absolutely him. He just seemed slick, like he was trying to pitch himself. And clearly it wouldn't be a Hard sell. Because clearly he was all that and a bag of chips. Nothing about him seemed sincere, and I didn't like the way he brought up Kayla at all. Talking about how he was so excited to meet her and implying that me and my ex's rule about waiting was stupid and I should let her change it. So the next time I saw my ex, I made sure she knew that I didn't want him meeting Kayla anytime soon. She promised me that she wasn't trying to get out of our deal to wait six months. But she did let me know that she thought things with Gordon were serious, and she expected that he'd still be around when the clock ran out. Every month after that was filled with dread. Every time I sent Kayla off to my exes, I wondered if this would be the time she'd meet Gordon. All my friends tried to convince me that I was being paranoid, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that I didn't want this guy around my daughter. But one day, Kayla came home from her mom's and told me that Mommy's sad because she broke up with her boyfriend. I swallowed and said that was too bad, and asked Kayla if she'd ever gotten to meet him, and she said no. I was so relieved. The next time I saw my ex, I told her I was sorry that things hadn't worked out with the two Of them. But told her I'd always had a bad feeling about that guy. That's when she took a deep breath and told me the truth about their breakup. A few weeks ago, a young boy in our area had gone missing. The police had asked anyone who might have a clue where he could be to come forward. Well, apparently, one of the eight people at Gordon's work had noticed some disturbing images on his computer. During a routine security check, he realized that the boy in those photos looked a lot like the missing kid. They raided Gordon's house and found the boy locked in a closet in Gordon's house. Battered, traumatized, and bitten by rats, but thankfully alive. Gordon was immediately taken into custody. And he called my ex from jail, thinking she would believe that he was framed somehow. Obviously, she immediately got a restraining order and was taking measures to make sure he never contacted her again, including putting her house on the market. After I made absolutely sure that Kayla was telling the truth and he'd never met her, my ex swore he hadn't. I just hugged her while she cried. I didn't blame her for being taken in by him. After all, I hadn't even had any evidence that he was a bad guy. I just knew somehow.

One. The person you strapped yourself to for a tandem skydive was up until 3:00am doing cookies last night. 2. The best time to buy a car is the second model year of its release. Year one it's patchwork to just get them off the line. Year two everything is fixed and has quality content. Year 3+ Oems give incentives to make parts cheaper and to discontent to improve margins. 3. Sometimes when a job is posted and the requirements are unrealistic, that's because they already have someone that needs to be promoted to that specific position, and they simply tailor that job ad so only that person qualifies, even if hundreds of people apply. Four. Political propaganda. TV hosts and speakers don't believe that shit themselves and are very cynical about it. Like it's just a job like any other. 5. The signal strength bars on your phone don't mean anything real. Each phone manufacturer comes up with their own secret formula. It might change between software versions and it's just a holdover from the old first generation analogue phones. When received, signal strength was the only important metric. 4G and 5G networks are way too complex to distil into one bar graph. But customers are used to it, so phones still have it. 6. Many therapists need therapy themselves. Sometimes a lot of it. 7. The massive professional quality cinema projectors that movie theaters use. The ones that can project crystal clear 4 K+ images. The ones linked to top notch surround systems that make movies come to life. The ones so big they have a giant exhaust hose. They have regular HDMI ports on the side. 8. Utility construction, primarily fibre. The majority of the subcontractors have no idea what they're actually doing and are just following the instructions like it's IKEA furniture. 9. Your call isn't really important to us.

That is against the rules. Then I wish for more genies. That is also against the rules. Then I wish those rules did not exist. The genie warps in a humongous book and flips to a page before smugly saying that two is also against the rules. I wish for you to write down detailed instructions which would allow me to circumvent the rules in place and wish for a million wishes with a single wish and hand them to me, I declared, grinning widely. That, the genie began before pausing. His brows furrowed as my wish clicked into place. Will be done. It worked? I asked incredulously. Somehow, yes, he answered. His face for Lauren is a typewriter, and a ream of paper materialized in front of him. This might take a while. Well, then, I declared, my second wish is for you to enclose yourself within a bubble wherein time flows differently for the next 10 minutes, such that my first wish is completed within that span of time. Thy will be done, he murmured, snapping his fingers. I watched in awe as a bubble appeared around him, his form seeming to fade away as he moved faster than I could process. Shrugging, I settled on the floor, pulling my phone out to pass the time. It's done, a haggard voice said, pulling me back to reality. I looked up to see a wrinkled hand holding out a thick stack of papers. The Genie, in his prime just minutes ago, was now an old man. How long was it? I asked, taking the bundle and starting to read the first page. Seven millennia, he wheezed, floating down to sit in front of me. You have no idea the time. Let's do this, I interrupted, as I settled in to read what he typed out. It took 20 years, 20 years of preparation, but in the end I did it. Your wish is my command, the ancient genie mumbled, his voice barely more than a whisper. That was it! With a snap of his fingers, my wish was granted. A million wishes. More power than that of even a god was within my grasp. For my fourth wish, I intoned, I wish for your body and your mind to regress to their prime. Done! He whispered, snapping his fingers again. For my fifth wish, I wish for all my wishes to be granted through this ring when I speak them, starting with the specific words, I wish that, accompanied by me rubbing the gem here in four times, and that the gem pulses with a green light four times when a wish is granted. Strange, but done, he said, strong and youthful once more. I wish that the power to grant my wishes be transferred to his ring, independent of the genie's own powers from this point on, I stated, rubbing the gem on my ring four times. The genie just nodded as I Looked over at him, confirming that my wish had worked. I wish that the genie who granted my previous wishes remains unable to, consciously or unconsciously, willingly or through coercion, work with any person or persons or things of a terrestrial or extraterrestrial origin to undo any of my wishes at any point in time, past or present.

One immediate family member dated a pro athlete. He was ranked top 100. After about a year being together, he was in the three hundreds. Lots of pressure from his coach and family to end the relationship. He did, and you could tell he felt bad about it. We check his ranking sometimes, and he's never recovered. Always felt bad for them. Never fall for a tennis player. Love means nothing to them. Two friends with a girl who married an NBA star. Cheating was constant, known and accepted as the price she paid for being well taken care of and not having to work. She was very matter of fact about it, and it was kind of sad. Apparently it was only allowed on the road, and there was never to be any side chicks in or around the house. 3 I was married to a former D1 softball pitcher. She was crazy intelligent and athletic, but such an asshole most of the time. We lasted over a decade, but I couldn't take the competitive side of her and her inability to let things go. She's also an attorney, so that didn't help in arguments. Four. Dated a retired NHL player for 10 years. His body was completely broken and he was competitive as shit. Good guy, but he died of a massive heart attack at 50 a couple years ago. Five. I dated an international swimmer. He was up every Morning at five to swim, came back to eat, cuddle and sleep. Then did the same thing in the afternoon. He was really good at balancing his training and the relationship, which I don't think I fully appreciated in the moment. His shoulders took up like three quarters of the bed, which I guess was a blessing and curse. The biggest downside was, no matter how much he showered, everything always smelled a bit like chlorine.

Soulja Boy beat a pregnant woman into having a miscarriage. 2. Jack Nicholson beat a prostitute that he hired to the point of irreversible brain damage. 3. Travis Scott essentially leaving his manager for dead in the studio. His loyal ex manager who suffered from seizures had one while Travis was with him. Travis abandoned him while it was happening and went home, then texted him firing him a day later saying I can't have a manager who's shaking on the ground and shit. The lack of empathy continued with Astro World. 4. Paul Walker has entered the chat. So has his significantly younger girlfriend. He was 33 and she was 15 if I recall. Feel free to look it up. 5. Ronald Reagan sold weapons to Iranian terrorists and gave the money to bunch of coke dealers in Central America to fight communism. Reagan essentially is the reason crack becomes so popular in the 80s despite being one of the toughest presidents on drugs. 6. Steve Sociopath jobs he berated his daughter for being born to his mistress, refused to install heating in her bedroom, reiterated she isn't getting a penny of his $400 million fortune, then told her she smelled like a toilet on his deathbed. I hope she's an avid Samsung consumer.

You Americans seem to have both the smartest and the stupidest humans on earth co existing in your country. 2. You are allowed to drive a car at 16, own weapons, and sign up for the military at 18, but alcohol is some taboo and only for 21+. 3. Water. Why are Americans so weird about water? So many people will just drink Coke or juice or Gatorade all day. And if they do drink water it needs to be ice cold or flavoured with Mayo or something. 4. A lot of you follow and worship politicians. Like their gods, flags and all that stuff. In the U. K. It's universally acknowledged that we hate all politicians pretty much equally. 5. How casual debt is and how easy it is to take loans and credit cards out in other people's names without their knowledge. 6. Having to tip almost everywhere. It definitely makes sense at some places, but feel like we have to tip at the most random of places these days. 7. Private health insurance that is tied to your employment. 8. Non medical circumcision in infants. 9. The crazy rise of Uber Eats and other companies that deliver food at a markup of what it costs in the restaurant. 10. Why does everything have to be bigger? Bigger cars, bigger houses, bigger food portions, bigger people. 11. College frats 12. Shoes inside 13. Those red cups you guys seem to drink out of at every party or outdoor event. 14 how car centric the whole country is.

One. In high school, I was dared to play gay chicken, which is where two straight guys pretend to be gay, and the first one to chicken out loses. The other guy and I are both really stubborn, and neither one of us wanted to lose. We've been married 14 years, and we run a bed and breakfast in Vermont without adopted daughter. If that dude doesn't chicken out soon, I'm going to start to suspect that he's actually gay. Two. Was dared to catch a Frisbee in my teeth from across the yard. So walked outside and across the yard. Girl wound up, threw the Frisbee, figured a this ought to be funny when it bounces off my face, and as a total fucking fluke, actually caught it in my teeth. Three. Wasn't me, but a girl was dared to mirror what I do. So I made her hug a guy I knew liked her. Four. I was about 12. At a friend's sleepover. I was dared to go home by a kid who didn't like me too much. I walked the two miles home, and as I came to my driveway, my older brother had just pulled in. He had three baby raccoons with him. Because he had hit their mother while delivering pizza, I got to spend the rest of the night with him. Three raccoons in a cheese and pepperoni pizza, watching nightmare on Elm. Street 5. The first day I met my wife, we played a game of truth or dare. She asked me, truth. What kind of clothes on a girl do you like? Then the next day she showed up to my house in those clothes.

She didn't know I was stronger than her. When my then girlfriend and I started dating, I discovered early on that she can be quite physical in the sense that she likes to push, hold, and punch even. Bear in mind she is never actually trying to hurt me. She is just playful like that. I found this both adorable and fun, so I played along. If she pushed me, I would act like I had to balance myself, or if the bed or sofa was nearby, I would fall onto it. If she held me, I would pretend that it was difficult for me to get out of her grip. If I pushed her and she resisted, I would pretend it was hard work. Same with me holding her arms, etc. You get the idea. I always assumed she knew I was playing along and not actually physically straining myself to compete with her strength. This went on for months. Here is where my screw up occurs. One day we were chilling on the sofa watching a show when I realized I was running late to meet some friends. I told her I needed to shower and make a move. She decided this was a good time for a play fight. She sat on top of me to pin my arms under her knees. I played along and struggled to move her off me a little More wrestling took place with me playing along like I do. Then I told her I really need to make a move. She was not done and continued to hold and push me back onto the sofa. Eventually I decided I need to win this little fight and get going, so I got her onto her back, held her hands near her head, leant down to kiss her on the cheeks a few times, and let her know again that I was running late. She tried to move her arms and could not. While struggling she grunted out, why are you so strong today? I laughed and looked at her like she was joking. This was my second mistake. Her eyes went wide with comprehension and she stopped struggling. Are you always this strong? She asked, almost to herself. Come on, babe, you did not really think we are of equal strength, did you? I replied. I then went to take a shower, got ready, and as I was heading out the door I noticed that she might have been a little upset. Me, being fully aware that I do not fully comprehend the mystery of female emotions, had no clue why she was upset. I did what all men do. I guessed. I gave her a kiss and said I won't be gone for long and that I can pick up her favorite Chinese on the way back. I assumed she was upset about me not spending the afternoon With her, I got no reply. My third mistake was not spending some time talking it through. I instead went on my merry way and had a great freaking time with my friends. She spent the next few hours brewing, simmering, seething, and of course, overthinking. I came home with a Chinese, and as soon as I put it down on the dining table, she sprung out of the corner and attacked me. It genuinely surprised me and I reacted by bear hugging her to my chest.

I added my number to my mom's group chat and what I saw left me permanently disturbed. Yesterday my mom asked me to show her how to create a WhatsApp group on her phone. Her smartphone is brand new and she's new to smartphones. Her previous phone was only capable of doing the bare minimum when it came to communication and she was happy with that. Well, her old phone died recently and her plan was to go back to the early 2 and find another bare minimum phone. I decided, screw that, I'm getting you a proper phone that doesn't have an annoying cartridge game ringtone whenever it's switched on. I've been teaching my mom how to use her new phone for the past two weeks now. She's a slow learner, but she is making progress. Which brings me back to the WhatsApp group. I talked her through the process and even showed her how to add someone to the group. I suggested that she had my contact just to demonstrate how simple it was. As soon as she added me to the group, I said, well done, mom, put my headphones back on, and continued my online gaming session. I must have played for over an hour without checking my phone. When I finally put my controller down, I noticed that I had 28 messages, all in my mom's group. At that moment I realised I Never exited my mom's group or showed her how to one add me. I thought it would be funny to send a message in the group and inform my mom that I forgot to show her how to remove me. I never sent that message.

One. When I was a teenager, I asked a pretty girl if she would like to dance. She rudely replied, I don't dance with children. I immediately shot back with, sorry, I didn't realize you were pregnant. She just looked at me and stunned silence as her two friends laughed. I just turned my back on her and walked away. 2 it was my freshman year of high school. My parents had just recently divorced, and my mom, siblings, and I moved to a small town in upstate Pennsylvania. It was difficult enough dealing with family dynamics, let alone moving to a new town where I didn't know anyone. During my first week at my new high school, I was trying to learn my way around all the classes and get familiar with the teachers. Most of the kids had known each other for years. They had grown up together. I wasn't one of them. I was an outsider with a weird accent and different style. Some kids were very kind and welcoming. Others were cruel, unkind, and very stuck up. I just so happened to sit in front of a girl who was one of the stuck up kind. It was English class. It was also the only empty seat in the whole room. The teacher asked me to introduce myself and share where I was from, so I did. After I finished, we were told that there Would be a pop quiz in the class. The teacher asked me to take it so she could gauge where I was at in my comprehension of English, sentence structure, etcetera. As the teacher was handing out the quiz papers, the girl sitting behind me that I had mentioned earlier tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around to look at her. She leaned in and said, Special Ed is down the hall, and smirked the whole time she was saying it. I just looked at her for a second, blinked, and then turned around. I was slightly irritated. This girl had no idea who I was, yet had already made up her mind about who I was and wasn't. Yep, I was fully irritated at that point. I filled out the quiz. Once it was completed, I handed it in for immediate grading. The teacher handed all the quizzes back with our letter grade slash percentage. She then said there was only one student in the whole class who got a 100% on the quiz. Do you want to know who that is? It's the new student. She looked at me and said, congratulations. Now if everyone else would do that. Well on the next quiz. I turned around and looked at the girl behind me. I paused for a moment and then smiled and said, remember, Special Ed is down the hall. The smirk on her face disappeared in a flash. She didn't say a word. That felt So good. 3 I am the youngest of three children. My brother and sister look like my parents. I was the blue eyed, blonde haired child in a family of brunettes. My siblings used to tease me about how the mailman dropped me off or I was adopted, etc. For the record, we're full blood siblings. One afternoon when I was about 10 years old, my family of five packed into the four door sedan. As the youngest, I was squished in the middle. My siblings started teasing again and my parents just chuckled in the front seats. I argued back for a while, getting upset. Then I got quiet, looking straight forward with full confidence. I responded, at least mom and dad chose me. They got stuck with you. I never heard a word about being dropped off by the mailman again. 4 some years ago, I met a guy at a party who thought he was really something because was a corporate lawyer. Eventually he asked me what I did for a living. I told him I was a computer programmer. He said with a sneer, oh yeah, you're one of those guys who take

My son is 7 years old and once he accidentally left Google on his tablet open and I noticed a recent search for Dominicans with no hands and feet. I was kind of taken aback, so I took his tablet and did some snooping and found a bunch more. Searched for Dominicans with no heads, Dominican chests, Dominican torsos, Dominican legs, Dominicans in stores, Dominicans for sale, silver Dominicans, black Dominicans, white Dominicans. I was at a loss for words, wondering if I was raising a cereal on a liver with a specific hatred for Dominicans. I wanted to bring it up to him, but I didn't know how, so I figured I'd just take him for ice cream. Maybe the casual environment would help me bring it up. Well, we made a quick pit stop at a clothing store, and at this clothing store my son asked me why Dominicans don't have hands or heads. I became extremely confused and puzzled and just looked at him before he asked again, this time why there were so many different colored Dominicans. My face went a little pale and I gently told him to be quiet because his words could be taken offensively by Dominican people. He got frustrated at me and loudly screamed Dominicans aren't people, dad! As he pointed to a statue next to us. I breathed a sigh of relief. Mannequins! He meant mannequins.

After my first wife and I married, I joined the army. Fast forward a year and a half. A lot of bad judgment and immaturity on both parts. And we separated. And she moved back to Pennsylvania. I moved from North Carolina to Louisiana and filed for divorce. She refuses to accept the papers being served, but her mother has served the papers. After two attempts, she basically just didn't open the door to the people serving, as she didn't know who they were, so she wasn't served. We go into arbitration, wait 90 days, then I go to court. Divorce is finalized. The entire time, about a year or so, we had been separated, I had been paying spousal support per army policy. In the interim, I'd met my current wife. We dated and got engaged. A couple months after my divorce was finalized, we got married. So after the divorce was finalized, I stopped paying my ex support, again, per army policy. Plus, after the divorce was finalized, since my ex had no representation, not challenge the divorce, and not made any requests like alimony, we were divorced uncontested, wife in absentia, all mutual property to be retained by whoever had possession at the time. So my current wife go ahead with our wedding as planned, and two months later, I get called in front of the man, company commander with his No. 2 first sergeant standing there, and they're telling Me that my wife filed a complaint with a legal aid office from an Army Reserve lawyer that I hadn't paid her spousal support in a couple of months. I didn't understand, as my wife had dropped me off at work that morning and everything was fine. I asked if he'd like to call and speak with her, which he did while I waited outside of his office. When they brought me back in.

Everybody looked at the table looked at me, which is about half the people there. Dot I guess I was exhausted from all the questioning. I was questioned by multiple people multiple times, and the pressure of it all cause I kind of lost it. He asked the question, I looked across the table at her, and she told her dad to stop it. Her dad smiles and jokingly says that he'd really like to hear my response, and her uncle also said he'd like to know. I looked at my date and said, can I talk to you alone for a minute? To which her dad laughs loudly and then says I made him nervous. So everybody is laughing now and I guess it was a big joke. Then I said to my date, hey, can I talk to you alone for a minute? I stood up in place kind of. It was one of those long bench seats and I couldn't push it back cause other people were sitting on it. Then her sister says, oh, there are no secrets in this family. Speak your mind! People then laugh again and everybody starts making jokes about not having secrets. And this man who married into the family somehow tells me that he remembers being in my place and he says, let me give you some Advice the best thing to do right now is speak your mind and be honest. Then others join in and echo his sentiment. All jokingly, I think. Dot. So I looked at my date, and she says something like, you can tell me anything here. We're all family. She also, I think, was joking.

My daughter went to private school. In elementary school, there was one teacher whom every student wanted to have for first grade. She was an extremely excellent teacher. Well, one year, this teacher asked for a raise because she had been at the school for five years, and she was a very popular teacher among students and teachers alike. The head of the school turned down her request, and as a result, she left the school to work in the public school system. Well, as wonderful as she was in the private school, she was equally popular in the public school. She cared about each and every student in her class. One particular female student truly adored this teacher and decided to bring her a present every day. This present was a pretty White Rock. The teacher put the rocks, one next to the other, around the perimeter of her desk. Pretty soon, the teacher had to make a second row of these pretty rocks. But they were pretty, and she wanted to honor the students. So there they sat on her desk. One day, the school invited the local police to visit with the students in their classrooms. Just a basic, hi, we are your friends. If you ever need help, don't be afraid to ask a police officer, because we are here to help you. Then they allowed the students to ask questions. After 10 minutes of Answering questions, it was time for the students to go outside for recess. Once the students were outside, one of the policemen pulled the teacher aside and asked her about her rock collection. The teacher innocently replied, they are pretty, aren't they? One of my students brings me one every day for a gift. The policeman said, um, ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to point out who this child is, and I will have to confiscate all your rocks.

First, you tell me that you're gonna kiss another female instead of me. When the officiant says, you may now kiss the bride, then you tell me I'm not allowed to do the garter toss. What's next, huh? Well, you're not wearing a white dress or a wedding veil, either. Ah, god. If you can hear me, they're having an outdoor wedding. Let it rain, let it pour, let it thunderstorm! Bring on the Hurricane! Destroy it all! Mom, I'm gonna. I'm gonna have to uninvite you. Mom.

But obviously I'm still gonna go, so let's get dressed. I actually already know the gender because I called the bakery and pretended to be her. It's super easy to imitate her whiny voice, and I was like, hey, what color is the filling of the cake? Just wanna make sure, is it blue or pink? She somehow found out about it because she's literally crazy, so she begged me to wear both colors. That way I don't, like, boil it or anything, but no, I don't like to wear pink, so I'm wearing all blue. Here's the outfit. I actually didn't choose this one randomly. The last time I wore it in front of my boy best friend, he literally had to leave the room, go outside, and take a deep breath, and collect himself. He was like, holy shit, Melissa could never wear that. That's just because she doesn't really put in any effort when she gets ready, and she's always wearing, like, baggy hoodies or baggy pajama pants. She also tried switching locations for the gender reveal, but he left his Apple Watch at my place a while back, so I can literally see all their messages and I know exactly where to go anyway. Guys, I'm so excited. My plan is to literally run and Jump on top of him as soon as they cut that cake. And before anyone says anything. She literally lives with him, so his friends should be able to hug him and celebrate first.

So she caused the whole scene, threw a bunch of cake at me. So I'm gonna go to the grocery store and get some cake for her. I just got to Walmart. I feel like this is the cheapest option, especially because she's not worth a single cent. But her reactions gonna live in my head forever. And that itself is. The funny thing is, she's gonna think that I'm here to apologize or make amends, and then, boom, she's gonna be drenched in cake. And I'm gonna make sure it's a flavor that she absolutely hates, too. We're getting closer. I'm so excited. I already found the one she absolutely hates. Peanut butter. And this is a peanut butter and jelly cake, and it's less than six bucks. Obviously, I can't show up without a gift for my boy best friend, so I'm getting him this card that perfectly describes our relationship. The front says, you share so much, so gladly, so often. He definitely does. I love you for being a good and loving man. I love you for being my closest friend. I love you for being everything that means the most to me. Happy birthday. It's not his birthday, but he deserves to be celebrated every day. Got everything I need from Walmart. Now I'm gonna head to target. To buy my boy best friend a PS five since his crazy wife never lets him play video games. Before any of you, Karen say, well, two wrongs don't make a right. Now, the difference is, she was wrong, I was right. So this doesn't really apply here. And I hope she enjoys smelling like cake for a week straight.

My family is not rich whatsoever. I am not spoiled in the slightest. I'm super grateful for everything that I have, and I'm glad that I have parents that love me enough to work hard so they can buy me the little things in life. I know most of you guys are really, really poor because you have parents that are lazy and absolutely hate your guts. So maybe you could ask Santa for new ones so next year you can get way better presents. I didn't even ask for the new iPhone so I'm super confused why they got me this stupid thing. But they also got me a laptop, which is interesting because I barely go to school. I'm pissed because I asked them for apple headphones and they got me these from Sonos. They're only like $500 which is like the same price so I'll probably just throw these away and have them buy me new ones. Stupid Gucci purse which is way too heavy. And then this Louis Vuitton purse even though I asked them for a YSL. Balenciaga sunglasses even though it's literally winter so why would I need these? I literally just spent $3,000 on skincare from Sephora last month but they bought me more products from bubble and Drunk Elephant bought me even more shit that I don't feel like showing because my gifts kind of suck. I didn't realize that they actually spent more than $20,000 this year because I guess they bought me a Jeep. I really hope it's not in a color that I hate.

I'm actually very productive, and I never get bored. The second he Maxine, I whip out my notebook and start writing a thousand things I love about him. I've done this every single day for the last three months, and I never run out of things to say because he's literally perfect. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss him because 12 hours feels like eternity. So of course I always have pictures of him that I can look at. Unfortunately, this is basically torture, so I do get emotional every time. Of course, I kiss each picture one by one, hoping that he could somehow feel it while he's working. Since I'm in here for 12 hours, I typically finish a gallon of water, so whenever I have to use the bathroom, I just use the empty jug. He works at McDonald's, but apparently there's a rule where girlfriends aren't allowed to order food there, so he always takes his lunch break with his co workers, and I just eat whatever I can find in his car. Today I was able to enjoy some Takis and a cough drop. Honestly, I don't even get hungry because I only like to eat when I'm with him. Every hour feels like a lifetime, so I always end up iffing one of his t shirts. That way I could feel close to him. Obviously, that's not enough, so I sprayed his Cologne all over the stuffed animal. That way I have somebody to snuggle. I always look at our videos together and start sobbing, but this is my reaction to when he finally got off work.

My dad is black and my mom is white. I look really black, while my older sister Kate looks more white. This one feature has affected my entire life. You see, despite my dad being black, he has extreme colorism against black people, while my mom is just straight up racist. Her. My dad is the only exception. Me and Kate are only two years apart, but growing up, our experiences were very different. Every birthday of hers was celebrated not only with a cake, but also huge birthday blowouts every day for her entire birth week. Meanwhile, my birthday was just another day in the year. However, instead of soaking up all the attention and hating me as much as our parents did, it would always be kind to me when they weren't looking. On my ninth birthday, Kate knew our parents wouldn't do anything for me, so she asked them if she could celebrate her birthday on my day. Of course, they said yes, and when the day came, she let me choose who to invite. When it was time for the cake, Kate distracted my parents and brought them into another room so everyone could sing Happy Birthday for me. It was one of the happiest days of my life. Another time, when we got our report cards and she got all C's while I got b's. She knew my parents would likely wail on me for not getting A's, so While they were reading my report card, she begged them not to hurt me because she didn't like violence. So they ended up just pinching me a few times. So even though my parents basically saw me as a cotton picker, as they called me, I still felt lucky because Kate was always there. Until one day when she turned her back on me. It was her 17th birthday. I woke up to the sound of not just my mom, not just my dad, but my entire family throwing all of my belongings into boxes. Sister said all she wants for her birthday is her own room. Sorry is the first thing my dad said. When I asked what was going on, my eyes widened, and I asked them where I was supposed to go because there were no other rooms in the house. My mom chimed in, I don't know. You have phone numbers of friends and family. Figure it out. Darky tears filled my eyes, and I looked over at Kate, who refused to make eye contact with me. Her entire body was tense. It took almost half an hour of convincing before I finally believed it wasn't some weird prank. I immediately started to howl with a deep sadness because the one thing I was holding on to, the one ally I had in the house, abandoned me. And even as I curled into a ball and started to rock back and forth with a loneliness that I can't describe with words. They ignored me, just kept packing. By this point, my flight, or fight, kicked in. I numbed my emotions for walking out and calling the only other family member I trusted, my aunt on my dad's side. After Kate's betrayal, I had no idea what she'd say, but she immediately said I could come over and stay for as long as I needed. I didn't eat breakfast that morning. Didn't even give Kate her gift. Just took the boxes, ordered an Uber and left. But on the way there, Kate called me. I was filled with hate as I saw her name pop up on the screen, but picked up anyway. I'm so sorry. Please don't hate me. My eyebrows furrowed and I went completely silent. Are you alone right now? She asked. I told her yes. Kate didn't say anything else. She just turned on Facetime and showed me a pregnancy test with two pink lines. It was hers. I gasped. Lily, I'm pregnant. I don't want to tell mom and dad yet because, well, you know how they can be. But I don't want you to be home when they find out. I thought back to the time when Kate came home with a hickey. My parents shouted at me for almost an hour, telling me how bad of an influence I was, how it was all my fault. So I understood Kate. What can I do to help? I asked. She told Me to ask for her help from our Aunt Bonnie. Suddenly, I could hear my parents walking up the stairs, singing Happy Birthday, so I hung up. My mind was spinning. A part of me was relieved that Kate was still my best friend, but mostly I was just worried. Very worried. And when I got to my Aunt Bonnie's, my stomach twisted into a pretzel knot, because she opened the door, gave me a huge smile, and hugged me super tight. I'm so happy you visited. Never told her what had happened, and clearly my parents didn't either. We were in the middle of polite, introductory small talk when I just blurted it out. My parents are racist, and my sister is pregnant. The second I said it, she laughed, thinking it was some sort of joke, and that's when I started bawling my eyes out. By this point, we had already taken in the boxes, so we went inside and she listened while I talked. I made her promise not to tell my parents. She swore she wouldn't. The next hour consisted of me completely unloading everything. The racism, the favoritism, getting kicked out. She promised I would be safe with her and held me while I cried myself to sleep. I didn't know it at the time, but Aunt Bonnie was about to make my parents pay. Me and Kate's lives were about to change forever. The rest of the full story is on my channel and Linked below.

For not telling my boyfriend I could understand his language this whole time. I have been dating Andrew for about eight months now, and I'm in a situation that's making me question everything. When I met Andrew, he mentioned early in our conversation that he was born in Mexico but moved to the US when he was 12. I was immediately interested because I love practicing my languages. But for some reason, I hesitated to mention I spoke Spanish. It wasn't a deliberate choice at first. The topic just shifted, and then the moment passed. On our first date, he got a call from his mom and spoke to her in Spanish. When he hung up, he apologized and explained that he always speaks Spanish with family. I almost told him then that I understood everything, but he looked so comfortable having this private connection to his heritage that I didn't want to take that away from him. So I just smiled and said it was no problem at all. Looking back, this was my first mistake. As we continued dating, it became this weird, unspoken thing. The longer I went without mentioning it, the more awkward it felt to bring up. Hey, by the way, I've understood everything you've been saying to your family for the past three months isn't exactly casual conversation, so I just didn't say anything. At first. It was innocent enough. When his mom would call, he'd speak Spanish and give me a summarized Version. Afterward, I'd nod along even though I understood his mom asking if I was the kind of girl he could bring home and him saying I was different from the others in a good way. It actually made me feel special hearing how he talked about me when he thought I couldn't understand. But about two months ago, things started getting weird. Andrew's cousin Manuel moved in with him temporarily while looking for a job. And suddenly I was hearing a lot more Spanish conversations. And they weren't always flattering. One night, while I was making dinner in Andrew's kitchen, I overheard him and Manuel talking in the living room. Manuel asked when Andrew was going to get serious about finding a real partner instead of wasting time with white girls who don't understand our culture. Andrew didn't defend me. Instead, he said something like, it's not serious with Gianna. She's fun for now, but obviously I'll end up with someone my parents approve of eventually. I nearly dropped the spatula I was holding. We had talked about meeting each other's parents just the week before. He told me in English he was excited for me to meet his family. The disconnect between his English persona and Spanish persona was jarring. After that, I started paying closer attention. When his sister visited and asked in Spanish if I was as boring in bed as I looked, Andrew laughed and said, definitely not, but I'll tell you about it later. When his mom called and asked if I was still too skinny, he agreed and said he was working on getting me to eat more. The final draw came last weekend. We were at a restaurant with Manuel and Andrew's friend Diego. While I was in the bathroom, apparently, Diego asked if Andrew was planning to bring me to his cousin's wedding next month. When I returned to the table, Andrew and his friends switched from Spanish to English so smoothly. I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't caught the tail end of Andrew's response. She's just a placeholder until I move back home. My parents would disown me if I brought home someone who doesn't speak Spanish and doesn't understand our traditions. For eight months, I've been falling in love with someone who saw me as temporary, as less than the placeholder, all because he assumed I couldn't understand what he was saying behind my back. I excused myself, saying I suddenly felt sick, which wasn't a lie, and took an Uber home. Andrew texted me all night asking if I was okay, if he should come over, if I needed anything. I didn't respond until the next morning, when I asked him to meet me at a coffee shop near my apartment. When we sat down, I started the

What the fuck are you talking about? Like, I don't know if you knew this, but we are having a conversation. Talking back to each other is how this whole thing works. And if you ask me if I understand, and I hit you with the yes, and then you hit me back with the no, you don't, why the fuck are you even asking me then? And I cannot stand when they tell me to watch my tone. Like, hey, dumbass, all I said was okay! In a monotone voice. Y'all ever be doing something? your parents ask you to do the thing that you're already doing, and it's like, I don't wanna do this shit no more. Now you'll forget to do the simplest thing, like just Taking out the trash, and here comes your mom talking about some, oh, I guess I'm a bad mother. Nobody cares about me. And it's like, motherfucker, what? Nobody said that.

When my son was 8, he begged me for a dog every single day. I was exhausted. Single mom, two jobs, just trying to stay afloat. I didn't have the time, energy, or money to entertain the idea. One night, half joking and fully fed up, I snapped and said, fine, if you can save up $500 to cover the first year of expenses, I'll get you a dog. I figured he'd forget about it in a week. He didn't. This kid got to work immediately. Started collecting soda cans from neighbor's recycling bins. Old his Pokemon cards. Did every odd chore he could find for a dollar here, $2 there. Every few weeks, he'd dump his piggy bank on my bed and count his money out loud. 40 sevens, $52 63. At first, I thought it was cute. He'd wake up early on weekends to search the park for bottles. Made flyers asking if neighbors had any small jobs. I started to feel a little guilty. Other kids were spending their allowance does on candy and video games. My son was saving every single penny. Honey, I said once, you sure you don't want to spend a little? Maybe buy yourself a cool toy? He shook his head. I want a dog more than anything, mom. His dedication was next level. At the school book fair, while other kids were excitedly buying new books, he just walked around with His hands in his pockets. When Halloween came, instead of using his allowance on candy, he trick or treated and then sold half of his candy at school the next week. By winter, he had $287. Started going to the library and researching breeds. He'd show me printouts of dogs that were apartment friendly, low, shedding, calm. Look, mom, this one doesn't bark much. When spring hit, he had $398. Then came the garage sale. He sold half his toys, action figures. He loved his old bike, even clothes that still fit him. Kids at school called him weird for never buying anything fun. He didn't care. When his birthday came, he asked grandma for money instead of gifts. When she still gave him toys, he politely asked if she had the receipts. Wasn't just about the dog anymore. You could see it in his eyes. This was his mission. Every Tuesday and Thursday, he'd walk Missus Johnson's poodle. On weekends, the Millers paid him to take their golden retriever around the block. He kept a notebook, logging every dollar. Drew little cartoon dogs next to his savings milestones. By the time he turned 10, it had been nearly two years. Other parents started asking how I kept him so motivated. I didn't have an answer. Honestly, I was starting to worry. But then I'd see him lying in bed at night, whispering dog names to himself, rehearsing training commands, petting a stuffed animal. Like practice. And I knew this Wasn't just about a pet. It was about proving he could do something hard. Something grown up, something real. And then one day, two full years later, he came bursting into my room, holding a Mason jar stuffed with bills and coins. Mom, I did it. I counted it three times. $500. My heart dropped. That same week, we just been evicted. I'd lost one of my jobs. We were living in my sister's basement. Everything felt like it was falling apart. The last thing we could afford was a dog. But I looked at his face. Pure joy, glowing pride. And I couldn't do it. I couldn't crush that. So that weekend, we went to the shelter. He picked out a small mutt named Buster. Scrawny little.

I wanted to say from the beginning that I have never touched or hurt a child and never will. Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons. How it all began was when I was around 15 or so. I started to become attracted to girls around me. I went into puberty very late. As I grew older, instead of my attractions growing in accordance with my age, they never moved, which lead me to continually being attracted to girls of that age. When I was a minor, it wasn't such a big issue, but when I became an adult, it was when I turned 19, I made the decision to essentially become a recluse. I did not want to hurt anyone, but there were many emotions fighting inside of me. I had urges that I had little control of, and it was a mission every day to avoid following through on them. It came to a head one day when I was speaking to the daughter of a friend, and the urges almost overwhelmed me. I almost broke. This was the point when I shut myself away. I would only go out when I knew that children were at school or wouldn't be on the street after dark. I avoided media involving children. I avoided books involving children. Most days I wouldn't go out at all, only going out after dark, if at all. I took jobs. Where I could work night shift so that I didn't have to have any contact with children. This made my life absolute hell. I became a nervous wreck. I would get anxiety if anyone came to the door, in case it was a child. I still worked, but my performance was poor. This often LED to me being fired or disciplined. No one else knew what I was going through. By necessity, it was something I had to endure alone. Around seven years ago, I found a psychologist. It had gotten to be too much, and I had to speak with someone about it. Over the course of the next six months, we discovered that my intimate feelings were brought about by my being sexually abused at a young age. When it was happening, it was frequent and often violent. As it turns out, I have repressed most of it. I didn't know how bad it actually was. However, discovering this lead to that revelation. Over the course of three years of twice weekly treatments, my feelings towards minors began to fade. Slowly but surely, I started to get better. I owe my psychologist my life, literally. I was at the point of suicide before I started seeing him. Now, seven years on, I have no attraction towards minors. I have a much more normal life. I can actually go out during the day without being anxious. I can talk to children with no urges. I am mostly normal. I Am still dealing with the repercussions of my dark times. But the dark times themselves are over. I'm married, and I have a baby boy on the way. The process of getting treatment is so freeing, I can't even describe it. Now, my psychologist is the one who suggested writing this out. He thinks it will help with my healing process. I hope it will. Thanks for listening.

What was that? Oh, hey, what's up, Justin? How are you? This is Jubilee from brick and Jubilee in the morning. Excuse me? Yeah. Jubel from brick and Jubel in the morning. You familiar? Claire? Who? What's going on? Claire? Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, Claire's still there. Justin? Justin, this is Brooke and Jubilee in the morning. It's a radio show, and we do a segment called The Awkward Tuesday Phone calls, where if you want to confront somebody about a difficult issue or you just have kind of an awkward conversation, you can email the show, and we'll give you some advice on how to handle the conversation, as long as you make a very awkward phone call. And that's why we're on the phone now, is Claire wanted to call you and ask why you ditched her on your wedding day on our show. Claire, I'm on the radio. Who cares about that? Did you just say her dad, he wrote you a check for 80 grand? Yeah. Why? Would he do that? What? Why? And you took it? My dad would never do something like that. Okay, I don't believe that. He did. Give us a reason. Give us something. Look, I wasn't going to take it. I tried to say no, but he made me promise. And, you know, I've never had $80,000 before. I couldn't turn him down. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, my god. So you are telling me that you didn't marry me for $80,000? I'm worth $80,000 to you? I mean, no, no, it's not. It's wasn't about that. It's that your dad convinced me. He. He talked me into it. He said it was the right thing to do, you know, so I. I figured, you know, maybe he. He's right. So I took the money. It's the right thing to do. To leave his daughter literally minutes before you're supposed to get married in exchange for $80,000? Look, it was a tough choice. It was a tough decision to make, but, you know, what was I supposed to do? Marry her?

My sister has always had a troublesome personality since she was little, she was expelled from daycares, received complaints at school, and couldn't finish high school because she basically didn't attend even 20% of the classes. My mother sent her to school every day, but she would hang out with older friends from another school and would skip without my mother knowing. However, despite all these things, it was always clear that my sister was my parents favorite. Even when she took my things to sell and buy sweets, my parents would simply say that I should tolerate it because she was my younger sister and just being playful. They didn't complain when she got expelled, didn't complain when she was detained for various reasons or for anything else. On the other hand, I was not allowed to have a cell phone, couldn't go out with friends, and my routine from ages 12 to 17 was from school, in addition to working to pay the fines my sister incurred. However, ever since I started working, I always saved the money left over after paying the fines in a bank account my uncle set up for me. Every cent. My parents didn't allow me to spend my own money on myself to have more left for my sister, so I always did it in secret. At 19, I had finally Saved enough to make a down payment on an apartment and finally move out of my parents house. When I announced this to them, they were confused about how I had so much money and said that if I had really saved it in secret, I should be ashamed and give it to my sister. This obviously LED to an argument, with me saying that I owed her nothing and my parents saying they were giving me an order and I had no choice. This was at night, so I told them it wasn't going to happen and that I would leave the next day. However, the next day I realized that no one was there. I didn't care. It's not like I wanted to say goodbye to them. But when I checked my bank account, I saw what had happened. I'm a heavy sleeper and someone used my fingerprint while I was asleep to withdraw my money. I called my parents in desperation, telling them what had happened, and they said they already knew and that it was my sister who had done it and now they were having breakfast at a fancy place in the city. Since I had actually saved up a good amount of money, I didn't say anything. I couldn't react. I just hung up, grabbed my bike and went straight to the police station, reporting everything. I already knew that it was one of my relatives who had done it, so I recorded the Call so they couldn't deny it in court. My parents were able to post bail since they were considered only as accomplices while my sister was arrested. I managed to recover the money, moved out, and cut off contact with my family for the past few years. However, a few days ago in the morning, I received several messages from numbers I didn't recognize, but after responding to some, I figured out who they were. It was my family. They were saying that my sister had been released from jail, and now that she was out, she was coming to my house for a conversation. I thought she might apologize or something, so I agreed and waited. When she arrived, she hugged me, asked how I was, and asked to come in. And of course, I let her. Now comes the worst part. She talked about how she had forgiven me for reporting her, that she no longer held any grudges, and that I shouldn't worry about it. I didn't understand why she thought I was worried about that, since she was the guilty one, not me. After that, she said she just hoped that I would return the money she had taken, because to get Protection in prison, she had promised to give the money she had taken from me, roughly $50,000, to the people who protected her. I told her it wasn't possible because I had already spent that money on my apartment. At this point, she snapped. She said it wasn't fair, that she had worked hard to get that money and that I should come up with it by the end of the month or she would sell everything. I have to recover it. My parents, of course, supported her and said that since she had already taken the money, it was hers. I've already called the police and reported everything in case something happens to me. But honestly, I don't know what to do.

My chemistry teacher, Mr. Davidson, was absolutely convinced that I was building bombs in his classroom. He just finished some school safety seminar about dangerous students and decided I was his prime suspect. Why? Because I actually paid attention and asked questions about chemical reaction. It started when I asked why sodium explodes in water during our alkaline metals unit. I'd watched YouTube videos about it and was genuinely curious about the electron transfer process. Mr. Davidson's eyes narrowed. Why do you want to know about explosions, Jake? Because that's what we're studying, I replied, confused. He pulled me aside after class. I'm watching you. Kids who ask too many questions about dangerous reactions are usually planning something. The next week during our acids and bases lab, I mixed the solutions exactly as instructed. My started fizzing more than others because I'd measured precisely while my lab partner had eyeballed everything. Jake! Mr. Davidson shouted across the room, step away from your station immediately! The entire class turned to stare as he rushed over in a panic, knocking over someone's notebook. What did you add to that mixture? He demanded. Just the hydrochloric acid and sodium bicarbonate, like the instructions said. I stand. That's way too much reaction. You're trying to create a dangerous situation. He confiscated my lab sheet and gave me a zero for reckless experimentation. The reaction was literally just making salt water and carbon dioxide the same Thing that happens when you mix baking soda and vinegar. Words spread fast. Other teachers started eyeing me suspiciously in the hallways. The principal called me in for a chat about lab safety. My parents got a phone call about my concerning interest in dangerous chemical. Things escalated when we studied organic chemistry. I mentioned that I've been reading about how aspirin is synthesized because I wanted to understand how medicines work. Mr. Davidson went pale. You're researching drug synthesis at home? It's just aspirin, I said. I want to be a pharmacist. That's what they all say, he muttered, making a note in his grade book. The breaking point came during our final exam. One question asked about the chemical equation for photosynthesis. I wrote the standard equation, then added a note explaining how the light dependent reactions work because I'd studied ahead. When he returned the exams, mine had an F with see. Me immediately scrolled across it. This level of detail isn't normal for a high school student, he said, waving my paper. Where did you really get this information? From the college textbook my sister gave me, I replied. I like chemistry. Nobody likes chemistry as much unless they're planning something dangerous. I'm recommending you for a disciplinary review. That afternoon, I sat in the principal's office with my parents while Mr. Davidson presented his evidence, my lab reports, my test answers, and a list of my questions from class. Jake has shown an unusual interest. In explosive reactions, drug synthesis

My sister always had a history of selfishness. When we were kids, she would take my toys, cry when I received something, even if she got something too, and she would even secretly take my money, among other things. My dad and mom would scold her, but my mom had a kind heart and would ultimately forgive her and let her go unpunished. There was only one thing in the world that my mom would not forgive, stating that anyone who did it would be removed from the inheritance. Any form of betrayal. According to my mom, my grandfather's betrayal to my grandmother had ruined her life for a long time, and it was simply unforgivable in her eyes. Fast forward to the present. I have been dating my girlfriend for about two years. Surprisingly, my girlfriend and my sister always got along very well, which was strange to me since my sister and I barely spoke to each other. They would hang out together, go shopping, travel, and do all sorts of activities together. Recently, my girlfriend started acting strangely after a trip with my sister. She had distanced herself from me for a while, and to be honest, it was clear that she was about to break up with me. However, I had already accepted that and thought it would be the end. Of it. But I was wrong. One day I woke up to her alarm, and when I tried to wake her up to turn it off, she just said she was taking the day off and asked me to silence the alarm. I got up, picked up her phone and was about to turn off the alarm. However, I saw a message from my sister in the notifications, where she said she couldn't wait to put the plan into action. I admit I acted wrongly, but I was curious and thought they were planning some surprise for me or an interesting trip, so I decided to check. However, when I opened the conversation, I was shocked. There were hours and hours of detailed conversations outlining a plan to falsely accuse me of infidelity, causing me to lose my inheritance. My sister would take control of the inheritance and give 25% to my girlfriend later. They talked about me in the messages as if I were insignificant, as if I deserved it, as if I had done something wrong. I took screenshots of everything, sent them to my phone, deleted the messages, put the phone back where it was and laid down. But I couldn't sleep. In the messages, they plan to reveal my alleged infidelity at my mother's birthday dinner the next day. I knew exactly what the two of them would say. I knew they had hired someone to create fake images of me with other women in public. I knew they had hired someone to call my mother and pretend to be my lover, among other things. I decided to let them proceed with the plan and document everything that happened. I knew my dad would believe me because he knew I would never do something like that. I plan to record everything that occurred.

Now that I'm about to have my daughter, she comes back and says it's my obligation to name my daughter after her as a tribute. My dad passed away way too soon. He was a truck driver, and one day he had an accident. It was really sad for me, especially since my relationship with my mom was already bad. At that time, she was cheating on my dad, and I knew about it. One of the reasons my dad worked so much was because he wanted to save enough money to buy a house for the two of us so he could divorce her. Technically, the house we were living in was hers. She never really cared to hide her affair, and I often saw her bring her boyfriend home. After my dad passed, that guy became my stepdad. At first, he tried to act like he was cool with me, and honestly, I talked to him normally because I didn't have much choice. I figured if I had to live with him, we could at least try to get along. But that didn't last long. Little by little, he started telling my mom that he didn't want to raise a kid that wasn't his, and so on. I saw it all because they argue about it right in front of Me. Even though my relationship with my mom wasn't great, I never thought she'd actually kick me out. Well, I was wrong. One day, we had an argument because she had taken the money I was saving and gave it to my stepdad. I called her out on it, and that's when she told me I was useless, that she didn't want me in the house anymore, and that I was just a bad reminder of my dad. She said she didn't even understand why I was still there. I thought she was just saying that because she was mad, but no. The next day, my clothes were thrown out of the house, and when I tried to go inside, my stepdad blocked the door and told me I didn't live there anymore. I called a friend, desperate, and he let me stay at his place for a while. After that, I moved to my grandma's house. At first, she wasn't exactly thrilled about having to raise me, either, but it was definitely better than living with my mom and stepdad. Little by little, we got to know each other better, and she really became like a mom to me. From there, I finished high school, went to college, dated, got married, and now I'm finally about to have my daughter. I told my grandma the news, since we talk almost every day, even though I live far away now. Apparently, she told my mom because the next day, my Mom called me to talk about it.

I remember being maybe 10 years old at Thanksgiving when my uncle got a little drunk and started saying something about Jeffrey being the real victim. And my grandma literally slammed her hand on the table and told him to shut up. That's how taboo Jeffrey was in our family. For years, I just accepted that Jeffrey was this mythical black sheep who did something so terrible that he basically got erased from the family. I'd overhear snippets like he betrayed us or after what he did to Samuel, but never the full story. My mom would just say he made bad choices and we shouldn't end up like him. Fast forward to last summer when my grandma had a minor fall. She's fine, DW. But it scared all of us enough that we decided someone should stay with her for a while. I volunteered, since I was between Lisa's anyway. So I'm helping her organize some stuff in her spare bedroom, and I find this photo album I've never seen before. Not hidden or anything dramatic, just on a shelf with a bunch of other random crap. I start flipping through it, and there's this guy in tons of photos with my mom and her siblings when they were teenagers. He looked maybe a little older than them, and nobody ever mentioned him to me. I asked my grandma who he was, and she got this Weird look on her face and was like, that's your cousin Jeffrey. Super quietly, like she didn't even want to say his name out loud. Then she took the album from me and said we should finish cleaning another day. I couldn't stop thinking about it, tbh. why was this dude in all these family photos if he was so terrible? He looked normal, always smiling, arm around my mom in some pics, not like some evil person. So I started asking questions. Big mistake, apparently. My mom completely shut down when I asked, told me it wasn't my business and to respect my grandma's feelings. My dad claimed he didn't know much, but I could tell he was lying. None of my answers or uncles would talk, except for my aunt Valentina, who was always the family rebel. Valentina agreed to meet me for lunch, but made me promise not to tell anyone we talked. According to Valentina, Jeffrey wasn't actually a bad person at all. He was my mom's cousin, and he lived with my grandparents for a few years as a teenager because his parents had died. Valentina said Jeffrey was super smart and went to college on a full scholarship, which was a big deal for our family back then. The way she described him was completely different from the family villain I'd imagined. She said he was funny and kind, always standing up for her when my grandfather was being strict. She actually started Crying when she talked about him, saying she missed him every day and it wasn't fair. What happened? When I asked what actually happened why he was cast out, she got all panicky and said she shouldn't have met me. She literally threw money on the table for her food and left. Just walked out mid conversation. I tried calling her later but she didn't pick up, then texted me saying she was sorry but couldn't talk about it anymore. Obviously. This made me even more curious. I did some hardcore internet stalking and eventually found a Jeffrey who matched the right age and hometown on social media. I wasn't 100% sure it was him, but the guy had the same smile from those old photos. I debated for like 2 weeks before sending him a message. Super casual, just asking if he was related to my family. He responded the same day, asked which branch of the family I was from, and when I told him he immediately wanted to video chat. I was kind of scared but also dying to know what happened, so I agreed. The moment we connected I knew it was him. Older version of the guy in those photos, same eyes as my mom. Definitely family. He looks so emotional seeing me. Said I looked just like my mom when she was young. Jeffrey asked a ton of questions about everyone like he was genuinely interested in how they were doing despite everything. When I finally asked why everyone pretended he didn't exist. He got really quiet. He asked if I really wanted to know. Said it might change how I see my entire family. I said yes. The story he told me was nothing like I expected. Turns out my grandfather, Sam

My dead sister taught me this. She said, if you want the ability of reading minds, you have to play the game mirror man. Here are the rules. No. 1. Exactly at midnight, cover all the mirrors in your home, but leave the one you like the most uncovered. Number two. Now, at 2 a m, take a candle and sit in front of that mirror and repeat this. Mirror man, I want to play. If the candle lights up, that means the game has started. For the next three hours, you will hunted by the mirror man. Remember, he cannot enter in this world. He will hunt you through the reflection of the real world. Number three. Do not hide in one place for more than 10 minutes. Keep moving or else he will find you. No. 4. If you hear footsteps, don't dare to check it out. If you hear a familiar voice calling out your name, run away immediately. That is not someone you know. No. 5. If somehow you lasted three hours without being hunted, congratulations. You have won the game. Now take a glass of water and go to where you started the game and say, I won. You are late. It is time to end this game of fate and throw the water on the mirror. If you hear a loud scream, that means the game is ended. And now you have the ability. Of reading minds. But remember, if you tried to end the game even a minute before or after the 3 hours time period. I'm sorry. The mirror man will skin you alive. My sister died this way. So good luck.

There was this kid at my school named Reggie who always got stuck with the worst group projects. He was quiet, pretty heavy, and got super nervous talking in front of people. But what really sucked was that teachers always put him with the kids who didn't want to do any work. This one semester in our American history class, Missus Patterson assigned this huge project about the Civil War worth, like, 30% of our grade. And guess who got stuck together? Reggie and these three kids. Ashley, Connor, and Blake, who literally never did anything in class except scroll TikTok. I sat behind them, so I heard everything the first day they met. Ashley goes, okay, Reggie, you're, like, really good at this stuff, so you can just handle it. Connor laughed and added, yeah, we'll help present or whatever. Blake didn't even look up from his phone. Reggie tried to speak up, but guys, it's supposed to be a group thing. We each need to do a section. Ashley rolled her eyes so hard, I thought they fall out. Look, we all know you're gonna end up doing it anyway. Save us the trouble. They started calling him try hard Reggie behind his back. I'd hear them in the hallways making jokes about how he probably stayed up all night color coding his notes, which, knowing Reggie, he probably did every week for three weeks. Reggie would ask them to meet Up every week, they'd have some excuse. Ashley had cheer practice. Connor had to work at his dad's shop. Blake was just straight up like, nah, I'm good. So Reggie did everything. Ate all the slides, wrote the entire script, even edited this whole video presentation with music and everything. I know because he stayed after school every day working on it in the computer lab. The night before it was due, I saw him in there at, like, 7 p m, still working. His mom came to pick him up, and she looked worried. Honey, where's your group? She asked. Reggie just shrugged and said, they're busy. Presentation day comes around, missus Patterson calls their group up first. Ashley, Connor, and Blake walk up there, all confident they own the place. Reggie followed behind, carrying his laptop and looking nervous as always. They start presenting, and honestly, it was really good. Reggie had done an amazing job. But here's where it gets messed up. When Missus Patterson asked who did what? Ashley jumps in first, I handled all the research on the battles. Connor goes, yeah, and I wrote most of the script. Blake nods along. I did the video editing. Then Missus Patterson looks at Reggie. And what was your contribution? Before Reggie could answer, Ashley cuts him off. He helped with some of the formatting. Some of the formatting? I wanted to scream, Missus Patterson wrote down their contributions and gave them all A's. Reggie got The same grade. But you could see on his face that something inside him had broken. The next day, Reggie walked into class carrying this thick Manila folder. He went straight to Missus Patterson's desk and said, can I talk to you after class? During lunch, I saw him in her classroom through the window.

I don't, I don't think. It doesn't sound like it. No, I took over real fast. Trust me, I, I, I even sent some of the groomsmen to our place. I sent people to his parents place. I mean, I called them nearby hospitals. Like, I mean, I got crazy. So where. Wait, was his car there or did he leave? So the car was still there. But it's our car. It's our shared car. So finally, no one ever hears from him with, like, I gave up the search. Everybody gives up. And I finally get a text a few hours later that just says, I'm sorry, I can't do this. What? Wow. So you got, what, ditched at the altar? Basically. Sorry if that sounds insensitive, but we didn't even make it to the altar. That was the sad part. We didn't even make it to the altar. So wait, you're just, like, sitting around a big room that was supposed to be your reception, all that's filled with flowers and, like, the foods there, and he just texted you? He didn't even tell you this in person? No. And that was. That was the text? That's it. He just said, I'm sorry, I can't do this. It was like, I was too shocked to cry. I think I just stood there and almost fainted. Oh, my god. And so, um, I have not heard from him since. Oh, my god. What? That's crazy. What? I hate this dude. I am sorry. Yeah. Um, what did you do? So after I got the text, I responded right back, and he never wrote back to me ever again. And so I contacted family, friends, anybody I can think of that would have an answer. No one's heard from him or seen him. So he just took off? Like, on everybody? On everybody. His parents, I mean, they keep in touch with him, but he never tells them where he is or where he's living. It's weird. Oh, my gosh. Oh, Jesus. But fast forward. Today. I hired a private investigator. Really? Yeah. I just. I can't let it go. I don't think any woman could. Well, yeah, I mean, I don't want to find the person. Like, if they just took off and skipped out on their family and friends and you at the. At your wedding, I want to know what happened. I'd want to do. I don't know. I'd want to do something bad. You'd hire a hitman, bro. Oh, my gosh. What did you find? So I found out that he moved out of state. Whoa. He obviously has a brand new phone number. The investigator found his new number, and he gave me that number. Oh, whoa. So basically, I really need your help because I wanna confront him, and I. I don't know how, and I kind of need moral support to do so because I'm. I'm scared. I'm scared of What I'll find. I'm scared of how he's gonna react though. Jubal, you're right. This is juicy.

I, we could have eaten twigs. It doesn't matter. We were talking about our families and what we want out of life. No. Oh, see, here we go. Someone that. You're just like our family. We were just talking about your family and how amazing. Here's another thing. In this phone call, if you rewind all this, you will hear Emma say amazing about 400 times. She says it a lot.

And then I found out more evidence when I was doing his laundry. Oh, no. Okay. What. What evidence did you find in the laundry? Like, a little lipstick on the collar, perhaps? No. Um. Oh, my god, this is so awkward. Uh. Oh. Say there was another kind of game, and, um, it was not on his collar. Oh, god.

So, Kim was explaining to us that you guys got to know each other a few weeks ago while hanging out with some friends, correct? Yeah, that's correct. Okay. She also explained that you guys got along pretty well right away. She said your personalities kind of clicked. Is that also fair to say? Yeah, that's fair to say. Okay, um, well, so what's up with the relationship there, James? Are you. I'm gonna call you out. You got right into it. Yep. Are you in a relationship with somebody right now? Um, no. You're not? No, I'm not. So you're single? Yes, I am single. Okay, so we have that part figured out. So if you're single and you clicked with Kim, why haven't you reached out for another hang of any kind? Like, are you not interested? Alright. Oh, no, man, I'm very interested. She was great, uh, but apparently she got back with her ex. That's what I was told anyway. Who told you that? Uh, her friend Danielle told me that. In fact, it was Danielle who tried to set us up in the first place, so. Alright, well, first of all, she never got back with her ex, so that's a lie. And second, she was told that you were in a relationship by the very same person, Danielle. And that person, by the way, that's the person we are now bringing up. On what line? Um, okay, so on line three, we Have. Danielle. Good morning, Danielle. Good morning. So I know you've have no idea what's been going on, and we. We've been asking you to hold for a few minutes because we have not filled you in as of yet. So I appreciate your patience. So let me kind of give you a little background here. We have your girlfriend Kim on the line with us. Kim, say hi. Hey. Okay, so Kim was telling us that you tried to set her up with this James guy, and he was pretty cool, but I guess he was in a relationship and he didn't tell anybody? Uh, yeah. I mean, I guess either he didn't know it was a date type scenario, or he did know, but he was just kind of like keeping his relationship on the down low. Maybe. Okay, well, let's hear from James himself. James, is any of that true? No, that's totally not true at all. I knew it was a date. I have no relationship. You don't? No, I don't. Oh, um, my bad. I mean, I thought my husband said he did. I don't know why he would have said that. I told him I like him a lot, so. Yeah. And why did you tell Dave that I got back with my ex? I never said that. Yes, you did. You told me I should leave her alone cause she got back with her ex. You specifically said that. Danielle, is there a Reason why you tried to set them up. And then it seems like you tried to break them up right after. Cause that's. To me, that's what it seems like you did here. No, I just think that. Kim, you need to call me so we can talk. No, like, I. We could talk right now, while we're all here. I'm tired of this whole like he said, she said game. I want to know the truth. I know, but it would be better if we talked by ourselves. Why? So James can't hear what you're gonna say about him behind his back. That's pretty crappy, Daniel. Fine. You know, I was trying to be nice about it, but since you're gonna make me do it. If we found out that James is a registered sex offender and try to date a high school girl, and that's why he moved back here. So there it is. Kim, you wanted the truth. I try to do everything discreetly, but that's the real, honest truth. Oh, snap. Uh, James, did you want to say anything in your defense here, or. Okay, so I guess that's a no. Um, so, Danielle, you. You found this stuff out about James when? About a week after our double date. So I told him to back off cause she got back with her ex. Right? And I didn't want him to know. I originally felt horrible, you know, I had no idea about his past. Yeah, And then someone approached my husband, and we looked it up online, and the whole story was there. You know, mug shot and everything. I see. Okay. And, Kim, I mean, not now. Now that you've heard this, how are you feeling? Honestly, I'm completely disgusted. And, Daniel, I'm so sorry. Like, I feel terrible. Well, listen, at least now you know the truth. You know? And, you know, trust your friends. I guess sometimes, even when they're lying to you, still trust them.

Hi. I was, um, calling to speak to Kate, please. Max, who's calling? Uh, this is Natalia. This is Kate. Hi. So, listen, I wanted to call you because I didn't want to start any drama or anything, but I wanted you to know that your husband David, asked me to join him for dinner. And I asked him, you know, hello, aren't you married? And he said, I'm in a marriage, but we're not exclusive to each other anymore. And I have to be honest, that whole thing just sounded kind of weird and fishy to me. So I just wanted to call you, just so you know what's going on, because I. Okay, hold on. Um, so my husband told you we weren't married anymore? No, no, no. He said that you were married, but it was an open marriage, I guess. Oh, well, that's really interesting. Hmm. Okay, so it's not an open marriage? No, it's not. It's nowhere close to being open. Oh, shit. Well, that's. Well, I'm seven months pregnant. I wouldn't open my marriage. Oh, wow. Okay, well, that's what I thought. Listen, I just wanted to make sure you knew what was going on, cause it was just all fishy. Yeah, uh, it is fishy. What did you say your name was again? Um, actually, Kate. This is actually the Z Morning Z radio show on Z1O4. We're. We're right in the middle of something called dirty work Wednesday right now, so. This is a prank. No, no, no, no. It's not a prank. Um, we got a call from a girl who had a lot more than dinner with your husband, but all under the impression that he was in an open marriage, which he lied about. Oh, when did this happen? This is ridiculous. Um, this happened at his company retreat in Williamsburg. Oh, okay, great. So that's why he said spouses can't come. I'm gonna kill him. We just got off the phone with him a minute ago. We can call him back right now if you want to confront him with all this. But you said this is on the radio. Yeah. Oh, I don't think you want to hear what I'm about to say on the radio. What? I mean, listen, we can bleep it all out. We. We have a thing called the bleep button. Um, hang on one second. Let me call him back real quick. Hello? Hey, David, uh, it's Jack. Carlo. I just called you a few minutes ago. Um, I got your wife on with us. I guess there was a little bit more info we needed for your policy. It has to do with your marital status. Okay, so it says here that you're married to Kate. Uh, but a couple of weekends ago, you told a girl at your work that you were in an open marriage, like, right before you slept with her. So how does that work? David? Are you still there? Uh, so do you want to explain to me exactly when we decided to have an open marriage? David sleep with this girl a couple weekends ago? Is that why you came back and wanted to lick my ass? Oh, haha. Nope. Okay, uh, I'm not sure that qualifies as an explanation. So, Kate, you had no idea he was telling women this? No, but I want to speak to the lady who told me that she just slept with my husband. Oh, my god. No, no, no, no. What? No, I did not sleep with him. It wasn't me. No, no, it wasn't Natalia. Um, I'll tell you what. Stay on the line. We'll get all this sorted out for you. Okay, hang. Hang on the line for a second. But, yeah, it was that thing. Okay, hang on. I love your. I love your response. No, it wasn't me. Well, it wasn't. You are. Mom, my girl just caught me. You made her catch you? I don't know how I let this happen. With who? The girl next door, you know.

I'm not gonna say it was sexy, cause she's not sexy. She's. She's a dirty hoe, personally.

What is his name? Brian. Okay, and when did he become your ex? Like, how fresh is this? It was last year, but we still talk to each other all the time. Okay, so. But he's dating someone else now? Yes. And her name is Hannah. And she seems totally nice and everything. I know a few people who know her too. They said she's super nice and they seem happy together. But here's the thing. I keep telling her that Brian is doing things behind her back, and she keeps ignoring me when I try to help. Okay. Do doing what things behind her back? Talking to other girls, talking to me still, and trying to get me to actually hook up with him. So Brian is still trying to hook up with you even though he has a new girl? Pretty much. And I tried getting a message out to her and she blocked me, so I just. Yeah. Oh wow. Well, how did you try contacting her? Contacting her? Did you like, DM her or something? Like, what'd you do? Yeah, I tried dm'ing her through Instagram, but she blocked me. Right away she told her friends not to talk to me either. She told them I was Brian's psycho ex. But really, truthfully, all I'm trying to do is help her here. Okay, so you're trying to be the nice person here so she doesn't get her heart broken like you did? Basically, yeah. Okay, but she won't listen to you. Probably cause Brian himself is probably been like, oh, she's my psycho ex, don't listen to her. I guess, yeah. Okay, yeah, but the whole thing is. Didn't you say Brian was still trying to hook up with you? Like he's still trying to get with you. I mean, we're supposed to be going out for drinks this weekend and he specifically told me not to mention it to anyone because of Hannah. Oh wow, that's shady. Okay, so. But she doesn't believe you. Well, alright, what if we did this? What if we got Brian on the phone, okay, and then also had this Hannah girl on listening like on a third line. And then you sort of talked about hooking up or your little drinks date coming up. And then she'd be able to hear everything herself. That way you wouldn't have to convince anybody of anything cause she'd hear it for herself. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Alright, good. So it's an old fashioned Three Way call.

Just that they dated, they broke up, and she's sort of crazy, I guess. Oh, okay, let's bring Chantelle on real quick. So, Chantelle, before we do this, what did you want to say to Hannah? Just that I'm not crazy, and I'm only trying to prevent you here from getting hurt. That's. That's it? That's really it? Okay, Hannah. I mean, okay, if you're just trying to help me, then what was wrong with keeping all this private? Like, why do we have to do all of this on the radio? Because you won't answer me when I try to talk to you. You blocked me on Instagram, that's why. Yeah, I blocked you because Brian asked me to. He said he didn't want you spying on him. Well, like I said, I'm only. I'm only trying To help you here. Okay, so listen, we came up with this idea here real quick. We wanted to call Brian up, and then. Chantelle, why don't you ask him about your supposed upcoming date that he made with you behind Hannah's back and see what he says? Fine with me. And Hannah. We're gonna turn your line down while she's talking to him, but you're still gonna get to hear everything that's being said. Okay? I mean, I just think this is really immature, but whatever. Okay, hang on, Chantal. We're gonna call him up here, and when he answers, you're on. Okay?

You know, we're both single, so I told her, like, hey, you know, if you need anybody to hang out or dance with tonight, I'm right here. Oh, that's so sweet. If I was by myself at a wedding, I would definitely take a guy up on that offer. No, well, I mean, she. She did, uh, and we talked during dinner. We got to know each other, did a few shots. Uh, we pretty much danced together the entire night. Uh, and in fact, people were, like, coming up to us and asking, like, oh, how long have you been together as a couple? And we were like, 45 minutes. Haha. Wow. Okay, so the whole meeting people well at a wedding thing actually works, then? I mean, I mean, it did for me. Yeah. Okay, so the connection was there then? Oh, oh, oh, yeah, absolutely. In fact, after the reception was over, we. We went somewhere else for some drinks, and then I asked if she wanted to crash at my place. So she came over, spent the night. Wow. Okay. Wow. Way you go, Scott. So you guys went to your. Now, did you end up, um. You know. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, like, we messed around a bunch, but we didn't end up having sex. I gotcha. But so you enjoyed Each other's company. Oh, totally. Yeah. And when I tell you, I've never clicked with somebody so much in my life, I mean, I. I remember thinking this. This person here could be my next girlfriend. Wow, that's awesome. Okay, but I'm assuming something went wrong, though, or you wouldn't be calling us. Yeah, exactly. So, uh, so here's what went wrong. The next morning, she got up early and asked if I could make her breakfast and said that she had to get going, but she was gonna call me. So I wait a day or two, no call. And I'm telling myself, alright, just stay cool, stay cool, don't act desperate, don't overreact. Let's just let her make the first move. So I wait, and then there's nothing. So I'm finally thinking, all right, well, what if. What if she lost my phone number, you know, or something? Or like, what if she's been actually trying to reach me? So I sent her a text message asking what she was doing for Memorial Day weekend, and she's like, yeah, I am super busy. And that was the last time I heard from her. Oh, man. Okay, so she. She gave you the blow off? Yep, pretty much. And. And then the thing I can't understand was like, guys, the entire night we were having an absolute blast together. And I could tell she was really into me. I was totally in her. And I. I have no idea. What happened? So once again, and we get these all the time. We have somebody who starts out super into you and then something happens and makes them pull a one eighty for no good reason. I can't tell you how many of these we've had to figure out. So I'm assuming that's what you want to know. Why she acted so interested that night and now she's not. Yeah, yeah, like I. I just don't know what I did that made her give me the blow off like that. Yeah. Is there a possibility that she's married? No, no, no, she's not married. Cause we're both friends with the bride and groom and they both said to us, oh my gosh, we're so glad you guys found each other. You're perfect together. Yeah. I feel like if she was married and the weddings, like, uh, by herself, somebody would have come up to you and be like, uh, you know she's married, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, she is definitely not married. Okay, so great time at the wedding, you go for drinks, you come home, you do some heavy petting, and then the next day she's no longer interested. So that leaves us with the normal line of questioning here. Forgive us for asking, um, did you. Did you try any weird sexual move on her? Absolutely not. Okay. None of that. So everything you guys did was pretty much by the book? Yeah. Okay. Yep. Did you Go pee. Pee or poop in the bed like. Or have terrible flatulence in your sleep? no, I do not. Okay, okay. Do you keep a collection of fingernails under your bed anyway, or something weird like that? No, no, that is disgusting. Cause one time, that was the. That was the reason. Um, okay, so you have this girl's name, this girl's phone number then? Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay, give it to us. We'll get her on the phone and we'll find out what's going on. Okay? Alright, great.

About what? So one of my best friends from college, it, like, literally a woman who was in our wedding is getting married, and she's having her bachelorette party the last weekend in April in Vegas. And I have never been to Vegas, so I was, like, crazy excited, and the first thing I do is check my calendar, and I'm sort of counting backwards in my head. Anyways, it turns out that the weekend of the party, I have my kids, so I can't go. So I called Dale, and I'm like, listen, I never asked you to switch with me, but can you please take the kids the last weekend of April? If you do them, I'll take them the next three weekends. And he's like, nope, sorry, can't do it. No. Oh, wow. Just like that? Please? Yeah, just like that. And did you ask him why he can't do it? So he claims he has a work event that weekend in Richmond, and I know it's a lie. So you ask him nicely, please switch this one weekend with me? And he says no. Correct. Have you ever switched weekends for him? All The time? Like, I. I switch when he wants to go fishing. I switch a couple weeks ago when he's sick. I even switched last year so he could play in, like a freaking kickball tournament. Oh, no, he's one of those grown UPS who plays on a kickball team. Yeah, every summer. don't make fun of kickball. It's fun, okay? Dear Lord. Okay, so you said you want us to prove he's lying to you. Um, is it about having to work that weekend? You want us to prove he's lying about that? Yeah, I mean, I'm completely sure he's lying about it. Because anything that involves me actually enjoying myself, he has to ruin. Okay, so. Alright, so a couple of questions. You said this Vegas thing was in April? Yeah, it's the last weekend in April. The last weekend in April. Okay, give me the exact date.

Um, but it's basically like a dating contract. What? A contract? And what is that mean? Yeah, it's like something that I wrote up to kind of help protect myself about, like, things that he has to reveal to me. Like, do you have any crazy psycho exes? Do you have any dependent children? Do you have any STDs? Okay, this is an actual written document that you have? Yeah. I mean, like, it's not like I sent this to my lawyer, but it's like a paper that I wrote up cause I wanna be respected and, like, there's some weirdos out there, like, and you never know, and, like, I wanna know what I'm getting myself into. Well, I guess so. And on one side, they always say you need to be clear with what your expectations are, and that's a very clear way to do it. That's very. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. So I emailed it over to him and I said, you know, like, take a look. This is kind of like what I'm about and it's important to me, but I know it's not a normal thing, and I said that, but, you know, I just thought he would take a look. And I was up front, everything. Was there. Have you given that to other dudes before and they've been cool with it? To be honest, this is the first time that I've done it, but it's because, like, I've been hurt so bad from the other one, so. Yeah. So was it. Is it, like. What was his response to that? He chatted with me a couple of times, but it was kind of, like, brief. Like, he said he was busy and had to go to work, and then, like, I haven't seen him in, like, I haven't scheduled any dates, and I. I really like this guy, so I was, like, really concerned, and I didn't want to scare him away, but. I didn't want to scare him away, but I gave him a contract to sign. I mean, I see how that could be a little daunting, right? Yeah. And, like, the thing is, like, I can understand why you did it and your reasoning, but if you were to receive one for me, if I ever got one of those, it would be a huge red flag that the person I was about to date has major trust issues. It wasn't my intention to scare him away. And I guess, you know, with what you guys said that maybe. Maybe it did. But I. I really like this guy, and, like, I had serious.

When I turned 8, my parents threw me this huge party. All my friends came. We had a bouncy house, pizza, the works. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. But right as we were about to cut my Ninja Turtles cake, my mom pulled me aside with this panicked look. Honey, we need to tell everyone to go home right now. Daddy's very sick and needs to go to the hospital. I was devastated. My friends left confused, some crying because they thought someone was dying. The bouncy house guy packed up while I sat there in my party hat, watching my perfect day crumble. Dad spent three days in the hospital for what they said was a severe stomach infection. I felt so guilty for being upset about my ruined party when he was suffering. But this became a pattern. Every single birthday for the next 10 years, some crisis would strike right before or during my Celebration. When I turned nine, my mom got food poisoning an hour before my sleepover. When I turned 10, my grandma fell down the stairs during my bowling party. 11 was my dad's appendix acting up. 12 was our car breaking down on the way to the amusement park. By 13, I started having panic attacks before my birthday. I'd wake up wondering what disaster would ruin it this time. My friends stopped expecting invitations. Some parents whispered that our Family was cursed or unlucky. I began asking for quiet celebrations instead. Just cake at home, please. But even then, something always went wrong. The power would go out, someone would get injured. There was always something. When I turned 16, I didn't even want a party. I just wanted to go to dinner with my parents. But halfway through appetizers, my mom clutched her chest. I think I'm having heart palpitations. I started telling people I hated birthdays. Friends thought I was being dramatic. Just bad luck, they'd say. By 17, I was seeing a therapist for what I thought was birthday anxiety disorder. She kept asking about my family dynamics, but I defended them. They can't help that emergencies happen. When I turned 18, I didn't even tell them it was my birthday. I was planning to just let it pass quietly, maybe treat myself to coffee later. But that afternoon, I came home early from school and overheard my parents on the phone with my aunt. Yeah, we're free for dinner tonight, my mom was saying. Cheerful

Growing up, my entire extended family called me Little Picadillo. Like, everyone. My mom, dad, aunts, uncles, cousins, even my grandparents. I genuinely thought it was the cutest thing ever. For context, we're half Mexican on my dad's side, so I just assumed it was some cute Spanish word or maybe a family tradition thing. I never questioned it. My dad would call me that with this big smile, ruffling my hair, saying I was his special little picadillo. There was this one time in fifth grade when we had to do a heritage project, and I proudly wrote about my special Mexican nickname, picadillo, and how it connected me to my roots. My teacher even asked me to explain it to the class, and I stood there going on about how it was this special term of endearment passed down through generations. Meanwhile, my dad was sitting in the back row during parent night trying not to lose it. I found out later he had to excuse himself to go to the bathroom, but was actually in the hallway crying with laughter. On my 16th birthday, my grandma gifted me this beautiful handmade bracelet with picadillo engraved on it. I wore that thing everywhere for like two years straight. When people would ask what it meant, I'd proudly explain it was my special family nickname in Spanish. Some of my high school friends even Started calling me Pica as a shortened version. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. When I was like 14, I went through that phase where you hate everything about yourself and your family, so I started rolling my eyes whenever they used it. I'd be like, I have a real name, you know? And my family would just laugh and say, once a picadillo, always a picadillo. My dad would wink at my uncles and they'd all start laughing. I thought they were just being annoying adults. In college, my roommates met my family during Parents Weekend and of course the nickname came out. For the next four years, some of my closest friends called me Piccadilly, thinking it was this cute cultural thing. My cousin Emmett once visited campus and nearly spit out his drink when he heard my friends use it so casually. He played it off, but now I realize he was dying inside knowing what it really meant. There was even this guy I dated sophomore year who thought it was adorable and started calling me his little piccadillo in this sweet voice. My dad met him during a family dinner and had to excuse himself from the table when he heard it. I thought he was just being weird about me dating someone, but no, he was laughing at this poor, clueless guy. Fast forward to last month. I'm 25 now and was at my cousin Tracy's wedding. I haven't lived at home For years, but whenever I visit for holidays, the nickname still comes out. At this point, I kind of reclaimed it. Like it was annoying as a teen, but now it's just part of who I am in the family. Nostalgic, even so. At the reception, I'm catching up with all the relatives I haven't seen in forever. Everyone's a little tipsy, including me. After three glasses of champagne, my dad's brother, Uncle Andres comes over and gives me a big hug saying, there's my favorite little piccadillo. And I'm like, still can't escape that nickname, huh? Uncle Andres starts laughing so hard, like tears in his eyes laughing. I'm just standing there confused. He calls over my dad and my other Uncle Jeff, saying, she still doesn't know what Piccadillo means. They all start dying laughing. I'm like, what? It's just a cute nickname, right? And they're all exchanging these looks. My dad, clearly drunk, puts his arm around me and goes, should we finally tell her? She's old enough now. At this point, my cousin Emmett walks over, overhears, and goes, wait, she doesn't know? And now I'm getting annoyed because clearly I'm the only one not in on whatever this joke is. My dad clears his throat and says, well, sweetheart, you know how your mom had that really intense craving for picadillo when she was pregnant with you? Picadillo, if you don't know, is this Mexican ground beef dish with tomatoes and spices and stuff. I Nod, because I heard the story before. My mom craved it so badly during her pregnancy that my dad would make it at 2:00am sometimes. Well, my dad continues. The thing is, your mom

My English teacher destroyed my inhaler during an asthma attack because she thought I was being dramatic for attention. And I ended up coding in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. I've had severe asthma since I was four. The kind where your airways just decide to close without warning. The kind that's unalived. People, my parents, doctors, and the school all had a detailed medical plan. I keep my rescue inhaler with me at all times. No exceptions. Miss Winters was new that semester. From day one, she made it clear she thought teenagers were just attention seeking drama Queens. When I used my inhaler during silent reading, she gave me this look like I just set off a firecracker for fun. After class, she pulled me aside. I don't appreciate theatrical disruptions in my classroom. I tried explaining it wasn't optional. It was medicine. I needed to breathe. She just smiled that tight, condescending smile teachers use when they think you're lying. If you need attention that badly, find another way to get it. Not in my class. I told my mom that night. She called the school, but nothing changed. Two weeks later, I felt my chest tightening during her class. That terrifying sensation of your lungs refusing to expand. I quietly took out my inhaler, trying not to disturb anyone. Miss Winters stopped mid sentence. What did I tell you about disruptions? I could Barely speak. Can't breathe. Put that away or take it outside, she snapped. I tried to stand, but my legs were weak. The wheezing was audible now. My classmates were staring. I'm looking concerned. I need. I gasped. My inhaler. She marched over, face tight with anger. This attention seeking behavior ends now. And then she did something I still have nightmares about. She snatched the inhaler from my trembling hands. You can have this back when you learn to control yourself, she said, dropping it into her desk drawer. I tried to stand to get to her desk, but collapsed back into my chair. Black spot

My roommate Jake, thought he was the smartest guy in our dorm. He'd constantly brag about his 4.0 GPA and how he never had to study because everything came naturally to him. It got annoying real quick, especially during finals week when the rest of us were stressed out of our minds. One night in December, we were all cramming in the common room. Jake walks in eating pizza. While we're surrounded by textbooks and energy drinks, he starts going on about how our organic chemistry final was going to be a joke because he'd already memorized everything. That's when I snapped. I was surviving on three hours of sleep and my third Red Bull of the day. Without thinking, I said, if you're so confident, let's make a bet. If you get anything less than a 95 on the final, you have to streak across the quad during lunch rush. Jake laughed and said, deal. But when I get my 98, you're buying my textbooks next semester. Everyone in the room went quiet. Textbooks cost like 800 bucks total. I was already eating ramen every day to afford tuition, but my pride wouldn't let me back down. The final was brutal. Three hours of mechanisms and synthesis problems that made half the class walk out early. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. But Jake seemed calm as usual when he turned in his test.

One of our listeners emailed us about you and I'll just get to Brass Tax. I can tell you're a business kind of guy. Yeah, he straight to the point here. Okay, whatever. Do what you need to do. Alright, so here's the deal. You recently went out with a girl named Heather. You remember going out with Heather? I do remember going out with Heather, yes. Why are you asking me about it now? Well, because Heather emailed us saying that after your date, which was the most romantic date she's ever been on, by the way. After your date, you stopped texting her and she's wondering why. Wow, that is a. That's a real grown up move there, Heather. What? Wait, I don't get it. Like, are you upset by that? Are you being sarcastic? Or that she emailed the radio station to complain about why I'm not calling her after our date. So this wasn't even that crazy of a first date for you? For me? No. For her? It was for her? Yes. Okay, I knew. I knew it would be that way. And that's. I mean, it was all by design. You knew it would be that way? Okay, wait, I'm confused. The way she described You. You were charming and you were romantic, and right now you're coming off as kind of a smug a hole.

All right, so we can get you on the phone as quick as possible, if you wouldn't mind just telling us why you're not wanting to talk to her. Look, we had a lovely time, and I got what I wanted out of the date. Get what you wanted out of it? But you. Yeah, she. You didn't even kiss her at the end. What did you want out of it? Dinner. If you must know, I did it for a business deal. What? You did it for a business deal? Going out with her? I don't get it. Yeah, I sometimes do business with her father. Yeah, she told us that. She mentioned that it might be a good idea that I date her, so I. I called her up, and I took her on the best date of her life. Oh, so you're telling me that you used her as a stepping stone in your little effing career? I'm not saying that, no. But I will tell you that two days later, I close the deal. You are like, oh, my. So what's the money? Comes. So you took her out just to close a deal with her father? Not just To close a deal. We had a nice time. She had a nice time. I'm sure wasn't a wasted night in her life. Yes, it was. You were texting her afterwards, and you couldn't wait to see her again. You played with her emotions. You totally let her on. You're a total. Haha! Jeez, Brooke. Look, you can call me names all you want, but I'm just being honest with you guys. You called me, and I'm the one closing multimillion dollar deals on a regular basis. Whoa. Yeah, but you didn't have to. Like, I mean, couldn't you just go, yeah, sure. I'll go out with your daughter and take her on a regular date and not try to be super romantic about it. So I should take her on a date? Hey, I don't know. Maybe you just don't use his daughter at all, and you're actually a good businessman, and you make a deal without having to use somebody's daughter in the process of it. Listen, sweetheart, in business, you do whatever you need to do to close the deal, okay? I close the deal the day that you're doing things like that. You can come talk to me, but. Oh, my goodness.

Well, I know that because Mary Ellen emailed us to see if we could get a hold of you because apparently you've scheduled a date with her twice now and blown her off each time. Okay, is that. Is that what she said? That's what she said, yeah. And so we're getting you on the phone to find out why you keep blowing her off. To be honest with you, I've just been really conflicted about it. Um, really? And why is that? She thinks, just so you know, that you're probably either married or have a girlfriend. Haha, no, I'm not. Wait, is that a nervous laugh cause you're lying to us, or is that a nervous laugh because you're surprised she thinks that? No, I swear to god, I definitely don't have a girlfriend or a wife. Okay, so that's a good start. We got that out of the way. Why won't you go out on a date with her, then? Why do you keep scheduling and then bailing? You know, I. It's, I. It's my own insecurity, to be honest with you. Um, I just. I just didn't feel comfortable with it when I thought about it. Male pattern baldness. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Is that what it is? Hey, women are okay with that. No, I'm. I'm not balding. Okay? Okay. Oh, I. You said insecure and that's instantly where I went. I was like, he's gotta be balding. What? No, that. Ha ha ha. No, I. That is not the case. Oh, how. How can you be insecure? You're the guy that walks into a bar, asks a hot bartender out, and she actually says yes to you out of the thousands of guys that hit on her all the time. To tell you the truth, I'm not usually that impulsive. And I. I only did that because I. I really was drawn to her. Maryland is really interesting. She's really lovely. And, you know, I. I thought she was great. Yeah. Sounds like the kind of girl that you wanna blow off while she's on the way to a club to meet you. Usually when you describe somebody like that, you're like, I can't wait until they just get right to the door of where we're supposed to have a date and then tell him I'm not showing up, you know? Listen, in all sincerity, I know that in the end, she probably wouldn't be happy with this. Why? So what is wrong with you? Uh, alright, so you want. You want to hear the. The whole truth, then? Yeah, that'd be great. I'm assuming she probably does too. Yeah, um, we talked on the phone for quite a while. The Night. Uh, that we met, and it was great. It's really wonderful conversation. And after I got off the phone with her, um, I looked her up on social media. Uh huh. And, uh, I thought she was a lot older than she actually is. Okay. Um, she's 23. Okay. What's wrong with that? It's kinda young. How old are you? I'm 42, and I'm divorced in a couple of years. Um, okay, so you're almost 20 years older than her? Yeah. And that bothers you? Yes. Some girls do. You guys are like, what's the issue? Yeah. Jackpot. It's not me, it's for her. I don't. I don't want to do that to her, if that makes any sense. You don't want her to date a geriatric. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. In so many words. Thank you. Yes, but come on. I mean, shouldn't you leave that up to her? She's gonna have to explain this to, you know, her friends that we go out with and her family, like, meeting her parents. Like, I. I never for a million years thought that I would ever be that guy, you know? Like it. Yeah, the parents. I can. I can see what you mean there a little bit. It would be awkward to be 20 years older than the girl that you're dating and be like, okay, I've Officially become, like, midlife crisis, man. Yeah, but if you guys have a real connection and you think that she's sophisticated and intelligent, then why not? I think that's kind of a simple way of looking at it. And it is really a lot more complicated than that, especially on. On my end, you know? Okay. Wouldn't. Wouldn't you be curious to find out what she thinks? Not really. I'm not exactly proud to be in this situation. I think she's just kind of going to mock and ridicule me. Um, can you guys just. Can you guys just tell her? Okay, well, how about I just tell you that you actually kind of told her because she's on the other line listening and wants to talk to you?

Ah, okay. Well, that's a great start, I suppose. Um, does this co worker have a name? Yes, it is David. Okay, so you slept with David who is married? Yes. And not to you? Correct. Okay. And let me guess. You're calling because you're pregnant? No. Oh, god, no. No, it just happened, like, two weeks ago. So that would be, like, the world's fastest pregnancy. Oh, well, yes, I suppose it would be. So, question for you. Why did you sleep with a married man? I'm not being judgy, I promise you of that. I'm just curious. What made you think that this was a good idea? I just. I just have to know. Okay, so, um, our company did a work retreat, um, at a winery, and, um, you know, up in Williamsburg, and we were all up there, and it was, like, Saturday. Ah. So. Okay, so there was alcohol involved. So. So the picture is becoming a little clearer here. Yes, yes. And, I mean, that was part of it. Okay. But, you know, we've been flirty with each other for a long time, and, you know, we've just never had the opportunity really to talk alone outside of work, you know, and. Okay, so. So you're in Williamsburg, the wine is flowing, the conversation. She is good. Right. And so I just. I kind of got to the point. Where I was like, am I gonna be able to drive all the way home, or should I just start trying to find somewhere to stay? And, you know, he tells me that he has a hotel, and I can crash with him if I want. Okay. And I'm assuming you took him up on that offer. I did. And, you know, that's pretty much how everything happened. But this is the weird part. Um, so before we even got to doing anything, he tells me that he's married, and he and his wife have decided that they don't want to be exclusive anymore. And they, like, made this choice a couple years ago. Right. And he said they've never been happier. And he just wanted to make sure that I knew all of that before we went forward with anything. So he told you all of this before you slept together? Yeah. And you believed him? Yeah. I mean, I believed him because instead of, you know, just sleeping with me, which he totally could have done, he told me all of this first to make sure that, you know, I was cool with it. And. And if he wanted to, like, have an affair, you know, whatever, I don't think he would have told me that he was married in the first place. Yeah, that's true. That's true, I guess. Yeah. But maybe he was afraid you'd find out he was married and then expose him. So maybe If he thinks you're okay with the situation, you're not gonna bring it up to anybody. Okay, so you sound like my girlfriend. Yeah, they. They all think that he's lying to me and that he lied about having an open marriage. I agree with them. Do you know what his wife's name is? I think, uh, he said. I think he said it was Kate. Okay. I have a question. Why does any of this matter anyways? You. So you, you slept with a married man. You've moved on. You're not doing it again? Correct. You are doing it again. Oh, I'm, I'm, I, I, I really want to. Is that bad? Is that bad? I mean, not if his wife is okay with it, I guess. I have a question for you. Why don't you just call his wife? Call her up, say, hey, we're grown UPS here, and are you okay with me banging your husband, yes or no? What? I'm sick of all these run around situations when you could just settle it directly by talking to the other person. Is that what you want us to do, Mary Beth? You want us to call his wife?

Lou is on the phone with us. And Lou is about to live out everybody's dream with today's awkward Tuesday phone call. Seriously? He wants to quit his job? On the air? Yes. Apparently he's been working at a restaurant for about two years. Last couple months he got a new manager who is just horrible. Yeah, he even told us a story about how she threw a potato at his head. So his problem is he's trying to figure out the best way possible to quit with flair so that she feels it. And that's why he wants to do an awkward Tuesday phone call today. Lou, are you ready? I'm ready. I, I already have another job. I'm not worried. I, I have to tell this woman she's going down. All right, okay, so you're hyped up, you're ready to go? Ready? Ready. Let's do it.

I can't do anything right. I come in early, it's not good enough. I come in late, it's not good enough. All you do is yell and scream and criticize and go after anything that I try to do. I can't cook anything correctly. I work really hard for you, and you don't care! And all you do is criticize! You threw a potato at me! You're the worst person I've ever met! I can't take it anymore! Are you finished? No, I'm not finished, because you're evil and you make everyone around you feel like crap! You've been my manager for the last 6 months. But guess what? You're not gonna be my manager anymore because I quit! Go yourself. I quit! Now are you finished? Yeah, now I'm finished. Well, will

Hi. I was looking for Jamie. This is Jamie. Hi, Jamie. This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. What? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. Do you know what that is? Um, you guys are the radio show? Yes, that's it. Oh, my god. Awesome. Most of the time when I call people, they have no idea who I am. No, no, I mean, I've heard of you. Awesome. That's good. Well, the reason I'm calling today is you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners. Oh. His name is Ben. Oh, okay. And not as much laughter. Ben told us a little bit about your date. He said that he liked you a lot, but he can't figure out why. It's been two and a half weeks, and you haven't returned any of his phone calls. Oh, my god. Okay. Mm hmm. Um, I. I don't know what to say. Well, you can start off by maybe telling us if you like them. I didn't have my phone on. Um, yeah. I mean, he was really, really nice. He was a nice guy. So you did like him? Let me ask you a more important question. What did you think of his mom? Oh, my god. Uh. Oh, my god. How did you know that? Well, because Ben talked to us about your date. He told us how you guys went out for drinks, and then Went to go see a play, and his mom showed up before the play and then joined you guys on the date. And not only that, but drops you off, apparently, at the end of the evening, too. Yeah. That is romance. Oh, wow. What did you think when his mom walked into the lobby of the theater? It was really weird. Okay, I can't even imagine you're on the same page as we are, then. Yeah, because we tried to explain to him that's a strange move to do on a first date, and he was like, no, I swear, my mom and her hit it off. She thought it was great. She had a wonderful time. Actually, that part was totally true. She really. It was weird at first. What? It was. It was weird at first. It was totally weird at first, but she was actually really, really cool. I'm really into theater, and she knows so much about theater and theater history, and she was, like, telling me all these stories and. So you actually enjoyed your time with his mother? I really did. Wow. All right, well, if you. If you enjoyed his mom so much, why aren't you calling him back for another date? I mean, that could be your mother in law if you play your cards right. I don't think that I should say. Dude, I. I mean, we have to know. If it wasn't the mom, what could it be? Oh, God, they just. I don't wanna hurt his feelings. I think. I think he's actually pretty resilient. We poked fun at him pretty hard when we talked to him, and he seemed to take it pretty well. Yeah, I. I really. I don't know. It sounds pretty bad to me. Well, here's the thing, right? Whenever somebody signs up to do one of these second date updates, we let them know that they might hear something they don't want to. Right? So Ben is willing to hear whatever news it is that you have to say. We'll clean it up a little bit when we talk to him. You know, sugarcoat it if we need to, but if you can just tell us what it is, at least he will know. Yeah. Okay. Um. Okay. During the play, I was sitting in between them. Um. Oh, my god, that's so awkward. Yeah, I didn't realize that piece. I'm sorry. What? No, no, honestly, it was good. It was. It. It. She was really great to talk to. And I like talking to him, too, so it really was okay. But, uh, about halfway through the play, she was whispering to me about the play and stuff, and then she said there was an actor in the play, the one that I guess got Ben the tickets. Uh huh. And, um, he was, you know, really cute. And Ben's mom was talking about him and commenting on it, and she said, She thought we would, like, really hit it off. What? And that she wanted to set me up with Ben's friend. What?

I guess I'm okay with them, I. Hey, Veronica? Yeah. This is actually Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. Hi. Have you ever heard our radio show before? I'm sorry, I have it. Okay, I'll explain to you the reason why I was pretending to be from the National Rifle Association in just a second. But we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. Okay. Okay. It's where if you go out on a date with someone and then blow them off, they email us and ask us to give you a call and ask why. Okay, so you recently went out with one of our listeners. His name is Todd. Oh, okay. Okay. Now does it make sense why I was joking around about being from the National Rifle Association? Yeah, it exactly makes sense now. So Todd told us about your date. He said that you seemed a little weirded out that he carries a gun. After talking to him, he made me feel very comfortable about it. Okay. Um, so I wasn't that nervous, but, I mean, it is a little weird to carry a concealed weapon on you, so. Yeah, Todd talked to us. He said that He really enjoyed your date and he'd love to see you again. But he feels like the fact that he brought that gun on the date turned you off. And that's why you're not returning any of his phone calls. Is that why you're not calling him back? And no, that's not why. Okay. Did. Is it anything to do with the guns? Um, no, actually has nothing to do with guns. Okay. Do you mind telling us why then, so we can pass the news along to him? Well, we were watching Titanic and that's one of my favorite movies, and towards the end. What? Yeah, we went. We were watching Titanic, he put it in and I was just like, how. How sweet. He actually likes romance. Really nice, right? And that's like a four hour movie too. Yeah, but it was nice cause we were talking in between and at the end of the movie, after Leonardo dies, he just blankly asks if

Is this Brandon? Yep, it is. Hey, Brandon, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Hi. Um, hi. How's it going today, Brandon? It's fine. Can I. What's this about? Well, I'm calling you today because we got an email about you from somebody who listens to our show. Okay. Um, why? Well, good question. Because we hear you're pretty good with a left cross. What's going on here? I don't know what you're talking about. Or was it an uppercut and not a left cross? I don't know. I don't know what kind of punch you threw, but I do know you threw a pretty good punch. I'm just really confused right now. Can you. Can you just tell me why you're calling me in the first place? Oh, sure. Why didn't you ask before? Um, I'm calling because we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody and they like you a lot, but you don't call them back, they email us to get you on the phone and ask what happened. So you recently went to get coffee with a girl named Joanna. Oh, and that's why I asked about the punching. Because she told us the story of how she met you. And you punched one of your teammates on the volleyball team cause he called her a name. And then you went to Go get coffee. Yeah. Um, yeah, okay. Yeah, that. I mean, the punching thing makes sense. Um, so twitch, she. She emailed you about that? Yeah, because she says that she thought you guys had a lot of chemistry when you were having coffee, but now you won't plan another date with her. Ah! Oh, my god. That's too heavy. Size Brandon. So can you tell us why you don't want to go out with her again? Well, um, I don't know. I, I, I just. I feel I'm better off single and. Pretty much it. Did she come off as, like, too. What was her words? She thought maybe she looked high maintenance when she sent her coffee back a couple times. Yeah, well, I. I don't want to hurt her feelings, you know, I wish her the best and all that, but she was just pretty forward on the date, and then. That's putting it nicely. She was forward as in, like, the things that she said to you, or. She's blunt, or she. She walked forward and you like people who walk backward? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! I highly doubt it's that one. That's a thing, I think. No, it's not a thing. No, she. She was just really intense with the things she was saying, like, in the first five minutes. You kind of rub me the wrong way. What'd she say? Really? Would she get into politics or religion or something? No, It wasn't stuff like that. It was just, like, stuff about me. Like, she's kept saying weird things to me. Can you give us an example? Yeah, well, just stuff about how I looked. You know, she's. She just was, like, commenting on my clothes. She didn't like my hair. She's like, oh, I can tell why you're single. Yeah, yeah, I can tell you're single. What? Maybe she. You. You got a nicer haircut. Oh, what? She was insulting your haircut. Jeez, man. Oh, my haircut. My. My pants, my. My shoes. Like, uh. Like, always like that. Like, oh, I can tell you're single. You need you a good woman. You. A good woman to tell you. What? How to look good. Oh, you need a lady to teach you how to dress? That's so weird, right? Oh, I know. It just really rubbed me the wrong way. And it was like, you're. You're a slob, but, you know, you're a cute slob. I find you're cute, but you're a slob. It's just strange, because when we talked to her, all she talked about was how attracted she was to you. That's not how I remember it. Like, maybe she just sees me as some kind of, I don't know, a. A project. Oh, like a. Like a Barbie doll. And she can dress you up, do your hair anyway she wants. Well, like a kill. Like a Ken doll, I guess, but yeah. Yeah, I guess you're Right? Oh, that would make me mad. Yeah, yeah, she was critiquing me the whole time on everything. Okay. Oh man. Alright, well that makes sense. I wonder if she's got any more critiques though, because she is on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Hi, Brandon. Oh my god! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Really? Yeah, that's Joanna right there. Oh my god. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dude, Joanna, you're coming in hot. Don't you wanna apologize? No, I don't want to apologize. Everything I said was true. I mean, his shoes, I mean, were ridiculous. They didn't go with his outfit and they were really dirty. Like he needed to throw them in the washer or just clean them. But I was still very attracted to him. He just needed like a little ketchup or help or something, you know?

Well, I know that because Mary Ellen emailed us to see if we could get a hold of you because apparently you've scheduled a date with her twice now and blown her off each time. Okay, is that. Is that what she said? That's what she said, yeah. And so we're getting you on the phone to find out why you keep blowing her off. To be honest with you, I've just been really conflicted about it. Um, really? Why is that? She thinks, just so you know, that you're probably either married or have a girlfriend. Ha ha ha. No, I'm not. Wait, is that a nervous laugh cause you're lying to us, or is that a nervous laugh because you're surprised she thinks that? No, I swear to god, I definitely don't have a girlfriend or a wife.

It's my own insecurity, to be honest with you. Um, I just. I don't know. I just didn't feel comfortable with it when I thought about it. Male pattern baldness? What are you talking. Is that What it is. Hey, women are okay with that. No, I'm. I'm not balding. Okay, okay. You said insecure, and that's instantly where I went. I was like, he's gotta be balding. What? No, that. No, I. That is not the case. How. How can you be insecure? You're the guy that walks into a bar, asks a hot bartender out, and she actually says yes to you out of the thousands of guys that hit on her all the time. To tell you the truth, I'm not usually that impulsive. And I. I only did that because I. I really was drawn to her. Maryland is really interesting. She's really lovely. And, you know, I. I thought she was great. Yeah. Sounds like the kind of girl that you wanna blow off while she's on the way to a club to meet you. Usually when you describe somebody like that, you're like, I can't wait until they just get right to the door of where we're supposed to have a date and then tell him I'm not showing up, you know? Listen, in all sincerity, I know that in the end, she probably wouldn't be happy with this. Why? So? What is wrong with you? Uh, alright, so you want. You want to hear the. The whole truth, then? Yeah, that'd be great. I'm assuming she probably does too. Yeah. Um. We talked on the phone for quite a while the night, uh, that we met. And it was Great. It's really wonderful conversation. And after I got off the phone with her, um, I looked her up on social media. Uh huh. And, uh, I thought she was a lot older than she actually is. Okay. Um, she's 23. Okay. What's wrong with that? It's kinda young. How old are you? I'm 42, and I'm divorced in a couple of years. Um, okay, so you're almost 20 years older than her? Yeah. And that bothers you? Yes. Some girls like it. Most guys are like, yeah, Jackpot. It's not me, it's for her. I don't. I don't want to do that to her, if that makes any sense. You don't want her to date a geriatric. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. Yeah. It's so many words. Thank you. Yeah, but come on. I mean, shouldn't you leave that up to her? She's gonna have to explain this to, you know, her friends that we go out with and her family, like, meeting her parents. I never for a million years thought that I would ever be that guy, you know? Like it. Yeah, the parent. I can. I can see what you mean there a little bit. It would be awkward to be 20 years older than the girl that you're dating and be like, okay, I've officially become, like, midlife crisis, man. Yeah, but if you guys have a real connection and you think that she's sophisticated and intelligent, then why Not. I think that's kind of a simple way of looking at it. And it is really a lot more complicated than that, especially on. On my end, you know? Okay. Wouldn't. Wouldn't you be curious to find out what she thinks? Not really. I'm not exactly proud to be in this situation. I think she's just kind of going to mock and ridicule me. Um, can you guys just. Can you guys just tell her? Okay, well, how about I just tell you that you actually kind of told her because she's on the other line listening and wants to talk to you.

Now that I'm about to have my daughter, she comes back and says it's my obligation to name my daughter after her as a tribute. My dad passed away way too soon. He was a truck driver, and one day he had an accident. It was really sad for me, especially since my relationship with my mom was already bad. At that time, she was cheating on my dad, and I knew about it. One of the reasons my dad worked so much was because he wanted to save enough money to buy a house for the two of us so he could divorce her. Technically, the house we were living in was hers. She never really cared to hide her affair, and I often saw her bring her boyfriend home. After my dad passed, that guy became my stepdad. At first, he tried to act like he was cool with me, and honestly, I talked to him normally because I didn't have much choice. I figured if I had to live with him, we could at least try to get along. But that didn't last long. Little by little, he started telling my mom that he didn't want to raise a kid that wasn't his, and so on. I saw it all because they argue about it right in front of Me. Even though my relationship with my mom wasn't great, I never thought she'd actually kick me out. Well, I was wrong. One day, we had an argument because she had taken the money I was saving and gave it to my stepdad. I called her out on it, and that's when she told me I was useless, that she didn't want me in the house anymore, and that I was just a bad reminder of my dad. She said she didn't even understand why I was still there. I thought she was just saying that because she was mad, but no. The next day, my clothes were thrown out of the house, and when I tried to go inside, my stepdad blocked the door and told me I didn't live there anymore. I called a friend, desperate, and he let me stay at his place for a while. After that, I moved to my grandma's house. At first, she wasn't exactly thrilled about having to raise me, either, but it was definitely better than living with my mom and stepdad. Little by little, we got to know each other better, and she really became like a mom to me. From there, I finished high school, went to college, dated, got married, and now I'm finally about to have my daughter. I told my grandma the news, since we talk almost every day, even though I live far away now. Apparently, she told my mom because the next day, my Mom called me to talk about it.

Some people just want to figure out what happened on their date and why the person isn't calling them back. And then there's Sean, who's on the phone for a second date right now, and he wants both. Pretty much. Says it was one of the strangest dates he's ever been on. So, Sean, how are you? Hey again. I'm good. I'm just trying to figure things out. Yeah, I mean, most. Most people who do this segment say that their date was bad or something, but strange. That's an interesting description to me. Yeah, I've just been trying to figure it out and I don't understand. I've asked my friends. I could use some help here. Okay. What's the girl's name you wanna call? Jessica. Jessica. Alright. And tell us a little bit about your date with Jessica. Okay. Um. Where to start? Oh, no. Alright, so we met online. She's super cute. So I figure, okay, let's go to a bar. Let's. Let's talk. So we go to this Irish pub and you know those dates where it's just like, not right? You know, where, like, you're trying to have conversation, but there's always this awkward silence or long pauses and you can kind of like, never get any momentum. Yeah, it sounds fun. It was just painful. Uh huh. Alright, so this is happening. I've had this situation before. It's like there's not Chemistry or whatever. So after, like, 45 minutes, you know, I gave it a good old college try or whatever. We weren't clicking, so I just say, like, hey, we can just leave. We can just end this date, and that's okay. And what did she say to that? She seems super relieved. Okay, so there were no hard feelings? You know, we're both adults. Like, it all feels very copacetic or whatever. And then she asks me to walk her to her apartment, which, you know, it's relatively early in the evening, but the sun's down. And so she says she just wants to have somebody take her back to her apartment, and that that makes sense to me. You know, just to be a nice guy, I say, sure, okay. Okay. And we're walking to apartment, and I guess, like, thinking back, like, the conversation started getting a little bit better, you know, like, there was a little less tension in the air or whatever as we were walking. So now you're getting along? Yeah. Well, that's the thing. We get to her place, and I have no idea why she did this, but she invites me up. What? What? I guess things got a lot better then, right? So you went from, let's end the date. This is horribly awkward, to, come on up to my place. Yeah, I didn't know what was going on, either. In my head, I was thinking, really, like, I didn't say That out loud. But I was totally thinking. Yeah. So did the date continue up there? Surprisingly, it did. Really? I had like no expectations. Yeah, I. I wasn't planning on anything happening. I was just like, alright, well, let's see what happens, you know? Like. Or maybe she was just even inviting you to be polite cause she thought it was a polite thing to do after you walked her home. I don't know. I guess my mom's friends would say like, you want a glass of water or something? It wasn't like that polite, but. Right, I guess like, cause all the tension was gone cause we were laughing with each other and just being ourselves. You know, one thing leads to another and we. We end up hooking up. Oh my god. Did she. I mean, did she initiate this? I'm sure dudes say this all the time. It felt like it was mutual. It didn't feel like one of us made the initiative. yeah, yeah. That's a big switch from not wanting to talk to you to now they can't keep their hands off each other. Yeah, I mean. And that's why, as I remember it, I did not initiate. Cause, you know, it felt like it was so not gonna happen. So. Anyway, that happens. It's really nice. She's great. Whatever. Um. And she's great. Whatever. I mean, I don't want to give details, you know, I want to be. it's Fine. It's fine. Did you stay the night? Well, here's the thing. Um, she gets up to use the bathroom and then I hear the apartment door close. Okay. And I wait for 45 minutes alone in her apartment. What? Weird. She left. She just left me in her apartment. That's weird. She must have really wanted to get out of there. Yeah, after 45 minutes I was like, alright, I don't know what's going on. She didn't text me or leave a note or anything, so I just left. Wow. Huh. She wasn't like, she ghosted you in her own apartment, right? Like, was it a. A weird booty call that she didn't want to? I don't. I don't know. Yeah. So anyway, like, I've texted her, I tried calling her once. Radio silence. And me and my buddies, we don't understand this one, so I could just use some help. Yeah, that's confusing. Wow. But you would if, like, there's a normal excuse for it, you would want to see her again. Still, it felt like there was some chemistry, so maybe things could happen and kind of want to know if I did anything weird so that I won't do it again. Well, and that's so straight, like, to finish all of it and then leave. Like, if there's something really weird happening, she would probably tell you in the middle of it. That's a good point. Yeah, it's like an old, like horror story or something. Where you, like, the person disappears and you know they've never been in that apartment for 30 years or something. Yeah. I bet that was the longest 45 minutes of your life, just laying there like, is she gonna come back? Is she not? Like what? Time slowed down to a crawl. Yeah, I think that I have never been so scared. Alright, well, we'll play a song and then come back and call her and see if we can figure it out for you with your second date. Okay? Alright. Thanks. I really want to figure this out. Alright, hang on.

Oh, okay, so somebody keeps texting your husband? What's, uh, what's his name? What? Well, what is your husband's name? It's Ben. Okay, and how long have you guys been married? Four years. Okay, you said somebody keeps texting him? Yes, and he keeps saying that it's one of his co workers named Mark. And then when it comes up in his phone, it says Mark. But I just. I don't know, I don't think that's who it really is. Okay, and why not? Uh, first of all, uh, the person, this Mark, keeps texting him even after work is done. At the end of the day, like when we're watching TV in bed, he'll get a text, or on the weekend, he gets a ton of texts from this person. Okay, so either somebody at work is obsessed with him, or it's not who we think it is. Exactly. And, um, you know the reason that I. I don't even think that it's a guy, cause whoever is texting him is using a ton of emojis. And I. I mean, I've seen some of the message that he gets, and it's just like, it doesn't look like anything that a guy would text to another guy. Yeah, I gotta say, as much as I use emojis, I don't use them very often when I'm texting other dudes. Yeah, like, unless It's. Unless it's the laugh cry emoji, which I use with everybody. No, no, it's not the. It's like. It's the ones that are like the face winking with the tongue sticking out and the surprise face. Yeah, yeah, I. I am not using winky emojis with another dude, so. Okay, so quick question. You have seen these conversations? No, I. I have only seen the little notifications that pop up on his screen at the top. Okay. But I do know. I know the phone number of whoever it is. You do? And how do you know that? Because at first, um, when he started getting the messages, it was just a phone number, right? And then. And I didn't pay attention to it because I, I really did think that it was someone from his work because that made sense. But then after he kept getting texts from that same number over and over, I was like, huh, I'm gonna remember this number. Like, just my gut, right? And it was actually easy cause part of the number is the address that I used to live at when I was a kid. So that was like a little memory. Yeah. And then after a while, um, I guess he just put Mark down for the contact because that's what. Okay, but you have this person's number then? Yes. Did you try to call it? No. Because I would like you guys to do that, and then I could Listen to what he says to this. Okay, so sort of like a Three Way call, and you want to listen in. Yes, exactly. Okay, so standby, we're gonna need that number, and then will we get it? Shag, just text this Mark or whoever it is. Or Ashley when you do it. Ashley, text. Okay. Just text and say, hey, it's Ben. I lost my phone. Can you call me at work real quick? And then give Mark or whoever Mark is the hotline. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then. Okay, Courtney, I'm gonna get that number from you, and then we'll call Ben and whoever this person is when we come back, okay? Okay. Whoever this person is, Mark or whatever. Um, so we texted them and said, hey, it's been lost. My phone. Can you call me at work real quick? Here's the number. And the number was our hotline. Well, as some of you pointed out, if this really is Mark from work, if they work together, they know the work number. So, yeah, he's gonna go, that's not our work number. Yeah, we work together our work numbers. Anyways, so when we figured that out, after we sent the text, we all kind of looked at each other like, oh, crap. And we waited and we waited during the commercial break, and the phone did not ring. And so we. I said to Ashley, I said, well, it really is Mark from his work. Then he's probably Calling their work right now, going, what are you doing at work so early? Or whatever. And then about, I don't know, a minute into the Zane song Pillow Talk, our hotline rang. It was blinking. And I'm gonna play you exactly what we heard when that hotline rang. Hang on a second, let me load it up for you. Cause we. Hotline ring. Yeah, there we go. Uh, let's see. Hang on a second. Oh, did I lose it? Hang on a second. I know, I know. I recorded it. Hang on, let me find it real quick. Uh, let's see. I know. I will check you into the bathroom. And then I saw the light blinking. Goes like, oh, my god, there it is. Okay, we need to get this. All right, here it is. Okay. Okay, so this is me answering and saying, Vanderlay Industries. And then listen to what happened for the rest of this phone call. By the way, I'll let you decide if Mark is really Mark. Vanderlay Industries. Um, yeah, I'm looking for Ben, though. Sure, no problem. May I ask who's calling? Yeah, it's Michelle. Michelle. Okay, stand by. I'm gonna ring him up for you. Thank you.

Are you kidding me? Whoa! Sugar packets? That is what gave you a bad feeling? What is going on? Oh, that's Eric. He's actually on the other line listening. What? And wants to talk to you, but he couldn't wait until I told you that. Yeah, I came in cause this is ridiculous, Tony. You said you had a bad feeling, and actions speak louder than words. And I was like, did I punch any babies? Come on. What? Oh, wow. You gotta be kidding. You have to punch a baby to be a bad person? You said it like it was the worst thing I'd ever done. You'd ever seen anybody do. You are a thief, Eric. Everybody does that. No, not everybody does that. My meemaw taught me that. Well, your meemaw must be a pretty bad person, too. She's taught you some pretty terrible habits. My meemaw was a beautiful woman. Oh, my goodness. You're not speaking of meemaw, dude. Yeah, but can I just ask why? Why 20 packets of sugar? What do you use them for? It's Splenda. First off, it's not sugar. Right, it's Splenda. Big difference. Yeah, which I guess is harder to buy yourself. It's more expensive. That doesn't mean you can steal it from someplace like a coffee shop. I pay for the coffee, and I get to take as many splendas as I want. That's what it's there for. You can do it, too. No, you get to Use as many splendas as you want while you're there. Yeah, I mean, she kind of has a good point. Like, if everybody went in and took 20 packets of sugar and Splenda, they'd spend more money on that than the actual coffee. They would refill it. They do. I know. Do you, like, take photos of the ketchup home after you're done using it there? Do you take on the salt and pepper shakers, too? Use them for your meal, so they're yours now? No, that's different. It's not different. It's not different. How is that different? You are a thief. Either way, you're stealing from the establishment. Wow, Tony, you are angry. Hey, Tony, if you had such a big problem with it, why didn't you say something? We had just met. I didn't feel like it was my responsibility to scold you for stealing. I just can't believe that you're yelling at me for taking packets of Splenda. I can't believe you're not in jail for stealing. Okay, now that's a little extreme. Oh, yeah. They're gonna catch me one day. The big criminal is slender Bandit. Oh, I'm on the lamb. I hope they do well before they lock Eric up for life. Tony, would you like to go out on a second date with him? We'll pay for it. Oh, come on. No, I would not. Are you sure? He's a bad boy. I thought all women like bad boys. No, absolutely not. Eric, your Karma is gonna catch up to you someday. And I hope it was worth it for all the splendor. Well, you know what? I don't wanna go out on a date with you either, because you're crazy, all right? Crazy? What? Well, I'm crazy. hold on, hold on. No, I'm not gonna hold on. No, this is absolute bullshit!

But then I handed her the video I'd taken 20 minutes earlier and watched her face as she realised everyone now knew the truth. My little sister was born two months prematurely, came out bluer than a Smurf, and spent the first three years of her life hooked up to tubes and machines. Naturally, my parents were super protective of her. They'd stay by her side, buy every toy she wanted, and demand I ditch hanging with friends to babysit her. At first, I thought this was right. She was my chronically ill baby sister. But then she got older, she got healthier. She know longer needed tubes or machines and could live normally. However, by this point, she had Learned that being sick got her whatever she wanted, whether that be materialistic things or just sympathy and attention. It started with her headaches mysteriously coming back whenever she was doing homework. My parents would take the homework away before replacing it with ice cream. And by the time Emma turned 11 and I was 16, she had perfected her act. And that really bothered me because her pain only struck during my moments. I made varsity soccer. She developed mysterious stomach cramps that required my parents to leave my first game early. When I got accepted into college, she collapsed during my Celebration dinner and we spent the night in the ER, where doctors found nothing. Wrong. The worst part was how she'd smirk at me when our parents weren't looking. She even practiced her pain faces in the mirror. I tried showing my parents once, but Emma had already told them I was jealous of the attention she needed for her condition. My boyfriend Jake lasted eight months before Emma got to him. She created fake screenshots of messages where I supposedly called her a faker and wished she would just die already. The breakup happened at a coffee shop. Jake slid his phone across the table while showing me the evidence Emma had compiled. He said he couldn't be with someone who treated their sick sister so cruelly. Emma texted me a selfie wearing the hoodie Jake had given me. That was my breaking point. For five years, I had watched her steal everything. So I started watching her closely. Way more closely than anyone ever had. And I noticed a pattern. Every time she was in pain, she always grabbed her right side. Whether that's her head, her kidney. Always right side. She always

My mother has always believed every room exists for her grand entrance. And I don't mean that in the cute, she lights up a room kind of way. I mean it like, if there was a funeral, she'd show up in sequence. My sister got her master's degree. Mom spent the entire graduation dinner talking about how she made it all possible by giving birth to her. It started small, almost dismissible. At my eighth birthday party, she blew out my candles because this smoke was getting in her eyes. By high school, she turned every parent teacher conference into a performance review of her parenting skills, while my grades sat ignored on the desk. When my brother James got into med school, she threw a party for herself with a cake that said, proud mother of a future doctor. James wasn't even in half the photos. We Learned to work around her like she was bad weather. My sister started having two parties. James stopped sharing good news until after it happened, and I just went quiet. We thought we had her figured out until James met Sarah, the sweet kindergarten teacher who somehow saw the best in everyone, even my mother. They dated for seven years while mom tried everything to break them up because Sarah wasn't good enough for her baby boy. She crashed their date nights, claiming emergencies and told Sarah's Parents that James was exploring his options when they got engaged. She wore black to the announcement dinner, telling everyone she was in mourning for her son's freedom. And then she pulled her biggest stunt yet. The wedding. James had begged her to behave and bought her a beautiful navy blue dress the morning of the ceremony. She agreed to wear it, and we all felt so relieved. But we should have known better. I was helping James with his cuff links when I heard gasps from the corridor. And then I saw her. My mother, floating down the hallway in a full white wedding dress with a train, a veil, the works. Hers was more elaborate than Sarah's simple, elegant choice. She'd bought it in secret, hidden it at her sister's house, and had been planning this moment for months. James went pale as he processed what was happening. Seven years of Sarah's patience, thousands in deposits, 200 guests waiting, and our mother had turned it into her show. She brushed past us, adjusting her veil with practiced nonchalance. Oh. Oh, this old thing. I just thought it would be nice to feel included. That's when it clicked. Watching my brother's shoulders slump as he texted Sarah not to come out yet, I realized I could either let her ruin this day or make her the center of attention in a way she'd never forget. I grabbed the largest glass of red wine I could find from the reception. Setup and asked the bartender to fill it to the brim. Then I made my approach through the crowd of whispering relatives, calculating the angle like I was lining up a pool shot. She was holding court near the altar, surrounded by horrified aunts, spitting some story about how traditions are meant to be challenged. I walked up, turned to gesture at something behind her, and executed the most perfectly choreographed accident of my life. The wine hit her dress like abstract art, a massive crimson splash across the pristine white that spread fast through the fabric. The veil turned pink. Train looked like a crime scene. I dropped to my knees immediately, groveling and sobbing about my clumsiness. Oh, god, mom, I'm so sorry. Your beautiful dress. I even produced actual

Sounds like it's true. Well, I don't think it was the whole time. Okay, dude, if you were flirting with any man that was dressed as a clown for any amount of time, I feel like that means that you must like him a lot, because clowns are not easy to be attracted to.

My seven year old daughter came home from school with a strange question. Mommy, why does the crossing guard know where I live? My heart stopped. Our crossing guard had been there for months. Friendly, helpful, always waving at the kids. But Lily said he'd been asking questions. What time does daddy leave for work? Which window is your bedroom? Do you walk to school alone on Wednesdays when Mommy has appointments? He'd even asked if we had a dog, security cameras, or if grandma ever babysat overnight. Lily mentioned he knew our car wasn't working and that we'd been walking more often. I thought she was confused until I checked our neighborhood app. Three other parents posted similar concerns. The crossing guard was asking their kids about family schedules, home layout. Who had he's? One mom said he offered to walk her daughter home when she missed the bus. Another said he'd asked her son about the family's vacation plans and whether they used a house sitter. A third parent mentioned he'd been asking about which kid had working parents versus stay at home moms. The school said they'd hired him through a temp agency. He passed all background checks. They insisted. But something felt terribly wrong. Why would a crossing guard need to know our children's bedroom windows? Why was he memorizing our daily routines? Why did he care about our work schedules and home security? At first, I Told Lily to stay close to her teacher after school. But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. Crossing guard with no real credentials, just watching our children, gathering information. I decided to test him. The next morning, I told Lily to say daddy was going out of town for work. A complete lie. Within an hour, I got a text from an unknown number. Heard your husband's traveling. I could check on you and Lily if you need help. The message included details about our house that only someone who'd been watching would know. Our broken porch light, the loose gate latch, even that our neighbor's dog bark

Hi, can I speak to Marissa, please? Yeah, this is she. Hi, Marissa. My name is Ashley. Um, we don't know each other, but I'm a friend of one of the girls you work with. Rachel Ra. Rachel Mill? Yes, Rachel Mill. Okay. Yeah. What can I do for you? Okay, so, um, this is gonna sound very like seventh grade, and I apologize, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't stepping on anybody's toes. Um, I was at the softball game on Friday night, and I got to meet Ryan. Okay. And, uh, anyways, long story short, I was thinking about asking him out, and Rachel was all like, well, you might want to check with my coworker Marissa first. I think they're dating. Oh, okay, I, I don't. Yeah, I mean, okay, I know this is all kind of goofy, but I just didn't want to be that person who comes in and ask a guy out when somebody else is already interested. Plus, I didn't want to embarrass myself. No, yeah, I get that. I just. So I'm guessing by the tone of your voice, then something is going on then? I mean, yeah, like, it's nothing officially going on, but, I mean. But you guys are, like, into each other? I, I guess you could describe it that way. Okay. That's all you had to say. I 100% respect that. So, I mean, have you guys gone out yet? I mean, I'm not Gonna say we've been on, like, an official date or anything? Like, I respect you calling. I just thought. I just feel like, like you're friends with my coworker. You said Rachel, right? Rachel, yes. Why? It's weird that, like, she just like, gave you my number. Like, she could have just like, come up to me and ask me. Like, she was at the game too. It. Yeah, I'm sorry. Like I said, I know this is all really weird cause we don't know each other and everything. Oh, no, no, no. I'm not like, mad. Of course. Like, it's all good. I totally, like, appreciate that you're calling. I just, like, never, like, I've never had this happen. The whole thing is like, I actually asked a guy out one time and then found out that he was already sleeping with another girl when I asked him out. So I was like, I do not want this happening again. Oh, yeah, no, I totally get it. I just don't like taking it back. Like, when Rachel told me about you guys, I was like, do you think they're sleeping with each other? And she was like, look at Ryan. Wouldn't you sleep with him? Oh, my god. Well, I mean, really trying to keep this, like, low key out of the whole, like, work gossip circle, which is just like, insane. So obviously we're not doing as good as the job as I thought, so. Yeah, I don't Think so? Cause, I mean, Rachel, like, what she said was, I mean, she was pretty sure about it, and that's why she had me call you. Yeah, no, I respect that, and I'll thank her, but it's just good to know. And thanks for calling. Yeah, definitely. Nice to meet you. No problem, no problem. Okay, so after hearing all this, the consensus is, oh, yeah, she's definitely sleeping with him. I mean, like, in fact, I'd say this is all new. And if I had to guess, I would say they've probably only done it once, and it was recently, but they've definitely done it. Okay, so that's your theory. Andy, what do you think? I, I don't know what to think. Okay, well, it's possible that maybe Ashley's jumping the gun here. What we can do is we can pull the audience and hear what they have to say, and then maybe they disagree with her synopsis of this whole thing. Do you want us to try that? Sure, I guess.

One day, my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking, so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today, and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body, so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a seven year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept Bouncing between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me, and I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time, a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary, so they Sent me. I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said I remember you.

But I don't want her to know who I am. Of course, because if he, like, made this whole open marriage thing up. Yeah, yeah, he lied. I do not want his wife to know who I am. Okay, so you want to hear his wife say, yes, we have an open marriage. Or. Or no. What the hell are you talking about? But you want to stay anonymous just in case. Absolutely. Okay. And if she says no, we're definitely not in an open marriage. Are you going to stop seeing David? 100%. Because I'm not okay with that. Okay. Do you have his wife's phone number? No. Okay, uh, now, obviously you have his. Uh. Huh. Okay, so we'll have to get her number from him then. Um, what kind of vehicle does he drive? David? Um. What. What's old Davy boy rolling in? He has a Tahoe. It's white. Okay, great. Perfect. Sit tight, and then we'll sort all this out when we come back next. Um, now, the first thing we had to do to make all this happen was get the wife's name and phone number. We did that during commercial break. I'm gonna play you just an abbreviated version of the phone call we just had with David. David is the guy. He's the married guy. Hi, can I speak to David, please? Uh, this is David. Hey, David, this is Jack. Harlow, I'm calling from American Mutual Insurance. Um, we're the company that just absorbed the Old Agency that was handling your auto policy. So I just want to introduce myself cause I'm gonna be your new point of contact if you have any questions or any changes done to your policy. Um, I'm gonna be sending you an email as well with all my contact info. This is really just kind of informal. Hello? To introduce myself, that's all. So, hold on. Um, so my policy isn't with travelers anymore? No, it still is. Um, we're the agency that oversees it. So your policy is still the exact same on the old Tahoe? Um, rates aren't going up or anything like that? Same coverage. Um, nothing major has changed. We're just combining agencies, that's all. Oh, okay, I got you. And yeah, and I believe we have your wife's policy with us as well. I think her name is Kate. Or is it. Or is it Catherine? Oh, it's. It's. It's both, actually. She's probably listed as Catherine, though. Yeah, I think I see that here. Although, you know what? I don't have and I don't see a current contact number for her for some reason. That part is blank. Is there a good number I can put down if we need to contact her for any reason? Yeah, yeah. Uh, do you want work or her cell? Oh, cell number is fine. Okay, hold on, let me. I never memorized Numbers? Yeah, let me put that up. Uh, seven, five. Seven five. Uh huh. Two, five. Great. Okay, got it though. That's all the info we needed. Thanks a lot, David. Oh, no problem. Nice to meet you. And that's how you get somebody's phone number. Easy, as long as you know what vehicle they're driving. Do you know when he. When I asked for his wife's number and he said, hang on a second, and he had looked up in his phone? Natalia, across the board for me. Mouths a phrase, how do you not know your own wife's number? Yeah, she says that to me like, how do you not know your own wife's number? And I'm like, I know. I know my wife's number. Yeah. Without. Without looking it up. Same with Paul's number. So I can do. Yeah. Shady. Shady dude. Alright, so we have the number, and now we are going to call, um, Catherine. Kate or Catherine? Yeah, this would be her. And you know you're gonna be the one doing this, right? Yes. Okay, I'm making sure I'm ready. Alright.

Yes, it is. How are you? I'm great. Good morning. What can I do for you? Good morning. Um, well, I actually have a question. Oh my god. About a date that you went on. One of our listeners emailed us about you and I'll just get the brass tax. I can tell you're a business kind of guy. Yeah, he straight to the point here. Okay, whatever. Do what you need to do. Alright, so here's the deal. You recently went out with a girl named Heather. You remember going out with Heather? I do remember going out with Heather, yes. Why are you asking me about it now? Well, because Heather emailed us saying that after your date, which was the most romantic date she's ever been on, by the way. After your date, you stopped texting her and she's wondering why. Wow, that is a. That's a real grown up move there, Heather. What? Wait, I don't get it. Like, are you upset by that? Are you being sarcastic? Or that she emailed the radio station to complain about why I'm not calling her after our date. So this wasn't even that crazy of a first date for you? For me? No. For her? It was for her? Yes. Okay, I knew. I knew it would be that way. And that's. I mean, it was all by design. You knew it would be that way? Okay, wait, I'm confused. The way she described You. You were charming, you were romantic. And right now you're coming off as kind of a smug a hole. Well, uh, you called me in the middle of my business day. In a situation like this, I'm not gonna be particularly happy about it. Whoa. Alright, so we can get you on the phone as quick as possible. If you wouldn't mind just telling us why you're not wanting to talk to her. Look, we had a lovely time and I got what I wanted out of the date. Get what you wanted out of it? But you. Yeah, she. You didn't even kiss her at the end. What did you want out of it? Dinner. If you must know, I did it for a business deal. What? You did it for a business deal? Going out with her? I don't get it. Yeah, I sometimes do business with her father. Yeah, she told us that. She mentioned that it might be a good idea that I date her. So I. I called her up and I took her on the best date of her life. Oh, so you're telling me that you used her as a stepping stone in your little effing career? I'm not saying that, no. But I will tell you that two days later, I close the deal. You are like, oh my. So once the money comes. So you took her out just to close a deal with her father? Not just to close A deal. We had a nice time. She had a nice time. I'm sure wasn't a wasted night in her life. Yes, it was. You were texting her afterwards, and you couldn't wait to see her again. You played with her emotions. You totally let her on. You're a total. Haha! Jeez, Brooke. Look, you can call me names all you want, but I'm just being honest with you guys. You called me, and I'm the one closing multimillion dollar deals on a regular basis. Whoa. Yeah, but you didn't have to, like, use people. I mean, couldn't you just go, yeah, sure, I'll go out with your daughter and take her on a regular date and not try to be super romantic about it? So I should take her on a date? Hey, I don't know. Maybe you just don't use his daughter at all, and you're actually a good businessman and you make a deal without having to use somebody's daughter in the process of it. Listen, sweetheart, in business, you do whatever you need to do to close the deal, okay? I close the deal. The day that you're doing things like that, you can come talk to me, but I'm the one who closes my business. Oh, my goodness. And by the way, her dad offered her

Why are you texting me, bro? Really unblocked me haha. Are you happy with him? With Antonio? Yeah, he makes me happy. Why are you asking me? Does he treat you right? Uh, yeah. Why are you texting me asking these questions? Lol. Does he know your McDonald's order or your mom's name? Bro? What? Lol no. I haven't even told him about my mom. Wait, why are you being weird? You literally haven't texted me in two years. Why are you now? Because I love you, Val. I never did not. That's beautiful, bro. You can't call me bro. You broke up with me a whole year ago. I know, and I'm sorry, but please give me a chance to explain. Now you wanna text back? What is there to explain? How you treated me like I wasn't even a thought in your head after our five years together. And now you wanna come back because I'm with someone new? He doesn't know you like I do. What does that even matter, bro? You left me. Why do you wanna come back? I don't wanna come back. I just need to know if he's good for you. He's good to me. He doesn't know you the way I do. You like good morning texts, so I made sure to call you beautiful every morning. You claim you don't like romance movies, but once you watch one, you always tear up at the sad parts and then end Up, smiling at the cute ones. You claim you love horror movies and act tough, but you just doesn't want anyone to know how scared you are. So I made sure to hug on to you tightly. You hate eggs but love the ones from IHOP for some reason. You say you hate the winter because of the icy roads and how cold it is, but won't hesitate to play outside in the snow. You have a total of 13 freckles on your face, but hate the ones on your nose so it made you feel better when someone compliments them. On January 21st, 2020, on my birthday, we went to a cute coffee shop. You bought me a drink and I bought our breakfast. I got a breakfast sandwich, and you got bacon and jelly toast. While we were eating, your toast slid from out your head and onto your lap. We thought it was so funny because it fell in slow motion, which it didn't, but it made it funnier. And from then on I called you jelly even though you hated it. But deep down it was an US thing, so it made you happy. And I know it did, so don't even deny it. Your Starbucks order is always the same a pink drink with a scoop of matcha and vanilla cold foam on top. During fall season, you always switch it to pumpkin spice lattes, which you hate but drink to fill in season. You collect trinkets But only shiny ones, because it's what interests you. Your favourite day is Thursday, but only because it's the day before Friday, which means that the weekend comes sooner. On August 15th, 2021. You gave me a matching glass butterfly bracelet you wore every day. But I never had mine on my wrist. That made you sad because I wasn't wearing it. But a few weeks later, when you asked me to buy a movie tickets online to see a film, I asked you to grab my wallet. And when you opened it, the bracelet fell out and snapped, and the glass shattered. Made you sad. Even though I didn't care for it, you brought it to me and apologized for breaking it. I was a little upset, but I couldn't stay mad at you. We made up, watched our movie in the cinema. We both went to our homes. I spent weeks putting together the last beads. But instead of making it into a bracelet again, I used it for our anniversary gift to make you that necklace. And then we switched jewelry. You gave me your bracelet, and I gave you the necklace, remember? You never took it off. And that's something I love about you. You never get tired of the same thing. That's why I knew you'd never get tired of me. Your loyalty is truly beautiful, jelly. So if he can recognize all of that, then he's the one for you. I don't even know what to Say if you still love me

Why are you texting me, bro? Really unblocked me haha. Are you happy with him? With Antonio? Yeah, he makes me happy. Why are you asking me? Does he treat you right? Uh, yeah. Why are you texting me asking these questions? Lol. Does he know your McDonald's order or your mom's name? Bro? What? Lol no. I haven't even told him about my mom. Wait, why are you being weird? You literally haven't texted me in two years. Why are you now? Because I love you, Val. I never did not. That's beautiful, bro. You can't call me bro. You broke up with me a whole year ago. I know, and I'm sorry, but please give me a chance to explain. Now you wanna text back? What is there to explain? How you treated me like I wasn't even a thought in your head after our five years together. And now you wanna come back because I'm with someone new? He doesn't know you like I do. What does that even matter, bro? You left me. Why do you wanna come back? I don't wanna come back. I just need to know if he's good for you. He's good to me. He doesn't know you the way I do. You like good morning texts, so I made sure to call you beautiful every morning. You claim you don't like romance movies, but once you watch one, you always tear up at the sad parts and then end Up, smiling at the cute ones. You claim you love horror movies and act tough, but you just doesn't want anyone to know how scared you are. So I made sure to hug on to you tightly. You hate eggs but love the ones from IHOP for some reason. You say you hate the winter because of the icy roads and how cold it is, but won't hesitate to play outside in the snow. You have a total of 13 freckles on your face, but hate the ones on your nose so it made you feel better when someone compliments them. On January 21st, 2020, on my birthday, we went to a cute coffee shop. You bought me a drink and I bought our breakfast. I got a breakfast sandwich, and you got bacon and jelly toast. While we were eating, your toast slid from out your head and onto your lap. We thought it was so funny because it fell in slow motion, which it didn't, but it made it funnier. And from then on I called you jelly even though you hated it. But deep down it was an US thing, so it made you happy. And I know it did, so don't even deny it. Your Starbucks order is always the same a pink drink with a scoop of matcha and vanilla cold foam on top. During fall season, you always switch it to pumpkin spice lattes, which you hate but drink to fill in season. You collect trinkets But only shiny ones, because it's what interests you. Your favourite day is Thursday, but only because it's the day before Friday, which means that the weekend comes sooner. On August 15th, 2021. You gave me a matching glass butterfly bracelet you wore every day. But I never had mine on my wrist. That made you sad because I wasn't wearing it. But a few weeks later, when you asked me to buy a movie tickets online to see a film, I asked you to grab my wallet. And when you opened it, the bracelet fell out and snapped, and the glass shattered. Made you sad. Even though I didn't care for it, you brought it to me and apologized for breaking it. I was a little upset, but I couldn't stay mad at you. We made up, watched our movie in the cinema. We both went to our homes. I spent weeks putting together the last beads. But instead of making it into a bracelet again, I used it for our anniversary gift to make you that necklace. And then we switched jewelry.

Mom and dad are gone on. Jen, I've been calling mom for hours, and now I know why she hasn't picked up. Oh my god, no, this can't be true. Jenna, I'm losing it right now. Mom and dad were all I had. I'm only 12 now I have no one and nowhere to go. Wait. I mean, no, no, you still have me. I'm here for you. I'll take you in one. You aren't alone. Jenna, I can't even think right now, I'm so scared.

No, babe, I am all she has. Grandma and granddad left us last year. Ugh. Fine. But you're going to have to take care of her every need. I don't need a liability in my life. I didn't account for a liability. Johnny, Why are you being so mean? I'm allowing your little sister into my house. That's all you need from me. You know what? Whatever. Fine.

Our parents literally just left us only three weeks ago. Of course I'm showing her all my attention. She's still hurt, just like me. Listen, Jenna. Yeah, I don't care. You know how I get when my needs haven't been met. You can't go three weeks without anything. No, and on top of that, you even make me take care of her when you have to go to work. She eats up our food, and I have to spend extra on her like she's my child or something. I didn't sign up to be a goddamn babysitter! Wow. Now I see you for who you really are. Babe, we are literally only 20. Why does this little girl have to be your responsibility? I don't deserve to have to take up for someone Who isn't my responsibility. I put in extra hours at work just so I can make enough to feed us all. And in return, I'm getting less attention. And no woohoo! I'm tired. I'm finally starting to see your true colors. You're a selfish, self centered narcissist. Dad only cares about himself. You know that. Me and my sister are grieving, but all you care about is how you're not getting as much attention. Listen, Jen, I'm not about to argue with you. It's either me or the her. You pick you, Johnny. I'm taking my sister and then we're leaving. Where is she? Whatever, I don't even care anymore.

And he's just short by a tiny bit. How much is he short? Only 48 thousand dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short forty eight thousand dollars? Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes, yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money! Hold on, he makes $200 a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. 50,000 dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom, my brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this. When you managed our finances, we were always in the red because you kept funneling money to your family. Now we finally saved a bit and you're pulling this again? You're his brother in law. He's buying a car for his wedding. Such an important event. Just help him out when he has Money later. He'll definitely take care of you. Ha! I'm going to call your brother right now. Call? What for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me too? And $48,000? I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car, and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question. But you can't lend me $5,000? Is at the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000, so why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally? I have zero responsibility toward you. Spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death situation. I'm done talking To you? I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now! Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

Were you cheating on me? You know what? Yes, I was. Because Charlie provides for me in ways you could never. I need you, babe. Please don't do this. Quit texting me. We're done, babe. Hello? Hey. Wasn't expecting a text from you. Haha. How are you? I'm doing well. How about you? I'm sorry for what I did, baby. I wanna make this work with you. I was influenced by social media and my friends to dump you because you couldn't give me a lavish lifestyle. Happily married now. And I also used my saved money for the big plan I had. I may not have a lavish lifestyle, but I'm the happiest man alive. What did you save that money for? I need to know. If you knew before, you would have stayed. But I'm glad I didn't tell you. You showed me your true self.

See, that's what my friend said she was like. Any guy that prefers dating during the week but won't see you on the weekends either has a weekend girl or is married. And you're his secret side piece.

He just sounds married. It's a married person job. I mean, I. I guarantee he's married, has kids and everything. Okay, pump your brakes here. When. When you guys go out? Heather, you said it's during the week? Yes. Does he ever seem like he's trying to be secretive when you're together? And by that, I mean, like, does he say, let's meet somewhere instead of picking you up? Does he take you places that are like 45 minute drives out of town? That kind of stuff? No, not really. We're pretty open. With our dating. So like, for instance, like on Valentine's Day, he took me to the melting pot and he kissed me in the parking lot in front of everybody. So. Okay, it doesn't mean he's not married. I mean, what if his family like, lives in another town and he just works here? I don't know. I mean, I met him on a dating website and he basically talked about how hard dating is. He told me about his ex girlfriend. He just doesn't sound like he's married. Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, he could have just been making all of that up. We know people like that. Okay, so. So you want us to do what, Heather? Find out if he's married. That would be a great part. Yeah. Okay. And I guess maybe find out why he's always busy on the weekends. I mean, maybe he just likes to have alone time on the weekends. We don't know, but we can find out. Hang on the line so we can get his number from you. Okay? Okay. Okay. How much money do you wanna put on this whole married thing? How much money? Yeah, how much money you wanna bet? I don't know. I don't wanna bet money. I mean, it's. It's dirty work Wednesday. How about this? How about if.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me. Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh, really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your tech support agent sending you willy pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you. Anyway, we're done. Wait. Not only did you cheat on me, but it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better and pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me, bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Tight. What do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries his Laptop in a suitcase. So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make a e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it once he sends it. Block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's gotta work in fast food now. And he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. But it's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favorite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10. He'll get a warning with this. Do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food now. He can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water. Add on that if he does this, he get. It's $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

What outdated tech did your grandparents hilariously misuse? My Grandma Marsha is the sweetest human alive but has absolutely zero tech knowledge. Like, still uses a flip phone in 2022 level of tech illiterate. I was staying with her for a couple weeks during summer break because my parents were renovating our house and it was uninhabitable with all the construction dust and noise. Grandma lives in this cute little house she's been in since forever, and she has this spare bedroom that's basically a time capsule from when my mom was a teenager. Anyway, the first night I'm there, I'm unpacking and I find this ancient iPod classic in the dresser drawer. Like the chunky silver one with the click wheel from literally 2,005 or something. And I'm low key obsessed because it's such a vibe. So I plug it in to see if it still works. Miracle of miracles, this thing actually turns on after charging. The battery is trash, but it works when plugged in. I start scrolling through the music and O M G. It's all these amazing early 2,000 songs my mom must have loaded on there. Lots of Usher, Black Eyed Peas, Avril Lavigne. Absolute Gold. So I'm using this thing occasionally in the evenings while I'm staying there, mostly with headphones, but sometimes playing it through its tiny little speaker when I'm in my room. Grandma sees it a couple times but doesn't say anything. Just gives it curious looks about a Week into my stay, I noticed grandma is acting weird. She keeps checking the mail anxiously and making these concerned faces at me when she thinks I'm not looking. I figured maybe she was worried about a Bill or something, but whenever I asked if everything was okay, she'd just smile and say, oh, yes, dear, everything's fine. But it was not fine. I could tell she was stressed about something. She started taking phone calls and whispers out on the porch, which she never does. And one day I overheard her talking to her friend Amy on the landline about being worried about money, which was super weird because grandma is usually pretty comfortable financially. Then one afternoon, I come home from meeting up with some friends and find grandma sitting at the kitchen table with her checkbook out, looking absolutely devastated. Her eyes are all red like she's been crying. I immediately panic and ask what's wrong, and she just pushes this envelope.

Hey, dad. How's my favourite camper? Everything there alright? We're all about to turn in for the night. How'd you like your first day? I hated it. What? How could you hate it? I had so much fun when I was there. At your age, it's not fun at all. Not fun? Why? The food is crap, my legs are sore, and all the other campers are assholes. Watch your language. The other campers keep saying it. Just don't be like them. Fine. Is that creepy old cabin on the other side of the lake still there? Yeah, we passed by it as we were canoeing to the campsite. You wouldn't believe the stories about that thing the counselors mentioned. Some of them. I think the lake is a bit creepier than I thought. What do you mean? Why? One of the campers drowned there 18 years ago. He was out there swimming by himself when no counselors were around. The weird part is they never found a body, even though they searched the whole lake. Oh, Darling. Sounds like a spooky campfire story. We already told those, and they were dumb. True stories are scarier to me. Well, you stay safe there, okay? I will, dad. Don't worry. I'll talk to you in the morning, okay? Sounds good. We love and miss you, Jade. We'll see you in two weeks. Good night, dad. Good night, Jade. Dad, are you awake? Dad, what is it? Are you okay? Something really messed up just happened. What? All the camp counselors are gone. All their beds are bloody, like someone dumped a bucket of blood into the blankets. Jade, you need to call the police right now. This is serious. Did you hear me? What's happening there? Everyone's freaking out. Has anyone called the police? Yes, someone already did. They told us to stay put and that they'll be here soon. The nearest police station is an hour away. From what I remember, some of the kids are talking about grabbing the flashlights and running into woods. Don't leave the campsite, Jade. Stay exactly where you are until the police arrive, okay? Do you hear me? They're leaving now. Stay put. Don't follow them. I'm serious, Jade. Okay. Dad, what do you think happened to those counselors? Do you think it could have been an animal or something? It's just weird that their bodies are nowhere to be found. I don't know, Jade, but just remain calm. The police will be there soon. I'm really freaked out, dad. I know. Keep your head down and breathe in and out. They're screaming coming from the woods. Don't go in there. It sounds like they're being hurt or something. Like they're being attacked. Jade, listen to me. The number one priority right now is for you remain safe. Tell me everything that's going on around you right now. We're all huddled together. People are crying and really scared. Some people are running. Away! Dad, am I going to die? No, of course you are not going to die. Nothing's going to happen to you. Something's coming out of the woods. Find some place to hide and stay there. I repeat, stay there and do not move at all. Okay. I just crawled underneath a bed.

Forgot to tell me what? That you won't go with us? And you're telling me this after I took a week Off work and told my friends I'm going to a trip with my girl. Then prepared for a surprise. I won't tell you on a trip that I fully paid for. Look, I'm so sorry, babe. All of my friends really appreciate you. We will love you. And they all said you're a great guy for this. They wanna hang out with you after this trip. I organized everything for both of us. Me and you. I paid for everything. I only accepted Ava because you wanted her. Tell me you're joking. Please. That is so, so generous of you. I didn't think it would bother you that much, to be honest, because I know you're not an insecure boyfriend. This has nothing to do with insecure. I wanted to spend time with you. I was going to propose on your birthday. Mia, how can you do this? I'm really sorry, babe, but you're always so serious. This was my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink, and we will just go to fun places and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you. Right, but sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood for me. I'm only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry, babe. But I will make it up for you. When I come back, you can propose to me. We should go to another trip. Just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places. Eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam? Hello? Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey, babe. We're at the receptionist. They can't seem to find your name, though.

He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow. Ello. Oh. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back.

Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father.

Apparently he's been working at a restaurant for about two years. Last couple months he got a new manager who is just horrible. Yeah, he even told us a story about how she threw a potato at his head. So his problem is he's trying to figure out the best way possible to quit with flare so that she feels it. And that's why he wants to do an awkward Tuesday phone call today. Lou, are you ready? I'm ready. I, I already have another job. I'm not worried. I, I have to tell this woman she's going down. All right, okay, so you're hyped up, you're ready to go? Ready? Ready.

I'm Facetiming Logan, and I can't even hear him over you gaming. Okay, I'll be more quiet, but on one condition. If you stop making all those freaky sounds with him over Facetime. I can hear them, you know, it's just weird, Kyle. I mean, I'm willing to, like, turn a blind eye and not tell mom, but you have to promise that you won't bring Logan over when I'm here. That little chode pisses me the hell off. That's not fair. You're always home. Well, too bad. Guess Mom's finding out about your mysterious sounds at three in the morning. Wait. Okay, fine. But why don't you like him? He just gives off a bad vibe. I can just feel that he's hiding something. And he's constantly on my tip bro. Always hating, thinking he's better than me. Can you stop dissing my boyfriend? I will come over there and beat you right now if you keep pissing me off. Rizz AP says the only beating that's going on is you beating your bean. The only beating that's going on is you beating your bean, Kyle. I'll be quiet. Just stop whimpering, please. Good night. Haley, I have to tell you something really important. No, you don't. You never do. No, I'm being serious right now. I saw Logan with another girl at this party last night. Well, then it's not Logan. Logan's a senior, and you're a freshman. What? Would a senior be doing at a freshman party? Yeah, I know. That's the weird part. The girl he was talking to was a freshman. But it was 100% Logan. I'm sure of it. Like my personal beef with him aside, I don't think you should trust him anymore, Haley. And why would I choose to listen to you? I still trust Logan and he still loves me. What ever. Just know when he cheats on you. Or worse, don't come back apologizing for not believing me. Not happening, because he would never cheat on me. Haley, you have to break up with Logan right now. I already told you, I'm not listening to you. I don't care who you saw doing what. Haley, just listen for once. Remember the party that I saw Logan and the freshman at? You mean fake Logan? Yeah, I wanted to believe that too, but after today I'm 100% sure it's Logan. And why is that? I just saw the both of them at a cafe on like a date. Then when I made eye contact with Logan, he immediately got up and pretended he didn't know the freshman that he was talking to. If it wasn't the real Logan, why would he be scared of some random guy looking at him quickly? Maybe the guy just didn't wanna be seen talking to a freshman. I know Logan. He wouldn't do that. Oh yeah? Text him right now and ask him where he is. Alright, I will. Did you just text him? Five seconds ago? Yeah. How'd you know? I just saw him pull out his phone in the cafe. It's him. Haley, I'm sorry, but I did warn you earlier. It's probably just a coincidence. He just texted me that he was still at his house. Do you have his location? No. God, you're so naive, Haley. Kyle, what the hell did you do? I'm protecting you, that's what I'm doing. Logan just texted me that he's in the hospital and that a bunch of freshman boys jumped him so he couldn't hold off a few. Freshman? What? A baby O'mao. He said it was your friends. Kyle, this is too far. No, it isn't. I'm just trying to keep you safe from that absolute dirtbag. Don't talk to me again, Kyle. Why are you always trying to ruin my life? You'll see soon enough. Kyle, did the freshman that Logan was with have green eyes and wavy black hair? Yeah, her name is Rebecca. She also always wears this hoodie, I think. I can't remember how it looks like. Was it red? Yeah, that was it. It was a blank red hoodie. I'm sorry, Kyle.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me. Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh, really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone. Phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your text support agent sending you Willie pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you anyway, we're done. Wait. Not only did you cheat on me, but it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better in pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me, bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Tight. What do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries His laptop in a suitcase. So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make an e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it. Once he sends it. Block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's gotta work in fast food now. And he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. But it's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favorite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10. He'll get a warning with this. Do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast Food. Now he can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water. Add on that if he does this, he gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me! You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

I can't believe. Shoo! You paired me up with my ex, who cheated on me with the entire football team for the final physics project that could have saved my failing grade. All gaily did the entire time was flirt with me. Then today, when we were supposed to turn the project in, she sent me this. She fed the project to her freaking dog! How could you do this to me? Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face. Sit next to me, Bailey. You completely ruined my life. You're a selfish brat who destroyed our project because I didn't want to get back with you. I'll never be with a girl like you ever again. Oh, come on, Luki Puki. It's not that serious. You know what would be so romantic? Failing this class together because we both gave up on the project to fall in love. Stop with this. You destroyed the project and fed it to your dog, all because I didn't want to be with a bop like you. You're being dramatic. Can't Tina app bring me roast Master robot help me roast my bop X that keeps trying to get me back? Say, what man in their right mind would wife a garden tool?

Ha ha ha! I'll be sitting here waiting for you to come back, my king. Shut it! Mr. Reynolds, I need your help. What's going on, Lucas? Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey? Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything. Wait, I see something. What? Comment part three.

You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay? No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do, could I stop you? Anyway, it's your call. You've changed so much. Feel like I barely know you lately. The old you would have made me come home no matter how late. Can I ask you something, too? Did the old me annoy you? If we're both gonna be miserable, might as well let you have your fun. Babe, I love you. Don't worry. I won't nag you to come home anymore. No more overthinking, either. If you drink too much, crash at your buddies. I get it now. No more micromanaging you or fighting over little things. Babe, I'm touched you feel this way. I'll love you more and more. Hmm. Have a good time with your friends. Hey. We'll do. Babe. Just got off work. You didn't forget what day it is, right? It's my birthday. Going out with Co workers. Wanna join? I'll pass. Don't know your work friends would be awkward. Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Love you. You sure you won't come? I'm sure. Alright. Did you get me a birthday gift? Nope. You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. You've changed. You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to How we were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while. What is it? Let's get a divorce. I'm exhausted. I can't work on this relationship anymore. Lost that spark. Better to split up now. It's best for both of us. Babe, I don't agree. Please don't leave me. I won't go out anymore. Won't stay out all night. Babe, give me one more chance. I know I messed up. That's it. I gotta go. I've already contacted a lawyer. And I think you should too. Let's end this on good terms.

I can't believe. Shoo! You paired me up with my ex, who cheated on me with the entire football team for the final physics project that could have saved my failing grade. All gaily did the entire time was flirt with me. Then today, when we were supposed to turn the project in, she sent me this. She fed the project to her freaking dog! How could you do this to me? Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work in My favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face. Sit next to me, Bailey. You completely ruined my life. You're a selfish brat who destroyed our project because I didn't want to get back with you. I'll never be with a girl like you ever again. Oh, come on, Luki Puki. It's not that serious. You know what would be so romantic? Failing this class together because we both gave up on the project to fall in love. Stop with this. You destroyed the project and fed it to your dog, all because I didn't want to be with a bop like you. You're being dramatic. Can't Tina app bring me roast Master robot help me roast my bop X that keeps trying to get me back? Say, what man in their right mind would wife a garden tool? What man in their right mind would wife a garden tool? Wow. Lucas Shrieley, stop talking to me. I'm going to make sure you and Miss Geisha get what you deserve. Yeah, right. Have fun with that. Ha ha ha! I'll be sitting here waiting for you to come back, my king. Shut it! Mr. Reynolds, I need your help. What's going on, Lucas? Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey. Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything. Wait, I see something. What? Comment part three.

I have been dating Andrew for about eight months now, and I'm in a situation that's making me question everything. When I met Andrew, he mentioned early in our conversation that he was born in Mexico but moved to the US when he was 12. I was immediately interested because I love practicing my languages. But for some reason, I hesitated to mention I spoke Spanish. It wasn't a deliberate choice at first. The topic just shifted, and then the moment passed. On our first date, he got a call from his mom and spoke to her in Spanish. When he hung up, he apologized and explained that he always speaks Spanish with family. I almost told him then that I understood everything, but he looked so comfortable having this private connection to his heritage that I didn't want to take that away from him. So I just smiled and said it was no problem at all. Looking back, this was my first mistake. As we continued dating, it became this weird, unspoken thing. The longer I went without mentioning it, the more awkward it felt to bring up. Hey, by the way, I've understood everything you've been saying to your family for the past three months isn't exactly casual conversation, so I just didn't say anything. At first. It was innocent enough. When his mom would call, he'd speak Spanish and give me a summarized Version. Afterward, I'd nod along even though I understood his mom asking if I was the kind of girl he could bring home and him saying I was different from the others in a good way. It actually made me feel special hearing how he talked about me when he thought I couldn't understand. But about two months ago, things started getting weird. Andrew's cousin Manuel moved in with him temporarily while looking for a job. And suddenly I was hearing a lot more Spanish conversations. And they weren't always flattering. One night, while I was making dinner in Andrew's kitchen, I overheard him and Manuel talking in the living room. Manuel asked when Andrew was going to get serious about finding a real partner instead of wasting time with white girls who don't understand our culture. Andrew didn't defend me. Instead, he said something like, it's not serious with Gianna. She's fun for now, but obviously I'll end up with someone my parents approve of eventually. I nearly dropped the spatula I was holding. We had talked about meeting each other's parents just the week before. He told me in English he was excited for me to meet his family. The disconnect between his English persona and Spanish persona was jarring. After that, I started paying closer attention. When his sister visited and asked in Spanish if I was as boring in bed as I looked, Andrew laughed and said, definitely not, but I'll tell you about it later. When his mom called and asked if I was still too skinny, he agreed and said he was working on getting me to eat more. The final draw came last weekend. We were at a restaurant with Manuel and Andrew's friend Diego. While I was in the bathroom, apparently, Diego asked if Andrew was planning to bring me to his cousin's wedding next month. When I returned to the table, Andrew and his friends switched from Spanish to English so smoothly. I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't caught the tail end of Andrew's response. She's just a placeholder until I move back home. My parents would disown me if I brought home someone who doesn't speak Spanish and doesn't understand our traditions. For eight months, I've been falling in love with someone who saw me as temporary, as less than the placeholder, all because he assumed I couldn't understand what he was saying behind my back. I excused myself, saying I suddenly felt sick, which wasn't a lie, and took an Uber home. Andrew texted me all night asking if I was okay, if he should come over, if I needed anything. I didn't respond until the next morning, when I asked him to meet me at a coffee shop near my apartment. When we sat down, I started the

I once had to call poison control as a grown adult. I was walking by an elephant ear plant pulled off a little bit and was fidgeting with it. Not unlike picking up a random stick as you are walking and screwing with it. My caveman brain kicked in and I popped it in my mouth. Those plants put like a fiberglass kind of thing in your throat. So I had to call poison control. They asked me why I did that and didn't have a solid explanation, so they thought I was mentally disabled. They asked for me to put my parent or caregiver on the phone. I was 30. I don't have any disability, but boy, I sure do some dumb shit sometimes. 2. Sometimes I come home from work and yell NO ONE! I'm HOME! Then I burst into laughter from how lonely I am. Three. I'd be a ridiculously easy lay if any guy who's ever been nice to me dared to ask. 4. I have lost complete control of my bladder due to cancer at 42. I wear adult diapers to work every day. I carry a laptop to work. Not because I need it. I have a perfectly fine desktop at work, but because I can hide my spare diapers in the laptop bag. I go through two or three diapers a day, sometimes more. And Sometimes still manage to leak through, so I hide in my office and work really late so I can sneak out after everyone else left and hide that I pissed myself. I wish I could work from home. 5. I deal with suicidal ideation every day of my life. I can be having a good time and for some reason my brain just says just put a bullet in us and I don't know why. The only reason I haven't is because the couple of people I love would actually be hurt. So I'll stay miserable for them, I guess.

What was the last straw that made you say, nah, I'm out of here? One. His mom had a key to our apartment, and she would just use the key to enter the apartment without even knocking during any time of the day. She'd also jump into his bed if he's in the bed and cuddle with him. We were 26. 2 we wanted to plan a holiday together. I had some suggestions of where to go and asked him for his. He said he didn't know and he'd have to ask his mom what he'd like. 3 he had just purposely, on accident, no, showed a flight that I paid for him. I was asking why he didn't make arrangements when he's known the flight times for two months. I was sobbing, but instead of trying to console me, he gave the phone to his mama and never apologized or paid me back for the flight. Todd, you're still on my shit list for the no show flights. Four. For a while back in high school, I was dating this guy, and his mom kept telling him I wasn't pretty enough for him and he deserved a girl who was really pretty, like a cheerleader or something. He was a pretty average looking 90s boy with bleached blonde hair. I was an alt girl. We weren't totally mismatched, but maybe a little, I guess. Anyway, if I called The house to chat with him. She'd either not answer the phone or lie and say he wasn't around. He called back a few times and apologized for his mom being a bitch. Once I heard her say, why haven't you dumped her and found your princess yet? After a while, it just got annoying. The relationship eventually fizzled out and he ended up dating someone else. She actually called me one time and asked, how the hell did you deal with his mom?

One? Not technically lab results, but on intake, my best friend's pulse ox was 44%. The oxygen she was getting was purely through agonal breathing at that point. She was immediately rushed back, put into a medical coma, and intubated. Life support for four days, ICU for six. She had a triple whammy of influenza, strep throat, and pneumonia. Needless to say, she was incredibly close to death and it amazed everyone that she made it. Two. Sent a patient for an ambulatory sleep study when he was referred to us for suspected sleep apnea. Was very tired and apathetic when he came in. His test came back with an AHL of 127, with the longest apnea episode lasting 77 seconds, essentially meaning he was stopping breathing 127 times every hour. Called him back urgently to start a C pap trial. Moved to V pap and last I had seen him he was happy, cheerful, and about 35 kg lighter than when we initially saw him. Three. Blood pressure of 280 over 186 on a pregnant patient in the field. I'm an EMT. Terrifying. Four. Elderly woman with a pulse rate of 8. I figured the pulse ox was shitting the bed, as they often do, so I told my coworker to take it off the patient and put it on me to check if it was the machine acting weird or not. Coworker put the pulse Ox on me and it showed a normal healthy pulse rate. Almost immediately my coworker and I looked at each other, looked at the patient, looked at each other again, and just went, oh fuck. 5. I recently had a hemoglobin level of 5 and I overheard my nurse telling everyone else at the nurse's station she went to work today with a laugh. IDK if this is extreme, but every nurse and doctor was like, no shit, you're tired all the time.

One. He is so much happier than he was in high school, where people would physically assault him, harass him, and mock him. He has autism and is obsessed with Batman and sharks. The last time I saw him was two years ago when I was walking around my friend's college and he was delighted to see me and even remembered my name where we caught up. And he told me all about how he had been on vacation and got to go out on a boat and see sharks. 2. My dad told me about a kid he went to high school with who used to sit in the back of the class mumbling and giggling to himself all the time. Occasionally he'd pick his nose and eat the results. Despite this, my dad said he was apparently really smart and got all A's. He told me the guy's name, and since it was pretty distinctive, I looked him up online. He was a federal appeals court judge. 3. He renamed himself Green Dragon of the west. He's a network engineer. So okay, I guess. 4. He discovered that he was better at interacting with computers than with people and became a software engineer. 5. Calm down significantly and is happily married now. He acted out in school because he was being abused by his foster parents at home. Nobody knew At the time, 6. I wouldn't say I ran into him, but I occasionally drive past the penny kid walking around slumped in a leather jacket and greasy hair on a hot summer day. I really have no idea what he's doing with his life, but he still seems pretty weird. Back in high school he was always collecting change that he'd find on the ground, and I found out later he actually saved up $500 or so and donated it to charity. I thought a lot differently about him once I found out.

One that the moon can be visible in the daytime. Like, how can you go through life never noticing that? Two. When driving, there's something in between gasping and braking. You can coast to let the car drag in slow a little before turns exits to merge into slower traffic. 3. That the misuse of antibiotics is a legitimate issue. Had my girlfriend tell me that she never finishes her prescriptions because they give her extras and then if she's feeling sick in the future she'll take the extras. 4. Geography of the world I was shocked that a lot of people in my campus thought that Singapore was in Europe. 5. That narwhals are really a thing. My parents thought I had read some fake online article because in what world would a unicorn whale exist? After a few minutes of looking it up on their own, they realized that these weird creatures are in fact real. 6. Mixing two common household cleaners, bleach and ammonia, makes chlorine gas. I saw some memes saying to mix them as it makes a super cleaner and I hope no one bought into it. 7. A pony is not a baby horse. I see this revelation a few times a year on Reddit. A baby horse is a foal. A pony is a small horse, typically a few different breeds. 8. I have a twin sister. I'm a guy. You would be Surprised how often I get asked if we're identical. Nine. That dogs chase animals. I see so many people giving away their dogs because they're chasing my chickens. Um, duh. They're prey driven animals. That's literally what most were made to do.

One. I thought that everybody had to go to a hospital at every three months for a checkup and has their blood sample taken and ultrasound done. Turns out no. My classmates were horrified when I began to explain in detail how certain medical procedures work and where I got my scar on my stomach. To sum it up, I had kidney cancer at the age of four. It was so bad, the surgeon had to remove my whole left kidney. I really thought that this was normal. My father is a cancer survivor. My mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Going to any kind of doctor is basically a family trip for us. Now I am more mindful of how I speak about this, because when I was younger, I used to say things like, and that's how I got my blood drawn 16 times on one day. The face my classmate and her mother made is burned into my head to this day. Two was always tired, sometimes multiple naps a day, sometimes falling asleep doing something. I figured I was just a sleepy person, or maybe it was because of my autoimmune disease. My dad kept telling me I had to see a doctor because how much I slept wasn't normal. Turns out it's type 1 narcolepsy, the worst case my specialist had ever seen. 3 when I was younger, I used to hear The ice cream van at night as well as all throughout the day. One day, I mentioned it to another kid, and they all said I was crazy. Turns out it was a stress reaction from what would go on to be my bipolar. Four. For me, it was that my bed, which is just a box spring with legs, is supposed to have a mattress. I mean, I do, but it's only an inch thick and cushions as much as your hoodie, so, yeah, turns out I've been sleeping on a super hard spring for the past 10 years. Screw you, dad, for cheaping out on my bed. Five, that your partner shouldn't cheat on you. I grew up with my dad constantly cheating on my mom and being her therapist through it. I would go through his phone for her, listen to them fight, and then be the therapist for her the next day. I never knew how bad it was until I met my friend's parents, who loved one another, rarely fought, and never had issues with cheating. When I spoke about the things I knew and how my life played out, they were horrified. I still struggle with being the therapist friend, allowing myself to be treated poorly and cheated on. Six, thinking burnout was just part of working hard. Turns out it's not a badge of honor. It's a big red flag. When I graduated from architecture school and took my first look in the Field. I realized that I had actually had my fill in school twitched careers after that. The harder you work, the more promotable your boss is. Finishing tasks early is always rewarded with more tasks. 7. Hoarding. Grew up in a hoarder house and didn't realize until my teenage years that living in a house covered with hundreds of boxes, decade old food, and cat piss is actually bad for one's health and hygiene. It's also incredibly hard to unlearn. Eight apparently yelling at every minor inconvenience is not normal. I grew up with people who would do that, and I thought everyone did the same. Then one day I was out with my friend and she accidentally took the wrong turn on the highway. Her response was oh, oops, guess I gotta take another route. The responses I'm accustomed to were slamming the steering wheel and yelling curse words out loud and a lot of blaming. I asked my friend, are you not angry you took the wrong turn? She was confused. No, why would I be?

One time he was wearing his pants plumber style and I saw a huge streak of brown going down his crack. When I told him about it, he said he only uses four squares of toilet paper because it's expensive. Three. Her mom accidentally bought too much and wanted to drop off some groceries just in case her daughter needed anything. This woman came to her house with easily $200 to $300 worth of food, toiletries, drinks, soaps, even two bags of name brand beef jerky. It was obvious to me her mom didn't accidentally buy all this stuff. She did it because she loved her daughter and wanted to make sure she was taken care of. My ex then proceeded to yell at her mom and very rudely thanked her before making snide remarks about how she didn't like this brand or flavor. 4. As someone who dated a drinker for four years, I'm sure others have felt similar levels of disgust. The notable incidents were one time he drove home blackout drunk, parked in our neighbour's lawn and passed out on our porch. I found him there in the morning when I was heading to work.

They banned running on the playground during recess. 2. My grade school principal tried to convince me not to call my mother when I broken my arm on the monkey bars. She was upset about that. Three kids came home with a note freaking out that the school was going to force them to allow doctors to look at their privates. Everyone in class was stressed over this. Upon reading the note I had to sign, it said curvature of the spine exam and boys and girls would be screened in private areas. 4. They argued with me about son's safety. Specifically, my son wanted to wear long pants instead of shorts. I let him wear them. They were the same as the required shorts, just longer. The vice principal called me to take me to task and told me that he couldn't possibly get sun damage on his legs because the kids don't stop moving. I told her to cut it out because she knew that was B. S. I live in Australia. Five. They decided children weren't allowed to have a best friend. If 2 kids got along too well, the teachers would intentionally separate them by switching desks, putting them in different groups, not letting them be partners on projects, etcetera. They would even mess with their recess, letting one kid out on time and the second a minute Or so late hoping the first would start playing with other kids before the best friend came out. 6 my kid went on an overnight school trip. I got multiple messages and emails from the principal saying he had snuck out in the middle of the night and jumped off a dock into the lake. When he got home we asked him about it. He started laughing because he thought we were messing with him. He had no idea what we were talking about. My kid can be a turd, so I emailed the principal and a couple of teacher chaperones to get more information. The teachers told me they had no idea what I was talking about. It was the first they were hearing about any incident at camp. The principal went silent, dodged my emails and calls, and a week later apologized to my son by saying, sorry, I must have mistaken you for some wildlife. Tell your mom you're all good. Never heard from her again. 7 my kids elementary school issued a policy that the kid who in an argument delivered the last hit slash blow would be punished. However, they did absolutely nothing about bullying, so often the kid hitting was a kid defending themselves. If someone punched my kid and my kid hit back, my kid would be punished. Once a little girl in first grade was attacked by a much older boy. She was very into martial arts and dislocated his shoulder in The fight. They called in her parents and wanted to start disciplinary action against the girl. The mother very clearly told them to cut the crap and if they failed to protect her daughter, she would make sure the girl could defend herself. 8. They made my husband leave work 40 minutes away to put disinfectant spray and a Band Aid on our eight year old son's slightly scraped knee, which absolutely didn't require either and could have been handled by the kid himself because they're not allowed to administer medicine. 9. They told me that her having headlights wasn't a reason to keep her out of school. And then I understood how she freaking got them. 10. A friend's son goes to a school that has banned all physical contact, including in sports. They can get suspended for any contact whatsoever.

My friend Tyler loved making fun of my anxiety attacks. We've been friends since seventh grade, but somewhere along the way, my panic disorder became his favourite comedy material. Whenever I'd start hyperventilating in public, he dramatically gasped for air and say, oh no, Chris is broken again. Everyone would laugh while I struggled to breathe, my chest tight and vision blurring like I was drowning. He'd introduce me to girls at parties by saying, this is Chris. He malfunctions under pressure. Don't get too close or he might have downtime. I'd stand there, face burning with embarrassment while they'd giggle and avoid eye contact. I would literally back away. I stayed friends with him because I thought that's what I deserved. The worst part was how he'd escalated over the years. If I had an attack during a movie, he pause it and announce to everyone, Chris needs a system reboot. If I panicked before a test, he tell classmates, Chris Dot exe has stopped working. Restaurants, he tell waiters I was buffering when I couldn't order. It got so bad that people started calling me error message Chris behind my back. Even strangers knew about my condition because Tyler made it his signature joke. Last month, Tyler got accepted to Columbia Law School, his absolute dream school, the one he'd been working toward obsessively since freshman year, pulling all nighters and sacrificing everything for his LSAT score. He threw This huge Celebration party at his parents massive house and invited everyone from our friend group, plus extended family, neighbors, and most importantly, the girl he'd been trying to impress for months, Jessica. Jessica was gorgeous, brilliant, and completely out of his league. She was getting her PhD in clinical psychology and had always been genuinely kind to me about my anxiety, even offering helpful breathing techniques. Tyler had been planning to ask her out after the party, convinced that his law school acceptance would finally make him impressive enough to win her over. During his speech, Tyler started getting emotional, talking about his dead grandfather, who had wanted him to be a lawyer but passed away during Tyler's sophomore year. His voice began shaking as he described visiting his grandfather's grave that morning to tell him the news. I could see the signs immediately. The trembling hands, the rapid breathing, the way his eye

One. Got this one from a friend who's a judge. If you get called for jury duty and wanna get out of it, the foolproof way for both sides to throw you out is to say you have a strong respect for law enforcement and if they brought a charge against someone, they must have done something wrong. Even if there's no evidence, you believe they don't arrest innocent people. You'll be home before lunch. Two. Tell your co workers you have terrible hearing. Which personally, is partially true, but it's not nearly as bad as I play it up to be. And everyone feels comfortable whispering around you. I know everything. Three. Really good looking blind people won't care if you're ugly. 4. I had a conference at a hotel during a break. I went out into the hall and dished up a full breakfast. Turns out the meal was for a completely different conference and our conference only had coffee and muffins. So it was accidental and I never did it again. But it would be very easy to do if you needed a meal. Five. Hotels often have fees if you cancel too close to your intended stay. In a lot of cases. You can, however, call them, reschedule into the future, then wait a bit and call again to cancel, but this time without the fees. Six. For any type of web delivered service where your physical location doesn't matter. Digital downloads, event tickets, online credits. Choose a zip code in a place with no sales tax for this purpose. I've memorized 59,901, which is Calispell, Montana. 7 once talked with a homeless man that mentioned he would often empty and clean out a dog food can and refill it with beef stew. He ate it outside of the grocery store while he was asking for money or food and would get hooked up. 8 in my area the building codes are super strict and a lot of the time you won't get permission to tear down a house completely to build a new house. However, if you don't demo the entire house and instead remodel the house, then you'll get permission. So what we have done in the past is literally demo everything except for the fireplace and chimney and literally build a brand new house around it? 9. Get the app for fast food places that have reward points. Anytime you go there or just walk by it. Look for receipts laying on the ground. Scan in the receipts for reward points. Free food. I have already got over $1,600 worth of free food from one app when Menards does their 11% off. Look for rebate receipts laying around the parking lot. Last year I got several hundred dollars of rebates that way. 10. Work as little as possible for the maximum amount of money. Avoid letting your boss know when you've completed tasks ahead of time as Finishing quickly often leads to being assigned even more work. Focus on keeping your boss satisfied without overextending yourself.

Everyone warned us about teenage adoptions being impossible. When we met Jake at 15, he'd been in the system for eight years and had this reputation for running away from every placement within weeks. The case worker pulled us aside before our first meeting. This kid's been through 12 homes, she said. He's smart, but he's got walls built so high you'll need a ladder just to see over them. Jake sat there during our meeting. Hoodie pulled up your buds in. Completely checked out. When I asked about his interests, he just shrugged. When my husband mentioned we had a spare room he could decorate however he wanted, Jake actually laughed. Not a happy laugh. You'll change your mind, he said. The first words he'd spoken. They always do. We brought him home on a Tuesday. The first few days were awkward, but not terrible. Jake would emerge from his room for meals, answer direct questions with one word responses, and disappear again. He reminded me of a feral cat we'd once tried to help. Always ready to run. By Friday morning, his room was empty. I found a note on his pillow that just said, thanks, but this won't work either. Don't take it personally. My husband wanted to call the case worker immediately. Maybe we're not cut out for this, he said, pacing around Jake's abandoned room. Maybe everyone was right about teenage adoptions. But something bothered me. Jake had only taken his clothes and phone charger, but left behind the speed up composition notebook I'd seen him writing in constantly. He carried it everywhere, protective of it like it contained state secrets. Against my better judgment, I opened it. I expected angry rants about foster families or maybe song lyrics. it was full of detailed observations about every family he lived with. Written like some kind of scientific study. Day 3 with the Johnsons. Dad yelled at mom about leaving dishes in the sink. He apologized later, but she didn't talk to him for two hours. They'll probably divorce within two years. Day 7 with the Peterson's. They keep asking if I'm settling in okay, but what they really mean is are you going to steal anything or burn the house down? Mom hides her jewelry box when I'm around. Day 12 with the Rodriguez. They find write about money every night after they think I'm asleep. Foster care stipend isn't enough to cover what they thought it would. I'll be gone by the end of the month. He was keeping score, documenting every family's dysfunction, like he was gathering evidence that no one actually wanted him. The entries got more cynical as they went on, like he was building a case against hope itself. The last entry was about us. Did 3 days ago. Day 3 with the Millers. They seem happy, but give it time. Nobody actually wants a broken 15 year old with Trust issues. Mom keeps trying to make conversation, and dad bought me expensive headphones. Like that'll make me stay. They'll realize I'm too much work soon enough. Close the notebook and felt my heart break a little. This kid wasn't running because he was bad. He was running because he was convinced everyone would eventually give up on him anyway. I drove to every place a runaway teenager might go. Bus station, public library, McDonald's, the mall. Nothing. Finally, at 2:00am, I tried the 24 hour diner downtown. There he was, in a corner booth, that same notebook open in front of him, writing by the light of his phone. I slid into the seat across from him. He looked up, genuinely shocked. How did you find me? Lucky guess, I said, signalling the waitress for coffee. So what's your prediction about us? What's going in the notebook tonight? His face went red. You read it? Yeah, I did. And you know what? Your observations about people are scary accurate. You picked up on things about those families.

I had to let Rachel use my car whenever she wanted. She ended up treating it like her own and barely even said thanks. And my parents made me out to be the selfish one for not wanting to share with my little sister. A few days after Rachel showed up at my house, I got a call from my mom asking me to come over for dinner. She didn't say much, but I could tell from her voice that this was going to be one of those dinners. I went over that night, and sure enough, after a painfully awkward meal, my mom cleared her throat and said, Rachel told them about the venue. I asked what she told them, and they said that Rachel and Matt had been struggling to find a venue and it was really important to them since this was a big step in their relationship. I nodded. She went on to say that our Vineyard would be the perfect location for them since it was their first wedding, especially since it was a traditional wedding. The sentence hit me like a ton of bricks. My wedding didn't matter as much to them either, because it wasn't between a man and a woman. I was stunned, but I shouldn't have been. My parents had always quietly disapproved of me being with my fiance. Lisa, they never said it outright, but their subtle digs and passive aggressive comments about my lifestyle choices always gave it away. And now they were outright telling me that my sister Rachel's wedding was more important because it was traditional. I explained to them that I picked out the venue a year ago. Lisa and I have been planning our wedding around that Vineyard. We're not giving it up. My mom side and my dad shook his head. My mom said I should let Rachel have her moment. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I laid my silverware on the table and told them that I was not giving up the venue, and if Rachel wanted a Vineyard, she could find another one. They looked at me like I was being completely unreasonable. My mom even had the audacity to say, just think about it, okay? I didn't need to think about it. I walked out that night knowing that they were never going to see my wedding as important, but I wasn't going to let them ruin it for me. Few days later, Lisa and I got a call from our wedding planner. The woman sounded confused and a little frantic, and she asked me if we canceled the venue. My heart sank. I said, of course not. And she told me that someone called pretending to be me and canceled the booking. I felt a surge of anger. I knew exactly who it was. There was Only one person petty enough to pull something like this. I hung up with the wedding planner and immediately called Rachel. She picked up on the second ring and her voice was all sugary and sweet. I asked her if she had canceled our wedding venue and she didn't even try to deny it. She said we didn't need it anyway. I told her that she committed fraud and that we couldn't get our deposit back. She laughed and said that it was a harmless prank. She said that since I forced her to find another venue just as quickly, we should be able to find one with no problem. I was so angry I couldn't even speak. I hung up on her. I called the venue and managed to get the booking reinstated. Thank god the people at the Vineyard were understanding, but the damage was already done.

My friend Tyler loved making fun of my anxiety attacks. We've been friends since seventh grade, but somewhere along the way my panic disorder became his favorite comedy material. Whenever I'd start hyperventilating in public, he dramatically gasped for air and say, oh no, Chris is broken again! Everyone would laugh while I struggled to breathe, my chest tight and vision blurring like I was drowning. He'd introduce me to girls at parties by saying, this is Chris. He malfunctions under pressure. Don't get too close or he might have downtime. I'd stand there, face burning with embarrassment while they'd giggle and avoid eye contact. Some would literally back away. I stayed friends with him because I thought that's what I deserved. The worst part was how he'd escalated over the years. If I had an attack during a movie, he'd pause it and announce to everyone, Chris needs a system reboot. If I panicked before a test, he'd tell classmates, Chris Dot exe has stopped working. At restaurants, he tell waiters I was buffering when I couldn't order. It got so bad that people started calling me error message Chris behind my back. Even strangers knew about my condition because Tyler made it his signature joke. Last month, Tyler got accepted to Columbia Law School, his absolute dream school, the one he'd been working toward obsessively since freshman year, pulling all nighters and sacrificing everything for his LSAT score. He Threw this huge Celebration party at his parents massive house and invited everyone from our friend group, plus extended family, neighbors, and most importantly, the girl he'd been trying to impress for months, Jessica. Jessica was gorgeous, brilliant, and completely out of his league. She was getting her PhD in clinical psychology and had always been genuinely kind to me about my anxiety, even offering helpful breathing techniques. Tyler had been planning to ask her out after the party, convinced that his law school acceptance would finally make him impressive enough to win her over. During his speech, Tyler started getting emotional, talking about his dead grandfather, who had wanted him to be a lawyer but passed away during Tyler's sophomore year. His voice began shaking as he described visiting his grandfather's grave that morning to tell him the news. I could see the signs immediately. The trembling hands, the rapid breathing, the way his eye

Yes, this afternoon. That can't be true. I was sleeping and then heard noises from the kitchen. Grandma is cooking something in the dark. Not again. Is she wearing a long white nightgown? And can you see if her ears are slightly bleeding? How do you know that? Yes, both are true. What's wrong with grandma? Should I go to her and calm her down? That's not your grandma. I went through this myself 20 years ago. Under no circumstances should that person see you. What's going on? Grandma started singing a song and laughing the whole time. Her voice sounds different somehow after the last time. I built a secret room in the basement. Go quietly to the basement. Behind the wine rack, there is a hidden door. Oh, god! She saw me. Her eyes are glowing completely red. I ran to the basement and closed the door. Why is grandma chasing me? She's banging on the door. Go to the secret room now! Not until you tell me what's really going on. I won't do anything until you tell me what's wrong with grandma. This is about your life. The basement door won't hold her off for long. So do what I tell you. It's not your grandma. Hello, Laura. Don't worry. She won't be hurt if you do exactly what I tell you. No. No what? I think you don't understand me. Your daughter will disappear. Forever she will never live as she does now. Womp, womp, womp.

Your husband contacted us. Because he thought that after 10 years of marriage that maybe your behavior had changed a little bit, and he thought maybe you were cheating. So thanks to your interference, now he's gonna go burn down my house. Well, I don't. I don't know about that. Are you guys kidding me? Do you know how crazy my husband is?

Well, no. He's Pepto cursing. He's screaming at me. He's threatening to burn down our house. You guys just interfered in something you shouldn't have been interfering in. The whole relationship sounds very. Well, very volatile. His. He seemed very calm until he found out you were lying, and then it's like he lost his mind because I'm at work. I cannot scream my head off the way he can, okay? And he's. He's crazy. You guys don't know how crazy he is. He's crazy jealous since day one. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We heard his side. We heard your side. Yeah, well, maybe we should let you go, and y'all can figure it out. Okay, well, you tell me.

Hi, can I speak to Isabella, please? She's not here. Okay. Who am I speaking with? May I help you? Yeah, this is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. Who am I speaking with? This is Aaron. What? So what do you want to talk to Isabella about? This is Isabella's cell phone, correct? Yeah, she's just not home. Something I can do for you? Yeah, how? Well, um, first of all, who are you, Aaron? Who am I? Yeah, I'm Isabella's significant other. You're her boyfriend? Yeah. Nice. How long you guys been together? I don't even know what you're calling about. Why do you want to know? Well, we do a segment on our show, and. It's gonna kind of be an awkward conversation here, Aaron. We do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. Uh huh. And that's where if a listener of ours goes out on a date with somebody and ends up getting blown off, we get an email from them asking if we can call that person and ask why. So somebody sent us an email about Isabella? That doesn't even make sense. How long have you. Someone. Yes. Somebody recently met Isabella and has been texting with her and thought that everything was going well, and then Isabella kind of stopped responding to him and told them not to text anymore, and they were hoping to get a second date. Um, are you an Are you an. We've been. We're together like. So there's no way she's going out on a date with someone else. Yeah, right. No, especially not recently. Hey, Aaron, I don't want to try to blow up her spot like this. Not. Might not be a bad thing. How long have you guys been together? Cause she could. It could be that you just recently met a guy or whatever. No, you know, it's not even possible. You. We've been together for a long time. On and off. So maybe during one of those off periods something could have happened. But even that seems unlikely. I know, I know this is probably a hard phone call to take and to hear. Not hard to hear, but it's doesn't make sense. It's not even possible. Aaron, a guy emailed us and he's been texting with Isabella. They met at a party a few weeks ago, hung out, had a good time. He thought that she was into him and then she said, don't text me anymore and stop texting him. That's why he wanted us to call, right? But I'm on her phone now. I've checked her phone. There's no text messages from any guy. Okay, I can assure you that you check her phone all the time. Enough. We trust each other. Whatever. You know I like trust. Two weeks ago, were you guys together or on a break? Cause you said you guys have breaks. Look, it's really none Of your fucking business at this point. It's not. You don't even want to know if maybe your girlfriend is cheating on you. Who the fuck are you? I've already answered all of your dumb questions, so I think you need to fuck off. I'm just trying to help you get to the bottom of it, because this is the phone number that we got from another dude who said that he met Isabella. Look, if you have some guy that's calling you, then why don't you tell him he's mistaken and he's got the wrong person and she's got a boyfriend and to just, like, back off and stop harassing her? Okay? I'll do that for you. Hey, Jake, back off. Isabella has a boyfriend. His name is Aaron. This is so uncomfortable. Aaron. Jake, the guy who says he met Isabella is actually on the phone with us right now. Jake, say hi to Aaron. Hey. So how long have you guys been dating? You never really answered that question. Who the fuck are you? I'm not even gonna answer this. I don't even know who you are. I don't want to know who you are. You sound like a little bit of a dweeb. And I don't think she has. I, I met Isabella. Here's the deal, dude. Oh, here's the deal. We hung out for the whole night. She stayed in my bed. Oh. Oh, but it doesn't sound like you guys are really into each Other, you won't even say how long you've been dating. All right, dude, here's the deal. I don't know who the fuck you are. I don't have a problem with you. But you keep pushing down this road, we're gonna have a problem. You need to back off. I don't know. What are we going on? You've made a mistake. All right, Jake, why don't we. Why don't we just ask Isabella? Why don't we ask Isabella? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Oh, god, this is so uncomfortable, Aaron. I mean, I know you have her phone right now, but how can we get a hold of her? I'm not gonna give you any of your info. Where is she? She must be coming back soon. This is ridiculous. I am with Isabella. We are together. No, you can't talk to her. No, we're not gonna go through. I'm not gonna listen to this pseudo shrink try to tell me that my relationship isn't working out. All right, you may. Maybe. Radio show. Maybe. You guys weren't together two weeks ago. It was two weeks ago, Aaron. That's when Jake says he met Isabella and she spent the night at his house. In his bed. In his bed.

So in a second, we're gonna call him and pretend to be from a pickleball resort. Which does exist. It does, because he's gotten really into pickleball, and he just joined a pickleball club. And we'll say that because he's a new member, he won a prize. Go to an all inclusive pickleball resort in Miami, and you can take a guess with him, and we'll see if he chooses Bella or somebody else. But before we do that, Bella, why don't you refresh our memory on why you think Greg might be cheating? So he has never been active. Like, not an active dude, and all of a sudden he's obsessed with pickleball? He's. He's now going multiple times a week. And he got a text from some chick named Jenna, who apparently works at the club, and it just seems pretty sketchy. Like, all of a sudden, not only is he into pickleball, but now he's, like, getting random text that he doesn't want to talk about. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that's the weird part. All right, well, are you ready for us to call him? Yeah. Yes. I'm just scared, but yes, I am. I know I am. No, I. I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, here we go. Hello? Hi, this is Gordon calling from.

Uh, yeah, it's been pretty cool so far. I really enjoy the course. Uh, I feel like that my game's gotten a lot better just being a member of the club. So. Great. Yeah, I'm pretty excited. Guess what? It's about to get a lot better because congratulations, Greg. I'm actually calling to tell you that you're the big winner. What? What am I winning? We are doing a contest where one of our lucky new members is going to win an all inclusive trip to Miami at a pickleball resort. It's an Oceanside pickleball resort. It's really a cool experience. You get training, you get. It's four days, you get all kinds of training and coaching and things like that. And it's nothing but pickleball for four days by the beach in Miami. I won! Yes, you did. Congratulations. Oh snap! Like. Like, for real? Yes, for real. Congratulations. Yeah, it's just our way of saying, you know, thank you for. Thank you for joining and thank you for being a member. And thank you for using all of our services that we offer. Cause I know you've been doing lessons and stuff too. Yes! This is so cool. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. And it is a plus one. So you get to take somebody with you. And we'd like to extend the offer of inviting That person. By sending them some flowers and a. And a card. Invite them. Oh, okay. Okay. Uh. Um, I've been talking to this chick, Jenna. Um, and so I actually met her at the club. Oh. And I. Wait, yeah, yeah. Are Jenna. Yes, yes, yes, yes. You've been training me. Oh, okay. Yeah. If I want to thank her. Like, you know, we've been only kind of seeing each other for a short time, and I haven't really had a chance. I see Jenna every day, and I haven't heard that, so that's exciting news. I'll shoot. If that's possible, I would love to take her. Yeah.

I don't know, dude. Um, are you awake right now, Thomas? I mean, I don't wanna be, but I am now. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, man, I, I, I'm right there with you. Is this gonna take, like, how long is this gonna take? It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. In case you're busy. Or whatever, but I just want to go back to sleep. Well, do you remember going out with a girl named Kelsey? Probably. Probably. Oh, my god. Do you remember her? No. Yeah, yeah, I remember. Okay. What's up? Well, Kelsey emailed us because she told us about your date. And she said that you guys went for a walk, stopped by the grocery store, and she invited you to the movies, and that's when you. Oh, yeah. It was a lot. It was. It was a lot. It was a lot. It was a lot. What was a lot about it? The walk or the grocery store? All of it. It was, uh. Anyway, so what's. What do. What do you need? Oh, my god. Well, Kelsey. Kelsey wants to know why you're not calling her back. Oh, gosh, Thomas, can you tell. Can you tell us why? I guess it was just, like, she wanted to do so much stuff. Really? What do you mean? She thought she was too boring for you. She thought that a walk in a grocery store was, like, lame and that you were looking for more excitement. That's why I don't. Who walks? Like, that's why they invented cars and Uber. Like, why do we have to walk? It was so much. Okay, so it's not that you were bored on the date, you just didn't want to walk? Pretty much. No, it was. I didn't want to do. And then. And Then after the walking goes the random restaurant, and then the grocery store, and then I have to carry her groceries, then I have to help her put the groceries up, and then. And then after all of that, on top of that, she's like, oh, yeah, let's go see a movie. I'm like, oh my god, I just did more work than I've done all week. I don't want to do any small things. And it was so late, dude, it was like 8:00 o'clock or something. Like, it was so late. I don't. I don't like it. Wait, Thomas, you're concentrating a lot on the things that you did on the date, but what about her? Did you enjoy hanging out with her? She said she was laughing a ton, smiling a lot. I mean, she was cool. It was just. She does too much, man. I'm not. I'm not that. I'm not an outdoorsy dude who likes to do all this. Like, I feel like she would go hiking and that sounds terrible. Haha. Okay, so if I'm. If I'm reading this correctly, you just feel like she likes to do way too much? I mean, I'm in social. Find someone who likes to do stuff with her, and that's awesome, but I just don't. I don't like. If I didn't have to leave the house, I would not leave the house. Why? Wait, why are you even dating then, Thomas? Like, dating requires you To do stuff. It doesn't, though. Like, you can say you dating, you drive to a place, you eat dinner at a place, and then that's it. And then maybe you. And maybe. Maybe you go back and you watch like, Netflix or Hulu or something. Like, it's not. I don't know. She wanted to do so many things and I just. I'm not that kind of dude. I'm not that kind of dude. Alright, well, at least you know what you want, Thomas. Oh, you should have told her that though, Thomas. She. She did not. Yeah, but then I'd have to like, meet up again. We probably have to go on another walk to explain why I don't like going on walk. Haha. Yeah, a lot of effort. Well. Wow. Thomas, I. I know that this is probably gonna be hard for you to deal with, but Kelsey is on the other line and wants to talk to you for a minute. Oh my god, you guys are the worst! Haha.

And all of a sudden he's obsessed with pickleball. He's. He's now going multiple times a week.

Like, all of a sudden, not only is he into pickleball, but now he's, like, getting random text that he doesn't want to talk about. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that's the weird part.

Yeah. That's what this is about? That's just so. Yeah, this is about somebody named Kayla, not somebody named Leslie. Oh, god, is she listening to this? Kayla? No, Kayla is gone. Because, dude, I mean, we called for a second date update. She wanted to go out with you again, and then she heard you call somebody, like, somebody named Leslie a bitch, and she hung up and isn't interested in doing the second date update anymore. But I want to know who Leslie is now. Me, too. Is it, like, some stalker you have or something? Like, for free? Honestly, you really don't? Like, it's a long story, and it is not, uh, not a good time. Did Leslie happen before the Kayla date or after the Kayla date? It was after Kayla. Like, honestly, I just want to. I just want to forget about the whole thing. It Was really. And, like, I just want to move past it, you know? You don't have to tell me. But maybe if you do tell me, then I could explain to Kayla about the situation with Leslie and help her understand that so that maybe she wants to go out with you again. Yeah, um. I mean, like, I could tell you guys, but, like, I don't want you to go and tell Kayla, cause it's like. It's real. It's like a really weird story. Like, I don't want her to know that. That I. I won't. I don't know. I won't tell her specifics about this Leslie girl. And she's got to be understanding. I mean, she said that she's gone on some pretty horrible dates. From the same site you guys met on, too? Yeah. Okay, we. At this bar, we drank way too much. We wound up hooking up in a Wendy's bathroom. And. And then. And then she bit me. Okay, but she bit you when you're in the Wendy's bathroom? She bit me. I got stitches for it, and that's. I'm just gonna leave it there. Where did she bite you? You don't need to know. And so she bit you so bad that you had to get stitches? Yeah. So you see why I don't want to talk to her, right? I guess. Yeah. It seems like you could have seen that one coming. If you're hooking up with a girl in a Wendy's, Bathroom? Yeah, she's crazy. And now she keeps calling me and texting me. won't leave me alone now. So that's what happened. Does that answer your question? Yes, it definitely does. So I won't give Kayla all those details. Thank you. You're. You're welcome. I won't give them to her because you actually just did. Kayla is still on the phone listening

Um, well, the number you're calling from doesn't come up as one of my contacts, so I'm not really sure whose phone you have. Right, well, no, I, I, I'm not calling from the actual phone because I didn't want to use up their minutes or anything. So can I, can I just read you a text real quick, and then maybe you can look through your text conversations and tell me who sent it to you? Um, sure. Okay. Uh, hang on a second. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so, um, they sent you a message a few days ago, whoever this is, that said, um, that's fine, but I'm paying next time. You earned it. And then it has a heart and a winky face, so I assume maybe it was your wife or your girlfriend or something, cause that's, that's, that's why I called you. Well, it's not my wife. Cause I'm not married. But, yeah, I, I know whose phone that is. Oh, okay, great. Um, is there any way you could possibly give me their name so I can look up their address to kind of return their phone to them? Not really comfortable giving out her information. Um, maybe you could just turn it into the cops or something, and I can get a hold of her and let her know they have it. Okay, I gotcha. I didn't think about the fact that, like, trying to track down a woman I've never met is kind of creepy. No, no, it's cool. I, I mean, it's, it's nice that you're doing the right thing. I just don't think she'd want me giving out her personal info like that. I, I understand. Um, one more thing, though. Um, why does this phone number come up as Chris when it calls you? I'm sorry, what? When this phone that I found, when it calls you or text you, why does it come up as Chris? You just said this was a woman's phone. How. How do you know that? How do I know it's a woman's phone? You just told me it

Right, well, no, I, I, I'm not calling from the actual phone because I didn't want to use up their minutes or anything. So can I, can I just read you a text real quick, and then maybe you can look through your text conversations and tell me who sent it to you? Um, sure. Okay. Uh, hang on a second. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so, um, they sent you a message a few days ago, whoever this is, that said, um, that's fine, but I'm paying next time. You earned it. And then it has a heart and a winky face, so I assume maybe it was your wife or your girlfriend or something, cause that's, that's, that's why I called you. Well, it's not my wife. Cause I'm not married. But, yeah, I, I know whose phone that is. Oh, okay, great. Um, is there any way you could possibly give me their name so I can look up their address to kind of return their phone to them? Not really comfortable giving out her information. Um, maybe you could just turn it into the cops or something, and I can get a hold of her and let her know they have it. Okay, I gotcha. I didn't think about the fact that, like, trying to track down a woman I've never met is kind of creepy. No, no, it's cool. I, I mean, it's, it's nice that you're doing the right thing. I just don't think she'd want me giving out her personal info like that. I, I understand. Um, one more thing, though. Um, why does this phone number come up as Chris when it calls you? I'm sorry, what? When this phone that I found, when it calls you or text you, why does it come up as Chris? You just said this was a woman's phone. How. How do you know that? How do I know it's a woman's phone? You just told me it

Hi. Can I speak to Douglas? Who's Douglas? Hey, Doug, this is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. How are you? Uh, my name is Douglas. Who's this? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, okay. Who are you? I host a radio show called Brooke and Jubal in the morning. My name is Jubal. Um, what do you need from me? Well, I wanted to talk to you about a friend of ours who. You know. Okay. Okay. You're pretty quick into the point guy, aren't you, Douglas? Yes, I am. Why you calling me? Um, good question. So you went out with a girl named Jesse recently? Yeah. Yeah. Do you like Jesse? What business is that of yours? Well, it's. It's our business because she emailed us to see if we could talk to you and find out if you didn't like her. I didn't hate her. Uh. Whoa. I just didn't feel it working. Okay. Okay. Can you tell us why? I don't feel we're at the same places in our lives, and it's just as far as personalities, temperaments, and patience goes. It's just not what I'm looking for in someone to date. Sorry. Is it because you have a kid and she doesn't? How do you know that? Well, she told us a little bit about your date and said she thinks that's the reason you don't want to go out with her again. It's just like The money old say you can't deal with it yourself. Wait, what? What, you just like, put down a whole generation of people there? Well, I'm not saying that every millennial is one of those things and behaves that way, but when I see a duck, I call it a duck. Good way to be. So you thought she was a millennial duck? No, she was. Well, after having to listen to a five minute tirade that someone didn't tag her in a Facebook post? Yeah, kind of. What? Okay, wait, whoa. I want to know about the tirade, but I'm really curious. Are you 65 year old man? I'm a 30 year old man with two kids with sole custody. I got a lot to do. I'm very busy. I just don't have time to screw around anymore. Okay, and by her complaining about a Facebook post, you think she has time to screw around and you don't? It's not just that I. She's complaining that, you know. You know, I work a 10 to 8 or 10 to 5 job and I only got eight hours of sleep last night and. Yeah, but her friends aren't tagging her in Facebook posts and it's just. I mean, I don't think she's a bad person, I just don't have time for that. Yeah, I mean. I mean, it makes sense. Like you're a single parent of two kids. I'm in a different place in my life. Yeah, I'm sorry, what? I mean, why didn't you just tell her that, though? Well, I didn't wanna come down on her as, like, you know, you're an idiot, and I don't wanna have anything else to do with you. I mean, we're already there on the date, and I don't think that. I don't think that. It's just like I said, we're just in different places in our lives, right? We want different things. Maybe in a few years she might feel differently, but right now, I don't have the time to do it. So in your mind, it's just finish the date up, give her a kiss on the cheek, send her on her way, and you can get back to doing business? Look, it's not doing business. It's called life. I'm actively participating in it, and I just gotta get it done. I don't have time for the BS. But, I mean, here's the thing with that. Like, I get that you have a lot on your plate right now, but you can't fault her for not having the same amount of stuff to deal with. I'm not faulting her. I'm just saying that I don't have time for it. I'm sure there's plenty of other guys that can sympathize and want to listen to her about not getting tagged in a Facebook post. I'm not one of them. All right? And look, if you guys want to get back to her and just let her know, that'd be great. I'd Appreciate it. Well, I have a better idea. I can tell that you're. Like I said, you're a man of business. Let's expedite it and just let you know that she's on the phone right now. And you actually told her? What are you talking about? I mean, she's on the other line listening to this conversation and would like to speak with you real quick if you have time. Sir? Sir, she's not on the phone.

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it. Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day, my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a Couple extra expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with. So I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line. So I ran up by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why Don't wait till you get home. You check the email. You call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why Don't wait till you get home. You check the email. You call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

Mädchen die so sind sind Clowns. du bist kein Girls Girl dann nehm ich immer so n. leicht rosane Lipgloss? nicht Girls. Girls würden auch immer sagen, wenn jetzt jemand sagt, oh Mein Gott, Lara sieht heute so schön Aus. ja, aber ihre Haare sind gefärbt. ja, aber sie trägt richtig viel Schminke. kurz gesagt, Girls, Girls können akzeptieren, dass es noch Millionen andere schöne Frauen auf der Welt gibt. und nicht Girls.

In my family, girls were married off the moment they got their first period. Didn't matter if you were 12, 13, or 14. The blood meant you were ready for a husband at least three times your age. I grew up with this idea, so in my head it didn't seem that bad until I turned 11, because that's when I watched my cousin Mariam get promised to a 43 year old man just three days after her first period. His previous two wives had died before turning 20. That was the first night I decided to stop eating enough food. Not because I was fat and not be I hated food, I noticed the skinnier girls in my family would be the last ones to get their period, and I knew it was my only option. I later Learned that your body actually needs to have enough fat before starting puberty. Lol. The other girls called me skeleton, but I and care. Other girls my age were already promised to men who had children older than them. That didn't mean they stopped prepping me to be a wife, though. Every Friday from 1:00am to 10:00am, I was made to serve meals to male family members for hours without speaking. And of course, if I made eye contact or noise while serving, then I would receive 10 lashes of the belt. I was forced to hold burning pots without Oven mitts to toughen up soft hands for kitchen work. And every night, my mom put skin whitening cream all over my face so I could be beautiful. And other than the secret starvation, I was the perfect daughter. I played the part with zero complaints and always talked about how excited I was to have kids. But when I was 14 and still periodless, I found something that changed everything. For context, we were in the USA the whole time. LOL. My mom had just convinced us that all of this was normal and that any girl who didn't do this was bound to die alone, as well as being ugly and useless. Until one teacher forced me to have a meeting with her because I had accidentally worn a T-shirt to school and she saw how skinny I was. When she walked out to go to the bathroom, she had forgotten to lock her drawer. Inside were books about marriage laws, pamphlets with titles like your rights as a Young Teenager and when culture become crime. As I read, my jaw dropped. It was the first time I had been introduced to the idea that marriage under 18 was wrong. No cultural exceptions, no parental consent loopholes. I stole the thinnest pamphlet, hiding it in my waistband. Over the next few weeks, when my parents thought I was asleep, I memorized every page. Phone numbers for CPS, shelter addresses, the exact words that would trigger a mandatory report, I Learned that teachers, counselors and doctors had to report suspected abuse by law. So I started a wife skills group in my uncle's tool shed. Six younger cousins who hadn't bled yet, all desperate to avoid their fate. There, I taught them what I'd Learned. Which teachers were mandated reporters? How to say the words that would trigger an investigation. We practiced in whispers. They're forcing me to marry. I'm only 13. Please help! And at 15, my body betrayed me. The blood came during morning food prep, soaking through my white dress. My mother scream of joy brought every woman in the house running. They were practically beaming with joy. Kiss my cheeks told me I was lucky. By nightfall, my father had already chosen my husband, Hamood Habibi, a construction Mogul who had buried two of his wives once they turned 23. Kidney failure, the death certificate said. The woman whispered it was from too many pregnancies, too young. Two days later, my cousin Anya, a girl from the shed, got her period too. Within hours, she was promised to a fifty one year old who collected wives like trophies. But eight children older than her. I watched the light drain from her eyes as they discussed her bride price like she was livestock. That night, I slipped her my notebook. Every shelter number, every legal fact, escape route I'd memorized. Tomorrow, I whispered, tell the science teacher. Use the exact words I taught you. Her hand Shook as she took it. What about you? My wedding's not for two weeks. I'll figure something out. I responded, voice shaking. But I was wrong.

Our high school had this massive dodgeball tournament every spring. Juniors versus seniors, and whoever won got to skip the fitness test that quarter. The entire gym would pack with kids screaming their heads off. This year the stakes felt higher. Our senior class captain was Jake. Chill guy who played baseball but wasn't like super intense about it. The junior captain was Austin, who basically lived in the weight room and never let anyone forget it. Draft day was pure chaos. Austin went first, obviously picking his gym buddy Connor. Jake picked Emma, who did track. Back and forth it went. All the usual suspects getting chosen. The football guys, the soccer girls, kids who actually showed up to PE instead of hiding in the bathroom. I was sitting in the bleachers with my phone, honestly just waiting for this whole thing to be over. I'm not athletic at all. I wear oversized hoodies, and my idea of cardio is walking to the vending machine. Then I heard my name, drew. Everyone turned to look at Jake like he'd lost his mind. A few people actually laughed. Austin smirked and whispered something to Connor that made them both crack up. I pointed at myself. Like me? Jake nodded. Yeah, you. I walked down to join the team, my face burning red. People were already making jokes about how this was basically a free win for the juniors. The tournament started First few rounds, I did exactly what everyone expected. Nothing. I stood in the back corner, maybe moved a step or two when balls came flying my way. Honestly, I was just trying not to embarrass myself completely. Nice strategy, Jake Austin yelled across the gym after we won our second match. Hide the weak link in the back. By the semi finals, most of our good players were out. It was down to me, Jake, Emma, and two other kids against Austin's full squad of athletes. That's when something clicked. I stopped thinking about everyone watching. I stopped caring about looking stupid. I just started moving the way I did every single day after school. See, nobody at school knew this, but my little cousins are absolutely obsessed with dodgeball. Like, weirdly obsessed. Every family barbecue, every weekend sleepover, every random Tuesday when I'm babysitting, we're in the backyard throwing tennis balls at each other for hours. My aunt even bought them this whole set with foam balls and everything. I've been dodging projectiles thrown by sugar high eight year olds for like, three years straight. The finals came down to five juniors versus just me, and Jake Austin was grinning like Christmas morning. This is gonna be embarrassing.

The inmate I respected most was a 19 year old kid who unalived his own mother. The twist? She had been selling him to grown men since he was seven years old. And he finally snapped when he caught her doing the same thing to his 6 year old sister. This kid, Marcus, had endured 12 years of hell. His mother would sedate him with sleeping pills crushed into his food, then lock him in rooms with strangers who paid her anywhere from two hundred to eight hundred dollars depending on what they wanted to do. She made thousands of dollars off his suffering while telling everyone he was just a troubled child who made up stories for attention. Marcus tried to tell people what was happening. At age nine, he told his teacher about the bad men who came to his house. His mother convinced the school he had behavioral problems. At 12, he tried to run away six times. Each time, his mother would cry to police about her disturbed son and they bring him right back to her. The worst part was how she manipulated him. She buy him expensive shoes after the worst nights, telling him it was their special secret and that he was helping the family survive. She convinced him that if anyone found out, they both go to jail and his little sister would end up in foster care with strangers who Might hurt her even worse. When Marcus turned 16, his mother started bringing fewer clients around. He thought maybe it was finally over. Then his sister Emma turned 6, and Marcus noticed his mother giving her the same crushed up pills. That's when he realized his nightmare was just beginning for someone else. The night it happened, Marcus came home early from his job at McDonald's and heard his little sister crying from the basement. He found his mother taking photos with her phone while a man twice his size was hurting Emma. Marcus had hidden a kitchen knife in his backpack weeks earlier. Instead of using it on himself, he used it on them. When police arrived, they found Marcus holding his sister in the living room, both covered in red liquid. Emma kept saying, Marcus saved me over and over. The basement was full of cameras, computers, and boxes of photos and videos going back years. His mother had been running a network. The case made national headlines when they found videos of Marcus dating back to second in grade. His mother had been advertising him on dark website since he was 7. The FBI arrested 43 people connected to the network, including two teachers from his elementary school and a family court judge who had dismissed Marcus's previous reports of abuse. In prison, Marcus became untouchable. Even the most violent inmates protected him like their own son. Gang leaders would personally escort him to meals. Lifers who Hadn't spoken to anyone in years. Would check on him daily. I've never seen anything like the respect this kid commanded from hardened criminals. What broke my heart was watching Marcus struggle with guilt over unaliving his mother. He'd have nightmares where he'd wake up screaming apologies to her. This kid felt bad for stopping the woman who had sold his body for 12 years and was about to do same to his baby sister. His sister Emma was placed with their aunt, who had been fighting for custody for years, but was blocked by their mother's lies. She visits Marcus every week and brings Emma once a month.

This kid's been through 12 homes, she said. He's smart, but he's got walls built so high you'll need a ladder just to see over them. Jake sat there during our meeting. Hoodie pulled up your buds in, completely checked out. When I asked about his interests, he just shrugged. When my husband mentioned we had a spare room he could decorate however he wanted, Jake actually laughed. Not a happy laugh. You'll change your mind, he said. The first words he'd spoken. They always do. We brought him home on a Tuesday. The first few days were awkward, but not terrible. Jake would emerge from his room for meals, answer direct questions with one word responses, and disappear again. He reminded me of a feral cat we'd once tried to help. Always ready to run. By Friday morning, his room was empty. I found a note on his pillow that just said, thanks, but this won't work either. Don't take it personally. My husband wanted to call the case worker immediately. Maybe we're not cut out for this, he said, pacing around Jake's abandoned room. Maybe everyone was right about teenage adoptions. But something bothered me. Jake had Only taken his clothes and phone charger, but left behind the speed up composition notebook I'd seen him writing in constantly. He carried it everywhere, protective of it like it contained state secrets. Against my better judgment, I opened it. I expected angry rants about foster families or maybe song lyrics. Instead it was full of detailed observations about every family he lived with, written like some kind of scientific study. Day 3 with the Johnsons. Dad yelled at mom about leaving dishes in the sink. He apologized later, but she didn't talk to him for two hours. They'll probably divorce within two years. Day 7 with the Peterson's. They keep asking if I'm settling in okay, but what they really mean is are you going to steal anything or burn the house down? Mom hides her jewelry box when I'm around. Day 12 with the Rodriguez. They fight about money every night after they think I'm asleep. Foster care stipend isn't enough to cover what they thought it would. I'll be gone by the end of the month. He was keeping score, documenting every family's dysfunction, like he was gathering evidence that no one actually wanted him. The entries got more cynical as they went on, like he was building a case against hope itself. The last entry was about us. Did 3 days ago. Day 3 with the Millers. They seem happy, but give it time. Nobody actually wants a broken 15 year old with trust issues. Mom Keeps trying to make conversation. And dad bought me expensive headphones. Like that'll make me stay. They'll realise I'm too much work soon enough. Close the notebook and felt my heart break a little. This kid wasn't running because he was bad. He was running because he was convinced everyone would eventually give up on him anyway. I drove to every place a runaway teenager might go. Bus station, public library, McDonald's, the mall. Nothing. Finally, at 2:00am, I tried the 24 hour diner downtown. There he was, in a corner booth, that same notebook open in front of him, writing by the light of his phone. I slid into the seat across from him. He looked up, genuinely shocked. How did you find me? Lucky guess, I said, signalling the waitress for coffee. So what's your prediction about us? What's going in the notebook tonight? His face went red. You read it? Yeah, I did. And you know what? Your observations about people are scary accurate. You picked up on things about those families.

My dentist, Doctor Martinez. Everyone in town loved him because he was so gentle and never hurt anyone during procedures. I went there for years. Never felt a thing during cleanings or fillings. He'd always say, you won't feel this at all. And he was right. I actually looked forward to dental appointments. But my breath got worse even though I brushed constantly. Food started getting stuck in places it never did before. My girlfriend mentioned my smile looked different, but I couldn't see it. Doctor Martinez always had explanations. Genetics, he'd say. Some people just have softer enamel. He prescribed expensive mouthwash that made everything worse. During one appointment, I felt something sharp fall into my mouth. Doctor Martinez quickly suctioned it out and said it was just a piece. It's of old filling. The receptionist always looked nervous around him. She'd stutter when scheduling my next appointment. Once I caught her crying in the bathroom after he yelled at her about patient files. My insurance started rejecting more claims. They said I was having too many procedures for someone my age. Doctor Martinez got angry when I mentioned it. His hands shook while he worked on my mouth. That day, I started getting bills for procedures I didn't remember having. When I questioned them, he showed me consent forms with my signature, but I never remembered signing them. I noticed he always scheduled me for the last appointment of the day. The Parking lot would be empty. Other patients in the waiting room looked miserable. Everyone had bandages or swollen faces. But they all praise Doctor Martinez when asked, their eyes looked dead, though. The tools he used looked different from other dentists I'd seen on TV. Sharper, more aggressive looking. When I asked about them, he changed the subject immediately. My friends started avoiding me. They said my breath smelled rotten, even after brushing. Some made excuses not to sit near me at restaurants. My teeth started shifting. Gaps appeared overnight. I'd wake up with my mouth tasting like metal. Blood on my pillow became normal. Doctor Martinez said it was just adjustment periods from all the work. He installed a new chair that reclined further back than normal. I felt completely helpless lying in it. The restraints seemed tighter than they needed to be. Started taking photos of my mouth at every visit. Way more than seemed normal. He'd zoom in on specific teeth and mutter numbers under his breath, like he was calculating something. Then he began asking personal questions. How much money I made, if I lived alone, whether I had family in town. He wrote everything down in a separate folder. One day, I arrived early and found him in his office counting cash. Big stacks of bills spread across his desk. When he saw me, he quickly shoved everything into a safe. I'd never noticed before. He offered me a payment plan for future work. He Already knew exactly what procedures I'd need for the next five years. The timeline was eerily specific. Then I moved to college and had to find A new dentist. That's when everything fell apart. The new dentist took one look at my mouth.

Well, you know, my daughter forwarded over that email you sent with the little timeline or whatever, and I'm confused. Oh, well, what are you confused about? I'm happy to clarify anything that you might be confused about. You know, it says the wedding's coming to an end at 10:30, but we paid for the venue until midnight. So why are you making us end our wedding at 10:30? I am not making you end your wedding at 10:30. This is the timeline that me and your daughter worked on.

And we suggest an hour and a half or a minimum of an hour for this service. What do you mean, we have to reset the space and clean up? That's part of your contract here at the venue. You'll need to dispose of all the trash, clean up the personal items, clear out the food and beverage. So it makes sense to end at 10 30 or even 11, because you only have the space until midnight, and if you don't get it clean, there's a big fee. I know your daughter was trying to avoid that. Well, this is so unfair. We wanna party until midnight, so That's what we'll be doing. Okay, there's no problem in that. Our rule here is if you are going to party until midnight, you need to rent out the next morning to clean up the space. It is currently available and the charge is 12 dollars. 12 dollars? I'm not paying that. Okay, if you don't wanna pay that, then I would suggest ending the wedding at 10:30 so that you can clean up the space. Can you just cut us some slack?

Whenever he had homework he didn't want to do, which was practically every day, he would tell me to do it for him. And if I ever tried to say no, he would trash my room and force me to clean it up. And I would have just told my parents, but back then, I just wanted him to love me. So instead, I chose to keep it a secret. And for years, I told my parents about how happy I was to have Trent in my life. And my lies were good. Too good, actually. So much so that when he broke my hand after refusing to do his homework for five days straight, they didn't believe me. Trent would never do that, my dad said, before slapping me across the face for telling lies. even though my intuition was screaming at me to get revenge on Trent, I didn't. Because I knew that if he was never punished for being abusive towards me, then his behaviour would eventually pass on to my parents. And I. I was right. Because when I was 16 and Trent was 19, I caught him stealing money from our mom's purse in the middle of the night. But I knew telling on him meant putting my life in danger, so I kept it a secret. Over the next few weeks, I heard him sneaking out at 2:00am every weekend. And whenever he Returned home, he would make the entire apartment reek of the devil's lettuce. I. I wasn't sure if my parents knew or not, but a month later, I finally got my answer, because just as Trent walked in at 6:00am, my dad caught him. Trent, what's going on, Buddy? You've been coming home reeking of dour eggs for weeks now. I tensed up, and that's when I heard a smack. I'm an adult. I can do what I want, was all Trent said in response, before going to bed and sleeping for the entire day. He woke up and joined us for dinner. I expected my dad to hit him back, or at least tell him what he did wasn't acceptable. But no, he just asked Trent if he wanted some salt with his meal. And we were all forced to play happy family and pretend like everything was okay. And maybe my parents were happy to live in fear of their son, but I wasn't. So a week later, I moved in with my friend who lived a block away. Neither of my parents asked why, because they already knew the answer. I didn't talk to them much after that. Fast forward to five years later. I was 22, working as an operations analyst and making $50,000 a year. It was around this time that I got the call. It was my mom, and it was the first time she had called me since the day I moved out. I picked up reluctantly, and she was in tears. Honey, me and your father need you, Trent, to suck in Colombia. I took a deep breath to gather my thoughts and calmly asked what the f was going on. That's when I heard my dad's voice. Trent told us there was a job waiting for him in Colombia, but as soon as he got in the taxi from the airport, his buddy stole his passport, and now they won't give it back unless we pay up. How much is it, dad? I asked with a sigh. They're asking for $12,000, and if we don't pay now, it'll double tomorrow. I pinched the bridge of my nose. Dad, I'm still paying back my student loans, and honey, we wouldn't ask if we weren't desperate. Please? I walked over to the nearest mirror and stared at myself. Was this really what my life had come to? I don't even know why I agreed. I guess I just figured that at least now I would never have to hear about him again. That thought alone was enough to put me on cloud nine, and I spent the rest of the week with a huge smile on my face. But Trent found a way to ruin that, too. I was fast asleep on a Thursday night when I got another call from my mom. This time I didn't pick up, and she started spam texting me about needing another $6,000 for Trent. Turns out After the passport fiasco, my parents never forced him to come home. So Trent decided to put his trust in the same people who stole his passport. Because now he was one of them. Or so he thought. Until they took him hostage and demanded money again. I told my mom no, because even if I wanted to help, I simply couldn't. My bank account was completely empty, and I had already sold my car to help with student loan debt. In response, her and my dad started texting me at the same time, saying I was an effing disgrace, that I should have saved more money to help pay. I blocked them both, turned on flight mode, slept like a baby with a silk eye mask over my face. But they still couldn't leave me alone. Three weeks later, my mom had somehow reached my work phone. We effing hate you. Consider yourself disowned, was the first thing she said. Then my dad chimed in. When we couldn't pay the hostage fee, Trent got set up by his friends for drug trafficking. Now he's being sentenced. We might never see our baby boy again. All because of you. Any other good news for me? I responded with a smirk on my face. I was about to hang up, but then I heard a voice in the background. It Trent. Tell her I'm getting 25 years. Maybe she'll finally crack. My heart dropped. They weren't calling from Columbia. They were Calling from home, my family had decided to take advantage of me, and I had fallen for it. I hung up immediately, my hands shaking as I sat down the work phone. My co workers were staring at me from their cubicles, but I couldn't focus on their concerned faces. I grabbed my personal phone and started changing every single password I had, banking apps, email accounts, social media, everything. My fingers moved frantically across the screen as I enabled two factor authentication on every account that offered it. I called my bank next, explaining that I needed to freeze my accounts and issue new cards immediately. The representative asked if this was due to suspected fraud, and I confirmed it was. They put a security alert on my account and promised new cards would arrive within five business days. I did the same with my credit cards, then signed up for a credit monitoring service to watch for any suspicious activity. That evening, I noticed something odd when I got home. The doormat outside my apartment was slightly askew, and there were faint scratches around the lock that I hadn't seen before. My heart raced as I carefully opened the door, checking each room with my phone ready to dial call 9 1 1. Nothing seemed missing, but small things were out of place. My mail had been rifled through and my desk drawers weren't quite closed properly. I went to the building's management office immediately. The security footage Showed a figure in a hoodie trying different keys at my door around two PM, eventually giving up and leaving. The build quality wasn't good enough to see their face clearly, but I knew exactly who it was. The manager suggested I file a police report and offer to change my locks for free. I spent that night at a hotel, too anxious to stay in my apartment. Next morning I returned with a locksmith and had a deadbolt installed along with a chain lock. I also ordered security cameras online, paying extra for next day delivery. While waiting for them to arrive, I went to every neighbour on my floor, showing them a photo of Trent and asking them to call me if they saw him around. The cameras arrived as promised and I spent Saturday afternoon installing them. One face the hallway, another they're covered my door and I put a third inside pointing at the entrance. I downloaded the app that let me monitor them remotely and tested the motion detection alerts. Everything was working perfectly when my landlord called that evening.

Everyone warned us about teenage adoptions being impossible. When we met Jake at 15, he'd been in the system for eight years and had this reputation for running away from every placement within weeks. The case worker pulled us aside before our first meeting. This kid's been through 12 homes, she said. He's smart, but he's got walls built so high, you'll need a ladder just to see over them. Jake sat there during our meeting, hoodie pulled up, earbuds in, completely checked out. When I asked about his interests, he just shrugged. When my husband mentioned we had a spare room he could decorate however he wanted, Jake actually laughed. Not a happy laugh. You'll change your mind, he said. The first words he'd spoken. They always do. We brought him home on a Tuesday. The first few days were awkward, but not terrible. Jake would emerge from his room for meals, answer direct questions with one word responses, and disappear again. He reminded me of a feral cat we'd once tried to help. Always ready to run. By Friday morning, his room was empty. I found a note on his pillow that just said, thanks, but this won't work either. Don't take it personally. My husband wanted to call the case worker immediately. Maybe we're not cut out for this, he said, pacing around Jake's abandoned room. Maybe everyone was right about teenage adoptions. But something bothered me. Jake had only Taken his clothes and phone charger, but left behind the speed up composition notebook I'd seen him writing in constantly. He carried it everywhere, protective of it like it contained state secrets. Against my better judgement, I opened it. I expected angry rants about foster families or maybe song lyrics. Instead it was full of detailed observations about every family he lived with, written like some kind of scientific study. Day 3 with the Johnsons. Dad yelled at mom about leaving dishes in the sink. He apologized later, but she didn't talk to him for two hours. They'll probably divorce within two years. Day 7 with the Peterson's. They keep asking if I'm settling in okay, but what they really mean is are you going to steal anything or burn the house down? Mom hides her jewelry box when I'm around. Day 12 with the Rodriguez. They fight about money every night after they think I'm asleep. Foster care stipend isn't enough to cover what they thought it would. I'll be gone by the end of the month. He was keeping score, documenting every family's dysfunction, like he was gathering evidence that no one actually wanted him. The entries got more cynical as they went on, like he was building a case against hope itself. The last entry was about us. Did 3 days ago. Day 3 with the Millers. They seem happy, but give it time. Nobody actually wants a broken 15 year old with trust issues. Mom keeps Trying to make conversation. And dad bought me expensive headphones. Like that'll make me stay. They'll realise I'm too much work soon enough. Close the notebook and felt my heart break a little. This kid wasn't running because he was bad. He was running because he was convinced everyone would eventually give up on him anyway. I drove to every place a runaway teenager might go. Bus station, public library, McDonald's, the mall. Nothing. Finally, at 2:00am, I tried the 24 hour diner downtown. There he was, in a corner booth, that same notebook open in front of him, writing by the light of his phone. I slid into the seat across from him. He looked up, genuinely shocked. How did you find me? Lucky guess, I said, signalling the waitress for coffee. So what's your prediction about us? What's going in the notebook tonight? His face went red. You read it? Yeah, I did. And you know what? Your observations about people are scary accurate. You picked up on things about those families.

She'll never be normal. My stepdad said it over the phone. Didn't even try to hide it. Just assumed I was always too R worded to understand what was going on. You see, I have mosaic down syndrome. For those who don't know, it means that I have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in some, but not all of the body cells, which translates to this. I look like I have down syndrome, and people assume I'm fully disabled, but I have the same level of intelligence as anyone else. And my stepdad never used the R word. Heck, he never even called me stupid. Just looked through me like I was the furniture that came with the house. When teacher said I was making progress, he'd nod and change the subject. When I won an award for my art project, he put it in the drawer, not on the fridge, where my half sister's stick figures lived. But with Emma and Chloe, he was super dad. Read stories with voices, helped with homework, bragged about their test scores. My girls are sharp as tax, he'd tell anyone who'd listen. Never our girls ever. Including me. Mom would squeeze my shoulder when he did it. Like that fixed anything. Your stepdad means well, she'd say. He just doesn't know how to connect with you. I knew the story by heart. My birth father died in a car accident when I was Six months old. I was too young to remember him. Mom met David when I was three, and he'd been generous enough to take us both on. You're lucky, mom would say. Not many men would raise someone else's child especially. She never finished that sentence. But I knew what came next. Especially a child like me. In the lead up to my 13th birthday, I tried to convince myself that my parents would go all out for me. That they would pull through and finally make a day about me instead of Emma and Chloe. And in the end, they did get me a gift. Except it wasn't for me. It was for Emma and Chloe. They had gotten them three things each that they had circled in the magazine toy catalog. When I reached my hand out to ask if I could share, my dad slapped it and told me to stop being so selfish. And that's how my entire family spent my birthday. In a restaurant without me. So I did what I always did when I was bored and alone. I went through the attic. I started off with the usual old pictures of my mom. The ones before I was born. She looked happier, brighter. But then I found a stack of photos I ever seen before. And they weren't dusty because they were new. They all read Michael 2 thousand sixteen wedding on the back. My hands were trembling because Michael was my dad's Name. And he died in 2,003 or so. I thought there were more photos. Michael at what looked like Special Olympics events. Michael holding a certificate. Advocate of the Year, Down Syndrome Association. My hands trembled as I found the letters underneath. Dozens of them, all addressed to me, all unopened. My sweet Gertrude. One began, today you are seven. I wonder if you still love butterflies like when you were small. Page after page of a father I'd never known existed, writing to a daughter he wasn't allowed to see. He talked about his job at the garden center, how he'd memorized every plant's Latin name. About swimming medals and pottery classes. About the apartment he kept ready just in case. At the bottom of the stack was a court document. Custody hearing. Mom's signature on every page. Michael is not equipped to raise a child with special needs. Her statement read. It's better for Gertrude to believe he's passed in break. They took me from him because he had down syndrome. Because mom thought one of us was enough of a burden. That's when I heard the garage door open. It was the sound of my family coming home. My half sisters were giggling while my mom was practically singing about how good of a time she had. I shoved everything back except one photo and went to my room. Because on the back of it was my dad's phone number. But I was scared to call. What If he didn't want to see me, what if he hated me for not being like the other kids? Breaking point came when Emma took my good colored pencils. It was the only new thing either of my parents had bought for me in three years. All I said was, can you just use your own? And suddenly all hell broke loose. She started screaming, crying at the top of her lungs, saying, your Trude is abusing me again. Suddenly, my stepdad barged in and immediately took her side. But instead of just grounding me or sending me to my room, he said, no wonder your effing dad is dead. Probably we saw what was wrong with you and drove into that tree on purpose. Something inside me snapped. I went to my room and dialed my birth dad's phone number. Oh, my gosh, Gertrude, is that you? No one had ever sounded so happy to hear from me. But just before I could respond, my stepdad grabbed the phone and smashed it to smithereens. Full story on channel link below.

I discovered my father had secretly paid off my sister's college tuition while letting me work three jobs and take out massive loans for mine. I found out by accident last month while helping my mom clean out the attic. Inside an old shoebox, I found bank statements showing monthly payments of twenty five hundred dollars to Stanford University from 2015 to 2019, exactly when my sister Olivia attended. This hit me like a punch to the gut. When I went to college in 2015, my parents said they couldn't help either of us with tuition. We have to be fair. My dad had said. You both need to learn financial responsibility. I worked as a waitress, grocery store clerk, and campus tutor. I took out $87,000 in student loans. Some nights I was so exhausted, I fell asleep in the library between shifts. My grades suffered because I was working 40 hours a week on top of classes. Meanwhile, Olivia joined a sorority, studied abroad in Paris, and never seemed stressed about money. I assume she had better scholarships or was just really good at budgeting. We weren't close, so I never asked. Looking at those bank statements, my hands started shaking. I dug deeper into the box and found more evidence. Receipts for Olivia's apartment deposits, checks covering her sorority dues, even statements from a fun money account my dad had set up for her spring break trips. The Total came to over $180,000. All while I was eating ramen noodles and selling my plasma to make rent. I confronted my mom first. She broke down crying, admitting she'd fought with my dad about it for years. He said Olivia was more fragile than you, that you were stronger and could handle working. That night at dinner, I placed all the papers on the table. My dad's face went white. Before he could speak, I asked the question that had been burning in my mind. Was it because she was your biological daughter and I was adopted? The silence that followed told me everything.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it.

There was this kid at my high school named Connor who thought he owned the place. His dad was some big shot lawyer and his mom ran the PTA, so he basically got away with everything. Connor was team captain, had perfect grades that his parents probably bought, and a group of friends who kissed his ass constantly. His favorite target was this old janitor everyone called Mr. Pete. The guy was probably in his seventies, moved real slow, and barely spoke any English. Connor would walk by and accidentally knock over trash cans, then watch Mister Pete slowly bend down to clean it up. He'd throw food on the floor during lunch and say stuff like, oops, looks like Pedro has more work to do. Even though the guy's name wasn't Pedro, the teachers saw it but never said anything. Connor's parents donated too much money to the school. Plus he was headed to some fancy college on a football scholarship, everyone just looked the other way when he was being a complete dick. On Monday, our principal announced we had a new student shadowing classes for the week. This guy walked in, and he was definitely not your typical high school kid. He looked maybe 19 or 20, kept to himself, and had this long sleeve shirt that couldn't quite hide what looked like tattoo edges on his wrists. Nobody really talked to him. He just sat in the back of classes. Took notes and minded his own business. During lunch, he'd eat alone while watching everything going on around him. At Wednesday, Connor was having one of his usual fun sessions with Mister Pete. The old man was mopping the hallway when Connor walked by and slipped, grabbing the mop bucket and spilling dirty water everywhere. Mister Pete just stood there looking defeated, while Connor and his friends laughed their asses off. The new kid was sitting nearby and watched the whole thing. He didn't say anything, just kept eating his sandwich. But his jaw was clenched tight. Later that day in gym class, Connor was telling his buddies about the mop incident. He started doing this fake accent. Making fun of how Mr. Pete talked, calling him names. I won't repeat. The whole time the new kid was doing

But then I handed her the video I'd taken 20 minutes earlier and watched her face as she realized everyone now knew the truth. My little sister was born two months prematurely, came out bluer than a Smurf, and spent the first three years of her life hooked up to tubes and machines. Naturally, my parents were super protective of her. They'd stay by her side, buy every toy she wanted, and demand I ditch hanging with friends to babysit her. At first, I thought this was right. She was my chronically ill baby sister. But then she got older, she got healthier. She no longer needed tubes or machines and could live normally. However, by this point, she had Learned that being sick got her whatever she wanted, whether that be materialistic things or just sympathy and attention. It started with her headaches mysteriously coming back whenever she was doing homework. My parents would take the homework away before replacing it with ice cream. And by the time Emma turned 11 and I was 16, she had perfected her act. And that really bothered me because her pain only struck during my moments. When I made varsity soccer, she developed mysterious stomach cramps that required my parents to leave my first game early. When I got accepted into college, she collapsed during my Celebration dinner, and we spent the night in the ER, where doctors found Nothing wrong. The worst part was how she'd smirk at me when our parents weren't looking. She even practiced her pain faces in the mirror. I tried showing my parents once, but Emma had already told them I was jealous of the attention she needed for her condition. My boyfriend, Jake lasted eight months before Emma got to him. She created fake screenshots of messages where I supposedly called her a faker and wished she would just die already. Breakup happened at a coffee shop. Jake slid his phone across the table, showing me the evidence Emma had compiled. He said he couldn't be with someone who treated their sick sister so cruelly. Emma texted me a selfie wearing the hoodie Jake had given me. That was my breaking point. For five years, I had watched her steal everything. So I started watching her closely. Way more closely than anyone ever had. And I noticed a pattern. Every time she was in pain, she always grabbed her right side. Whether that's her head, her kidney. Always right side. She always called specifically for mom, always rated her pain between 8 and ten, and always recovered in exactly two to three hours. Which was just long enough to ruin what I had planned. Once I knew this, I developed my plan. And last Sunday, it went down better than I ever could have hoped for. We were having our monthly family dinner with all the aunts, uncles and cousins. Twenty minutes, Before dinner, I went up to the bathroom where I recorded a video. I explained in the video that I was about to make a fake announcement about getting promoted at work. In this video, I predicted exactly how Emma would react. I said she would wait for the applause to die down, then grab her right side and whimper for mom. She would rate her pain as an 8, 9, or 10. She would need to lie down immediately, and she would ask mom to take her to the hospital if the pain doesn't get better within 20 minutes. At dinner, I stood up and clinked my glass. I got everyone's attention, then announced I had just been promoted with a huge raise. If you don't want to wait for part 2, you can watch the full story on my YouTube channel.

The inmate I respected most was a 19 year old kid who unalived his own mother. The twist? She had been selling him to grown men since he was seven years old. And he finally snapped when he caught her doing the same thing to his 6 year old sister. This kid, Marcus, had endured 12 years of hell. His mother would sedate him with sleeping pills crushed into his food, then lock him in rooms with strangers who paid her anywhere from two hundred to eight hundred dollars depending on what they wanted to do. She made thousands of dollars off his suffering while telling everyone he was just a troubled child who made up stories for attention. Marcus tried to tell people what was happening. At age nine, he told his teacher about the bad men who came to his house. His mother convinced the school he had behavioral problems. At 12, he tried to run away six times. Each time, his mother would cry to police about her disturbed son and they bring him right back to her. The worst part was how she manipulated him. She buy him expensive shoes after the worst nights, telling him it was their special secret and that he was helping the family survive. She convinced him that if anyone found out, they both go to jail and his little sister would end up in foster care with strangers who Might hurt her even worse. When Marcus turned 16, his mother started bringing fewer clients around. He thought maybe it was finally over. Then his sister Emma turned 6, and Marcus noticed his mother giving her the same crushed up pills. That's when he realized his nightmare was just beginning for someone else. The night it happened, Marcus came home early from his job at McDonald's and heard his little sister crying from the basement. He found his mother taking photos with her phone while a man twice his size was hurting Emma. Marcus had hidden a kitchen knife in his backpack weeks earlier. Instead of using it on himself, he used it on them. When police arrived, they found Marcus holding his sister in the living room, both covered in red liquid. Emma kept saying, Marcus saved me over and over. The basement was full of cameras, computers, and boxes of photos and videos going back years. His mother had been running a network. The case made national headlines when they found videos of Marcus dating back to second in grade. His mother had been advertising him on dark website since he was 7. The FBI arrested 43 people connected to the network, including two teachers from his elementary school and a family court judge who had dismissed Marcus's previous reports of abuse. In prison, Marcus became untouchable. Even the most violent inmates protected him like their own son. Gang leaders would personally escort him to meals. Lifers who Hadn't spoken to anyone in years. Would check on him daily. I've never seen anything like the respect this kid commanded from hardened criminals. What broke my heart was watching Marcus struggle with guilt over unaliving his mother. He'd have nightmares where he'd wake up screaming apologies to her. This kid felt bad for stopping the woman who had sold his body for 12 years and was about to do same to his baby sister. His sister Emma was placed with their aunt, who had been fighting for custody for years, but was blocked by their mother's lies. She visits Marcus every week and brings Emma once a month. Emma is now 9 years old, in therapy and slowly healing. She still calls Marcus

My mom named me river, not because she liked nature or anything meaningful like that, because her first dog was named river and she missed him. I found this out when I was 14 and my aunt Rachel got drunk at Christmas dinner. She started laughing about how mom named her kid after a dead mutt and how dad should have stopped her. Mom turned bright red and told her to shut up. That night, I asked mom if it was true. She started crying and said she was young and stupid. When I was born, that river had been her childhood dog who got hit by a car when she was 12. She missed him so much that when I came along, the name just felt right. I was devastated. My whole life, I thought my name meant something special. Turns out I was named after roadkill. But it gets worse. Last year, my parents went through this really messy divorce. During one of their screaming matches, dad yelled that he always hated my name because it reminded him of Mom's bit obsession with that dead dog. He said every time someone said my name, he thought about how mom cared more about a pet than picking something meaningful for their kid. Mom fired back that she regretted the name, too, that she was embarrassed every time she had to explain it to other parents, that she Wished she could take it back. I was upstairs doing homework, but heard everything. They had no idea I was home. After the divorce, they both started hinting that I should change my name. Mom suggested something more mature, like Emma or Grace. Dad kept saying river sounded too childish for college applications. We weren't even together anymore, but somehow agreed on this one thing. Two weeks ago, mom sat me down and said she'd pay for the legal name change, that it would be a fresh start for both of us. She had this whole speech prepared about how sorry she was and how we could pick something beautiful together. I looked at her and said no. She was confused. Started listing all these pretty names, asked what I wanted instead. I told her I'm keeping river because it's mine now. That I don't care if she named me after a dog, that she doesn't get to regret it and then make me fix her mistake. She got upset and said I was being stubborn, that people would judge me when they found out the story, that I should want something better. I told her the only

I was 15. Hiding in the bathroom stall during lunch again. It was the only place the bullies wouldn't follow. The cold tile floor had become weirdly comfortable over the past semester. I and entire lunch periods there. Back against the wall, knees pulled up so nobody could see my feet under the stall door. That morning started like any other. Woke up dreading school. Skipped breakfast because my stomach was in knots. Missed the bus on purpose so I wouldn't have to sit alone while everyone stared. I didn't notice anything was wrong when he dropped me off. He never did. First period, someone had written X yourself on my desk. Second period, my English essay was passed around and laughed at. By third period, I'd already had my backpack dumped in the hallway twice. Nobody helped. Teachers saw it happen and just looked away. One even inside, like I was the problem. Lunch was when it got really bad. The cafeteria was just one big stage for humiliation. Last week, they poured milk over my head. The week before, they'd stolen my phone and posted photo. It was pretending to be me. The comments were still coming in. So for the past month, I've been collecting pills. One from Mom's medicine cabinet, two from Grandma's purse when she visited. A handful from the medicine drawer at home. Last night, I wrote four notes. One for mom, one for dad, one For my little sister Emma. And one that just said, it's not anyone's fault. I'm just tired. That last one was for whoever found me. I folded the notes neatly and put them in my wallet. Picked out the perfect song for my last moments. Something quiet and sad that I've been listening to on repeat for weeks. I'd memorized every word. This morning, I hugged Emma extra tight before she got on her bus. She looked confused, but hugged me back. I almost broke down right there. She was the only one who'd really miss me. But she was only 8. She'd forget eventually. I took the Altoids tin out during homeroom and counted the pills one more time. 23. Internet said that was enough. When lunch period started, I went straight to the bathroom in the west wing. Nobody used it because it was far from the cafeteria. I locked myself in the last stall, the one against the wall. Took out my water bottle, set my phone on the toilet paper holder. Positioned my headphones just right. Then I opened the Altoids tin and poured the pills into my palm. My hands were shaking, but I felt calm somehow. Like I was finally taking control. I put on my headphones to listen to one last song. That's when Mister Ray knocked on the stall. So

I'm 15, and ever since the divorce last year, everything's been one long, awkward mess. My dad cheated on my mom with his coworker, who's now his wife. I found out by accident. I wasn't snooping or anything. He left his phone on the couch and went to the bathroom. A message popped up. I wish I never saw it. That one stupid message broke our family. No warnings. Just be trail. When they split, I told the judge I wanted to live with my mom. He agreed. But my dad pushed hard for visitation, and now I have to spend every other weekend at his house. At first, I refused. I didn't want anything to do with him or his shiny new family. But it started stressing my mom out. Court dates, legal fees, non stop anxiety. So I agreed under a few strict conditions. 1. I get my own room with a lock. 2. His wife doesn't speak to me. 3 I speak in exactly one family activity per weekend. No more, no less. My dad said, fine. Whatever helps us move forward. Like he didn't just nuke our entire lives and pretend we could paint over the fallout. So every other Friday, he picks me up. He talks, don't respond. He tells me I look like my mom. I pretend I didn't hear it. We go to family therapy on Saturdays where I sit there like a ghost. One hour silence. Done. Then it's back to his house. I stay in my room, headphones in, door locked. Doing school, work or gaming, or just counting the hours until I leave. It was working. Awkward, tense, but manageable. Then they showed up. His wife has two kids from a previous marriage. A 9 year old boy and a 12 year old girl. I'd met them once during a court mandated dinner. I kept my distance. I thought that was it. Nope. Two months ago, they moved in. No warning, no heads up. My dad just said, we're blending the families now, like we're a smoothie or some Pinterest project. The 9 year old, honestly, no problem. He borrows my switch games, returns them neatly stacked with a post it that says thanks, sometimes a crayon drawing. Totally chill, quiet, respectful, easy. But the 12 year old, she's a storm that doesn't take a hint. At first I tried being polite. I really did. She'd knock, peek in, ask if I wanted to watch a movie or do puzzles or whatever. I said no. She'd leave, come back ten minutes later with popcorn or candy, say, we don't even have to talk. I still said no. The third time, she didn't knock, just opened the door and walked in. Hey, I found this bracelet. Wanna see? I told her no again. She frowned and said, you're really mean, you know? I stayed quiet. She Slammed the door. I thought that was the end of it. Nope. Again, she started barging in almost every visit. Even if the door was locked, she'd knock like crazy until someone told her to stop. I. I told her clearly that I don't want to talk, hang out, or be friends. Not now, maybe not ever. I just want space. She cried. Of course she did. Ran to her mom, her mom ran to my dad. Then they both cornered me and said I was taking the divorce out on an innocent kid. I reminded my dad that I had rules, his rules, and this wasn't part of the deal. He said, things change. She's just trying to connect. I snapped. I said, then let her connect with her real dad. Oh, wait, he's not around, either. Yeah, that one stung. You can see it in his face, like I hit something raw. After that, the vibe changed completely. I locked.

Over five years, I'd given them $340,000. Not one penny had been paid back. One genuine thank you. Two weeks later, my great uncle Henry's lawyer called. Henry had left me his entire fortune. $67 million from his shipping empire. He said you were the only family member who visited him without asking for money, the lawyer explained. I asked him to keep it confidential while I figured things out. That's when I had my idea. I staged a car accident. Nothing dangerous, just a fender Bender in a parking lot with my friend's help. But I went to the hospital claiming head trauma and memory loss. The doctors were confused by my symptoms, but I'd researched everything. Perfectly selective, Amnesia. I could remember basic functions, but not people, relationships, or my financial situation. I don't understand. I told my family from the hospital bed, who are you people? Why do you keep saying you're my family? The reactions were instant and telling. Rachel immediately started reminding me about the $15,000 I promised her for a new car. You were so excited to help me, Alex. You said it was a gift. Mike brought fake loan document. You invested in my restaurant, remember? We were partners. I just need another $30,000 to keep it running. My parents. Parents kept pushing me to sign papers. These are just medical forms, son, to help with your recovery. But my elderly neighbor, Missus Patterson, who I barely knew, brought homemade soup every day. You helped my grandson with his college applications, she said. I don't expect you to remember. Kindness deserves kindness. My coworker James, who I'd mentored for two years, took vacation days to sit with me. You don't remember me, but you changed my life. Now let me help you. Even my mailman, Carlos, stopped by. You always asked about my kids, man. Made my day better. Hope you get your memory back. For three months, I watched my family try to steal from someone they thought had brain damage while strangers showed genuine care. The fine, a straw, came when Rachel brought legal papers to make her my financial guardian. Since you can't remember how to manage money, I'll take Care of everything for you. Time for the reveal. I called a family meeting at my house. Everyone came, probably thinking they'd finally get control of my assets. Rachel walked in with her guardianship papers. Mike brought more fake investment.

For as long as I can remember, my sister Claire has tried to compete with me. She's two years older, but whenever I achieved something, she found a way to one up me. When I got engaged, she got engaged six months later. When I bought my first house, she bought one down the street. But nothing compared to what she did when I got pregnant. My husband and I struggled for years with infertility. After two heartbreaking miscarriages and countless doctor visits, we finally got the news that we were expecting. It felt like a miracle. From the moment I saw those two pink lines, I already knew the name I wanted for my daughter. My grandmother raised me. After my dad passed and my mom checked out, she was my entire world. Her name was Evangeline. And before she passed, she used to say, if you ever have a little girl, I hope she carries my name. I told Claire the name one night when I was three months pregnant. I thought we were having a sister moment. She smiled and said it was beautiful. I should have known better. Two months later, Claire announced she was pregnant, too. She acted surprised and thrilled that our babies would grow up together. I was genuinely happy for her. Until the family baby shower she threw for herself. As I walked into the decorated venue, I saw a giant sign that nearly knocked the breath out of me. Welcome baby of Angeline. I froze. I. But it had to be a coincidence. But no. Claire got up and made a speech about how she always loved our grandmother's name and how it was perfect for her daughter. I pulled her aside after the speeches, trying to keep my voice steady. Claire, you knew I was naming my daughter of Evangeline? She smirked and shrugged. Well, I'm due first. Nothing stopping you from picking something else. I was stunned. My entire family just stood there awkwardly pretending not to take sides. My mom even whispered, it's just a name, honey. But it wasn't. It was the one promise I made to my grandmother. I went home that night and cried harder than I ever had through our infertility journey. But the longer I sat there, the more my sadness hardened into something else. Determination. If Claire wanted to play dirty, fine. But she underestimated me. I spent the next few weeks quietly gathering every piece of paperwork I needed. See, Claire hadn't actually filed any legal paperwork yet. She was calling the baby Evangeline, but hadn't registered the name officially. Meanwhile, I expedited my own legal name reservation with the state. In our state, you can pre

That year? I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she reached eighth grade. But I also had a student named miles who just couldn't sit still. He constantly bugged the girls, always trying to flirt, and it usually ended with him getting slapped or sent to the office. I had sent him down so many times that the front desk basically expected him every day. Eventually, I moved him to the front of the room just so I could keep an eye on him. One day, he asked me if he could sit in the back. He didn't argue or act out. He just asked nicely. For some reason, I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and the entire room was quiet. That's when I heard whispering from the back. I looked up and saw miles showing something to another student. At first glance, it looked exactly like a handgun. I froze for a second. I didn't know if I was seeing it right. Maybe it was a toy or a prop. But I couldn't tell from where I was sitting, and I knew I needed to get a better look without making a scene. I got up to help a student near the back and use that chance to look again. This time I knew for sure it wasn't fake. It was real. I felt sweat drip down my Face. My hands were shaking while I quietly pulled out my phone under the desk and tried to call 9 1 1. But the room was too quiet. I couldn't risk saying anything. I couldn't just leave the class, either. I had to keep everyone safe. And most of all, I needed to get my daughter out of there. I texted the assistant principal in all caps, telling him exactly what I had seen. Then I waited. I kept glancing at my daughter, trying to keep it together, but minutes passed and no response came. I knew I had to do something. I quietly called over one of the students I trusted and handed her a note I had written. It said, ask me to go to the bathroom, find the assistant principal, show him this tech, tell him to check his phone and leave the building right away. She nodded and left without a word. I went back to my desk and acted like nothing was wrong. Five long minutes later, someone knocked on the door. The assistant principal walked in, calm and casual, and started chatting with a couple students near the front. Then he looked at miles. Can I talk to you outside for a minute? Miles looked a little confused, but stood up as he walked past my daughter's desk. My

Yeah, kinda. What do you mean, kind of dating my mom? Look, Robin, like, the whole point was to meet you in person and to talk about this in private. Not, like, so I could strangle you in person. No, I. I wanted to meet in person so we could take our time, talk about this. How did this even happen? What is wrong with you? Oh, poor Robin. Oh, my god, David, what is wrong with you?

What are you talking about? Whoa. Here. Whoa. Let me tell you how it happened. This is how it went, okay? Oh, god. Okay, so on the day I helped your mom move, we were about halfway done with getting the things inside the house, and there was something that she was having kind of. I think it was like she was bending over to, like, Try to lift it. And, like, what? And, like, she started trip, and I caught her, you know, like. And. And she, like, looked up at me and. EWW. I mean, we didn't mean to kiss, but, like, once we did, it was all over. And, you know. Oh, my god, I'm gonna, like, I'm. David, I'm gonna throw up. Oh, Robin, take a deep breath. I'm gonna, like, pass out. Like, hold on. I'm so. We're all adults here. This is not happening. Look, Robin, I. I get it. I'm sorry, but, like, we're just people, and, like, we're attracted to each other. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're not people. That's my mom, David. That's my mom. Yeah, I know she's your mom, but Gloria is also a very sensual being. You know, like, stop it. Who knows her? Don't you do that. Are you just messing with Robin now? David, why would you say that? I mean, it's just. We're just humans, and it's not a. It's not a big deal. David, is this really worth, like, risking your relationship with this entire family? It totally is. She is just, like, we are so happy. It's just. It's amazing. So she's known you since you were a baby? That's so fucked up, Robin. I think that's part of the reason it works, is that we've known each other for so long. Like, we're already connected. Stop. Just stop it, David, you're so sick. And my mom Is disgusting too. Hey, don't talk. Don't talk about it. Yeah, you don't talk about Gloria like that. She is a beam of light in this dark world and you know it. Oh my god! Oh my god! Shut up like this is none of your business. I'm sorry I even call this radio station. Dude, it's ridiculous. Robin, it was your mom's idea that I be the one to tell you because she knew it would be really messed up if she was breaking the news to you. It is so messed up between the two of you. I think you could just give this a little time. When you see us together and. And how happy we are together, you know, all of us, you, me, Gloria, we can all sit down together. No, I can't. No, I can't talk over dinner. No, no, I can't talk about this anymore. I'm actually. I'm hanging. I'm ending this call right now and I'm calling my mom because I can't do this anymore.

No. Alright, okay, Robin, well, we'll let you go call your mom and see if you could intercept her before she gets to her new boyfriend's house. Yeah, I'm gonna call my mom right now. Unbelievable. Alright, brother, take Care. Keep us updated on the situation, okay? I feel so bad for you. She's gone. Hey, David, are you still there too? Oh, David. I feel bad, man. I didn't want it to go this way, but I. I mean, it is what it is, really. Probably not a whole lot of ways that could have gone. Are you sure you want to date the mom?

Like, you shouldn't even be telling your friends those details, let alone us. You know what? This is what's wrong with America. People are so uptight in America with sexuality.

Oh, my god, Jessica, we had a strong connection. It's worth doing this again. I was drunk. We're humans. We have urges. And we let our urges take control that night. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. We can try so many different things. That's just the beginning. Oh, my god, you're not funny. I don't think he's trying to be funny here. I'm trying to explain to you that it's okay to use your body like that. Like you're a sexy person. I'm a sexy person. We can make this work. All right, well, then let me ask you, Jessica.

My daughter's school counselor called during my lunch break. We need you to come immediately. Her voice trembled. Lily's refusing to speak to anyone. My heart stopped. Lily, my bubbly seven year old who never stopped talking, refusing to speak. The same girl who gave a presentation on butterflies to strangers at the park last weekend. I dropped everything and broke every speed limit driving to her school. The halls were eerily quiet, my heels echoing against the colorful tile floors lined with student artwork. Lily's butterfly drawing stared back at me from the star student wall. I found my daughter curled into herself in the corner chair, knees pulled tight against her chest. Her eyes were vacant, unfocused. Her yellow dress, her favorite, was wrinkled and dirty at the hem. The sparkly butterfly clip I'd fastened in her hair that morning was gone. Lily bean! I whispered, kneeling beside her. When I touched her shoulder, she flinched like my fingers were made of fire. I'd never seen her like this. Not when she fell off her bike and needed stitches. Not when our dog died. What happened? I demanded, turning to the counselor, fighting to keep panic from overtaking me. She shifted uncomfortably. We're not sure. She was fine at recess, then her teacher sent her to music class. When Mister Roberts brought her back, she was like this. The principal joined us, his tie slightly askew. Children sometimes have emotional episodes. He said, not meeting my eyes. Perhaps something upset her with her friends. I took Lily home that night. She wouldn't eat dinner, wouldn't talk. Just clutched her favorite stuffed rabbit with the missing ear. While helping her change into pajamas, I noticed dark purple bruises encircling her wrists like macabre bracelets. My stomach lurched. Baby, who did this to you? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Her tiny voice finally broke through. So quiet I had to lean close. Mister Roberts said, it's our secret game. If I tell, something bad will happen to you and daddy. My blood turned to ice. Mister Roberts? The beloved music teacher who'd been with the school for five years. The one parents fought to have their children placed with because he made special time for talented students. I called the police that night with a child psychologist. Help! The interview revealed everything. For months, Roberts had been taking special students to the supply closet.

I absolutely love people who pay with pennies. Seriously. Four years ago, I was cashiering at a Walmart on a register that holds all the smokes and alcohol. It's ten PM, and these two men in their early 20s come up to the counter. They had three very random items, which struck me as it was strange and unusual to get out items this late at night. Maybe it was for some fraternity, I don't know. It's a college town, so I get weird stuff from frats a lot. I scan the items and tell them their total is twenty two dollars and twenty cents. Grinning at each other, they reach into their jackets and slam down two massive ziploc bags full of only pennies. I stared them in the eye, but they didn't even look back at me. Everyone else in line groaned and went to other registers. These two kids knew what they were doing, but they didn't know what they were in for. Because I prepared for this. I knew this was going to inevitably happen. I grinned with them because I was going to get paid during this. These pranksters are here for recreation. I asked, is this twenty two dollars and twenty cents? No response. Did you at least count it? The more talkative one of the two just responds with no. I ask, are you going to. Nope. Is it at Least twenty two dollars and twenty cents. Um, I don't know. Nice. My coworker chips in saying hey, you guys can use the self checkout. It can take all of your coins at once. The man just replies with nope, don't trust them lady, it doesn't count all your change, right? My coworker kept trying to convince him, but to no avail. I eventually just told her I got this. I unpacked the ziplocks and threw all the pennies on the counter. It was a beautiful, massive storm of a mess. I dug straight into it. The two men, still averting my gaze, start chuckling as if they were taking away my dignity. They whisper to each other, dude. Oh my god. Dude. Yeah, dude. Hilarious. I counted each penny one by one. My coworker comes up to me, guess I'll help you count this. We worked up a system where we counted 10, put them in a pile, and then with 10 stacks of 10 pennies we separated them, making $1 piles. We made progress slowly but surely. Some customers came to the line, but we advised them to get to another line. Some of them looked at us confused, but when they saw the counter full of pennies, they understood. Some decided to wait, but when they realized it wasn't going to take just a few minutes, they took their leave. Another register in the liquor department open, so it wasn't too bad for other customers. We get To about $12 after about 10 minutes until I accidentally knocked over the piles. Oops, sorry, I said to the two men. My coworker looks at my grin.

When I was 12, my parents started leaving me home alone for entire weekends while they went to marriage retreats. They'd stock a fridge, leave $40 on the counter, and remind me not to answer the door or tell anyone they were gone. At first, I felt so grown up. No bedtime, pizza for breakfast, staying up all night playing video games. But by the third weekend, I started noticing things. Like how our neighbors, the Johnsons, would peek through their curtains when my parents loaded their car Friday afternoons. Or how Mrs. Peterson next door started finding excuses to check on me, bringing over extra cookies, or asking if I needed help with homework. The fourth weekend, something went wrong. Our power went out during a storm Friday night. I sat in the dark for hours, too scared to leave the house or call anyone. When Missus Peterson saw my flashlight through the window, she came over immediately. Where are your parents, honey? She asked gently. I lied. Said they were just running errands. She knew I was lying, but didn't push it. She invited me to stay at their house until the power came back. Spent the weekend with their family, playing board games, helping cook dinner, watching movies together. It felt so normal, so warm. When my parents came home Sunday night, I was already back in our dark old house, pretending. I've been fine alone. The Weekend visits to the Johnsons became regular. Mrs. Peterson would text me Friday afternoons. Power is looking unstable tonight. Might want to come over just in case. We both knew the power was fine, but I grabbed my backpack and spend the weekend with a family that actually wanted me around. Then one Friday, my parents didn't leave. Dad had gotten sick, so they canceled their retreat. I was disappointed, which should have been my first clue. When Missus Peterson texted about the power situation, I told her my parents were home. She replied, oh, good. I was worried about you spending another weekend alone. Another weekend alone. She knew. She known the whole time. That evening, there was a knock at our door.

Everyone in class jumped and looked around, but Mister Hollins just rolled his eyes and waved his hand at us. Stay in your seats. It's obviously just a drill, he said, not even looking up from his newspaper. District probably forgot to tell us the alarm kept blaring that loud, ear splitting sound that makes your teeth hurt. Some kids started looking genuinely scared, but Mister Hollins acted like nothing was happening. My friend Jake raised his hand. Should we maybe go outside just in case? Anyone who walks out of this room gets an automatic zero on their state test, Mister Holland snapped. And I'll make sure it goes on your permanent record. That shut everyone up real quick. State tests were a huge deal. Failing meant summer school or repeating the grade. Then I started smelling something. Not the usual cafeteria smell or cleaning supplies. Something sharp and bitter that made my nose burn. A girl named Amy, who sat by the window, suddenly pointed outside. There's smoke coming from behind the school, she said, her voice shaky. We all turned to look. Black smoke was pouring out of the back windows near the science wing. That's not a drill, I said, standing up. My chair scraped against the floor. Mister Hollins glared at me. Sit down, Dev. You're Being dramatic? I don't care about this stupid test, I said, my heart pounding. I'm not dying in here! I grabbed my backpack and headed for the door. A few other kids followed me, including Jake and Amy, but most of the class stayed frozen in their seats, too scared to move. Mister Hollins shouted after us, you'll regret this decision! I ran down the hallway and immediately saw what was wrong. Thick gray smoke was pouring out from under the science lab door. Orange flames were visible through the window. Some chemistry experiment had clearly gone very, very wrong. I slammed my hand on the fire alarm again, just to make sure it was working. The hallway was getting hazy and

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me. And I never received a single rejection email, either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones. Like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace. Or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes, like she'd known all along. Like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to. University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just Two weeks of applying, they told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't wanna be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. Then I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study. How my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me. That I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N C. Charlotte. There it was, in plain red Arial font. Rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades. Just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything. Found a tiny school three states away that she'd never heard of. Applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first Few weeks. She called me every day, but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording. It was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for. And my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone like mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we'd never get into college when she asked what my GPA was. 4.2 DASH. What? What? She exclaimed. How the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know a Zephyr? Encounter my name. By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling. I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory. Was still good. Why didn't she get

I was halfway through my math exam when the fire alarm went off. Everyone in class jumped and looked around, but Mister Hollins just rolled his eyes and waved his hand at us. Stay in your seats. It's obviously just a drill, he said, not even looking up from his newspaper. District probably forgot to tell us. The alarm kept blaring that loud, ear splitting sound that makes your teeth hurt. Some kids started looking genuinely scared, but Mister Hollins acted like nothing was happening. My friend Jake raised his hand. Should we maybe go outside just in case? Anyone who walks out of this room gets an automatic zero on their state test, Mister Holland snapped. And I'll make sure it goes on your permanent record. That shut everyone up real quick. State tests were a huge deal. Failing meant summer school or repeating the grade. Then I started smelling something. Not the usual cafeteria smell or cleaning supplies. Something sharp and bitter that made my nose burn. A girl named Amy, who sat by the window, suddenly pointed outside. There's smoke coming from behind the school, she said, her voice shaky. We all turned to look. Black smoke was pouring out of the back windows near the science wing. That's not a drill, I said, standing up. My chair scraped against the floor. Mister Hollins glared at me. Sit down, Dev. You're being dramatic. I don't care about this stupid test, I said, my heart pounding. I'm not dying in here! I grabbed my backpack and headed for the door. A few other kids followed me, including Jake and Amy, but most of the class stayed frozen in their seats, too scared to move. Mister Hollins shouted after us, you'll regret this decision! I ran down the hallway and immediately saw what was wrong. Thick gray smoke was pouring out from under the science lab door. Orange flames were visible through the window. Some chemistry experiment had clearly gone very, very wrong. I slammed my hand on the fire alarm again, just to make sure it was working. The hallway was getting hazy and

And I might be just acting jealous and crazy about it, or I might be a total idiot and something's going on behind my back. Okay. Okay, so let's start with your girlfriend. Her name is Marissa. Okay, and how long has she been your girlfriend? Since the beginning of this past summer. Okay, so a few months at least then, yeah. Okay, and so she has a friend who is a dude? Yeah, Ryan. Ryan. Okay, that was my next question. And. And so this guy works with her? Yeah, he just started there not too long ago, but he's in her department. So basically, they see each other every day. Okay, and how often do you see her? I mean, we text and stuff every day, but how often do we go on dates or hang out? Uh, you know, mostly just on weekends. Okay, so your problem is you think your girlfriend and this friend who's a dude might be more than just friends? I, I don't know. Sometimes I feel like it. Yeah. Okay, so let's bring our resident female expert, Ashley, in here. Hello. Yes. And you can explain why you feel that way? So why do you think they might be more than just friends? Okay, uh, so first of all, I don't understand why this guy has her phone number to text her. I mean, if he's just a friend from work, I don't Think he needs to be texting you while you're not at work? Okay, but, I mean, I have Nick's number, and I have Shaggy's number, and we all text each other on the weekends sometimes, so, I mean. Okay, well, then there's the picture she puts up. Like, all of a sudden, she'll put up pictures of stuff they're doing during the day at work, and she never used to post pictures for work. Okay, is this Ryan guy in the pictures? Most of them, yeah. Okay, and then what else? So we're supposed to go to Halo screen last Friday, and she was like, hey, babe, I wanna go watch our softball team for work play instead. Is that okay? I was like, yeah, I guess so. What time do I need to pick you up? And she was like, oh, you don't have to go. It's just a bunch of friends from work. Why don't you take your niece and nephew to hell of a scream? Let me take a wild guess. Ryan plays on the work softball team? Yeah. How'd you guess? Um, also, I didn't know. Watching the game and going out for drinks afterwards and not calling me back until the next day. Yeah, there might be something going on there. But you know what might be a good test? What's that? Okay, so I think what we should do is I should call Marissa and be like, hey, I'm Ashley. I'm friends with. So And so from your work, I was thinking of asking out Ryan, but they told me to call you first because she said you guys had a thing going on. I mean, trust me, if something's going on with him, she's gonna tell me right away. Yeah, that's true. And if not, and if nothing's going on, she's gonna say, oh, yeah, go right ahead and ask him out. I already have a boyfriend named Andy. I'm not interested in Ryan. Exactly. And if she's actually interested in this guy, she's not, you know, just gonna go, sure, go ahead and ask him out. Most girls are more possessive than that, even if they haven't done anything yet. But she's thought about it. She's gonna be like, well, actually, yeah, I think Ashley's right. I mean, I. I don't know if we're gonna find out one way or the other, and we might be left with half the audience thinking, uh, something's up or. No, she didn't sound suspicious, but I think this may be our best way to find out. So it's up to you. And you mean you. Do you wanna give it a try? Yeah, sure. As long as she doesn't know I had anything to do with it. No, she. She won't even know you're involved. So now what do we need, then? We need her phone number. Yes, we need her phone number. In the name of maybe a friend of hers that she works With, like, a female friend. So can you. You can get us that stuff, Andy? Yeah, no problem. Okay. And I'm gonna do a call out right now, quickly, to all the ladies who are listening this morning. Because, ladies, you know more than anyone, you're gonna be able to tell if something's going on. Listen close to her reaction when Ashley asks if there's something going on. I think nobody knows women better than other women. Correct. So we're gonna be relying on your judgment when we call her.

Everyone warned us about teenage adoptions being impossible. When we met Jake at 15, he'd been in the system for eight years and had this reputation for running away from every placement within weeks. The case worker pulled us aside before our first meeting. This kid's been through 12 homes, he said. He's smart, but he's got walls built so high you'll need a ladder just to see over them. Jake sat there during our meeting, hoodie pulled up, earbuds in, completely checked out. When I asked about his interests, he just shrugged. When my husband mentioned we had a spare room he could decorate however he wanted, Jake actually laughed. Not a happy laugh. You'll change your mind, he said. The first words he'd spoken. They always do. We brought him home on a Tuesday. The first few days were awkward, but not terrible. Jake would emerge from his room for meals, answer direct questions with one word responses, and disappear again. He reminded me of a feral cat we'd once tried to help. Always ready to run. By Friday morning, his room was empty. Found a note on his pillow that just said, thanks, but this won't work either. Don't take it personally. My husband wanted to call the case worker immediately. Maybe we're not cut out for this, he said, pacing around Jake's abandoned room. Maybe everyone was right about teenage adoptions. But something bothered me. Jake had Only taken his clothes and phone charger, but left behind the speed up composition notebook I'd seen him writing in constantly. He carried it everywhere, protective of it like it contained state secrets. Against my better judgment, I opened it. I expected angry rants about foster families or maybe song lyrics. Instead, it was full of detailed observations about every family he lived with, written like some kind of scientific study. Day 3 with the Johnsons. Dad yelled at mom about leaving dishes in the sink. He apologized later, but she didn't talk to him for two hours. They'll probably divorce within two years. Day 7 with the Peterson. They keep asking if I'm settling in okay, but what they really mean is are you going to steal anything or burn the house down? Mom hides her jewelry box when I'm around. Day 12 with the Rodriguez. I fight about money every night after they think I'm asleep. Foster care stipend isn't enough to cover what they thought it would. I'll be gone by the end of the month. He was keeping score, documenting every family's dysfunction, like he was gathering evidence that no one actually wanted him. The entries got more cynical as they went on, like he was building a case against hope itself. The last entry was about us, dated three days ago. Day 3 with the Millers. They seem happy, but give it time. Nobody actually wants a broken 15 year old with trust issues. Mom, Keeps trying to make conversation. And dad bought me expensive headphones. Like that'll make me stay. They'll realise I'm too much work soon enough. I closed the notebook and felt my heart break a little. This kid wasn't running because he was bad. He was running because he was convinced everyone would eventually give up on him anyway. I drove to every place a runaway teenager might go. Bus station, public library, McDonald's, the mall. Nothing. Finally, at 2:00am, I tried the 24 hour diner downtown. There he was, in a corner booth, that same notebook open in front of him, writing by the light of his phone. I slid into the seat across from him. He looked up, genuinely shocked. How did you find me? Lucky guess, I said, signalling the waitress for coffee. So, what's your prediction about us? What's going in the notebook tonight? His face went red. You read it? Yeah, I did. And you know what? Your observations about people are scary accurate. You picked up on things about those families.

My 14 year old daughter thinks she's been secretly dating a boy from her class for the past three months. Every Thursday after school, she tells me she's studying at the library, but instead goes to the ice cream shop across the street to meet him. The first time I found out was completely by accident. I was picking up my coffee from the shop next door when I spotted her sharing a banana split with this redheaded kid, both of them giggling and awkwardly avoiding eye contact. It was honestly adorable. Instead of confronting her, I decided to play along. I wanted to see how far she'd go with this secret. The next Thursday, she casually mentioned studying at the library again. I watched her fix her hair three times before leaving and apply the lip gloss I didn't know she owned. That's when I started having fun with it. Every Thursday morning I'd leave an extra $10 on the counter, pretending to forget my coffee money, snap it up when she thought I wasn't looking, probably thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. I also started making comments about the ice cream shop just to watch her squirm. You know that place has the best banana splits in town. I'd say during dinner she'd nearly choke on her food while her younger brother would look at her weird. Once I even walked into the ice cream shop while they were There! The panic on her face was priceless. She ducked under the table so fast she knocked over their milkshake. The poor boy just sat there covered in vanilla shake, looking absolutely terrified. I pretended not to notice and ordered my ice cream to go. The best part was watching her try to explain why she smelled like vanilla when she got home. The library got new air fresheners, she said, completely straight faced. I nodded seriously and said, must be expensive ones. They smell just like the ice cream shop's homemade vanilla.

Männer haben es auch nich so leicht. ich kann zum Beispiel nich über Gefühle reden, weil das immer unmännlich is und dann müssen wir aber trotzdem immer in den Krieg ziehen und in der Schule werden wir auch noch benachteiligt. du willst es doch jetzt ernsthaft nicht miteinander vergleichen, nicht meine Emotionen nicht zeigen können, vergleichen mit wir werden geschlagen und du weißt schon. also wie auch immer jedenfalls. und ich meine wer startet denn kriege?

So I was doing some grocery shopping at target today, and I was wearing my Minecraft hoodie. You know, the official one with the pixelated grass block design and a little creeper face on the sleeve. I'm 23 and work in software development, so gaming merch is pretty normal in my world. Got to the checkout line and there was this woman there with her two kids, probably around 8 and 10 years old. The kids were running around knocking stuff over, and she was getting increasingly frustrated trying to wrangle them while unloading her cart. That's when the older kid spotted my hoodie and got super excited. Mom, look! That's for Minecraft! I love Minecraft! He started pointing at me and bouncing around, which caught his little brother's attention, too. The mom looked over at me with this annoyed expression, like I was somehow part of the problem now. Then she did something I absolutely wasn't prepared for. Excuse me, she said, walking over with this entitled tone. My son really likes your sweatshirt. You look way too old to be wearing something like that anyway. Why don't you give it to him? It would make him so happy. I stared at her for a second, thinking maybe I'd misheard. I'm sorry, what? Your hoodie, she repeated, now speaking slower like I was stupid. The kid wants it, and honestly, you're an adult. Isn't it time to grow out of video game clothes? Just give it to him! I couldn't believe what I was hearing. No, I'm not giving you my hoodie. I bought this myself and I like it! That's when she got aggressive. Come on, don't be selfish! Look how excited he is! The kid was indeed staring at my hoodie with wide eyes, but I wasn't about to strip down in target to make some random child happy. Ma'am, this cost me 60 bucks and I'm not taking my clothes off for your kid! I said, trying to stay calm. But then she actually reached out and tried to grab the hem of my hoodie. Just take it off! You can buy another one. He's just a child. I stepped back quickly and pulled my hoodie down. Do not touch me! This is insane! The cashier was watching this whole scene unfold with wide eyes. The woman wasn't giving up though. You're being ridiculous. It's just a stupid but game shirt. Adults shouldn't be wearing kids stuff anyway. Lady, Minecraft isn't just for kids! I said, getting more annoyed by the second. And even if it was, that doesn't mean you can just demand someone's clothes. Her son was now tugging on her arm, saying, mom, it's okay, I don't need it. But she was too worked up to listen. You're probably some basement dwelling loser anyway, she snapped. At least my son would get some use out of it. That's when I lost my patience. I'm a software engineer, I own my own house, and I can wear whatever I want. Your inability to tell your kid no is not my problem. The cashier finally stepped in. Ma'am, you need to leave this customer alone and finish your transaction. The entitled mom huffed and stomped back to her cart, muttering loud enough for everyone to hear about adults who never grew up and selfish people these days.

But then I handed her the video I'd taken 20 minutes earlier and watched her face as she realized everyone now knew the truth. My little sister was born two months prematurely, came out bluer than a Smurf, and spent the first three years of her life hooked up to tubes and machines. Naturally, my parents were super protective of her. They'd stay by her side, buy every toy she wanted, and demand I ditch hanging with friends to babysit her. At first, I thought this was right. She was my chronically ill baby sister. But then she got older, she got healthier. She no no longer needed tubes or machines and could live normally. However, by this point, she had Learned that being sick got her whatever she wanted, whether that be materialistic things or just sympathy and attention. It started with her headaches mysteriously coming back whenever she was doing homework. My parents would take the homework away before replacing it with ice cream. And by the time Emma turned 11 and I was 16, she had perfected her act. And that really bothered me because her pain only struck during my moments. When I made varsity soccer, she developed mysterious stomach cramps that required my parents to leave my first game early. When I got accepted into college, she collapsed during my Celebration dinner, and we spent the night in the ER, where doctors Found nothing wrong. The worst part was how she'd smirk at me when our parents weren't looking. She even practiced her pain faces in the mirror. I tried showing my parents once, but Emma had already told them I was jealous of the attention she needed for her condition. My boyfriend, Jake lasted eight months before Emma got to him. She created fake screenshots of messages where I supposedly called her a faker and wished she would just die already. The breakup happened at a coffee shop. Jake slid his phone across the table, showing me the evidence Emma had compiled. He said he couldn't be with someone who treated their sick sister so cruelly. Emma texted me a selfie wearing the hoodie Jake had given. That was my breaking point. For five years, I had watched her steal everything. So I started watching her closely. Way more closely than anyone ever had. And I noticed a pattern. Every time she was in pain, she always grabbed her right side. Whether that's her head, her kidney. Always right side. She always called specifically for mom, always rated her pain between 8 and 10, and always recovered in exactly two to three hours. Which was just long enough to ruin what I had planned. Once I knew this, I developed my plan. And last Sunday, it went down better than I ever could have hoped for. We were having our monthly family dinner with all the aunts, uncles and cousins. Twenty Minutes before dinner, I went up to the bathroom, where I recorded a video. I explained in the video that I was about to make a fake announcement about getting promoted at work. In this video, I predicted exactly how Emma would react. She said she would wait for the applause to die down, then grab her right side and whimper for mom. She would rate her pain as an 8, 9, or 10. She would need to lie down immediately, and she would ask mom to take her to the hospital if the pain doesn't get better within 20 minutes. At dinner, I stood up and clinked my glass. I got everyone's attention, then announced I had just been promoted with a huge raise.

Like, I don't even think she'd really want me to share with you guys though. Well, I can understand that.

I checked it and saw my wife and son sitting on the bed. They weren't my wife and son. I work nights as a nurse. It's rough, but I'm hoping for a day shift soon. One night, just after 3 a m, I got a notification from my son's camera. Sound and movement. Nothing unusual. He's 3 and usually sleeps through the night, so I figured he rolled over or coughed. I opened the app and saw my wife and son sitting on his bed. Maybe he got scared and she came to comfort him. I was about to close it when I noticed something wrong. They weren't doing anything, just sitting there, perfectly still, staring up at the camera. Their eyes were pale from the night vision. They weren't blinking, just breathing. I called my wife. She answered groggily, clearly just woken up. Hey, you guys okay? Yeah. Buddy came in a little while ago. He was scared, so I let him stay. You're in bed right now? Yeah. Why? I glanced back at the monitor. They were still sitting there. Hang on, I said, putting her on speaker and pulling up the app again. Same scene, same blank stairs. You're positive you're in bed? Yes, she said. Well, I'm looking at the camera. You and Buddy are in his room. A pause. Wait, no, we're. Hang on. I heard rustling, and then a sharp, terrified gasp and The line cut out. I called again. No answer. Then again and again. Finally, four minutes later, she called back. She was sobbing, completely hysterical.

And I might be just acting jealous and crazy about it, or I might be a total idiot and something's going on behind my back. Okay. Okay, so let's start with your girlfriend. Her name is Marissa. Okay, and how long has she been your girlfriend? Since the beginning of this past summer. Okay, so a few months at least then, yeah. Okay, and so she has a friend who is a dude? Yeah, Ryan. Ryan. Okay, that was my next question. And. And so this guy works with her? Yeah, he just started there not too long ago, but he's in her apartment. So basically, they see each other every day. Okay, and how often do you see her? I mean, we text and stuff every day, but how often do we go on dates or hang out? Uh, you know, mostly just on weekends. Okay, so your problem is you think your girlfriend and this friend who's a dude might be more than just friends? I, I don't know. Sometimes I feel like it. Yeah. Okay, so let's bring our resident female expert, Ashley, in here. Hello. Yes. And you can explain why you feel that way? So why do you think they might be more than just friends? Okay, uh, so first of all, I don't understand why this guy has her phone number to text her. I mean, if he's just a friend from work, I don't Think he needs to be texting you while you're not at work. Okay, but, I mean, I have Nick's number, and I have Shaggy's number, and we all text each other on the weekends sometimes, so, I mean. Okay, well, then there's the picture she puts up. Like, all of a sudden, she'll put up pictures of stuff they're doing during the day at work, and she never used to post pictures from work. Okay, is this Ryan guy in the pictures? Most of them, yeah. Okay, and then what else? So we're supposed to go to Halo screen last Friday, and she was like, hey, babe, I wanna go watch our softball team for work play instead. Is that okay? And I was like, yeah, I guess so. What time do I need to pick you up? And she was like, oh, you don't have to go. It's just a bunch of friends from work. Why don't you take your niece and nephew to helloscreen? Let me take a wild guess. Ryan plays on the work softball team? Yeah. How'd you guess? Um, also, I didn't know. Watching the game and going out for drinks afterwards and not calling me back until the next day. Yeah, there might be something going on there. But you know what might be a good test? What's that? Okay, so I think what we should do is I should call Marissa and be like, hey, I'm Ashley. I'm friends with so and so. From your work. I was thinking of asking out Ryan, but they told me to call you first because she said you guys had a thing going on. I mean, trust me, if something's going on with him, she's gonna tell me right away. Yeah, that's true. And if not, and if nothing's going on, she's gonna say, oh, yeah, go right ahead and ask him out. I already have a boyfriend named Andy. I'm not interested in Ryan. Exactly. And if she's actually interested in this guy, she's not, you know, just gonna go, sure, go ahead and ask him out. Most girls are more possessive than that, even if they haven't done anything yet. But she's thought about it. She's gonna be like, well, actually, yeah, I think Ashley's right. I mean, I. I don't know if we're gonna find out one way or the other, and we might be left with half the audience thinking, uh, something's up or. No, she didn't sound suspicious, but I think this may be our best way to find out. So it's up to you. And you mean you. Do you wanna give it a try? Yeah, sure. As long as she doesn't know I have anything to do with it. No, she. She won't even know you're involved. So now what do we need, then? We need her phone number. Yes, we need her phone number in the name of maybe a friend of hers that she works with, like, A female friend. So can you. You can get us that stuff, Andy? Yeah, no problem. Okay. And I'm gonna do a call out right now, quickly, to all the ladies who are listening this morning. Because, ladies, you know more than anyone, you're gonna be able to tell if something's going on. Listen close to her reaction when Ashley asks if there's something going on. I think nobody knows women better than other women. Correct. So we're gonna be relying on your judgment when we call her.

My five year old daughter's neighbor Carlos was a 19 year old who worked three jobs to support his younger siblings. Every morning, he'd wave to Lily on his way to work, and she'd run to the fence to show him her drawings. Lily called him her best grown up friend. One Saturday morning, police cars surrounded Carlos's house. There had been a break in six blocks away, and someone gave them Carlos's name as a suspect. The elderly victim, Missus Patterson, was in intensive care, fighting for her life after being brutally attacked during the robbery. The evidence seemed overwhelming. Carlos match the description. Young Hispanic male, about 6 feet tall. He'd been doing odd jobs in that neighborhood. Most damming, they found Missus Patterson's stolen jewelry in his work truck. Though Carlos swore someone planted it there. Carlos was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery and attempted murder. His family couldn't afford a good lawyer. The prosecution painted him as a dangerous criminal targeting vulnerable elderly victims. He was looking at 25 years to life for a crime I was certain he didn't commit. I knew Carlos was innocent. I'd seen him that Saturday morning working in our shared garden. But the timeline was tight. That's when I remembered. Lily had been playing in our backyard that entire morning, chattering non stop to Carlos while he worked. She'd been helping him plant tomatoes and asking him a million questions. I Called Carlos's lawyer about Lily's potential testimony. He was skeptical. Child witnesses are unreliable, but I insisted we try. We spent hours preparing Lily, explaining she needed to tell the truth about that Saturday morning when Carlos was planting vegetables. The prosecution had presented their case with confidence, DNA evidence, witness descriptions, and stolen jewelry. When the defense called Lily to the stand, the courtroom went silent. As this tiny girl walked up to the witness box, judge adjusted the microphone down to her level. Lily, the lawyer began gently, do you remember Saturday morning when Carlos was working in your garden? She nodded seriously. We were planting the tomato babies. She said clearly. Carlos was very careful with them because baby plants can die if you're not gentle. What else do you remember? She brightened. Carlos taught me about bugs, and he showed me how his hands were all dirty from the special plant food. He said he couldn't touch anything clean until we wash them. The lawyer asked, did Carlos wash his hands that morning? Oh, yes, she said proudly. We wash them together at the garden faucet with the special soap. Carlos said dirty hands make everything dirty, so we scrubbed until they were super clean. But then Lily added something that changed everything. And Carlos was very sad about his work gloves. The lawyer asked her to explain.

What happened? I was 15 when my stepmom burst into my room at 2:00am, screaming about her missing diamond earrings. She ripped apart my dresser drawers, throwing clothes everywhere. My dad appeared in the doorway, took one look at the chaos, and immediately sided with her. No questions asked, no evidence needed. She grabbed my phone and smashed it against the wall. The screen shattered into pieces. Dad yanked me out of bed and dragged me to the kitchen, where she was already on the phone with military boarding schools. I could hear her describing me as a troubled thief who needed immediate removal. I ran upstairs and started shoving clothes into my backpack. He followed me, screaming that I was proving her point. Dad blocked the doorway, saying I wasn't going anywhere until the school van arrived in the morning. That's when I remembered the $800 in birthday money I'd hidden inside my old teddy bear. I ripped it open, grabbed the cash, and told them both exactly what I thought of them. Stepmom lunged at me, trying to grab the money. I shoved past dad and bolted down the stairs. He was chasing me, yelling about calling the police for theft of my own birthday money. I sprinted out the front door and heard Dad's car starting behind me. The headlights lit up the street as I cut through backyards, jumping fences. Missus Henderson's dog started barking, which woke up half The neighborhood. I made it to the main road and flagged down a taxi. The driver looks suspicious. When a kid with a backpack and cash wanted to go to the bus station at 3:00am, I lied and said my parents were getting divorced and I was moving to my aunt's. At the station, I bought a ticket to Portland, where my aunt lived, three states away. The bus didn't leave until 6 a m, so I hid in the bathroom stall, watching through the crack for my dad's car. Security kept walking past, asking if I was okay. When the bus finally arrived, I was the first one on. Halfway through the trip, my seatmate showed me a news article on her phone about a missing teenager from my hometown. There was my school photo with the headline family fears teen was abducted. Did. I pulled my hood up and pretended to sleep while she read the article out loud to other passengers. They were all talking about how worried my poor parents must be. Twelve hours later, I was standing on my aunt's porch. Porch? Ringing the doorbell. No answer. I sat down to wait and pulled out the spare key she'd shown me years ago, hidden under the fake rock. The neighbors across the street were staring at me through their window. Twenty minutes later, a police car pulled up. The neighborhood had called, thinking I was a burglar. The officer walked over, asking for my name. And ID. I gave him my real name, figuring I was caught anyway. His radio crackled and dispatch confirmed I was the missing kid from the news. Called my dad immediately and put it on speaker. Dad was crying, saying thank god I was safe and begging me to come home. But then I heard my stepmom in the background and yelling that I was manipulating everyone and probably staged the whole thing for attention. She demanded the officer arrest me for stealing my own birthday money and running away. The officer's face hardened as he listened to a rant. Just then, my aunt's car pulled into the driveway. She jumped out, saw me with the cop, and immediately knew what had happened. He hugged me tight and told the officer she'd been documenting my stepmom's abuse for two years, waiting for exactly this moment. She pulled out her phone and showed him dozens of screenshots of text messages where my stepmom bragged about making my life miserable. The officer took copies of everything and said he'd be filing a report with child services. Within an hour, my aunt had started emergency custody paperwork. Six months later, I was living with my aunt permanently.

My mother has always believed every room exists for her grand entrance. And I don't mean that in the cute, she lights up a room kind of way. I mean it like, if there was a funeral, she'd show up in sequence. When my sister got her master's degree, mom spent the entire graduation dinner talking about how she made it all possible by giving birth to her. It started small, almost dismissible. At my eighth birthday party, she blew out my candles because the smoke was getting in her eyes. High school, she turned every parent teacher conference into a performance review of her parenting skills, while my grades sat ignored on the desk. When my brother James got into med school, she threw a party for herself with a cake that said, proud mother of a future doctor. James wasn't even in half the photos. We Learned to work around her like she was bad weather. My sister started having two parties. James stopped sharing good news until after it happened. I just went quiet. We thought we had her figured out until James met Sarah, the sweet kindergarten teacher who somehow saw the best in everyone, even my mother. They dated for seven years while mom tried everything to break them up because Sarah wasn't good enough for her baby boy. She crashed their date nights claiming emergencies and told Sarah's parents That James was exploring his options when they got engaged. She wore black to the announcement dinner, telling everyone she was in mourning for her son's freedom. And then she pulled her biggest stunt yet. The wedding. James had begged her to behave and bought her a beautiful navy blue dress the morning of the ceremony. She agreed to wear it, and we all felt so relieved. But we should have known better. I was helping James with his cuff links when I heard gasps from the corridor. And then I saw her. My mother, floating down the hallway in a full white wedding dress with a train, a veil, the works. Hers was more elaborate than Sarah's simple, elegant choice. She'd bought it in secret, hidden it at her sister's house, and had been planning this moment for months. James went pale as he processed what was happening. Seven years of Sarah's patience, thousands in deposits, 200 guests waiting, and our mother had turned it into her show. She brushed past us, adjusting her veil with practiced nonchalance. Oh, this old thing. I just thought it would be nice to feel included. That's when it clicked. Watching my brother's shoulders slump as he texted Sarah not to come out yet, I realized I could either let her ruin this day or make her the center of attention in a way she'd never forget. I grabbed the largest glass of red wine I could find from the reception setup, and Asked the bartender to fill it to the brim. Then I made my approach through the crowd of whispering relatives, calculating the angle like I was lining up a pool shot. She was holding court near the altar, surrounded by horrified aunts, spitting some story about how traditions are meant to be challenged. I walked up, turned to gesture at something behind her, and executed the most perfectly choreographed accident of my life. The wine hit her dress like abstract art. A massive crimson splash across the pristine white that spread fast through the fabric. The veil turned pink. Train looked like a crime scene. I dropped to my knees immediately, groveling and sobbing about my clumsiness. Oh, god, mom, I'm so sorry. Your beautiful dress. I even produced actual

I promised my daughter she could shave her head if she wanted to. She was 9 when she first asked. I was brushing her long brown hair before school, the same morning routine we'd had for years. Dad, can I shave my head? She asked suddenly. I paused brush mid stroke. Why would you want to do that? She shrugged. Aiden in my class did it. It looks cool, and I hate brushing my hair every day. Instead of saying no immediately, like most parents would, I thought about it. Her hair, her choice. So I told her, if you still want to shave your head in three months, we'll do it. I figured she'd forget. Most nine year olds change their minds about everything weekly. But three months later, on the dot, she reminded me of my promise. I asked her to wait another three months. If you still want it, then we'll do it. She agreed. I was certain this phase would pass. Six months after her initial request, she brought it up again, this time with research. She printed articles about hair donation, found photos of women with shaved heads who looked confident and strong. Dad, it's been six months, she said, placing her folder of research on the kitchen table. I still wanna do it. I was cornered by my own promise, so I added one more condition. If you still wanna do this when school Breaks for summer. We'll do it then. That gave me three more months. I was sure she'd change her mind. But as summer approached, she grew more determined. She saved her allowance to buy clippers, asked for hats for her birthday. My family thought I was insane. My mother called weekly with dire warnings. She'll be bullied mercilessly, she insisted. Girls need long hair. It's part of their identity. My brother, a school counselor, cautioned me about social consequences. Kids can be cruel. Why would you let her make herself a target? Even my friends question my judgment. You're her parent once said. Sometimes you have to say no for their own good. But I remembered how many choices were made for me as a kid. How powerless it felt to have no say over my own body. And this wasn't permanent. Hair grows back. So when summer came and she asked again, I kept my promise. We went to a salon first, where she donated 10 inches to a charity for kids with cancer. The stylist gave her a box.

Met Tiger Woods when I was 15. He slapped my hat out of my hand. A different golfer whom I didn't know ran up, picked up my hat, and asked if his signature would be okay. I agreed, but I don't know who he was or what his name was, but my grandpa was pleased upon seeing it. 2. Bill Nye the Science Guy. I was on a field trip in middle school and our teacher saw him. She politely asked if he could say something to us or just say hi. We always watched him in science class. He told her to fuck off and basically berated her for bothering him and asking him to speak to a bunch of kids. I'm not sure if he was just having a bad day, but it was not the best experience as a child. 3. I was the ass. I saw Don Cheadle at an airport and was thinking about Oceans 11 and said to my friend, dude, it's Bernie Mac. And he looked back and said, no, I'm the other black guy from Oceans 11, but at least you like the movie. 4. Prince Andrew spent a lot of time around him about 10 years ago as working at private social events he attended. The guy is a total prick. 5. I met Shane Dawson at a restaurant I used to work at. He used to come in A few times a year with his fiance and in laws. He's a da heck lol. None of my servers liked him or wanted to serve his family and I damn near had to fight some little girls off the property because they would not leave without seeing him. 6. Jared Leto. I worshipped him as a teenager, mainly from seeing him in Requiem for a dream in my so called life and his band, but he was the most pretentious and arrogant person in real life. Never meet your heroes. 7 when I was six or seven, Hulk Hogan pretend WrestleMania chased me out of a boardroom I wasn't supposed to be playing around in at Little League complex Cross Bayou in Penelas County. Anyways, the story is my dad was coaching a game for my brother's team. I went to go sneak around in an empty room. Hulk's son played baseball there too and he must have seen me sneak in the room. I was hiding under the front desk when he came in with his Hulk voice. Who's sneaking around in here? And seven year old me nearly had a heart attack. He play chased me out of the room while I snuck out acting like he couldn't see me. Looking back at it, you can tell he was just having fun with a kid and his famous persona. But at the time I was absolutely traumatized and nobody believed my story. 8 I wouldn't say disappointing as I never was eager to meet him. But Drake. Drake was just unprofessional and egotistical when I worked with him. Both times. This was before he got big. Big first award show type level. He's told me to fuck off directly. And I watched his mom calm him down from a tantrum.

I got to work with the original editor of Lego Ninjago season 1 through 3 on my class short film. 10. I was time magazine's person of the year in 2006. 11. A zebra bit me in my left arm. 12. So I, white woman, was a preschool teacher, and every morning my female students would want me to do their hair like Elsa braids. I had a Black student, let's call her virtue, that saw this one day and would ask me to do hers. Like Elsa, too, Virtue's hair was never up and always a bit of a mess. Well, I looked up tutorials and Learned how to do a simple style on black hair. Virtue was so happy to have her hair up like the other girls. Her mom runs over to me after the second day of this and demands to know how on earth I got virtue to sit still without her killing me. Apparently, virtue had sensory issues with her head being touched and would essentially start kicking and biting and screaming at anyone who touched it except me. Apparently, she begged me to help with Virtue's hair again. So I, whitest girl in town, became her stylist. Her mom brought in all these products, and I essentially dematted her hair over the course of an hour and would do it up. Virtue was totally chill the whole time. Eventually, she grew out of the murder phase, and her mom was able to do it herself again. But for a time, my weird flex was that this precious little girl only wanted me to do her hair. 13 I've never lost the I love you more game.

I was 15 when my stepmom burst into my room at 2 a m, screaming about her missing diamond earrings. She ripped apart my dresser drawers, throwing clothes everywhere. My dad appeared in the doorway, took one look at the chaos, and immediately sided with her. No questions asked, no evidence needed. She grabbed my phone and smashed it against the wall. The screen shattered into pieces. Dad yanked me out of bed and dragged me to the kitchen, where she was already on the phone with military boarding schools. I could hear her describing me as a troubled thief who needed immediate removal. I ran upstairs and started shoving clothes into my backpack. She followed me, screaming that I was proving her point. Dad blocked the doorway, saying I wasn't going anywhere until the school van arrived in the morning. That's when I remembered the $800 in birth, a money I'd hidden inside my old teddy bear. I ripped it open, grabbed the cash, and told them both exactly what I thought of them. Stepmom lunged at me, trying to grab the money. I shoved past dad and bolted down the stairs. She was chasing me, yelling about calling the police for theft of my own birthday money. I sprinted out the front door and heard Dad's car starting behind me. The headlights lit up the street as I cut through backyards, jump fences. Missus Henderson's dog started barking, which woke up half the neighborhood. I made it To the main road and flagged down a taxi. The drive. Ever look suspicious when a kid with a backpack and cash wanted to go to the bus station at 3 a m? I lied and said my parents were getting divorced and I was moving to my aunt's. At the station, I bought a ticket to Portland, where my aunt lived three states away. The bus didn't leave until 6 a m, so I hid in the bathroom stall, watching through the crack for my dad's car. Security kept walking past, asking if I was okay. When the bus finally arrived, I was the first one on. Halfway through the trip, my seatmate showed me a news article on her phone about a missing teenager from my hometown. There was my school photo with the headline, family fears teen was abducted. I pulled my hood up and pretended to sleep while she read the article out loud to other passengers. They were all talking about how worried my poor parents must be. Twelve hours later, I was standing on my aunt's porch, ringing the doorbell. No answer.

What did you learn? I dated a tech CEO's daughter in college, never knowing who her family was until three months in. We met at a campus coffee shop where she worked part time. I assumed she needed the money like me, another struggling student trying to make ends meet. She wore thrift store clothes, drove a beat up Honda with dents in the side, and lived in a normal dorm room with a roommate. Her name was Emily, and I fell for her laugh. First he'd snort a little when something was really funny, then get embarrassed about it. We started hanging out after her shifts. Sometimes we'd split a sandwich because neither of us claim to have enough money for a full meal. I was working two jobs between classes, and she'd always insist on studying together so I wouldn't have to choose between grades and sleep. One weekend, about three months in, she invited me to her family home for spring break. Said it would save us both money. Instead of staying in the dorms, I packed my one decent shirt and jeans without holes. The drive took two hours. As we left the city, the houses got bigger. Then we turned onto a private road and pulled up to a gated entrance with actual security guards who knew her by name. My stomach dropped as we drove another half mile up a winding driveway to what I can only describe as A modern castle, glass and steel, perched on a Hillside overlooking the ocean. What the hell? Emily? Was all I could manage to say. She bit her lip, looking more nervous than I'd ever seen her. My dad started made a software when I was a kid. It kind of took off. Took off was an understatement. Why work at a coffee shop when your dad's worth billions? I asked while staring at the indoor pool, visible through the floor to ceiling windows. He looked away and said, people treat me differently when they know either they want something or they assume I'm a spoiled brat. I just wanted someone to like me for me. That first night was surreal. Their chef? Yes, they had a personal chef. Prepared a dinner that probably cost more than my monthly food budget. Emily's father, whose face I'd seen on magazine covers, at the head of the table, studying me. During dessert, he finally spoke directly to me. So what's your five year plan? The question felt like a trap. I could have lied, could have made up some impressive sounding career trajectory. Instead, I told him honestly that I was studying engineering, had $80,000 in student loans. I hope to get a job that would let me pay them off before I was 40. The table went completely silent. Emily's mother paused with her wine glass halfway through her lips. Then her dad laughed, a genuine, unexpected laugh. Finally, someone tells me, The truth instead of what they think I want to hear. After dinner, he showed me his collection of vintage motorcycles, something Emily hadn't even mentioned she knew I was into. As we admired a restored 1965 triumph, he casually offered to pay off my student loans. Just like that. The same way someone might offer you a stick of gum. I refused. The words came out before I could even think about. About it. Thank you, sir, but I need to handle that myself. He seemed shocked. Interesting, was all he said. That night, Emily and I stayed up late talking on the balcony of their guesthouse. No one ever says no to my dad, she said, looking at me like she was seeing something new. The relation

When a man followed my wife home from work, I did something that still haunts me. She called me, her voice shaking, saying a car had been behind her for miles. At first, I told her not to panic. Maybe it was a coincidence. But then she said he was speeding up whenever she changed lanes. Every time she tried to lose him, he stayed right on her bumper. I told her to drive to the police station, to keep talking to me and stay calm. She was crying, saying she didn't want to die, that she hadn't told me the baby's name yet. Before she could turn around, I heard a loud crash. Green. Then nothing. The call went silent. Her location stopped updating. I jumped in my car and sped toward the spot where the signal died. Her vehicle was there. Spun out off the shoulder, driver's door open, phone on the ground, still recording the footage. Made me sick. He blocked her in, smashed the window, pulled her out by the hair. She screamed, dreamed that she was pregnant, begged him to stop. He laughed, dragged her into the woods. That laugh still lives in my head. It was cold, unbothered. Like this was just a game. I spent three days searching like a madman. Barely slept, barely ate. Then my brother, a cop, called. They found her barely conscious near an abandoned cabin. Clothes torn, body bruised. She couldn't speak at first. When she finally did, she just kept whispering I'm sorry over and over again, like she had done something wrong. I held her hand and promised her it was over. But I knew it wasn't. Not for me. I told my brother I needed an address. I didn't ask if he understood. He just handed me a slip of paper and said there'd be no working street cams that night. I drove there without thinking. He was outside on the porch, smoking, scrolling his phone like nothing had ever happened. When he saw me walking up, he then smirked, do I know you? I didn't say a word. Just walked up and swung the pipe. The first hit shattered his collarbone. The second hit cracked his jaw. The third. I lost count. He screamed and begged, but I wasn't listening. I saw my wife in that hospital bed. I saw her eyes when she thought I was someone coming to hurt her again. I saw her body shaking in fear, even when it was me holding her. My brother cleaned the scene. Said it looked like a robbery gone wrong. The guy had enemies. No one asked questions. But even though the world moved on, I didn't. My wife healed. We had another baby. I laugh again. I go to work. But every night, I still hear her scream. Every morning, I still feel the weight of that pipe in my hands. And sometimes when I look in the mirror, I don't see a husband or a father. I see the man who stopped being one.

And you know you know what's gonna happen to you when you go to prison. Four teenagers murdered a 73 year old grandmother, but shouting and dancing in court. Linda Freaky just celebrated her 73rd birthday a few days ago. On Sunday, she parked her car on the roadside and was answering a phone call. Four teenagers suddenly opened her car door, sprayed pepper spray on her face, and viciously attacked her. Desperate, Linda took out her wallet and begged them to take away all her belongings, only hoping to spare her life. However, the teenagers showed no mercy and forcibly dragged her out of the car, driving her car at high speed. They knew that Linda was still wearing a seatbelt and was dragged down the street for an entire block, during which her arm was crushed. Witnesses reported that her screams lasted for three minutes, which was the most heartbreaking sound they had ever heard. Then Linda died alone in pain and fear. When four teenage killers appeared in court, they shouted, laughed, and even danced without showing any remorse. Because they know that as teenagers, they won't face the death penalty and can even be released on Parole in a few years. But given the brutality of the crime, the judge is considering trying them as adults. Do you support this decision? What punishment do you think they should receive?

At first, Maria thought it was cute, but as the days went by, she became more and more intrigued by the boy's purchases. For her, it was impossible that Max was using diapers at his age.

When I was working as a school secretary at a middle school, we had this 12 year old with a severe peanut allergy whose dad was a homicide detective. The kid carried two Epipens everywhere and had strict instructions that even trace amounts of peanuts could kill him within minutes. Father had personally briefed every teacher and staff member about the severity, providing detailed emergency protocols and his direct contact numbers. Everyone took it seriously except our new cafeteria manager. This lady was obsessed with cutting costs and thought food allergies were overblown nonsense from helicopter parents. She started buying cheaper ingredients without checking labels and openly dismissed the allergy list at paranoid parent demands that waste my time. The disaster happened during lunch period on a Wednesday, despite clear warnings posted everywhere and the boy's name on the high risk allergy list. She'd used peanut oil in the supposedly allergy safe chicken nugget. She'd also cross contaminated surfaces, ignoring basic safety protocols we trained her on multiple times. Within minutes of eating, the boy's throat started closing up. His lips turned blue as he gasped for air, frantically reaching for his Epipen while other kids screamed for help. His best friend immediately ran to get a teacher, but the cafeteria manager blocked the doorway. The cafeteria manager saw him struggling and actually laughed, saying, stop being so dramatic over a little food.

My mother has always believed every room exists for her grand entrance. And I don't mean that in the cute, she lights up a room kind of way. I mean it like, if there was a funeral, she'd show up in sequins. When my sister got her master's degree, mom spent the entire graduation dinner talking about how she made it all possible by giving birth to her. It started small, almost dismissible. At my eighth birthday party, she blew out my candles because the smoke was getting in her eyes. In high school, she turned every parent teacher conference into a performance review of her parenting skills, while my grades sat ignored on the desk. When my brother James got into med school, she threw a party for herself with a cake that said, proud mother of a future doctor. James wasn't even in half the photos. We Learned to work around her like she was bad weather. My sister started having two parties. James stopped sharing good news until after it happened, and I just went quiet. We thought we had her figured out until James met Sarah, this sweet kindergarten teacher who somehow saw the best in everyone, even my mother. They dated for seven years while mom tried everything to break them up because Sarah wasn't good enough for her baby boy. She crashed their date nights, claiming emergencies and told Sarah's parents that James was exploring his options when they got engaged. She wore black to the announcement dinner, telling everyone she was in mourning for her son's freedom. And then she pulled her biggest stunt yet. The wedding. James had begged her to behave and bought her a beautiful navy blue dress the morning of the ceremony. She agreed to wear it, and we all felt so relieved. But we should have known better. I was helping James with his cuff links when I heard gasps from the corridor. And then I saw her. My mother, floating down the hallway in a full white wedding dress with a train, a veil, the works. Hers was more elaborate than Sarah's. Simple, elegant choice. She bought it in secret, hidden it at her sister's house, and had been planning this moment for months. James went pale as he processed what was happening. Seven years of Sarah's patience, thousands of deposits, 200 guests waiting, and our mother had turned it into her show. She brushed past us, adjusting her veil with practiced nonchalance. Oh, this old thing. I just thought it would be nice to feel included. That's when it clicked. Watching my brother's shoulders slump as he texted Sarah not to come out yet, I realized I could either let her ruin this day or make her the center of attention in a way she'd never forget. I grabbed the largest glass of red wine I could find from the reception. Set up and asked the bartender to fill it to the brim. Then I made my approach, cutting through the crowd of whispering relatives, calculating the angle like I was lining up a pool shot. She was holding court near the altar, surrounded by horrified aunts, telling some story about how traditions are meant to be challenged. I walked up, turned to gesture at something behind her, and executed the most perfectly choreographed accident of my life. The wine hit her dress like abstract art, a massive crimson splash across the pristine white that spread fast through the fabric. The veil turned pink. Train looked like a crime scene. I dropped to my knees immediately, grovelling and sobbing about my clumsiness. Oh, god, mom, I'm so sorry. Your beautiful dress. I even produced actual

They had no clue I was actually teaching them how to flip the script. In my family, girls were raised to live life as men's personal slaves. It didn't matter if you were a toddler, teenager, or grandmother. The second you were able to walk in the men's eyes, you were ready to submit your life to us. Ever since birth, I was raised as my sisters and stepmother's owner. So in my head, it didn't seem that crazy until I turned 12. I remember being fed graves by my stepmother when I heard a loud thump from the other room, then screaming, then another thump. Then finally silence. Turned my head and saw that it was my dad and my uncles wailing on my eight year old little sister, all because she accidentally spilled the glass of water she was fetching for my dad. My stepmother hurried over, but not to help, instead to clean the spill and apologize to the men. That's when I knew I couldn't be a part of this. The next morning, I told my dad I wanted to start training my sisters privately. I said I need to practice giving orders without adults watching. His face lit up like I told him I'd won the lottery. He actually pulled me into a hug and called me a natural born leader. I took my sisters into my bedroom. After breakfast that day, at first they stood against my bedroom wall shaking. The ten year old Alia even instinctively started undoing her skirt. But when I stopped her and patted my bed and told them both to sit, their expressions changed. And when I pushed my lunch tray between us and told them to eat, their jaws dropped. They damn near dropped to their knees thanking me. While they were ravenously eating, I dropped a bomb on them. I said I wanted to help them. They looked at me like I had three heads and lunged into hug me like they were never gonna let go. We spent that entire afternoon coming up with a plan to get them away from this hellhole. Our plan went into action that same day. In front of others, they'd serve me and act like I was their master. And in private, we planned their escape. At first, it worked beautifully. My parents praised me constantly. Family dinners. My dad would brag about how his daughters jumped at my smallest gesture. Stepmother told her friends I was gifted at commanding respect. They had no idea what was actually happening. The thing was, going through with this broke my heart. I had to watch my sisters wake at 4 to cook for me. I had to nod approvingly as my uncles ordered them to give massages. I had to strike them in front of everyone, then apologize over and over. Later, as I cleaned Their wounds in secret. But then one day, everything changed. I went to the attic to retrieve photo albums for them to look at. And behind some boxes, I found a panel with documents. Inside there, I found a medical degree with a specific name on it. It was my bio mother's name. I froze. I was always LED to believe she never attended school and went insane and died right after my youngest sister was born. That's the story my father told me, at least. When I. I discovered that, I knew I had to act even more swiftly than before. I started going to internet cafes after school. I told my family I was going to religious studies as cover. I searched for hotline numbers, research stories, what actual families look like, how to help young girls escape abusive homes. I passed what I Learned to my sisters. I gave them my pocket money and taught them to hide money in places only they cleaned. I taught them to memorize important phone numbers, important laws that made what our family did illegal. I thought we were getting close. But then that same week, everything exploded. My father didn't find anything hardcore, but he found a paper where Fatima, my 8 year old sister, had written her own name. Just her name. Nothing else. And he went absolutely ballistic. Hazed around the house before announcing aloud that both sisters would be married off immediately to save them from corruption. I wanted to protest, but I stopped myself. I couldn't blow my cover. And so instead, I did something else. Three days before the weddings were scheduled, Fatima told her teacher exactly what I taught her to say, word for word. And because this was the

Mark and I had been trying for eight years to have a baby, and with that came so much disappointment. So when I finally got pregnant, we were both over the moon. Mark immediately went out and bought a tiny baseball glove for my son, he said, with this huge smile on his face. I just laughed and told him we didn't even know the gender yet. But Mark was convinced. He converted our spare room into this sports themed nursery without even asking me. Football wallpaper and baseball crib sheets, and a little basketball hoop on the changing table. He'd already picked out a name, too. Mark junior. I kept suggesting we should have a girl name ready just in case, but he'd wave me off and say there was no need. The thing about Mark was that he came from old money, and his father made it very clear that he expected a grandson to carry on the family name. But when. When we went for the 20 week ultrasound, the text said, clear as day. Looks like you're having a girl. Mark actually argued with her, told her she was reading it wrong, and demanded she check again. She showed us three different angles, and Mark still insisted the images were unclear. On the drive home, he kept muttering about getting a second opinion. That's when things started getting weird. Mark refused to let me buy anything pink. When my sister threw Us, a baby shower. And people brought girl clothes. He donated them all without telling me. He'd already enrolled Mark junior in this all boys prep school and put down a non refundable deposit. I tried showing him the ultrasound pictures, but he said the technology wasn't always accurate. The day Lindsay was born should have been the happiest day of our lives. But when the doctor announced, she's here, Mark's face just went blank. He wouldn't cut the umbilical cord, wouldn't hold her. While I was hemorrhaging and the nurses were trying to stop the bleeding, Mark was standing in the corner of the delivery room on his phone. After we brought Lindsay home, Mark completely checked out. He wouldn't say her name, called her the baby or it. He moved into the guest room and said it was because he needed sleep for work. But I knew the truth. He couldn't stand looking at her. His mother came by one day and actually said to me, don't worry, dear. The next one will be right. Like my beautiful daughter was some kind of mistake. Then came the day that still makes my hands shake. I asked Mark to watch Lindsay while I took a shower. Just 15 minutes. When I. I came out, the house felt wrong. Too quiet. I called out for Mark and got no answer. Lindsay's car seat was gone. His keys were missing from the hook. I called his phone over and over while Running back inside to grab my keys because something deep in my gut told me this wasn't right. I used to find my phone to track him and saw he was at the mall. As I drove around the parking lot, I finally spotted his car and I parked near it. That's when my heart dropped. I saw Lindsay strapped in her car seat, her little face bright red and drenched in sweat because it was 95 degrees outside and all the car windows were up. I ran to open the door, but it was locked. I pounded on the window, screaming her name while digging for my phone to call 9 1 1. Then I remembered I had Mark's spare key. My hands shook so bad, I could barely get the door open. When I did, I immediately felt like I was in an oven. Lindsay was barely conscious. I grabbed her out of that seat and ran for the mall entrance and the air conditioning, screaming for help. A security guard radioed for an ambulance while I poured water from someone's bottle over her little body. That's when Mark strolled out of the furniture store.

Then at a family dinner, she looked me in the eyes and said, you give us nothing but headaches. The room went silent. Everyone looked away. Not one person defended me. That night, I made a decision that would change everything. I grabbed my phone and froze every single bank card connected to her accounts. No more automatic payments. No more endless financial support. Nothing. I could still hear her words echoing in my mind as I drove home. The dining room had fallen into a heavy silence after her outburst. My uncle stirred his coffee nervously. My aunt shifted in her seat. My cousins suddenly found their phones fascinating. Not a single person spoke up for me. The sting burned deeper than I wanted to admit. I had bought this house for my mother, paid the mortgage. Every month. I covered every Bill. Electricity, water, groceries, even the premium internet package my younger cousins use for streaming their favorite shows. And yet, in front of the entire family, she tossed me aside like I was nothing but a burden. I clenched my hands under the table, forcing my face to stay neutral. I wouldn't give them the satisfaction of seeing me break. That's not fair, mom, I finally said, my voice combat firm. I pay for everything. This house, the bills, the food. And you never let us forget it! She snapped, cutting me off. You act like you're doing us a favor, but a real daughter wouldn't keep score. A real daughter. I swallowed the lump in my throat and let my gaze sweep across the room. My brother Mark sat back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest, face unreadable. My sister in law avoided my eyes. My cousins kept quiet. No one, not one person was on my side. I took a deep breath. Okay, I said. My mother frowned. Okay what? Okay, I repeated, standing up and pushing my chair back with a screech that made everyone jump. If my help is such a burden, then I won't burden you anymore.

One. I got a suspension for holding a stick. The phone call with my mom went something like this, only slightly dramatized. School Mrs. The quee, your son has been suspended. Mom oh, my goodness! What did he do? S he was holding a stick. M did he hit someone with it? S no, he was just holding it. M did he threaten to hit someone with it? S no, just held it. M did he refuse to put it down when you asked? S no, no, he was very cooperative. M so what did he do wrong? S he held a stick. M and I should be upset about that? S absolutely. You know we have a zero tolerance policy. M right. Well, I'll talk with him. As you might guess, I did not get in trouble at home. 2. Can't be standing around in groups more than four. Gang mentality. Three. Locked the only boys bathroom because someone wrote on the wall in Sharpie. It wasn't even anything rude or inappropriate either. It was just the word hi or something like that. Didn't unlock the door until one boy wet himself and parents threatened to sue. That kid really sacrificed himself for everyone else. 4. They outlawed bracelets because there was an article in a magazine somewhere saying they advertised what sexual acts you were open for based on their color. Then someone tried to outlaw wristwatches for the same Reason five. Not really a rule, but the toilet paper holders are outside of the stalls on a wall. So you have to calculate before taking a shit how much you need and hope that it was enough. Six different staircases for boys and girls. Seven. We weren't allowed to wear thongs. I don't know how they caught people who did. 8. Playing cards at lunch was prohibited because it promoted gambling. 9. You have to wear your tie all the way home. Some sad bastard teachers would stand on the main road away from the school and try to hand out detentions in presumably their own time.

You know, some species of anglerfish have A very interesting mating routine. They're that deep sea fish you saw in Finding Nemo. With the glowing orb. They use as a lure to attract prey. Because the deep ocean is so vast and dark, finding a mate down there, even one who glows, can be a challenge. When scientists first started studying angler fish, they noticed that they all were females, but quickly saw that many carried some sort of parasite. Upon closer examination, they realized this parasite was actually the male angler fish. It turns out, being born A male angler. Means you are born with only one purpose. Find a female. Many have no way to feed. And will die. If they are unable to locate their female host. They are much smaller than their mates, but due to their highly developed olfactory system, pretty good at sniffing out chicks. Once they found one, they chomp down. And secure themselves by their mouth. To the female. And fuse together, essentially becoming a dick and balls. Available to the female anytime she pleases. The male will grow in size. From availability. To the nutrients from the female's diet. And be there to inseminate her from time to time. So they can make little angler babies together.

Bryce figured out that by calling someone a predator, it makes people blind to the truth and just angry. And that's what he used to destroy me. I wasn't popular, I wasn't athletic, but I was smart, kept to myself, and somehow caught the attention of Emily, someone Bryce thought belonged to him. We've been getting close. Studying together, talking after class. Nothing romantic. Not yet. But it was enough to make him spiral. Enough to make him petty. The screenshots dropped on a Friday morning. Fake DMs between me and a freshman girl. Gross stuff. That made me sick just reading it. One of them even had a blurred out photo that kind of looked like me. Just enough to get people whispering. I didn't get a warning. Didn't get a chance to defend myself. By third period, I was in the vice principal's office. Patel stared at me like I was something rotting in the walls. We're placing you on immediate suspension, she said, until the investigation is complete. What investigation? No one talked to me. No one asked questions. My teacher stopped calling on me. My teammates ghosted me. My parents barely looked me in the eye. Emily blocked me. I was done. Not just socially. Academically, too. Lost my spot in the state math championship. College rep stopped replying. My Harvard early application was put under review. But I'm not the kind of person who Screams or cries when they're hurt. I watch, I wait, and I build. First. I picked apart the evidence. The fake DMs used a font that didn't match my phone. The supposed time stamps overlapped with a class I was in. One of the messages had an emoji I've literally never used in my life. The photo? Reverse image search pulled up the original from an old group photo, one I'd forgotten even existed. The face was mine. The edit wasn't. Then came the smoking gun. One of the images still had metadata. Big mistake. It LED back to a file saved under Bryce chat one dot PNG. I checked the network logs using a friend's admin credentials from the computer science club. Bryce's student login had uploaded it using the library Wi-Fi. That's when I stopped playing defense. If he wanted a fake story that bad, I'd give him one that stuck. I spent weeks gathering dirt. Real messages from Bryce to teammates, bragging about skipping practice, mocking girls he slept with, and admitting he cheated on three finals. I used voice AI to stitch together a fake memo. Bryce laughing, saying, I can make anyone look like a predator. It's so easy. I made it sloppy on purpose so he couldn't claim it was a deep fake. Then I forged a chat between him and a test plug, someone supposedly selling SAT answers and Yale essay prompts. I added fake Cash App screenshots, Google Drive links, even a draft Of a college essay copied line for line from Reddit. When it was ready, I dropped it anonymously, first on a student Reddit thread, then through a fake Instagram account. Then I emailed it using a burner address to Miss Patel and the school board for good measure. The fire spread instantly. Emily saw it first. She cornered Bryce in the hallway. He denied everything until she asked why the voice in the memo sounded just like him. He tried to delete file.

It was a regular Tuesday at Lincoln High, third period. When the fire alarm started going off, everyone just rolled their eyes and started the usual drill. File out slowly, complain about the test we were gonna miss, stand outside for 20 minutes while they checked everything. But something felt wrong right away. See, I knew our school's alarm system pretty well because my dad actually helped install it five years ago. He'd always complained about how cheap the district was, how they got the basic model that had these specific patterns for different emergencies. This alarm wasn't following any pattern. It was just this steady beep. No flashing lights, either. And our janitor, Mister Kim, wasn't outside directing traffic like he always did during drills. That guy was obsessed with safety protocols. He'd literally memorize where every kid was supposed to stand. I was walking with my chemistry class when I saw Trevor, our hall monitor, type RA, just standing there looking confused. He had this clipboard he always carried, but he wasn't checking names off like usual. Even Missus Patterson seemed off. She kept looking at her phone instead of counting heads. That's when my stomach just dropped. Something screamed at me that this wasn't right. So I told Missus Patterson I had to use the bathroom real quick. She waved me off without even looking up. Instead of heading to the restrooms, I booked it straight to the main Office. The secretary, Miss Gonzales, was still at her desk, typing away. If this was a real emergency, she'd be gone already. Hey, um, I think something's wrong with the fire alarm, I said, trying not to sound crazy. It doesn't sound right. And Mister Kim isn't outside. She barely looked up. Honey, go back to your class lineup. It's just a drill. But I couldn't shake it. Can you just check the security panel, please? My dad helped install the system, and he always said, fine. Fine. She rolled her eyes and walked over to this big control panel on the wall. I watched her face change as she stared at the screen. That's weird, she muttered, pressing some buttons. The alarm wasn't triggered from here. She called over Mister Rodriguez, the vice principal, who came rushing over. They started whispering and pressing more buttons. Then Mister Rodriguez grabbed his radio. All staff, code black. Lockdown immediately. This is not a drill. My blood.

My high school had this absolutely psychotic bathroom policy where you could only get a hall pass during the first 10 minutes of class. The worst part? My AP history teacher, Mister Jordan, was the mastermind who pushed for this rule. He was completely obsessed with maximizing learning time and treated every bathroom break like a personal attack on his precious lesson plans. Here's the thing. Nobody knew I have severe IBS. My stomach doesn't follow a convenient 10 minute schedule, and when it hits, I have maybe 30 seconds before disaster strikes. I'd already tried talking to Jordan privately about my condition multiple times. He told me to manage my time better, actually suggested I see the school counselor about my attention seeking behavior. The guy thought I was faking a medical condition just to skip his boring lectures. The administration completely backed him up. They said medical accommodations required a formal 5:04 plan through the district office, which takes six to eight weeks to process. Until then, I had to follow the exact same rules as everyone else, medical emergency or not. For three solid weeks, I suffered through every single class. I'd sit there cramping, sweating bullets, literally praying I could somehow make it to the end of the period. Sometimes I'd have to sprint out mid lesson and face detention later for distrupting the learning environment. Jordan started making public examples of me. He'd announced to the entire class. Whenever I tried to leave. Mr. Johnson apparently thinks his bathroom needs are more important than his education and his classmates learning time. Other kids started having accidents, too. Sarah completely wet herself in chemistry class. Jack threw up all over his desk in English because he couldn't get permission to see the nurse. Jessica passed out from period cramps in math. But Jordan just doubled down harder. He installed a huge laminated sign above the whiteboard. No bathroom breaks after 10 minutes. Absolutely no exceptions. This means you. He'd point to it dramatically whenever anyone asked for a pass. Then came the day that changed everything forever. I was 25 minutes into AP history when my stomach hit full crisis mode. The familiar cramping started, but this time, it was different. More urgent. I raised my hand, already knowing what Jordan's response would be. Bathroom emergency, please. He didn't even.

My older brother Kieran was supposed to pick me up from soccer practice. I'm 11, he's 17, and mom made him promise to get me by six. Practice ends, and all the other kids leave with their parents. By 6:30, I'm sitting alone on the bleachers watching Coach Brennan lock up the equipment shed. Your brother coming? He asks. I nod, but my stomach churns. 7:00 comes. Coach Brennan offers to call my mom, but she's pulling a double shift at the hospital. Tell him Karen's probably stuck in traffic. He waits with me until 7:30, checking his watch every few minutes. Finally, he has to leave for his own family dinner. The parking lot empties car by car. Street lights flicker on one by one. I try calling Karen, but it goes straight to voicemail. My hands shake as I dial again. I'm getting scared, but I can't bother mom at work. He's been exhausted since dad moved out three months ago. By 7:45, I'm the only person left. The school feels different in the dark. Every small sound makes me jump. A cat knocks over a trash can, and I nearly scream. I walk to the front gate, but it's locked. The janitor must have secured everything after coach left. Trapped on school grounds with no way out, my phone battery drops to 15%. 8:00 arrives. That's when I see him. An older guy in a baseball cap, walking slowly across the Parking lot toward me. He keeps looking over his shoulder like he's checking if anyone's watching. His hands are stuffed deep in his jacket pockets. Hey, kid! He calls out when he's still 20 feet away. You need help? Every warning my parents ever drilled into me. Screams in my head, no, thank you. My brother's coming, I say, backing toward the building. It's pretty late, though. Been watching you sit here for an hour.

Luckily, they didn't press charges, but my parents did. Not in court, not to the police. They relinquished their parental rights. It was a lengthy process and they didn't have much evidence to give, so they made stuff up, got family members to say I and be trusted around their kids, paid my sister to say I threatened them with a kitchen knife. And that's how I spent my 16th birthday, shoving my belongings into black bin bags and crying my eyes out. When I was almost done, my 8 year old sister Emily ran in. I thought she was going to wrap her tiny self around me like she did when we were little, but she just asked if I could give her one last dollar before I left. My heart broke as I handed it to her because I knew that after I was gone, my parents would need a new punching bag. Thanks! Exclaimed before waving and sprinting out of the room. I started fantasizing about the foster home, told myself I was glad to leave because at least my parents wouldn't be able to bother me anymore. But every time I tried to convince myself that it didn't hurt, it hurt even more. So I resorted to popping a nicotine mint at every chance I had and forcing myself to disassociate. That and hiding the ear of my dog Teddy in My pocket. The one I've had since I was four. The last time everything felt okay, but the place was ten times worse than I thought. Not because it was worse than my parents it was, but because my expectations for a fresh start were crushed. The dad was a fat headed bald man with a red face and forehead lines that made it clear he was angry all the time. Meanwhile, his wife looked like she was incapable of smiling. It was like the corners of her lips and eyebrows were super glued into looking stern and mean. But still. I walked in with a huge smile on my face and when the social worker left I tried to make small talk. You guys have a beautiful home! I exclaimed, trying to keep the mood upbeat and light hearted. The woman, whose name I Learned was Martha, walked right up to me. I thought she was going to London.

I checked it and saw my wife and son sitting on the bed. They weren't my wife and son. I work nights as a nurse. It's rough, but I'm hoping for a day shift soon. One night, just after 3 a m, I got a notification from my son's camera. Sound and movement. Nothing unusual. He's 3 and usually sleeps through the night, so I figured he rolled over or coughed. I opened the app and saw my wife and son sitting on his bed. Maybe he got scared and she came to comfort him. I was about to close it when I noticed something wrong. They weren't doing anything, just sitting there, perfectly still, staring up at the camera. Their eyes were pale from the night vision. They weren't blinking, just breathing. I called my wife. She answered groggily, clearly just woken up. Hey, you guys okay? Yeah. Buddy came in a little while ago. He was scared, so I let him stay. You're in bed right now? Yeah. Why? I glanced back at the monitor. They were still sitting there. Hang on, I said, putting her on speaker and pulling up the app again. Same scene, same blank stairs. You're positive you're in bed? Yes, she said. Well, I'm looking at the camera. You and Buddy are in his room. A pause. Wait, no, we're. Hang on. I heard rustling, and then a sharp, terrified gasp and The line cut out. I called again. No answer. Then again and again. Finally, four minutes later, she called back. She was sobbing, completely hysterical.

My son begged me not to come to his school's parents career day. But since I knew that all the other parents were coming, I didn't want Liam to feel left out. But then I got to my son's classroom to sign up, and I saw that all the other parents were dressed in these really high class suits. I became a little embarrassed of myself and of my profession. But I still had my best outfit on because I wanted Liam to feel like I wasn't the first parent to go up. And all the ones before me introduced themselves as accountants, therapists, and some guy was even a heart surgeon. But. And it was my time to present in front of the class. And off the bat, I could tell my son's entire class saw me as lower, especially this one kid. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to say the little Effer's real name, so I'll call him Benjamin. Benjamin took one look at me and started to laugh, saying I looked like a bum and that my watch was fake. Tried shutting him down and told him, my dad got me this watch from Walmart, and I've had it ever since I was kid. But that only made him yell out that I look like the kind of guy who wears Walmart watches. The other kids began laughing. I remember looking across the classroom and seeing my son put his head Down and between his hands and shame. That already made me feel like an embarrassment. I cleared my throat and started to talk about my job as a waste collector in New York City and how jobs like waste collectors are the backbone of society because we do the essential work no one wants to. Well, that's when Benjamin shouted out, waste collector! That must have been where you found Liam. Everyone burst out laughing, and I saw my son tear up. That was my final straw. Disrespecting me was one thing, but disrespecting my son was something I wasn't going to tolerate. You see, I had noticed that Benjamin's dad wasn't actually present at this show, and my son had warned me previously that Benjamin didn't have a dad, so I should refrain from commenting on it. But I didn't care. I took one look at Benjamin and said, at least Liam has a loving father. Yours left you. And honestly, I don't blame him. You're the first ever child I'd actually blame for a divorce. You insufferable little crap.

One. If you can't find your kid in your house, don't search for places you'd want them to be. Search the places you don't want them to be. Pools, freezers, washing machines, and dryers. Seconds count, and if they are hiding under the table for an extra minute, who cares? 2. Choking is silent. If they're coughing, they're not actually choking. If someone goes silent and starts pointing to their neck, start the Heimlich maneuver. 3. If your kid gets kidnapped, don't teach them to say help. Teach them to say something like who the fuck are you? You're not my fucking dad! Fuck you! That's going to turn a lot more heads and get you actual help a lot quicker. 4. Carbon monoxide is odorless. Get a detector. 5. You should still attempt to dial 9 1 1 in an emergency, even if you have no bars of signal. There are protocols that allow your phone to bounce signals off any tower available, including military first responder ones in towers not on your network, in the event that you attempt to call 9 1 1. 6. If you fall through the ice, the dark spot is the way out. The sun reflects off the ice's surface. The spot you entered has no ice or reflection, so it will be dark, the opposite of what we would naturally think. 7. Just because someone rings your doorbell doesn't mean you have an obligation. To answer 8. You lose heat 20 times faster when wet. Fires being dry, shed wet clothes. Nine. Teach your kids that if they're ever separated from you, to find any closest adult, preferably with kids, the likelihood of the next person you would walk up to being a predator are slim to none. But the odds increase dramatically waiting for the first person to approach a child alone. 10. Never go to a second location. 11. Don't mix bleach with anything but water. 12. Elephants can outrun you, elephants can outswim you, elephants can throw objects at you, elephants do not think you are cute. Elephants are very emotional. And finally, elephants remember everything. 13. A fishy smell in your house could mean there's an electrical fire. 14. Don't pour water on a grease fire. Put baking soda on it instead. 15. The rocks from a river absorb water. When rapidly heated, it causes the absorbed water to boil much quicker than steam can escape the rock. This build up of steam causes the rock to explode, sending hot rock fragments everywhere. So don't use rocks from a river to make a fire pit. 16. If you get lost in the wilderness, the best thing to do is to stay calm and stay put. Unless there is an immediate threat to your safety in the area, just sit down and wait for someone to come find you. Many people don't make it or get seriously injured because they keep Moving and search and rescue can't catch up to them

One was out with a friend of mine who ran into her dad and his other family. Two, I knew a woman who was going through divorce proceedings with her husband. He was always argumentative and borderline abusive towards her, certainly always shouting and demeaning. Then, just as the divorce was entering its final stages, he very suddenly passed away. His autopsy showed that he had a massive, undiagnosed brain tumor, which had been physically altering his personality. His wife felt all kinds of guilty afterwards and took it out on everyone she talked to and lost a lot of friends in the process. Three. During the last year of my grandfather's life, he had dementia and was having trouble keeping track of reality. Before he was placed into hospice, he kept complaining about a man that was in his house. He would say that he would come around at night and that he was taking his things and using his stuff. Grandma, of course, kept reassuring him that she was the only one there. His doctor increased his medications because he was losing touch with reality so badly. Fast forward to my grandfather's funeral, and a man showed up that wasn't known by more than a few people in the family. Turns out he was an old friend of my grandmother's who showed up to give his support. In a small town like that, it wasn't exactly an unusual Thing to have random people show up to the funeral home who knew the person at some point. Well, about a year later, my grandmother lets slip that she is seeing someone. The guy from funeral. At this point, nothing too odd. They got to talking at church and we thought it was sweet. Then a bit later, sweet, innocent old grandma mentions that it's their third anniversary. Grandpa passed two years prior. This man was the person that Grandpa saw in his house every night. He was the reason that everyone thought Grandpa was going crazy. He was the reason that my grandfather was medicated to the point of being a vegetable for the last horrible year of his life. 4. My friend in college was such a jock. Worked out constantly. Total womanizer. Had posters of women in swimsuits. Also pretty conservative politically. Few years later, he's in a relationship with a black guy and also converted to Judaism. They adopted a baby girl from Korea. Five. Little town I grew up in had these two car dealerships on opposite sides of town. One Chevy, one Ford. They were bitter rivals. Attack ads, shit talking salesman, billboard wars, you name it. When the owner of the Chevy dealership passed, it came out he'd also owned the Ford dealership by way of a shell company. No one saw that coming, including a lot of the higher UPS who worked at the dealerships.

I transferred to the new high school halfway through junior year when my dad got a new job. Walking into Senor Vasquez's AP Spanish class, I immediately felt the judgment. I'm pale, freckled, with bright red hair. Basically the poster child for Gringo, who probably thinks Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. Ah, our new student, Senor Vasquez said in English, looking me up and down. I hope you have some Spanish background, because this is an advanced class. Do my best. I replied in English, taking the only empty seat in the back. From day one, Senorita Vasquez treated me like a class charity case. She'd speak slowly to me in English while rattling off rapid Spanish to everyone else. the real entertainment started when she thought I couldn't understand her side comments. Pobrecito! She'd whisper to her aid when I'd pretend to struggle with vocab. This poor boy is so lost. Red hair, no brain for languages. During group work, she'd tell the other students in Spanish, the gringo understand. He probably thinks Biblioteca means taco place. The students were just as brutal. Mira al Pelirrojo! Jessica would whisper to her friends. Look at the redhead trying to roll his R's. Sounds like a broken lawn mower. Por que es que he? Miguel would mutter, why is he even here? He should be in Spanish. One with a freshman during lunch when they thought I was out of earshot. El Gringo probably uses Google Translate for everything. Watch him fail the midterm. See, what they didn't know was that Spanish is my first language. My mom is from Guatemala, and I spent every summer with my abuela in Antigua until I was 15. But I gritted my teeth and played along. Got b's and C's on purpose. Mispronounced words I'd known since I was 3. For four months, I was their entertainment, the struggling white kid who clearly didn't belong in A P. Spanish. Then came the

Thanks to my ex boyfriend, I knew a kitty filler when I saw one. After his brother got cancer, his parents had to cut electricity cost, which meant no more Wi-Fi. Luckily, we lived practically next door to each other, so every night after curfew, he would shine this huge torch in the sky and talk to me through Morse code. That year before we broke up was enough for me to be fluent in Morse code. Never thought it would be useful for anything again until I started working at my aunt's daycare. My aunt Margaret ran Little Lambs Daycare out of this converted Victorian house. She specialized in special needs children and had this reputation as a saint in our town. When I needed a job after college, she hired me immediately. The first few weeks were normal. Diaper changes, juice spills, sticky fingers. One Tuesday, during a reading of The Very Hungry Caterpillar, I was cleaning up the area when I heard her tapping. It was Morse code. My whole body went cold. I was tapping the R word slur over and over. I stared at her. She thought she was the only one in the area to understand Morse code. After that, I couldn't hear it. During Despicable Me, she tapped stupid whenever she looked at Jaden, who had down syndrome. During Finding Nemo, she tapped waste of space while smiling at Maria Who was nonverbal? These were three year olds. Babies who trusted her. I tried to rationalize it in my head. After all, she was a daycare owner for babies and she charged the parents 40% less than other daycares. So figured that maybe the stress was just getting to her or something. But as the weeks passed, I noticed something that made my stomach turn. She started tapping things like after nap time. Well, pointing at specific children and staring at my co workers. Then those same kids would come back from special learning time withdrawn and scared. Well, it didn't take long for me to take action after I saw her tap out. Take the quiet one today. I left two minutes after they did. As soon as they were in the room, I practically barged the door open and exclaimed my presence. Hey guys, what are we all up to? I yelled, trying to pretend I was just in a cheery mood. But I guess they heard me coming because I only managed to catch one thing. The unmistakable look of relief on the child's face when she saw me walk in. My coworker smiled and hugged me before asking me to join in on their reading session. Tbh she put on such a convincing act. I started to believe that I was imagining things. Until the next morning because that's when I woke up to a text from my aunt. She cut my hours down by 75%. And I was only rostered in to work with her. Up until this point, I was probably their best worker. Every child would hug me without even knowing my name. And parents would even send me gifts to thank me for making their children so happy. That's when I knew something fishy was going on. So for weeks, I tried to act as dumb as possible. I even dyed my hair blonde to feed into the stereotype. The plan was for them to stop feeling like they needed to hide things from me. Then came the day that changed everything. Margaret was reading The Cat in the hat when she started tapping. Picture day tomorrow. But when I checked our calendar, there was no picture day scheduled. Next morning, a man I'd never seen before arrived with a camera bag. Margaret introduced him as Mr. Roll, a children's photographer. She tapped ready on her coffee mug. That's when little Emma, one of our nonverbal kids, started crying hysterically. Not normal crying. Terror. Pure terror. She grabbed onto my leg and wouldn't let go. She's just camera shy, Margaret said sweetly. But her fingers tapped. Problem. I played dumb. Oh, I can take her to the reading corner. We'll look at books while you take photos. I then scooped Emma up, still pretending to be bubbly, and clue

My son begged me not to come to his school's parents career day. But since I knew that all the other parents were coming, I didn't want Liam to feel left out. But then I got to my son's classroom to sign up, and I saw that all the other parents were dressed in these really high class suits. I became a little embarrassed of myself and of my profession. But I still had my best outfit on because I wanted Liam to feel like his father was just as important as everyone else's. I wasn't the first parent to go up, and all the ones before me introduced themselves as accountants, therapists. Some guy was even a heart surgeon. But then it was my time to present in front of the class, and off the bat, I could tell my son's entire class saw me as lower. Especially this one kid. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to say the little Effer's real name, so I'll call him Benjamin. Benjamin took one look at me and started to laugh, saying I looked like a bum and that my watch was fake. Tried shutting him down and told him, my dad got me this watch from Walmart, and I've had it ever since I was kid. But that only made him yell out that I look like the kind of guy who wears Walmart watch is. The other kids began laughing. I remember looking across The classroom. And seeing my son put his head down and between his hands in shame. That already made me feel like an embarrassment. I cleared my throat and started to talk about my job as a waste collector in New York City and how jobs like waste collectors are the backbone of society because we do the essential work no one wants to. Well, that's when Benjamin shouted out, waste collector! That must have been where you found Liam. Everyone burst out laughing, and I saw my son tear up. That was my final straw. Disrespecting me was one thing, but disrespecting my son was something I wasn't going to tolerate. You see, I had noticed that Benjamin's dad wasn't actually present at this show, and my son had warned me previously that Benjamin didn't have a dad, so I should refrain from commenting on it. But I didn't care. I took one look at Benjamin and said, at least Liam has a loving father. Yours left you. And honestly, I don't blame him. You're the first ever child I'd actually blame for a divorce. You insufferable little crap.

One day, my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking, so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home, but I couldn't have been more wrong. When she calmed down, she told me, mom, Mommy, something happened today, and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end. I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body, so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a seven year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept bouncing Between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me, and I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. See, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time, a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looked so scary, so they sent me I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. Said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

Felt ridiculous as a kid, but brilliant as an adult. My dad had one rule. Always leave a pair of old shoes outside your front door. Just one pair, well worn, dirty, like someone tough lives there. I hated it. Every time we moved apartments, he'd find a pair of beat up work boots at goodwill and place them just outside, slightly crooked, like someone had just stepped out of them. Why? I asked when I was nine. It makes people think twice, he said cryptically. It's like putting a beware of dog sign when you don't have a dog. I thought it was nonsense. We weren't even in a bad neighborhood, just your average lower middle class block. It made us look messy. I'd sneak out and tuck them inside the shoe rack every chance I got. Dad would always notice and put them right back out. Fast forward to college. I move into an off campus apartment with two other girls. First floor. Decent neighborhood, but with some sketchy activity after dark. The week after we move in, there's a string of break ins in the area. Mostly small theft. Bikes, tools, someone's Amazon package vanishing. I remember Dad's weird shoe rule, and out of you're a nostalgia or paranoia, I left an old pair of construction boots outside our door. My roommates teased me, what, you dating a lumberjack now? But I didn't care. Those boots stayed. A month later, someone tried to break in Next door, while the tenant was at work, cops came, took a report. Our door untouched. One night, my roommate was coming home late from work. She saw a guy walking slowly past our units, checking doormats and peeking into windows. He stopped dead in front of our door, looked at the boots, and walked on. She told me the next morning he didn't even touch our doorknob. It's like the boot scared him off. That night, I called my dad. I finally asked him where the rule came from. He said when he was younger, their home was broken into twice. After the second time, a neighbor told his dad to leave muddy size 13 work boots outside. People avoid trouble. He said. Big shoes mean big trouble. That pair stayed outside our door the entire year. And now I've got my own apartment. And just like clockwork, I've got a pair of heavy, muddy boots stationed right by the door. They don't belong to anyone, but everyone who walks past doesn't know that.

I was in the middle of texting my friends the road work ahead Vine during math class when the principal coughed over the school intercom, the telltale sign that he was about to make an announcement. Attention all students and staff. No one has to leave their classrooms. Everyone must remain seated until further notice. This is for your safety as much as ours. Usually no one gave an F what the teacher said, but now it was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Even Mrs. Peterson stopped writing on the board mid sentence. We heard ambulances outside and she told us to sit in our seats. We're all glancing at each other around the room, wide eyed and curious. Nobody said anything, but we were all thinking the same thing. One of the teachers had died. The red and blue lights flashed across the walls, and we heard screams from the other grades echoing throughout the building. Missus Peterson told us that it wasn't a big deal and we should all be focusing on our studies. But she could barely get the words out from how hard she was hyperventilating, so much so that she didn't even care. As we all started to take our phones out and text our theories into the Snapchat group chat about what was going down, then we heard it. Steps running past our door. Heavy ones. Multiple sets. I Couldn't help myself. I had to look. I crept to the door and peeked through the window. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall pushing a wheel stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Eve. Missus Peterson whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. people's bitmojis were popping up faster than a whack a mole game. Maybe someone finally took out Mr. Jordan. The creep be history teacher. Nah, someone definitely just had an allergic reaction. Peanut allergies go crazy. Another one said that maybe someone had taken too much fent. Mrs. Peterson tried to continue the lesson. Something about the revolutionary war, but nobody was listening. How could we care about some battle from 200 years ago when someone might be dying down the hall right now? Finally, there was a knock at the door. It was the principal standing beside a police officer. Eve O'Brien, the principal announced. My heart dropped. That was, can you come with us? Please bring your things. I silently got up and followed, not knowing what the f was going on. In the hallway, I could see the paramedics near the gym. One was sitting on the floor filling out paperwork. The stretch

There was this guy at our school who claimed he was being bullied by literally everyone. His name was Dylan, and from day one, he positioned himself as the school's biggest victim. Every week, Dylan had a new story about someone being mean to him. Kids were stealing his lunch money, destroying his homework, spreading rumours about him online. Teachers loved him because he seemed like a sweet, quiet kid who just couldn't catch a break. He'd show up to class with the sad stories about how the popular kids were making his life miserable. Dylan got special treatment everywhere. Teachers let him eat lunch in their classrooms to avoid the bullies. He got extensions on assignments because he was too stressed from harassment to focus. The guidance counselor even started a whole anti bullying campaign because she felt so bad for him. But here's what was weird. No one knew who was actually bullying Dylan. Every time a teacher would investigate his claims, the evidence would mysteriously disappear. The kids he accused would have perfect alibis. Security cameras would be broken or positioned wrong. This went on for two years. Dylan built this whole reputation as the school's most persecuted student. The truth started coming out completely by accident. This kid, Jake, in my chemistry class, had been struggling with anxiety and depression. He'd started missing a lot of school and seemed really withdrawn. When he finally came back after a Week long absence. He looked terrible during lab. Jake's hands were shaking so bad he could barely hold his test tubes. Our teacher pulled him aside and asked if everything was okay. Jake broke down crying and said he'd been. And these horrible anonymous messages for months. Someone was sending him detailed descriptions of how he should kill himself, threatening to hurt his little sister, posting embarrassing photos of him on line with cruel captions. Our teacher immediately got the counselor involved, and they started investigating Jake's phone and social media accounts. They found hundreds of messages from different fake accounts, all targeting Jake with the same writing style and specific details that only someone at our school would know. The I T. Department got involved and started tracing I P. Addresses. Every single threatening message came from the same computer. One of the library computers that students could use during lunch. Security pulled the footage from the library cameras. And guess who was sitting at that exact computer during the times

I was 12 when Brian joined my class. He was tall, played sports. He should have been liked and popular, but instead, the whole class went ghost white as soon as he walked in. The teacher even went pale. I was clearly the only one who was out of the loop. I sat down next to him during lunch either way, and everyone, including Brian himself, gave me a weird look. You actually wanna be my friend? He asked, all surprised. We spent our whole day having a blast. I didn't have any friends at the time, so I went home excited to tell my mom about the new one I had made. But when I told her his name, her face went white. Stay away from that kid. Him and his dad are monsters. They beat and hospitalized their mom. I was shocked. The next morning, mom drove me to school instead of letting me walk. She marched right up to my teacher and whispered something that made missus squelch grimly. When I tried to sit near Brian in class, missus squelch moved my seat. I took one look at Brian from across the classroom, and I saw him nearly tearing up. During recess, he stood alone by the fence while everyone else played. And after school, I saw why. Brian's dad pulled up, and the entire pickup area cleared out. Parents grabbed their kids, And speed walked to their cars. One mom actually said, don't look at him, sweetie, to her daughter. Brian's dad just sat there with his head down while Brian climbed in. Everyone treated him like they were awful, but it didn't add up. Brian's dad would pack Brian extra granola bars for kids who forgot lunch money. And Brian voluntarily stayed after school to help with tutoring special needs kids. There was just no way this was the family who beat their own mother. Then came the day I realised who Brian and his father really were. I was walking home, counting the $50 my grandma gave me for my birthday when

What are some examples of a woman's touch that she added? 1. I have these things called throw pillows now, but apparently I am not allowed to throw them. 2. The decorative hair strands stuck onto all of my walls. 3. She replaced my cardboard box with an end table unnecessarily. 4. I couldn't keep my motorcycle in the living room or my tools and parts in the kitchen cabinets anymore. 5. The bathroom counter is just fucked now. 6. Apparently I'm supposed to have pictures of my loved ones in my house. Who knew? 7. You go through a whole lot more toilet paper. Eight plants. I went from zero to six in a single corner of my house. Nine. Tiny ankle socks everywhere. We broke up seven years ago and I still occasionally find one in some forgotten corner of the house. 10. The million shampoo bottles and all the seasonings. 11. We now have, without exaggeration, 15 end tables in the house. Four more in the attic just in case. 12. She always gets vanilla candles and now this house always smells like a bakery, and god damn it I love it. 13. She put all my stuff away where I could never find it and created a tremendous codependency because now I had to ask her where all my stuff was. Then she gave me an attitude for always asking where my stuff Was then she would say stuff like where it always is, but I didn't create these storage spots so I never knew where that was. Help me. 14. She stopped me from almost burning down my apartment when she pulled an entire stuffed animal worth of lint out of my dryer. I didn't know that was a thing. 15. Lotions for different seasons. She has a method to which ones she uses when. And they're not cheap either. 16. Lots of plushies moved in with her. Some of them now sleep on the bed. 17. A little version of me running around. Although that was halfway my fault too. 18. She changed the sheets like what is this, Buckingham Palace? 19. Different sizes of tea cups. I used to just make tea in a ceramic one liter beer Stein. 20. Constant mess. Clothes and hair everywhere. 21. My wife and I didn't live together until we got married and rented a house together. When we moved in, everything I owned fit inside my rusty dots hatchback. My wife's contribution to the household required an entire moving truck. 22. She buys a lot stuff for her many hobbies that only last a week. 23. Fucking shoes. So goddamn many. Shoes that don't get worn, don't get donated, but do get premium parking spaces in my closet. 24. Pillows. Lots and lots of pillows. Many of them I wasn't allowed to actually use as a pillow when napping. 25. So. Many blankets. Everywhere 26. Reading at these, I'm gobsmacked at how some guys apparently live.

One. The most bizarre house rule that I've encountered was at my friend's place, where they had a strict policy of no talking during dinner, not because of any traditional reason, but because their elderly grandmother believed that a mischievous spirit living in the dining room would learn secrets and cause chaos. 2. I cannot sit on the couch at my dad's house if his wife is home because she will feel invaded. She has to have the whole couch to herself, so I get to sit in a dining room table chair. 3. Playing beer pong at this one couple's house, and the rule was if the ball hit the floor and their cat got to it first, everyone had to finish their drinks. Cat was wicked fast, too. 4. If we slam the door as kids, my dad made us kiss the door to make it feel better. 5 once stayed at a relative's place where they had a strict no radio waves after dark rule. Post sunset, Wi-Fi was shut down, phones were powered off, and even the microwave was a no go zone. They believed that radio waves interfered with sweet dreams. The first night I was there, I felt like I time traveled to a pre internet era. 6. When I was around 8, I went to a friend's house for a playdate and dinner after school. When I asked for a drink, Her mom gave me a baby bottle with squash in it. I laughed, but she didn't laugh back. My friend took her own bottle and started drinking. I asked the mom if I could please have a cup instead, but she told me nope and that children drink from bottles in their house. Never went there again. 7. If you need to pass gas, you have to go outside and all the way to the mailbox. 8. Guests eat last. My aunt's ex husband used to make me sit and watch everyone eat before I could be served food. 9. No talking about or watching anything that contained magic. Harry Potter was banned, along with many shows and cartoons. 10. My friend's mom wouldn't let her put any trash in the bathroom. Trash can. There was a trash can there, but it was just there for show. I guess they were directed to put all trash generated in the bathroom down the toilet. 11. I had a job that involved going into people's homes. I had an inspection once at a house where the homeowners insisted that I put on this light blue bathrobe and white slippers to enter their home. The husband, wife, and adult daughter who lived with them were all wearing the same blue bathrobes. This was in the Midwest United States. Just a typical American Midwestern family, so it wasn't even like a cultural thing that I was unaware of. I still wonder to this day if they Were messing with me

One. I met Tyler, the creator, at a chick fil A in LA and was terrified to ask for a photo, but did so anyway. He agreed very sternly on the firm condition that I hold the sauce for his nuggets. And so in the photo, I'm holding the little packet, but in the background he is absolutely cackling with laughter. He then broke the facade, dapped me up, said he loves pranking people like that, and proceeded to ask me all about my life for five to 10 minutes. He also shared some fairly intimate details of his own life. A strange and beautiful man. 2. I was an extra on The Last of us and met Pedro Pascal. He was super nice. We technically weren't allowed to talk to the talent, and they'd usually ignore us, but he and Gabriel Luna talked to us anyway. 3. My sibling has a terminal illness in the 80s and make a wish sent our family to the set of Night Rider to meet David Hasselhoff. Was cool, but that's not what matters. Fast forward 30 years and I'm at Heathrow picking up a family member when I see the Hoff standing there on his phone. I approach him and wait for him to end his call. He looks at me and says hello. I tell him that we met. He looks at me and say, was their name blank? He remembered their Name after 30 years that will always stay with me. Four. Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively live relatively close to my hometown and show up to this Christmas event every now and again that our town puts on. Walked out of the ice cream parlor downtown and sitting on the bench right outside is Ryan Reynolds eating an ice cream cone. I looked up at him as I was walking out and made eye contact and I looked away. Then I looked back to make sure it was him and he looks me dead in the face and goes, I know, right? Isn't it crazy? And then he gets up and walks away. 10 out of 10. Five. Ian Mckellen came to the spa I worked at and was absolutely lovely. We didn't sell ice cream, but there was a farm shop across the road and I mentioned it and he asked me if I'd take him there. My friend who worked in the farm shop had his mouth open the whole time seeing me buying ice cream with Gandalf. 6 back in 2004 ish, John Cena and Batista gave me a spot at the gym at like 5 am. Super nice guys saw me on the bench press working alone and just walked over unprovoked to spot me. We talked for a little bit and finished our workouts together. Gave me a couple pointers. I've always rooted for them to succeed since then.

One in college woke up to roommates bed creaking. I shoot up to see what the hell is going on there. I see some woman on her back with her legs full spread eagle and my roommate just piledriving it like it was his last day on earth like a good bro. I quickly lie back down and pretend to be asleep. Her in between gasps of air is your roommate awake? Him no, he sleeps through anything. Cut to next morning. I casually get up and turn on my PlayStation 2 and start playing some random game. Roommates fling gets up and casually comes over and sits next to me. Her good morning. My name. Me good morning. Her name. Her did you sleep good last night? Me yeah, I can sleep through anything. As the last word left my mouth, I immediately realize I blew it. She began a huge flurry of slaps at my roommate while cursing at him. He didn't care because he was too busy laughing the whole time. Two something like she's too old for this, I'm not going to carry her up to bed anymore. And that was the last time I was magically transported from the living room couch to my bedroom. Three I was a camp counselor. Two girls very much like to make hot or not lists. One of them suggested a male counselor was hot and The other said he was saying mean things about me behind my back, which made him not hot. Hurt to hear that from my campers, but glad they supported me. Four old roommates planning to kick me out, and yes, they did. Five that I was dying with meningitis, but jokes on the doctors, I'm still kicking. Six my mom on a payphone begging her boyfriend for more heroin. 7 my family were staying at a friend's house and had to share a room. My dad comes to bed hammered and says to my mom something along the lines of, does it impress you that I'm this drunk and can still perform? I actually wanted to die. 8 no wonder people at school think he's gay. Said by my stepmom. 9 my mom and aunt talking, thinking ten year old me was asleep. Aunt Little John is so cute. Mom no, he's not very good looking at all. Ten when I was a kid, I used to be scared of monsters or something creeping up on me in my sleep. So I would always ask my dad to check on me before he went to bed. It made me feel more comfortable. One night, I was still awake when I heard him coming up the stairs. And I wasn't supposed to be awake and knew I would get in trouble if he saw me, so I pretended to be asleep. He came into my room and just kind of stared. At me for a few seconds, then came up close to my bed, lifted the blanket up, farted under it, turned around and left. It's been at least 15 years, and I remember that night vividly. He vehemently denies it to this day, but I know what happened. 11 my father telling my mother that sometimes he just wanted to kill me. I was five years old when I overheard this. Being that my dad was an alcoholic and full of rage, I believed him and lived my entire childhood believing he was going to kill me.

My son, Ben's best friend, Owen had the strictest parents I've ever seen. Not the typical no TV after eight strict. I'm talking next level insanity. Owen's dad, Greg, had this system where every tiny mistake cost Owen privilege points. Being one minute late to dinner, minus 5 points. Forgetting to make his bed, minus 10 points. Getting an A minus instead of an A. That's 20 points gone. The real kicker. Owen needed those points to do basically anything. Homework, eating meals, even using the bathroom. Greg installed electronic locks on everything and would only unlock them if Owen had enough points. The poor kid had to earn the right to basic necessities. Discovered how bad it was when Owen came for a sleepover, then asked if Owen could have some pizza. And Owen pulled out this little notebook where he tracked his points. He had exactly forty Seven Points left, and dinner cost 45. The kid looked terrified about spending them, knowing he'd need points for the bathroom later. That's when I Learned about the point debt system. If Owen ran out of points but needed something essential, he could go into negative points. But the payback was brutal. Every negative point needed three positive points to clear. Owen was currently negative 180 points from needing to use the bathroom unauthorized last week. I couldn't believe this was legal. Other parents in our Neighborhood knew about it, but stayed quiet because Greg was some hot shot lawyer who threatened to sue anyone who interfered with his parenting methods. One day, Ben showed me Owen's point log. The kid had to solve 50 math problems correctly to earn five points. A perfect score on a test? 15 points. But basic things like showering cost 30 points. Homework time was 25 points per subject. I'm a computer programmer, and looking at Owen's notebook gave me an idea. Greg tracked everything through this fancy smart home system he bragged about at the neighborhood. B B Q. Kind where you control everything from your phone. I noticed Greg always use the local coffee shop's Wi-Fi to manage the system remotely. The same coffee shop where I worked on my laptop every morning. It took me three days to crack into his poorly secured setup. First, I made small changes Owen would miss.

When I turned 8, my parents threw me this huge party. All my friends came. We had a bouncy house, pizza, the works. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. But right as we were about to cut my Ninja Turtles cake, my mom pulled me aside with this panicked look. Honey, we need to tell everyone to go home right now. Daddy is very sick and needs to go to the hospital. I was devastated. My friends left confused, some crying because they thought someone was dying. The bouncy house guy packed up, while I sat there in my party hat, watching my perfect day crumble. Dad spent three days in the hospital for what they said was a severe stomach infection. I felt so guilty for being upset about my ruined party when he was suffering. But this became a pattern. Every single birthday for the next 10 years, some crisis would strike right before or during my Celebration. When I turned nine, my mom got food poisoning an hour before my sleepover. When I turned 10, my grandma fell down the stairs during my bowling party. 11 was my dad's appendix acting up. 12 was our car breaking down on the way to the amusement park. By 13, I started having panic attacks before my birthday. I wake up wondering what disaster would ruin it this time. My friends stopped expecting invitations. Some parents whispered that our family Was cursed or unlucky. I began asking for quiet celebrations instead. Just cake at home, please. But even then, something always went wrong. The power would go out, someone would get injured. There was always something. When I turned 16, I didn't even want a party. I just wanted to go to dinner with my parents. But halfway through appetizers, my mom clutched her chest. I think I'm having heart palpitations. I started telling people I hated birthdays. Friends thought I was being dramatic. Just bad luck, they'd say. By 17, I was seeing a therapist for what I thought was birthday anxiety disorder. She kept asking about my family dynamics, but I defended them. They can't help that emergencies happen. When I turned 18, I didn't even tell them it was my birthday. I was planning to just let it pass quietly, maybe treat myself to coffee later. But that afternoon, I came home early from school and overheard my parents on the phone with my aunt. Yeah, we're free for dinner tonight, my mom was saying. Cheerful

I was halfway through my sandwich when the old speakers buzzed loudly. They always did before an announcement. But this time it didn't sound like the lunch schedule. The principal's voice came on, but it was shaky. Attention, students. Everyone must return to their classrooms immediately. Lock the doors. This is not a drill. The lunch lady stopped serving, and I looked at my friends, and they looked at me, and then we all moved at once. By the time we got to class, our teacher was already closing the blinds. She locked the door behind us and told us to move our desks to the corner, away from the windows. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Our teacher tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something. Crap gushing hard. People started crying and whispering that they were right outside, and I believed them. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she got up again. And walked back to her laptop. Then something changed cause her face went pale. She looked at me and asked if there was a Jack Arthur in here. The whole class turned to me like I was in trouble. She asked me to come to her and whispered if I had anything in the room that belonged to me. And I told her just my backpack. She told me to grab it and wait by the door. I didn't understand what was happening so I waited. A few minutes later there was a knock and the teacher opened the door and told me to go with the officer. Outside the hallway was full of cops and medics. I thought maybe I was being arrested and tried to think what I did wrong. But then I saw the soda machine near the bathrooms tipped over and next to it a shoe and a leg sticking out. The officer stepped in front of me fast and told me to keep my eyes forward. But I'd already seen it. He took me to a side room and told me to wait. Then the door opened and my uncle walked in. He lives an hour away and he never comes to school. So I asked him if I was in trouble but told me I was safe. I asked about my little brother Timmy, but he didn't answer. Instead he told me I needed to be strong for him. But I didn't understand. He Asked me to wear a blindfold and told me

My best friend Rachel asked me to be her maid of honor six months before her wedding. I was so excited until she handed me this thick binder with all her requirements. Most of it was normal stuff like dress fittings and shower planning, but then I got to page 12. All bridesmaids must have uniform blonde hair by the wedding date. Professional coloring appointments will be scheduled and paid for. I laughed at first, thinking it was a joke. My hair has been naturally Auburn red my whole life. It's literally my signature look. When I asked Rachel about it, she got super serious and said she wanted everything to be perfect and cohesive. She showed me this Pinterest board with all these blonde bridesmaids looking like identical dolls. I told her I wasn't comfortable dying my hair, especially since I'd never colored it before. She got this weird look and said we'd talk about it later. Two weeks pass, and she texted me a salon appointment for that Saturday. I texted back that I still wasn't doing it. She called me immediately, practically screaming that I was being selfish and ruining her vision. The other bridesmaids started getting involved. Her sister Emma kept sending me before and after photos of redheads who went blond, saying how much better they looked. Rachel's college roommate kept making comments about how it Was just hair and would grow back. her cousin started liking Instagram posts about hair transformation on my timeline. Things got really weird when Rachel scheduled a bridesmaid bonding day at her house. When I showed up, there was a professional hair colorist there with all her equipment set up. Rachel had this giant smile and said, surprise! We're all getting our hair done together! The other girls were clapping like this with some amazing gift. I felt ambushed. The colorist started talking about how gorgeous I'd look as a blonde and how healthy my hair was for bleaching. I kept saying no, but everyone was pressuring me to just sit in the chair. Just mom even showed up and started talking about how brides deserve to have their dreams come true. I finally had to leave. I grabbed my purse and walked out while Rachel was yelling behind me about how I was being a terrible friend. At night. I got removed from the bridesmaid group chat. When I texted Rachel directly, she said I had 48 hours to book the appointment or find a replacement for myself. I thought she was bluffing, but she wasn't. Two days later, she posted on Instagram about her amazing bridesmaid team with a photo of all the other girls at the salon getting blonde highlights. My replacement was her coworker who barely knew Rachel but had the right hair color. The wedding was last month. I saw all the photos online. And honestly, they did look like matching dolls. But here's the kicker. Rachel's new sister in law told me that Rachel spent

It was a good movie until it became even better. Suddenly at 1:00 in, Ryan Gosling, also known as me, said it's time to focus my energy. Then immediately after, he started ripping his clothes off and doing the thug shaker. Me, being a 29 year old male, immediately started furiously wanking. Right in the middle of the movie I started screaming and batching him uncontrollably while getting closer to the screen, my nostrils flaring up, preparing to make contact with Ryan Gosling's huge, oiled up, smelly AH! As I was getting closer to the screen, still absolutely smashing my chicken into the ground, the scrawny security officer, more like soy boy, called to me saying sir, you can't wank in a public theater. I simply replied with shooting diarrhea all over him. I had finally reached the screen and what I said could be heard for miles, instilling fear into every single woman who heard it and filling men up with undying courage. Imbue you cow! Followed by an ocean of yellow and white fluids coming from my mighty meatstick. Am I the ahole? Me, M15, and my girlfriend F16, were having sex for the first time. This is her first time and my first time as well. We were having sex for around 30 minutes. I couldn't ejaculate for some reason. I was still hard, but I couldn't nut

My son is 7 years old and once he accidentally left Google on his tablet open and I noticed a recent search for Dominicans with no hands and feet. I was kind of taken aback, so I took his tablet and did some snooping and found a bunch more. Searched for Dominicans with no heads, Dominican chests, Dominican torsos, Dominican legs, Dominicans in stores, Dominicans for sale, silver Dominicans, black Dominicans, white Dominicans. I was at a loss for words, wondering if I was raising a cereal on a liver with a specific hatred for Dominicans. I wanted to bring it up to him, but I didn't know how, so I figured I'd just take him for ice cream and maybe the casual environment would help me bring it up. Well, we made a quick pit stop at a clothing store, and at this clothing store my son asked me why Dominicans don't have hands or heads, became extremely confused and puzzled and just looked at him before he asked again, this time why there were so many different colored Dominicans. My face went a little pale and I gently told him to be quiet because his words could be taken offensively by Dominican people. He got frustrated at me and loudly screamed Dominicans aren't people, dad! As he pointed to a statue next to us. I breathed a sigh of relief. Mannequins! He meant mannequins.

I mean, Kevin. What? Why do you look so serious? I found out something shocking. What are you talking about? I overheard mom and dad talking last night. You're kidding, right? No, I'm serious. They were talking about a DNA test. Dad literally said the DNA results don't match for Kevin. He's not our son. What the flip? You're not my biological brother. Kevin, this can't be real. If you don't believe me, confront them yourself. Thank god they didn't keep the papers lying around. What do you mean by that? Nothing, Eve. Nothing at all. Kevin, tell me what's going on. You may not believe this, but it's all about love. Love? What are you even talking about? When I was seven, I was playing in the park and I saw a girl. I've never felt anything like that before. She was beautiful. But then I saw a boy playing with her. The boy looked exactly like me. What does this have to do with anything? That boy was your real brother. And the girl? That was you. Wait, what? I became best friends with your brother and asked him for a favour. My brain can't process this right now. What favour? I asked him if we could swap families. What? Are you joking? He was such a great friend, Eve. He agreed. So my entire life was a lie. I did it all just to be close to you. I've loved you since the day I saw You, Kevin. I still love you, Eve. I always have. To be honest, I've had a crush on you, too. I love you, Kevin. Really? Yeah. So, will you let me hit? Of course, baby. But wait. Is my brother okay? Is he alive? Yeah, he's fine. He's doing great. Can I meet him? Okay, I'll give you his number. Actually, can I meet both of you together? No, that's not happening. Don't ever ask that again. Okay. If you say so, baby.

The vast majority of people with a first time seizure will never have another seizure again and will not need lifelong anti seizure medication. Everybody gets one freebie! 2. I once found a ladybug in my room in the middle of winter. I tried to look up if I could feed it somehow and found countless other people asking the same question. The world is full of people who have compassion enough to feed a lone bug in the winter. Three. Crows will let other crows know if you're a good person. Feeding a crow in your backyard can quickly become many crows over time, since the rumor spreads and nearby crows in your area will know you as one they like. They can also be known to be protective of you and even bring you gifts. Suffice to say, crows are one of the most intelligent creatures on the planet and they are truly underrated. 4. If you quit smoking by age 40, your life expectancy is the same as a non smoker. Also, it's never too late to quit. 5. Nobody pays all that much attention to you. Everyone is the main character in their story and thinks you're just another supporting role or an NPC. I find this very freeing. Six. There is a type of mold growing on iron around the elephant's foot in Chernobyl. This mold eats radiation and the radioactivity of the elephant's foot has decreased drastically. Since the mold started growing there, it's comforting to me that the planet can heal, no matter how bad the scar we left. 8. Your pets will forgive you if you accidentally step on them. 9. Sometimes dogs in movies have to have CGI tails because they keep wagging their tails. They are just so happy to be there. Ten. You can talk to your pet rabbit by quickly pushing your lips downwards and upwards, as if you were trying to look up your nose in a mirror. Do it quickly and you're chatting. It mimics the nose movements they make and you can see them wiggle their noses faster out of interest. Copy their rhythm and watch them talk back. Also, stomping your foot like they do, as well as turning your back on them when annoyed is understood too. If they have chewed something they shouldn't have, you can stomp one foot and turn around with your arms folded. Have a look over your shoulder to make sure they see you. They should come to check on you, and if they don't, stop and make sure they see your back is turned. Eventually they get it and come over to make sure you're okay. Then let the nose wiggling commence. You can expect them to do the same to you as well, like when you clean their enclosure.

But then I handed her the video I'd taken 20 minutes earlier and watched her face as she realized everyone now knew the truth. My little sister was born two months prematurely, came out bluer than a Smurf, and spent the first three years of her life hooked up to tubes and machines. Naturally, my parents were super protective of her. They'd stay by her side, buy every toy she wanted, and demand I ditch hanging with friends to babysit her. At first, I thought this was right. She was my chronically ill baby sister. But then she got older, she got healthier. She no longer needed tubes, machines, and could live normally. However, by this point, she had Learned that being sick got her whatever she wanted, whether that be materialistic things or just sympathy and attention. It started with her headaches mysteriously coming back whenever she was doing homework. My parents would take the homework away before replacing it with ice cream. And by the time Emma turned 11 and I was 16, she had perfected her act. And that really bothered me because her pain only struck during my moments. I made varsity soccer. She developed mysterious stomach cramps that required my parents to leave my first game early. When I got accepted into college, she collapsed during my Celebration dinner, and we spent the night in the E R, where doctors found nothing wrong. The worst part was how she'd smirk at me when our parents weren't looking. She even practiced her pain faces in the mirror. I tried showing my parents once, but Emma had already told them I was jealous of the attention she needed for her condition. My boyfriend, Jake lasted eight months before Emma got to him. She created fake screenshots of messages where I supposedly called her a faker and wished she would just die already. The breakup happened at a coffee shop. Jake slid his phone across the table, showing me the evidence Emma had compiled. He said he couldn't be with someone who treated their sick sister so cruelly. Emma texted me a selfie wearing the hoodie Jake had given me. That was my breaking point. For five years, I had watched her steal everything. So I started watching her closely. Way more closely than anyone ever had. And I noticed a pattern. Every time she was in pain, she. I always grabbed her right side, whether that's her head, her kidney. Always right side. She always called specifically for mom, always rated her pain between 8 and 10, and always recovered in exactly two to three hours, which was just long enough to ruin what I had planned. Once I knew this, I developed my plan. And last Sunday, it went down better than I ever could have hoped for. We were having our monthly family dinner with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins. 20 minutes, Before dinner, I went up to the bathroom, where I recorded a video. I explained in the video that I was about to make a fake announcement.

Now that I'm about to have my daughter, she comes back and says it's my obligation to name my daughter after her as a tribute. My dad passed away way too soon. He was a truck driver, and one day he had an accident. It was really sad for me, especially since my relationship with my mom was already bad. At that time, she was cheating on my dad, and I knew about it. One of the reasons my dad worked so much was because he wanted to save enough money to buy a house for the two of us so he could divorce her. Technically, the house we were living in was hers. She never really cared to hide her affair, and I often saw her bring her boyfriend home. After my dad passed, that guy became my stepdad. At first, he tried to act like he was cool with me, and honestly, I talked to him normally because I didn't have much choice. I figured if I had to live with him, we could at least try to get along. But that didn't last long. Little by little, he started telling my mom that he didn't want to raise a kid that wasn't his, and so on. I saw it all because they argue about it right in front of Me. Even though my relationship with my mom wasn't great, I never thought she'd actually kick me out. Well, I was wrong. One day, we had an argument because she had taken the money I was saving and gave it to my stepdad. I called her out on it, and that's when she told me I was useless, that she didn't want me in the house anymore, and that I was just a bad reminder of my dad. She said she didn't even understand why I was still there. I thought she was just saying that because she was mad, but no. The next day, my clothes were thrown out of the house, and when I tried to go inside, my stepdad blocked the door and told me I didn't live there anymore. I called a friend, desperate, and he let me stay at his place for a while. After that, I moved to my grandma's house. At first, she wasn't exactly thrilled about having to raise me, either, but it was definitely better than living with my mom and stepdad. Little by little, we got to know each other better, and she really became like a mom to me. From there, I finished high school, went to college, dated, got married, and now I'm finally about to have my daughter. I told my grandma the news, since we talk almost every day, even though I live far away now. Apparently, she told my mom because the next day, my Mom called me to talk about it.

A week into Air assault school, this motivated E4 decided being sleep deprived wasn't enough suffering. The DFAC had been serving those little packets of Tabasco with breakfast. This guy Cooper from the 101st had been collecting them all week. Thursday morning, I watched as he lined up 6 packets next to his eggs. What's the plan here? I asked. Eyes on the prize, man. Gotta stay awake for land now. Before anyone could stop him, Cooper tilted his head back and squeezed all six Tabasco packets directly into his eyeballs. The sound that came out of him wasn't human. He dropped like he'd been tased. Hands clawing at his face, screaming something unintelligible. Coffee mugs hit the floor as people jumped up. Two cadre members sprinted over. His face was bright red, eyes swollen shut. Within seconds, the cadre were yelling for someone to get the medics while Cooper thrashed around knocking over chairs at sick hall. The PA couldn't decide whether to help him or murder him. Did you seriously put hot sauce in your eyes to stay awake? He just kept repeating this while flushing Cooper's eyes. The diagnosis? Corneal abrasions from both the capsaisin and from Cooper frantically rubbing his eyes. Afterward, he was removed from the course and earned a new nickname, Tabasco Cyclops. The PA later told us this wasn't even in his top five dumbest self inflicted injuries. Apparently, some guy From the previous cycle had tried to use hand sanitizer as contact solution.

Staff duty during a three day weekend meant nothing but paperwork and silence across the empty battalion area. My runner had just left to check the barracks when the landline rang. Staff duty sergeant speaking. Sergeant, this is the colonel. My heart stopped. Battalion commanders don't call at midnight unless something terrible happened. MP gate just called. Apparently my government vehicle is trying to enter post without me in it. I stared at the duty log completely confused. Sir, your vehicle is parked outside headquarters. I can see it from my window. Silence then? Not according to the gate guards who are currently detaining my 16 year old son behind the wheel. My brain finally connected the dots. The colonel's son had taken his father's vehicle, left post, and was now trying to return with it. Should I drive down and. No, stay where you are. I have a different task for you that moving the actual government sedan parked outside before his wife arrived to collect their son. Apparently she didn't know her husband had allowed their underage son to drive it around post earlier. I spent the next hour hiding a government vehicle behind the motor pool, creating a plausible story about mechanical issues requiring overnight maintenance and logging absolutely none of it. The colonel arrived Monday morning with donuts, placing them silently on my desk alongside a blank counseling statement form for your records. He said quietly, Some things shouldn't go undocumented. I still have that blank form unsigned. Sometimes the best duty nights are the ones that officially never happened.

One had dinner with my friend's family. They had a bottle of something called bino on the table, and they each took turns passing it around and adding it to their food. I asked and my friend said it was anti fart drops. He later told me that his family farts a whole ton, so the bino mitigates the grossness. I couldn't shake that. He has a weird fart family and never went back. I guess that's not really a red flag. They were just sweet people with fart problems. Two. Dirty litter boxes if they have cats, and I mean filthy. Three, when they don't do basic preparation for a pre planned guest coming over. For example, there's no toilet paper, they don't offer you anything to drink. House is really messy. 4. No hand soap in the bathroom. I lived in a 10 person house in college. We had two bathrooms. It sort of naturally split into girls and guys bathrooms, except for me, who used the girls. One night we're drinking and a girl ends up using the guy's bathroom because the other was taken. She comes back and says, damn, you guys must use a ton of soap when you wash your hands. Everyone looked confused. What? She said she used that bathroom like a week or two ago and it was out of hand soap. She just used it and it's out again. You can See it dawn on everyone's faces. 5. I change the bathroom towels in our guest bathroom every Friday. One Friday, I told my son to go wipe up the urine he left on the seat and floor and then watch this imposter of my DNA wipe the urine with a hand towel and hang it back up in front of me. I've never wanted to disown a relative more in my life. 6. No sheets on their bed, but clearly they sleep on it. 7. Holes punched in the wall. No thanks. Lol. 8. When their pets water bowls are empty. Monsters.

Weird. My parents got me a phone when I was 12, so in two more years, I might get one question Mark. The dude ended up being my best friend, even if he was six years older than me. He realized his mistake. I hadn't even noticed he was technically hitting on me since I was just a kid still and changed how he treated me. He answered my question, and then we started talking. I spoke of my time in foster care, and I think he had a paternal feeling after hearing some of the stuff I spoke of. He would walk me from my bus stop to my foster home at the time. I Learned later there was a drug dealer living on one of the streets nearby and helped me with my homework and even brought me his old phone when he got a new one. He and I are actually still in touch, and I tease him about how he hit on a 10 year old. He is now married to a wonderful woman, and I gave a speech at their wedding. Love you, Jacob, too.

One in sixth grade. One night I was like, I really don't feel like going to school tomorrow, so I looked up how to get a fever. I found a tutorial that said to take a bath at the hottest temperature your bathtub will go, and then stay up all night. I decided to try it, and I started the water for a steaming hot bath. It stung to get in it, and I somehow survived it for 30 minutes. When I was getting out, I felt dizzy, and then I fell on the floor and had a seizure. I woke up and saw the blinding ceiling lights of the bathroom, and the first thing I thought was, am I dead? And then I threw up in the toilet next to me and had a migraine for the night. And later found out I got first degree burns. So long story short, don't do that. 2 when I was 17, I worked at a grocery store with a guy named Brian. Normal guy, mid twenties, little chub. Didn't really think much of him. One day he tells me about how he lives in an apartment by himself and that his neighbors are absolutely crazy. Like, they would yell at him to be quiet, pound against the wall to get him to shut up, even though he wouldn't be doing anything. He would sneeze and his neighbors would scream at the top. Of their lungs from next door. It was that bad. Tbh, I didn't really care much when he was telling me this. I just wanted to go home and not work anymore. Couple days go by and I noticed that Brian wasn't showing up anymore. Whatever. Didn't think much of that either. A month or two goes by and he finally shows back up to work. So being the nice friend I am, I asked him where he's been. He tells me he was actually fired because he was in the hospital. I didn't think that was a valid reason to fire someone, but what do I know? I didn't comment on that. I asked him why he was in the hospital, and he told me it was for personal reasons. I tell him it was good having him back and carried on with my day. Fast forward a couple days to me talking to another coworker who was good friends with Brian. He says, did you hear what happened to Brian? Yeah, he was in the hospital and was fired or something. Do you know why though? No, he said it was personal. So this is what happened. A couple months ago, before Brian disappeared. He was at home by himself when his neighbors, surprise, start yelling at him through the walls for being too loud. Brian, telling himself, I've had enough, decides to call the police and have them deal with it. The police arrived and started talking. To the neighbors. For quite some time, hours go by with the police and neighbors. So he calls the police again to ask, what's taking so long? The police respond with, dot, um, thought we left, like, an hour and a half ago. Turns out that the neighbors were never yelling at him. In fact, they were never there. Brian was schizophrenic and was hearing voices in his head. He had to go to a mental hospital for a month. Three. Around 42 years ago, my little brother was playing with match

One, I thought Mick Jagger's name was Mick Jagger, and people just never said his first name for some reason. Two, I thought that horses had toes. Until I was 22, I thought the hoof was a horseshoe and the toes were tucked inside. How did I learn how wrong I was, you ask? I was walking past a cavalry museum and saw a horse statue and loudly remarked, it must hurt so bad when they fold a horse's toes to put them into the shoe. Dozens of horse enthusiasts turned and looked at me with wild bewilderment in their eyes. Three, I was, like, 22, working at a restaurant, making myself a salad, and I asked the chef for bumps, and he stared at me for, like, 60 solid seconds trying to figure out what I wanted. I explained to him I wanted bumps for my salad. I have all the rest of the toppings, but now needed bumps. Guys, my family told me croutons were called bumps my entire life. I called my dad that night and confirmed that bumps are indeed actually called croutons. 4 that you don't have to stand in the shower while the water warms up. 5 my sister was in her 50s when she found out the meaning of you have an addictive personality. She thought after all these years of therapy, that it meant that people were addicted to her personality. We laugh hysterically. When we talk about this in a very sad way. 6. You don't have to rip the plastic top off of your new deodorant with your teeth or pliers or anything. You can just turn the base until it comes up enough to just take it off. 7 that bonsai are not a species of tree, but a way to grow them. Any tree can be a bonsai. 8. I thought that prima Donna was prima Donna and that it meant everything before the singer Madonna and just assumed she was some kind of Universal Queen. 9. Was probably 21 or 22 when I Learned that whole milk is only 3% fat. I always thought it was 100, and when I saw reduced as being 2% I thought why wouldn't they do 50% or somewhere in the middle? 10. This is something my little sister did through high school. We're about eight years apart, so we never overlapped in school. She's always been a straight A student, and I found out she worked extra hard because she wanted to catch up to me in school so we could be in school at the same time. I almost cried.

One. Men's sacks change depending on the temperature. 2. When I was a kid, diaper commercials all showed a hand pouring blue liquid into the diaper. Later I saw a pad commercial that did the same thing. So for years I thought women lost their bladder control once a month and had to wear mini diapers. And also women and babies pee blue. 3. That men don't actually shit for an hour. It's their getaway peace and quiet time. I was thinking every man had IBS. 4. That your periods can last for multiple weeks if you are coming off birth control. Like WTF? My girlfriend here is bleeding for 2 weeks now and doctors are just shrugging like yeah, it's a typical side effect. Crazy. 5. That a guy can accidentally sit on his own gonads. I assumed they retracted. 6. I didn't know that peeing for men is so complicated. Apparently it can shoot in different directions and split streams. Why haven't there been more effective toilet urinal models? Seven when my wife said sometimes women don't want our problems fixed, we just want to vent about them. I think my brain broke in that moment. Eight their peepees float. Nine. Really surprised me when I Learned girls don't poop. Ten. Let's just say things were a bit lower than expected when I first got with a girl lol. 11. When men are peeing And they see poop stains on the toilet. They try to use the force of their pee to clean off the poop stains. My husband's biggest shock was he was using the women's restroom and asked through the stall what the little metal boxes by the toilet paper was for. 12 so I worked as a cleaner at my old school for a while after leaving, and I was very surprised to discover that the girls changing rooms was more disgusting than the boys. I walked in there once, and there were five dried, bloody tampons splattered against the wall. I quit that day. 13 how much mental and physical effort women have to put into their personal security on a daily basis. 14 that feminine hygiene products are taxed extra as a luxury item in my state. 15 honestly, I just found out that at 18, my husband was required to sign up for the draft when he got his driver's license. It was not optional for him. He had to because he is a man. Sixteen. I didn't realize that guys really struggle with showing their emotions. Like, I tell my husband it's okay to get upset over things like I do, and he straight up tells me, I don't know how to do that. Damn it, society! Let men show and feel things.

I'd be most interested to see what information survived from Rome and Old Saint Peter's before the current 1500s incarnation was built. 5. A lot of under the table quid pro quo stuff in politics. Not necessarily with each other, but if I do this, company X donates some more, and if media Y says this, I let some information leak. 6. I wouldn't be surprised if giant corporations regularly have large amounts of money stolen by hackers, and that they would hide it in order not to have it affect their stock prices. 7. The degree to which the people in charge have no idea what they're doing and are basically just winging it. 8. Military technology at the top level is definitely several decades ahead of what we're even aware exists. All the technologies and sciences that you can think I wonder if the military will find a way to use that are definitely either already in prototype stage, being actively developed, or are already in limited production. 9. The A. I. We get to Play with on every Windows 11 taskbar out there has absolutely got to be a freaking potato compared to what's on the cutting edge. 10. What absolute disarray the public school system is in. Unless you work in a school, you cannot even fathom how horrible it is. From insane behaviors to kids receiving diplomas and only being able to read at a first grade level. It is beyond broken. 11 when I was younger, I read a story in the news of a company that had come up with a bacteria that they would put into your mouth. This bacteria was harmless to people, but ate the bacteria that damages our teeth. It would have destroyed the dental industry. For some reason I never saw it again. 12. True history.

No delivery pizza or takeout unless you want gas station food. Most places nearby close by five PM on weekdays and have extremely limited hours or are closed entirely on weekends. It can be pretty damn peaceful. 11 if I call 9 1 1, EMS won't be here for at least 30 minutes. 45 for fire and an hour for police. And that's assuming they have nothing else to do and respond immediately. If the house is on fire, you call the neighbors.

And instead of making any effort to pay my grandmother back, pay off the car, or have any sort of emergency fund, the two of them buy an expensive purebred puppy. They dropped over $2,000 for the dog and then spent another $500 on a crate, toys, leashes, and dog food. Less than six months later, they lost the car and were evicted. They moved in with my aunt and her husband hated the dog so it was taken to the SPCA. It wasn't even a year old. My grandmother didn't see a cent of that money returned before she passed away. 7.

The first customer of the day tipped me like $5 on their coffee and I've never been so happy in my life. 3. I called in sick at my job because I didn't have enough gas money to drive to work but one more time. Which I waited till Thursday to do because that was payday. 4. Hit in a day old bakery outlet dumpster was still packaged and just fine. My elderly mom would get so excited when we brought that stuff home. She had lived through the depression and couldn't believe it was thrown out. Such a treat. 5 my motorcycle headlight broke so I started riding around with a flashlight. In my mouth. True story. I was young and very, very dumb. 6. Stole food for my kids. Really ashamed, but I couldn't let them go to bed hungry. Seven. Walked into a Costco with an expired membership card and had samples for dinner. I made the rounds a few times. 8. Back in the 90s, I wrote myself a check to cover me until payday. 9. Wash dirty clothes in the bathtub with dishwashing liquid. Couldn't afford quarters for the machine. 10. Showered at the gym, took napkins and plastic utensils from restaurants and lived off of protein powder and ramen.

One. Weird noises in the woods. Deer. Glowing eyes in the shadows. Deer. Something following you down a dark country road. Deer. It's always deer. Two. You need to carefully plan out your shopping needs because the trip to Walmart or Home Depot might be a two hour round trip. 3. You or someone you know has a personal vendetta against a wild animal in the area. 4. Legitimately being late for school or appointments due to being stuck behind a tractor. 5. Country life is slower than your lifespan in the city. You can go year after year seeing new buildings pop up, businesses, events, etc. Country life it's the same county fair every year, maybe a new building every 10 years, and a new business every five years. 6. Having your name and age listed in the local newspaper when you're pulled over for speeding and your family and friends get to give you crap for it because everyone loves to read the weekly police report. 7. How dark it is at night. You see how many stars there are, how bright and gorgeous, how busy the night sky truly is. 8. Weather changes your life. I've sat on the porch with my parents watching hail destroy our wheat crop days before it was due for harvest. There's nothing you can do. You just watch. I've also stood in a circle with my parents and older brother in the Yard while we prayed for rain for farmers. Weather is Destiny. 9 standing on my back porch in winter and there is absolute silence. 10 if you don't make dinner, you don't eat. No Uber Eats or Grubhub. No delivery pizza or takeout unless you want gas station food. Most places nearby close by five PM on weekdays and have extremely limited hours or are closed entirely on weekends. It can be pretty damn peaceful. 11 if I call 9 1 1, EMS won't be here for at least 30 minutes. 45 for fire and an hour for police. And that's assuming they have nothing else to do and respond immediately. If the house is on fire, you call the neighbors. In less than 10 there will be half dozen tractors with water tanks and hoses. Lop your foot off. Call the neighbors.

I work night security at a women's domestic violence shelter. Our one absolute rule. Never confirm if someone is staying with us. No exceptions. Not even if they claim to be family. One night, a well dressed man comes in. Designer suit, expensive watch. Very professional. He says he's a police detective looking for his daughter. Shows me a badge and everything. She's in danger, he says, voice shaking. Her ex husband is trying to find her. I need to get her somewhere safe. I check our system. The name he gives matches one of our residents. But our policy stands. We never confirm or deny. I understand, sir, but I can't give out that information. Listen. He cuts me off, pulling out his phone. Here are pictures of us together. That's her birth certificate. I'm her father and a detective. Here's my badge again. My manager, hearing the commotion, comes out. To my horror, she starts apologizing to him. Of course we'll help you, detective. Let me check if. Stop! I interrupt. We can't confirm anything. My manager glares at me. This is a police officer, it's fine. No, I say firmly. He needs to go through proper channels. The man gets angry, threatens to have us investigated. My manager writes me up for insubordination. Two days later, we Learned the truth. He wasn't a detective at all. The badge was fake. He was the Abusive ex husband the woman was hiding from. He tried this at two other shelters and one had given her away. She barely escaped. The write up disappeared from my file, my manager was fired and I received a letter from our resident thanking me for saving her life.

One. If I didn't accept my mom's Facebook game invites, I'd be grounded for a month. I remember one fourth of July when I was 14 or 15, I was having a great time with my cousin, walking around the neighborhood, until my mom called and told me to accept her Candy Crush invite. I told her I deleted Facebook, which I had, and she flipped out, told me to come home, immediately, sent my cousin home, and grounded me for the rest of the summer. It wasn't the harshest punishment, but still, yelling and grounding your teenage daughter over a Facebook game invite is pretty absurd. 2 when my brother was born, I wasn't allowed to touch him or even be near him for several months because my mom thought I might hurt him. I was six at the time, but she would lock me and my cat in my room for most of the day to keep us isolated. It freaked me out as a kid. I started wondering if I was dangerous or a bad person. Three. We had latches on the outside of our bedroom door so we couldn't get out. Four. We weren't allowed to talk at all during dinner. Five. We had to eat everything on our plates, even when someone else chose the serving size. As a parent, now I've changed that rule for my kids. 6. My parents had a designated screaming pillow for when we were too loud. I just assumed all families had one. 7. My parents had a rule that we couldn't say the word bored because they believed only uncreative people got bored. If I ever said I was bored, they would immediately assign me a random household chore like cleaning the garage or alphabetizing books. I thought this was normal until I realized most kids got to relax when they were bored. 8. I had to know where all my belongings were at all times, and if I misplaced anything, I'd get in trouble. But I also had to know where my dad's belongings were. He had ADHD and would constantly lose things, even when I wasn't home. When I got back from school, he'd ask me where his stuff was glasses, hat, keys, etc. If I didn't know, I'd get punished for not keeping track of his things too. 9. My dad set arbitrary ages for when I had to give things up rather than letting me naturally outgrow them. 10. Not my parents, but my cousin's parents had a rule that no one could open or remove food from the fridge for any reason during sleepovers. They would order one large pizza at five PM, give us each one slice and four candy bars for dinner, then send us to the bedroom. We weren't allowed out until they woke up, which was usually around 10:00am the next day.

I'm a cop and I got a call from a gas station about a guy trying to use fake money. Not just fake, embarrassingly fake. This man walked in with a handful of bills that looked like they were printed in a middle school computer lab. The paper was too thin and the colors were off. The cashier had already refused him, but instead of leaving like a normal person, he doubled down. This is legal tender, you have to take it. The cashier just sighed and called us. So I arrived, walked up to the guy, and before I even said a word, he tried handing me one. Officer, here's a little something for your troubles. Sir, did you just try to bribe me with monopoly money? I told him to turn around and put his hands behind his back, and that's when he started his case. Wait, I didn't know it was fake. I stared at the neon green twenty dollar Bill. Oh yeah, I searched his backpack and found stacks of this stuff. And instead of shutting up, he went for excuse number two. Okay, maybe I did know, but technically I never spent it, so I didn't break the law. Sir, you screamed at the cashier that this was legal tender like five minutes ago. Then he got desperate. Alright fam, let's make a deal. I'll give you the name of my supplier. Your supplier? These bills had the printer setting still printed on the back. Bro, you made these yourself? I walked into the squad car, and as I was putting him in, he hit rock bottom. Okay, last offer, $20, and we forget this ever happened. This man just tried to bribe a cop with the same fake money that got him arrested. I just stared at him. No words, no reaction. Just pure disappointment. I shut the door, got in the driver's seat, and before I even started the car, he muttered under his breath, man, this country just doesn't support small businesses anymore.

I just sat there confidently holding my debit card, waiting for the waiter to come back so I could pay like a normal person. Except he never did. I looked around. Everyone was counting bills like they were running a bank. And that's when it hit me. I leaned over to my friend and whispered, hey, do they take cards? He turned his head so slow I thought I was in a horror scene. Then, loud enough for everyone to hear, he went, wait, you don't have cash? The entire table went silent. Everyone turned to look at me like I just confessed to a felony. I started sweating. Nobody told me it was cash only. And then I heard someone whisper something, and suddenly a full blown argument broke out. Bro only came for free food. I knew it! I knew it! How do you not carry cash? Hello? I was being accused of fraud. I turned to the guy who organized the dinner, trying to plead my case. Dude, I'll literally send someone money right now.

I barely got two bites in when I heard a voice behind me. Sir, outside. Food isn't allowed in the park. I turned around, still chewing, and saw this park employee standing there with his arms crossed like I was committing a federal crime. I swallowed and said, oh, I'm diabetic. I just needed something real quick. His face didn't change. I'm going to have to ask you to throw that away. I thought he didn't hear me. No, I have to eat this or I'll pass out.

You want me to stand in a 30 minute line for a $12 pretzel while my body shuts down? I held up my medical bracelet. Dude, look, I'm not making this up. But he just sighed and pulled out his radio. I have a guest refusing to comply with park policies. My friends started Stepping in, explaining that I wasn't lying, but this guy refused to listen. At this point, my head was spinning, and my patience was gone. Bro, if I pass out right now, are you going to carry me to the park food court? And I swear, this man looked me dead in the eye and said, sir, you need to calm down. Calm down? I'm literally trying not to die.

One. My dad got sick of my mom bitching and belittling him. So he tried to shoot her in the head with his revolver. My brother and I were eating Mac and cheese at the time. I remember hearing the sound. It was so loud. I remember us crying in Mac and cheese falling out of our mouths. She sat there with her arms crossed in a bullet hole an inch above her head. It went through the exterior of the house. I could see light. My brother didn't make it. He became an addict and ended up in prison, trying to escape our home environment. He died in his cell five years into a 40 year sentence. I try to manage. It's not always easy. That was just one of the fucked up things I endured as a kid. I work in mental health now. 2. My mom and I had to move back into my grandma's house. I was 9 years old when I found my aunt, 18F in my room, stabbed to death in a pool of blood. Jealous guy that liked her got out of jail and went looking for her. When I told my mom, she didn't believe me and I just sat in shock on the couch. Then she found her. And I heard the most painful screams from my mom. 3 my first memory is the search party for my younger brother's body. That kind of set the tone. 4. My kid's mom committed suicide after we broke up. 5. Growing up with parents who should have been divorced but who chose to stay together.

You will only survive if you can beat every single person at one thing. What would you choose? One. Drunk go kart racing. I have no idea if I would win, but it'd be fun as shit. 2. I'd choose tearing movie ticket stub super fast. I used to work at a movie theater and we had contests to see who could tear the most tickets in the shortest time. I got really good at it, and it's such a random skill that I bet most people wouldn't even think to practice it. Three you pick a semi niche video game you know well and it should be an easy dub. Four stacking coins on my elbow and catching them with a hand on that arm. Five clap louder when I find the sweet spot. It starts to hurt my hearing. 6. Tetris my score on Endless Marathon mode on PS four is near or in the top 10. K7 Bop it extreme 8 1 v 1 me on rust quickscopes only nine making me climax. Even if I'm wrong, it'll be a great time. 10. Bird calls I can do about 30 nearly flawlessly. Eleven bear crawl. I can't run very fast, but my peculiar physiology makes it possible for me to go on all fours faster than anybody else traveling in that manner. Clarification I'm not a bear. 12. 1,000 random people. I'd feel pretty confident in chess. At 19 elo 13, pissing off my wife. 14. Sleep. I have two kids. Two year old and four year old. I've slept on a chair having dinner with the family of my wife. I just closed my eyes and fell asleep. I am sleeping now. 15 an all out battle to the death. When I enter the flow state, nobody can stop me.

One visible toes at a formal event. Two. Going to the toilet together. If guys do it, they're sniffing Coke. 3. The most popular one is one can have their shirt off, one cannot. 4. Affection towards children, especially children we're not related to. I can talk to small children, laugh with them, pinch a cheek, etc. Because it's more socially acceptable because I'm a woman. Of course I'll never harm a child, but strangers don't know it. But if a man did it, it would get more attention. Five. Girlfriend introduced me to some of her co workers in college. Handshakes and awkward hugs around. Last girl in the group greeted me by pinching my nipple. Several laughed. I immediately pinched hers back. There was a brief, uncomfortable silence until she started laughing. Once the shock wore off, it was fine and fun for her. It was not fine for me until she approved. Six being bald by choice. Seven as a former bartender, being grabby. Everyone says men are overly forward. Drunk middle aged women are the worst. I've had women grab my junk in front of god and country and everyone laughs it off. If I did that, I'd be in the hospital or prison. 8. Sitting in the park alone on a bench watching the kids play in the playground. Woman nurturing man pedo. 9. Wearing shorts so short that cheeks are hanging out is Fine for women, but not men. Ten. People are getting open minded about it. But body hairs. 11 holding hands. 12 males peeing sitting down. And I want to destroy that whole thing. I had major foot surgery and couldn't put any weight on foot for weeks. Started peeing sitting down, haven't looked back. It's so much more comfortable and cleaner. 13 at my school, the women get free gym locker locks and the men have to pay for theirs. As a female, it infuriates me. 14 hugging or sleepovers or staying together. 15 guys sorry fellas, I can't go out tonight. The wife won't let me. Oh no problem. We totally get that. Girls. Sorry ladies, I can't go out tonight. The husband won't let me. OMG girl, he is abusive and controlling. You need to leave him.

One. I would still have to go to work Monday. Two. If that round was two inches to the right, that would have been a really NSFW video. I imagine he turned his head at just the right time to look at a screen. History is determined based on inches and seconds. Sometimes. 3. Open Republican convention and then, depending on how Biden was pulling by that point, a possible open Dem convention too. So our primaries would have been completely pointless. 4. The Republican Party would need to find a new candidate. 5. Pete Davidson hooks up with Melania. 6. Nikki Haley would immediately start campaigning the second his death was confirmed. Seven. Total chaos. The Republicans would have to figure who the hell is going to run for president? 8. There would 100% be a funeral. Nine conspiracies where they would say he's both still alive and that the Biden crime family strikes again. 10. There would be a stronger urge to replace Biden as they don't need him to beat Trump anymore. The biggest reason why Biden was still in the race is because they seem to think he's the only one who can beat Trump. 11. He would have been a martyr for the MAGA cause and likely left a power vacuum which would have either replaced him with a more moderate Republican candidate or a far worse nationalist. 12. Had this Attack succeeded. The GOP would have gnashed its teeth in public while its old guard silently breathed a sigh of relief and began reasserting control. The RNC would have moved to remove the Trump children from power, and a standard Republican candidate like Haley Rubio or Desantis would have emerged from the convention as the nominee. In fact, my bet would be on a Haley Rubio ticket.

What's the one thing you'll not f around with? One. Just because you climbed up something doesn't mean you can climb down. 2. Do not attach two very active dogs to the handle of a razor scooter because you want to see if they'd be good sled dogs. 3. Sleep deprivation. Damn near died in a car accident then went mildly psychotic and paranoid. Just dumb. There are better paths to adrenaline fueled euphoria. 4. Not wearing hearing Protection when necessary. Tinnitus sucks. 5. First responder here. Garage door springs. Let a pro fix them. Six. Customs officers. They have no sense of humor. Don't ask me how I know. Seven don't work full time and go to school full time. I thought, may, I can handle it. I can do whatever I put my mind to. But it broke me. I tried to repress the stress, but my brain and body had other plans. I started waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks, convinced I was dying. Then came the agoraphobia. Airports and malls would trigger vertigo, making me feel dizzy, lightheaded, and like I was floating, setting off even more panic attacks. The cycle kept repeating. I finally went to the doctor and he said, you are doing way too much. Stop. He was right. You can push yourself too far. And even if you can brute force it, eventually your brain and body will rebel. 8. In ground Yellow jackets pay the dude with the B suit and the right crap to kill them safely. 9. Driving through standing water. Just because the car in front of you makes it through doesn't mean you will. 10. If an older man has a saddle nose deformity or cauliflower ears, let them be. A saddle nose deformity nose is also called a boxer's nose. An old man with training will effing kill you. That's how they got to be old. 11. Road rage. I was chased by a guy threatening to shoot me. That was the last time I yelled at somebody while driving. 12. Chainsaws. I don't even like the sound anymore. I had an accident with one and cut off my leg.

If you find an extra nugget in your order, it wasn't a mistake. You got a cool employee. 2. The New York Times best seller list has a lot of people on it who buy massive numbers of their own books. 3. Worked with a lot of banks and their IT systems. You wouldn't believe how old and fragile they are. It's a wonder it's not all coming crashing down. Four. I'm an academic researcher and I can speak for a huge number in my field when I say if you want access to our studies and they're behind a paywall, you can email us and we will send you the study. Five. Trained artist here. Most oil paints are made with very toxic substances, as are most paint thinners and mediums. Every single one of my teachers was either very sick. Cancer, Meniere's disease, or a bit crazy. Eating chalk, licking palettes. All incredible artists. I was privileged to learn from one lesson. I Learned very well. I wear gloves and sometimes a mask when I paint. 6. If you have already googled your problem, you have already exceeded the first two tiers of tech support. 7. Your lobster tail at Outback is microwaved. 8. I'm a casino manager. It is definitely possible to win money in the short term. For example, if you walk in, bet on red slash black on roulette, it's reasonably close to fifty. Fifty You might do this once. Double your money and leave. Congratulations. You will always lose in the long term. Always. Anyone that thinks they have some kind of system is a sucker. A game would not make it into the casino floor if the maths have not been rigorously checked and long term simulations run to confirm. Nine worked in online community management and social media for years. Admins can read all of your private messages. Private only means private from the masses, not from administration. We had to be able to read them to check reports of abuse, grooming, illegal activity, etcetera. I can't tell you how much cringe worthy shit I had to read through, especially from guys trying to hook up. 10 I make wildlife films for big streamers and broadcasters. The sound is all either library or fully. 11 teaching. Yep. Teachers gossip about the kids and each other and everything. There is always so much drama going on at any given moment.

One CPR is used to restart hearts and is quite successful. CPR is hugely unsuccessful and isn't used to restart hearts. It's used to keep circulation going until medication to restart the heart can be administered. A defibrillator is used to restart hearts. Nope. Again, it's used to stop hearts that are beating incorrectly in the hope that when they restart they'll be beating all nice and proper. Two Tic Tacs are sugar free. While listed as sugar free, this is a marketing trick taking advantage of a loophole due to their small size. To be listed as sugar free, a product must contain no more than half a gram of sugar per serving. Tic Tacs are approximately 98% sugar, but the serving size is one mint, with an average size only point four nine grams. Three if you're undercover and a cop, you have to tell me. 4. That you eat eight spiders in your sleep. You actually eat them mostly in your processed food, as the FDA allows a limit on things like peanut butter and tomato soup. 5. Einstein didn't fail math. 6. That life expectancy several hundred years ago was only 35 or so. The average age was lower due to incredibly high infant mortality rates. However, if you could survive infancy childhood, you'd likely live well into your late 50s or 60s. 7. The whole tongue map thing. You don't have parts of the tongue that only React to a specific taste. 8. That we only use 10% of our brain and if we could use 100% we'd all be super geniuses or something. The best reply to this that I ever heard is we also only use 33% of our traffic lights. Imagine what they could do if we turned all three lights on at the same time. Furthermore, this fact is heavily misquoted and meant something completely different. 9. Blood isn't blue in your veins. It's definitely still red, just darker. 10. While Donald Trump was the 45th president of the United States, he will be only the 44th person, the 44th male, to actually hold the job. Recall that President Grover Cleveland served two non consecutive terms. He won election in 1884, lost in 1888, and won again in 1892. So he is considered both the 22nd and 24th president. 11. That women are paid 77% as much as men for the same job. Twelve breakfast is the most important meal of the day. This originated as an ad campaign to sell breakfast cereal. 13. Bears eat beets 14. That Buzzfeed comes up with these lists on their own. I see you Buzzfeed.

When I was younger, I lived with my mom, my stepdad, and my younger half brother. My brother was always their favourite because my mom hated seeing me, as I reminded her of my dad, whom she had cheated on, and for some reason she blamed me for it. I was often ignored and left out. For years I tried to ignore this and get by, but the situation became unbearable when I was about 14 years old. My brother was spoiled and always got what he wanted. He was really into video games, and over time he started complaining that the house didn't have enough space for him to have his own game room, something he had seen somewhere and now wanted. My parents then started hinting that I should leave the house so my brother could use my room as his game room. At first I thought they were joking, since they often told me to leave the house and that my presence there was useless, but then I realized they were serious. They began pressuring me to leave, saying that I was practically an adult and it was time to move on. I told them that I wasn't even old enough to have a job yet. Had nowhere to go and was far from being an adult. But as time passed, they decided it was time for me to go. And one day, I came home from school to find all my belongings thrown on the sidewalk. It was incredibly tough. I had to go from shelter to shelter until an angel appeared and adopted me. She was a police officer who lived near the shelter where I stayed the most, and we got to know each other. A few months later, she took me to live with her and eventually adopted me. Honestly, if it weren't for her, I don't know how I would have managed to move forward. Years went by, and I did my best to move on. I worked hard, studied, and saved enough money to buy my own house with my own business. I couldn't have done it without my adoptive mother for sure, as she financed my education and helped me pay to start my business. Now that things were going well for me, I also bought a house for her so she could get out of renting. However, when my biological family found out that I had bought a house and a house for my adoptive mother, apparently because the guy who sold me the house was a friend of my family, everything got worse again.

My wife convinced me she wanted to have a baby. And for some reason I let myself believe her. The day we got married, she dragged my butt to the hotel room where she had organized the whole rose petals and balloon display. And I guess love really is blind, because three weeks later we saw the two pink lines pop up first. Anna was over the moon. We spent every weekend looking at baby catalogues together. And we had baby names for a girl and a boy. There was just one issue. Anna didn't have many female friends. The two she did have were still living in her hometown, and all the girls in her work were either jealous or bitter towards her. And after reading about how important girlhood is to a mother, I knew I had to do something. So I organised for her to go attend a local feminist group for women around her age. I figured they'd just be left winged, regular people. I wish I had known while dropping my wife to the library that it was the last time I'd ever see her again. Because the woman that returned wasn't my wife. For the most part, anyway. Usually when I see my wife, she wraps her arms around my neck and I twirl her around. But this time I saw something I'd never seen before. Hatred. But she smiled right after and I figured that I Had just imagined it. She told me the meet up had gone really well, and I was practically beaming with joy. I had no idea it was the calm before the storm. She continued to attend every Tuesday and Thursday. Sometimes it was even the highlight of her week. And after three months, she came home gushing about how excited she was for our baby girl to be born. I gently reminded her that we didn't know whether it was a boy or girl yet. But that's when her face turned super serious. I don't need an ultrasound to tell me what I already know. There's no way my body would bring another man into this world. I swear, I thought she was pranking me. But then she proceeded to gag like it was the most disgusting thing in the world. Anna, come on. Boy or girl, it's our baby. That's all that matters, right? She turned away from me and started scrolling through her phone. I jokingly tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention again. Don't you dare! She hissed. Wouldn't understand. You're one of them. The words hit me like a slap, so I did what any husband would do in this situation. I called her sister. You see, up to this point, my wife had been perfect. I was hoping it was just the pregnancy hormones, but I needed to have a safety net in case things went south. And because I was an orphaned Foster kid. That safety net had to be her family. According to her sister, Anna had always been extremely easily influenced by the wrong crowds. Usually it was just a phase, but she promised that if our child was a boy and anything happened, they'd be there to step up. I instantly breathed a sigh of relief. Fast forward to the 20 week ultrasound. It was a disaster. When the technician cheerfully announced, it's a boy, Anna actually shoved the wand away and sat up. Check again, she ended. You're wrong. The poor technician looked bewildered. Ma'am, I've been doing this for 15 years. See here, that's definitely. I said, check again. Anna interrupted. I had to physically hold Anna back as she lunged at the woman. The technician called for security and we were escorted out. The day our baby was born should have been the happiest day of our lives. But even before the baby came out, the nurses confirmed it was a boy. I jumped up with excitement. My wife started screaming harder as if the pain of the news was even worse than the pain of giving birth. And when baby Leo finally met me and his mom for the first time, my wife just lay in bed completely straight faced, holding him at arms length like he was a disgrace. Soon as we got home, I knew it was time to break the news to my wife. Hey, so your family offered to take the Baby in for a while? Yes, yes! A thousand times yes! She exclaimed. Without a second thought. I told her they would be coming in an hour, and her and baby Leo went for a nap together, his last nap with Mommy. I was watching TV when I could hear baby Leo crying. My heart dropped and I instantly ran up the stairs calling my wife's name. But when I got to the top, the door was locked. Something deep in my gut told me it wasn't right. I frantically tried to bang on the door to wake her up, and when it didn't work, I used all my force to kick it down. What I saw made my

I was 12 when Brian joined my class. He was tall, played sports. He should have been liked and popular, but instead, the whole class went ghost white as soon as he walked in. The teacher even went pale. I was clearly the only one who was out of the loop. I sat down next to him during lunch either way, and everyone, including Brian himself, gave me a weird look. You actually wanna be my friend? He asked, all surprised. We spent our whole day having a blast. I didn't have any friends at the time, so I went home excited to tell my mom about the new one I had made. But when I told her his name, her face went white. Stay away from that kid. Him and his dad are monsters. They beat and hospitalized their mom. I was shocked. The next morning, mom drove me to school instead of letting me walk. She marched right up to my teacher and whispered something that made Mrs. Squelch nod grimly. When I tried to sit near Brian in class, Mrs. Squelch moved my seat. I took one look at Brian from across the classroom, and I saw him nearly tearing up. During recess, he stood alone by the fence while everyone else played. And after school, I saw why. Brian's dad pulled up, and the entire pickup area cleared out. Parents grabbed their Kids and speed walked to their cars. One mom actually said, don't look at him, sweetie, to her daughter. Brian's dad just at there with his head down while Brian climbed in. Everyone treated him like they were awful, but it didn't add up. Brian's dad would pack Brian extra granola bars for kids who forgot lunch money. And Brian voluntarily stayed after school to help with tutoring special needs kids there. There was just no way this was the family who beat their own mother. Then came the day I realized who Brian and his father really were. I was walking home, counting the $50 my grandma gave me for my birthday, when three eighth graders surrounded me. Look at the rich boy, the biggest one said, and shoved me to the ground. They grabbed my money, and one of them kicked me in the ribs. I curled up, waiting for more, when suddenly they all scrambled away. Brian's dad stood there, not touching anyone, just standing. You okay, kid? He asked before helping me up. He walked me home without saying much else. When I told mom what happened, she completely lost it. He approached you? What if he'd taken you somewhere? She called the school immediately. A known abuser confronted my son. She kept by. The next day, the whole school knew. The principal sent out an email banning Brian's dad from school property. Parents shared it on Facebook, calling him a predator who lurked around children. At school, Brian looked destroyed. He sat with his head on his desk most of the day. When I tried to slip him a note saying thanks for his dad helping me, he pushed it back. Please don't, he whispered. You're making things worse for him. Two weeks later, I saw Brian crying in the library. He was trying to hide it, but his shoulder there were shaking. I sat down anyway. They spray painted predator on his car. Brian said he lost his job because of it. We might lose our apartment. He wiped his eyes hard. Everyone hates him, but they don't know anything. What do you mean? I asked. Brian looked around to make sure we were alone. He then

My physics professor was absolutely psychotic. Doctor Reeves had a PhD from MIT and seemed to hate every student who walked into his quantum mechanics class. His exams were legendary nightmares. The highest score in five years was 34%. Students literally transferred schools to avoid him. Our final exam was worth six, 60% of our grade. The last question was worth 50 points. Using Schrödinger's equation, calculate the exact probability wave function for an electron in this 47 dimensional quantum system. Then derive the energy eigen values for all possible states. The equation filled two entire pages. Variables I'd never seen before. Mathematical notation that looked like alien hieroglyphics. People were hyperventilating. One guy just walked out crying. Another girl was rocking back and forth, muttering formulas under her breath. I sat there for an hour, completely paralyzed. This was impossible. Even graduate students couldn't solve this. My entire physics career was about to end. I could hear people around me frantically scribbling, erasing, having mental breakdowns. The girl next to me was literally pulling her hair out. The room felt like a war zone. Calculators were overheating. People were using every inch of their blue books, writing equations on the margins, on their arms, anywhere they could find space. The desperation was suffocating. Then something clicked. I remembered Doctor Reeves's very first lecture. Physics isn't about memorizing formulas. It's about understanding what's actually possible in our universe. I stared at the problem again, really studied it, line by line, variable by variable. The quantum system they described. It violated the polyexclusion principle. The dimensions were mathematically inconsistent. The boundary conditions contradicted each other. This wasn't just hard, it was physically impossible. But here's the insane part. Buried in the middle of all that chaos was one tiny line that said, assuming standard laboratory conditions. Standard lab conditions meant room temperature, normal pressure, Earth's gravity. But the problem described a system that could only exist in the vacuum of space at absolute zero temperature, while simultaneously requiring conditions found inside a black hole. The temperature requirements alone were contradictory. They needed both absolute zero and millions of degrees simultaneously. The pressure conditions defied thermodynamics. Gravitational fields would tear apart any measuring equipment. I wrote, this quantum system cannot exist under standard laboratory conditions, as it requires mutually exclusive physical environment. The problem violates fundamental laws of physics, including the poly exclusion principle and thermodynamic constraints. Under actual standard laboratory conditions, this system would collapse instantly. I turned in my exam after 90 minutes. The entire class was still

He was a jerk. I had a couple of pet goats, and he would come over and bully them all the time. He'd poke them through the fence with sticks, throw rocks at them, spook them with loud noises. But he'd never go into the pen because he was too scared of them. One day, we're all inside and we hear this blood curdling scream. In comes the kid, screaming at the top of his lungs, the goat! The goat is after me! Help! We turned to see the big Billy goat staring at him through the sliding glass door. Every once in a while, it had headbutted the glass. Now, this was a very docile animal. He'd have never heard a fly, but he was out for that boy's blood. It turns out that the kid had been bullying the goat. He had him pinned up against the wall of the pen, throwing rocks and sticks at its private parts to see if he could hit them. The goat came after him, scaled the fence, and chased him across three acres of land and into the house. The kid waited for two hours for the goat to go away, but it never did. Anytime he opened a door to try to sneak away, the goat was right there trying to attack him. Eventually, the goat disappeared and the kid tried to sneak out of window feet first. And once again, Started screaming because the goat was right there, head butting his butt as he climbed out. It was absolutely liberating. Two. Little brother is a few years younger than me. He used to come into my room to harass me all the time, and my parents never allowed me to have a lock. He was around 10 when I started propping a piano stand under my doorknob to keep people out. Little brother pushed the door and the piano stand was at the knob. I ignored it before all I heard was the loudest bang followed by a thud. I opened the door to see him laying on the floor holding his face and crying. Apparently he decided that he could break down my door like in the movies by throwing himself against it after running from down the hall. But this idiot didn't just throw his shoulder or kick it. He threw his entire body against it like a squirrel going for a tree. Arms and legs out, face first. I got blamed for it, but it was worth it. Three. A girl once punched herself in the gut at her little brother's birthday party and threw up just so people would notice her. Four. Started angrily pumping weights when we were chilling at someone's house. Threatened to shave his head and then tore his shirt off of his body. 5. There was this girl for a while that had this huge crush on me, and she didn't seem To realize that she had been a total jerk to me for most of my life and that I really disliked her. Finally, she decided to get my attention by stealing my $300 leather jacket and saying that she wouldn't give it back unless I went out with her. So I contacted her mom and told her that if she didn't intervene, then my parents were going to press charges. The day after she gave my jacket back, she sent me this long text talking about how I hurt her so badly and it would take a long time to earn back her trust. I replied with by saying I don't want you to trust me. I want you to leave me alone. And we haven't spoken since. 6 I was at my friend's house. I was bored and started playing Portal 2 on his Xbox. After a while, my other friend's sister burst into the room and start screaming at me like we were dating and in a fight. My friend was there too and just watched. Every time I would tell her to leave, she would get louder.

Finally I figure out she's been drawing it closed with the bottom fully outside the tub. Okay. Sigh.

I want the hundred dollars back. This wasn't some sort of quick change scam. This woman was just dumb as a box of rocks. I told her if you'd like to give me the two dollar and eighty one cents in change I gave him, I'd be happy to give you a hundred dollar Bill. She kept arguing with me for a minute, long enough for other people in line to speak up and tell her how stupid she was. LOL. She eventually gave up and left with her ninety seven dollars and nineteen cents. 5 when I worked at a doctor's clinic, I had a lady on the phone wanting to book an appointment to have her flu shot. She specifically asked it to be a telephone appointment. I could not believe that. I had to explain to her that we cannot inject her through the phone. 6.

He was a jerk. I had a couple of pet goats, and he would come over and bully them all the time. He'd poke them through the fence with sticks, throw rocks at them, spook them with loud noises. But he'd never go into the pen because he was too scared of them. One day, we're all inside and we hear this blood curdling scream. In comes the kid, screaming at the top of his lungs, the goat! The goat is after me! Help! We turned to see the big Billy goat staring at him through the sliding glass door. Every once in a while, it had headbutted the glass. Now, this was a very docile animal. He'd have never heard a fly, but he was out for that boy's blood. It turns out that the kid had been bullying the goat. He had him pinned up against the wall of the pen, throwing rocks and sticks at its private parts to see if he could hit them. The goat came after him, scaled the fence, and chased him across three acres of land and into the house. The kid waited for two hours for the goat to go away, but it never did. Anytime he opened a door to try to sneak away, the goat was right there trying to attack him. Eventually, the goat disappeared and the kid tried to sneak out of window feet first. And once again, Started screaming because the goat was right there head butting his butt as he climbed out. It was absolutely liberating. Two. Little brother is a few years younger than me. He used to come into my room to harass me all the time, and my parents never allowed me to have a lock. He was around 10 when I started propping a piano stand under my doorknob to keep people out. Little brother pushed the door and the piano stand was at the knob. I ignored it before all I heard was the loudest bang followed by a thud. I opened the door to see him laying on the floor holding his face and crying. Apparently he decided that he could break down my door like in the movies by throwing himself against it after running from down the hall. But this idiot didn't just throw his shoulder or kick it. He threw his entire body against it like a squirrel going for a tree. Arms and legs out, face first. I got blamed for it, but it was worth it. 3. A girl once punched herself in the gut at her little brother's birthday party and threw up just so people would notice her. Four. Started angrily pumping weights when we were chilling at someone's house. Threatened to shave his head and then tore his shirt off of his body. Five.

One coworker had a short relationship and breakup and was obviously depressed about it, so I engaged and asked about it. His comment was I just don't understand how to make women feel like I believe that their opinion matters when they always have such stupid life views. I was hoping it was just a weird way of saying he's struggling to treat women equally, so I asked him to talk about it a bit. Didn't misunderstand. To him, men's views are obviously superior and it's all about simply pretending that women matter, and he was struggling hard to do that. Two. I once ordered shawarma and the guy at the counter asked if I wanted garlic sauce. I responded, sure, put lots. I don't have a girlfriend. His response was, maybe that's why you don't have a girlfriend. Three A friend of a friend who used to hang out with my roommates. Bigger guy, didn't really take care of himself. Didn't do anything except get fried and play GTA 5. Women these days won't date anyone unless they make 6 figures. Yeah dude, that's definitely the problem for you. Has nothing to do with the lack of hygiene. Four. I was at a party where a man had been invited specifically to meet a woman who would be there. It was a setup. In other words, he asked her To play pool. A very innocent and pleasant way to get to know someone, right? Well, he immediately started to dominate the game, and he held nothing back, including taunting her when she made bad shots and just criticizing everything she did in general. Of course he won and rubbed it in her face like he was a 12 year old. Think in your face, loser. And these people were in their 30s. It was straight out of a sitcom or something. Everyone who saw it knew why he was and would remain single. Five. Friend dated a guy who took her cat to the shelter as a stray. The cat was chipped and they called her to pick it up. She couldn't figure out how the cat got out, and the boyfriend claimed he didn't know. It happened a second time, and she had the cameras checked for the person dropping the cat off. She called him on it and he denied it. She broke up with him, but I always joke that she drove him to the shelter instead. 6 he brought his mom on our first date and asked her to order for both of us.

My physics professor was absolutely psychotic. Doctor Reeves had a PhD from MIT and seemed to hate every student who walked into his quantum mechanics class. His exams were legendary nightmares. The highest score in five years was 34%. Students literally transferred schools to avoid him. Our final exam was worth six, 60% of our grade. The last question was worth 50 points. Using Schrödinger's equation, calculate the exact probability wave function for an electron in this 47 dimensional quantum system. Then derive the energy eigen values for all possible states. The equation filled two entire pages. Variables I'd never seen before. Mathematical notation that looked like alien hieroglyphics. People were hyperventilating. One guy just walked out crying. Another girl was rocking back and forth, muttering formulas under her breath. I sat there for an hour, completely paralyzed. This was impossible. Even graduate students couldn't solve this. My entire physics career was about to end. I could hear people around me frantically scribbling, erasing, having mental breakdowns. The girl next to me was literally pulling her hair out. The room felt like a war zone. Calculators were overheating. People were using every inch of their blue books, writing equations on the margins, on their arms, anywhere they could find space. The desperation was suffocating. Then something clicked. I remembered Doctor Reeves's very first lecture. Physics isn't about memorizing formulas. It's about understanding what's actually possible in our universe. I stared at the problem again, really studied it, line by line, variable by variable. The quantum system they described. It violated the polyexclusion principle. The dimensions were mathematically inconsistent. The boundary conditions contradicted each other. This wasn't just hard, it was physically impossible. But here's the insane part. Buried in the middle of all that chaos was one tiny line that said, assuming standard laboratory conditions. Standard lab conditions meant room temperature, normal pressure, Earth's gravity. But the problem described a system that could only exist in the vacuum of space at absolute zero temperature, while simultaneously requiring conditions found inside a black hole. The temperature requirements alone were contradictory. They needed both absolute zero and millions of degrees simultaneously. The pressure conditions defied thermodynamics. Gravitational fields would tear apart any measuring equipment. I wrote, this quantum system cannot exist under standard laboratory conditions, as it requires mutually exclusive physical environment. The problem violates fundamental laws of physics, including the poly exclusion principle and thermodynamic constraints. Under actual standard laboratory conditions, this system would collapse instantly. I turned in my exam after 90 minutes. The entire class was still

I forgot to grab my towel, so I just walked out of the bathroom. Anyway, my husband's blind, so he can't see anything. But usually he's always telling me to dry my hair. Today, though, he didn't say a word. His face even turned red, like he was embarrassed. David was leaning back against the headboard. I was thinking maybe he was thirsty. In just a few minutes, I noticed him swallowing a few times. David's always a little distant with me. He doesn't want to bother me, so even when he needs something, he never asks. With that in mind, I decided to go downstairs and get him a cup of warm milk. But by the time I came back up, David had already gone into the bathroom. I put the milk on the nightstand by his side of the bed and grabbed his slippers, heading towards the bathroom. I waited outside for a while, but there was no sound coming from inside. I couldn't help but ask. You need any help? I forgot my towel. Could you? David hesitated. Of course. You can always ask me for anything. Don't forget we're married. Honestly, I felt a little down. It seemed like the only time David ever asked for my help was when he had no other choice. It made me feel like I wasn't doing a good job taking care of him. I searched around, but couldn't find his towel anywhere. Maybe the maid took It and didn't put it back, so I had to grab the pink towel I just used myself. I knocked on the bathroom door. I couldn't find your towel, I said, a bit discouraged, since I couldn't really help. If you don't mind, you can use mine, I added. I mean, it's just the one I dried off with, so it might still be a little damp. There was no response from inside. Maybe he didn't like the idea. I just wiped off some water after my shower, so it should be pretty clean, I explained, trying to make it sound reasonable. Still nothing. Well, I'll go downstairs and check the closet again. Maybe there's a brand new one. Then David's voice came from inside, quiet but clear. I want yours. What? I asked, confused. Your towel. Thank you. Suddenly a hand with sharp knuckles appeared from the crack in the door. The back of his hand had veins that popped out a bit, and I could see the muscle definition in his forearm. With water dripping down. It was pretty distracting. I quickly shoved the towel into his hand, not daring to look too closely. In the three years we've been married, he's never let me touch him. A few times, after I had a few drinks, I tried to jump into his arms, but I always woke up the next morning alone, wrapped up in blankets. I figured he must not like me. Maybe he only married me Out of necessity. I also heard that he's always had a crush on someone else. So I guess that's why he's always kept himself distant. The bathroom door opened. David came out with his bare torso wrapped in my pink towel. Even though he's blind, he still takes care of his body. His muscles were so well defined, they showed even under the towel. Why didn't you let me get your clothes? He asked, smiling shyly. That's the David I know. Suddenly the towel around his waist slipped. I froze for a second, then quickly turned away and shut my eyes. It was shocking. David's voice sounded a little hurt from behind me. Mira, I didn't mean to. I moved toward the bathroom, trying to comfort him. I'm just going to wash up. Take your time getting dressed. Don't worry, I won't peek. Splashed cold water on my face. I quietly tiptoed over to the laundry basket to grab my underwear, but it wasn't there. I clearly remembered tossing it in. I started searching through everything, layer by layer. David must have heard me opening drawers. Mira, what are you looking for? I'm looking for the new face cream I bought. I forgot where I put it. It's in the second drawer on the left, replied giving me the exact location. At the same time, I opened the bottom drawer on the right. There I found my underwear, and underneath it, David's grey towel.

I was grading papers when one of my students came up to my desk. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his sleeves. Then, barely above a whisper, he asked, how do I hide the marks? At first I didn't understand. What marks? I asked. He hesitated, then slowly rolled up his sleeves. His arms were covered in bruises, dark, deep ones. My stomach dropped. This boy always wore long sleeves and pants, even in 95 degrees. Weather I had noticed before, but I never thought much of it. I worked in a rough part of town, and it wasn't unusual for kids to have limited clothes. I asked if I could see the bruises on his legs. He shook his head. My dad said never to show anyone, or something bad would happen. I told him this was a safe space. He hesitated, then rolled up his pant legs. His legs, his stomach. Bruises everywhere. I brought him straight to the principal's office. The cops arrived soon after. We called his father in. He showed up, acting normal, like nothing was wrong. But as soon as he saw his son with the officers, his face changed. He knew he was arrested that day. Now he's in prison for child abuse. The boy is safe, living with his grandmother. He comes to school now wearing short sleeves, and for the first time, he doesn't look afraid.

My son loves gaming, and he'd saved up $2,000 from his summer job to build his first gaming PC. I took him to this fancy computer store, mostly for moral support. He'd done months of research and knew exactly what parts he needed. The sales guy took one look at my son's wheelchair and started talking to me instead. Sir, maybe we should look at pre built systems. They're much simpler. My son pulled out his carefully organized parts list, but the guy wouldn't even look at it. These high end components are very complicated, he said, still ignoring my son. Maybe something more basic would be better suited for his situation. My son, who'd been building computers in his head since he was 12, finally had enough. My situation? You mean the fact that I can code in three languages and run my school's tech club? Or that I've built five computers for my friends already? The manager overheard and came over, apologizing profusely, but my son was already Wheeling toward the door. Dad, let's go to Micro Center. I heard they actually hire people who know what they're talking about. Three hours later, my son had all his parts from Micro Center, where the staff treated him like the expert he was. He built his PC that weekend. It's faster than mine now. We drove past the first Store recently and there's a help wanted sign in the window. Guess they're still looking for qualified staff.

A factory worker lost three fingers in a machine accident due to a safety guard that had been removed to speed up production. The company didn't call an ambulance. Instead, they gave him a roll of paper towels and told him to clock out before going to the hospital. His medical bills exceeded $300,000, and he obviously couldn't return to his job. A lawsuit was inevitable. Their first settlement offer, $2,000 and a $50 gift card to a steakhouse. Their reasoning? Since he wasn't completely disabled, he could still find another job. When we rejected it, they bumped it up to $4,000 with the same Steakhouse gift card. I was livid, but my client just laughed and said, at least they didn't offer me a discount on gloves. We took them to court. During trial, we uncovered that management had knowingly removed the safety guard and had been warned multiple times that it was a hazard. The jury awarded him $2.7 million, plus another $5 million in punitive damages. The best part? The company's lawyer tried to argue that he wasn't that limited since he still had seven fingers left. But while making his closing argument, he struggled to open his own briefcase because his hands were full of documents. The jury noticed, and I knew at that moment we'd won.

One. I was traveling and on one leg of the trip, what I thought was a two hour layover was actually a 26 hour wait. I didn't have the right visa to leave the airport, and the customs guy said I wouldn't be able to stay overnight. So I asked him if I could buy a visa anywhere at the airport. He gave me a price, but it was in the local currency and I didn't know the exchange rate. The ATM would only dispense USD for an American card, so I took out $100 and went back to the desk. I handed the customs official the money and asked, is this enough? It wasn't until I saw him put it in his pocket before stamping my passport that I realized I had just paid a bribe. Two. I scanned a dollar Bill and printed it out in computer class in seventh grade. The substitute teacher called the cops. An officer showed up, took me in a small room, threw the actual book at me, and made me read the entries on counterfeiting allowed. I was super scared, but girls liked me a lot more after I got pulled out of class by the police. 3. Riding a bike drunk. Apparently that's a DUI. 4 when I was in middle school, my dad would give me $20 a week to pay for much. I was rarely ever hungry at lunch. So I just ended up saving the money. One day someone asks to borrow a dollar to buy snacks, and they'd pay me back with a quarter as interest the following week. I agree and it becomes a thing. Next thing I know, more people are quietly borrowing money from me and paying me back, and it kind of snowballs to the point where I even had teachers borrow money from me once in a while. During this period, I had lamented to my buddies that one or two folks who had borrowed from me often were avoiding me because they couldn't pay me back. Someone offered to collect the money for me if they could keep some of what they got. It sounded like a good deal, so I agreed. I eventually stopped doing it because I felt like people were only using me for my money. I tried to reinvent myself when I started high school. Years later, I realized that I had inadvertently been a loan shark. 5 pumped my own gas. New Jersey is an odd place. 6 I knew it was illegal at the time, but I had an unlimited rental pass at blockbuster. I'd walk in, rent a movie, go home and burn it, make copies, come back in, and rinse and repeat all day.

One. A few years ago, my boyfriend and I were handing out candy on Halloween night. We were running low, so my boyfriend left to go buy more. A few minutes after he left the house, he called me and told me that a little kid with the best train costume ever would be coming to the door soon, but that he's Oliver and not Thomas the Tank Engine. The kid had been crying to his dad that everyone thought he was Thomas the Tank Engine. A few minutes later, the kid shows up in the coolest train costume ever. The costume was made out of cardboard and was literally the whole train with the kid in the middle. It even had an area in the chimney that opened and you put the candy in. I opened the door, and I'm all like, OMG, Oliver the Tank Engine! I love Oliver! He is my favorite. And the kid just lost it. So did his dad. He was so freaking happy that I knew he was Oliver and not Thomas. His dad was filming everything and looked so happy and shocked that I knew he was Oliver. As they were walking away, I kept hearing the kids say to his dad, she knew I was Oliver! She knew I was Oliver! I fucking closed the door and cried. It was so precious, too. There was this time When I was seven, where a dragonfly was drowning in this little pool of water on the neighbor's chair, I noticed it and grabbed a stick and very gently pushed it out of the water. It sat there for a couple minutes and I thought it was dead until I saw it twitching a bit. I didn't think it was going to survive, but I sat with it anyways. After a couple minutes, it flew into the air and hovered in front of me for a second and flew away. I thought that it was trying to thank me, but it was probably just a coincidence. 3 during a visit to Tijuana, a taxi driver tried to mug me, but I only had enough cash for the fare. We had a long awkward pause where we just staring at each other not knowing what to do. He then just took the fare and dropped me off at my destination. Four when I was 10 or 11, I was fast asleep in my bed. One night when I woke up to have a coughing fit, I coughed and I coughed, and then there is my mom standing in the doorway of my room. She doesn't say anything. She just holds up a bottle of medicine and tilts her head to one side as if to offer it to me. I decline and she walks away. But I keep coughing, so I go to my mom's room and she's very much asleep. So I wake her up and ask if I can have that medicine now. And of course, she says something along the lines of, what the hell are you waking me up for? Get your ass back in bed. I don't know what you're talking about. And that's when it hit me how out of character it would have been for her to have gotten up and offer me cough syrup silently instead of just making me take it. I was fucking terrified for weeks afterwards that the nice ghost mom would come back.

One. Remember before I was a baby, when I was a different little boy and I had a different mommy and daddy? Uh, nobody. Do you remember that? Hmm. Only a little. 2 not my kid, but a little girl in my son's kindergarten class told me she lives across the street from a cemetery. I asked her if it was spooky to live that close to a graveyard, and she said, very matter of factly, not during the day, but at night, they all walk up to our windows and scream. Three. My five year old was speculating that the tooth fairy probably takes the teeth to put in her own mouth so that she has millions of teeth in her mouth. Yikes. 4 my daughter was 4, and while we were eating breakfast one morning, she says, I was on a mountain once, and my mom and dad passed away. And then I woke up and was in this house with you and mama. Then we just sat there for a few seconds and looked at each other. Then she said she wanted to watch Paw Patrol. 5 I have an awesome video of my son. He was maybe 2 3 at the time. He was taking a quarter and trying to put in the slot just above the door handle of a closed closet. He kept repeating, I pay the lady, I pay her. When I asked what He was doing. He responded, I have to pay the lady in the closet. I asked him why there was a lady in the closet. He said, she lives there. I pay her. Six my kid keeps talking about the babies in the walls of his bedroom. Very off putting. Seven definitely thought it was more funny than creepy, but when my kid was 2, he was scribbling on a piece of paper and quietly sang to the tune of Row, Row, Row your boat. Scrape, scrape, scrape your eyes, scrape your eyes today. 8 my son was around three at the time. Kept refusing to go downstairs as that's where Angel Man was, and Angel Man wanted to hurt the family. 9 the new little girl neighbor asked me, do you like burning? 10 creepy and funny. My youngest once said to me, I could make three baby hands out of your hand meat. 11 when my daughter was just 2, she said a couple of things that freaked me out. One night she was looking up at the full moon from a stairway landing window. I thought it was cute, so I went up and asked her what she was thinking, imagining she'd say something like, is the moon really made of cheese, daddy? Or something like that. Instead, she looked at me and in a creepy old woman voice said, we are all in the same cage. Like a good horror movie, dad. I ran to the Basement and pretended nothing happened. Twelve. My three year old daughter told us at dinner the other night I had a family before this one. Then she looked down at her plate and said in a really sad sounding voice they're gone now. To be clear, this is the only family she's ever had. No idea where she'd have got that idea.

Sure enough, two months didn't pay out. For some reason. He wasn't even mad and just kind of mentioned it like he was talking about the weather. If I miss a paycheck, I'd notice on payday. 2. Spend money if it saves you time. Time is more valuable than money. Three. Working at a luxury resort, one thing I've noticed is that the people who want to give the air of being very wealthy will have lots of designer patterns on their clothes and accessories, like Louis Vuitton print. But almost all of the truly ridiculously wealthy people will basically wear nondescript leisure wear and really plain looking clothes, like plain jeans and tees with no logos. 4. They will never complain about the cost of something, but will nitpick the quality of work to death. 5. I was at a really posh restaurant, you know the kind where there are about eight pieces of silverware. We had saved up for months, and a group of eight of girls, nurses, and Cnas went out. One of the recently divorced nurses was flirting with a guy at the next table. When we got our checks, he leaned over and tossed his platinum card on the.

One day I was driving when some guy ran a red light and hit me. The police found that it was the other person's fault and took him to jail for not having insurance. My car had pretty significant damage, and I did not want to pay for it myself. When I went to see what I should do next, I found out that someone bailed him out. Until now, things are okay. And I thought that it wouldn't be too hard to get the guy to pay, since he clearly had money. Nine months in, the guy doesn't answer any calls and claims that I'm the one who should be blamed for the accident. People at the station knew me because I come every few days to ask about the case. They understood my persistence, as the repairs were going to cost about $5,000. Eventually, they advised me to go and escalate to the head of that station and see what he can do for me. I went there and gave him the entire story. Once I was done, he called someone from his office and told him to help me close the case. I gave this guy everything, and he made one call to the guy I'm looking for. I told him how he never answers his phone, but surprisingly, the guy answered. The guy who was helping me went into his office for the call. I heard A lot of shouting from the guy helping me and basically silence from the guy who hit my car. The call ended and immediately I got a call saying that my money will be ready tomorrow. I thanked the guy who helped me and asked him how he was able to get this guy to change his mind and pay me. His answer was, I'm his father.

One. My dad was friends with a guy who worked for the registry giving the road test. His best story was of a kid who took his test while it was raining. He started driving without the windshield wipers on. The guy figured he was nervous so tried to give him a break saying it's raining pretty hard. Ha! The kid was white knuckled on the steering wheel and just said yeah, again trying to give the kid a break. He said, don't you think you should do something about that? The kid said yeah. Apparently he didn't know where the wiper controls were, so he rolled down the driver's side window and stuck his head out. At that point he stopped the test and failed him. 2. When I parallel parked, I hit the pole behind me and the tester said it's fine, this should be an automatic fail, but I think that's a bit too harsh. Then I hit the pole in front of me head on. Did not pass. Three. Wasn't a kid. My 80 year old great aunt. The tester kept telling her to speed up. After a few times she said she can't see the speedometer so she doesn't know fast she is going. He made her pull over and she did not receive a renewal. Thank god. 4. Last year I was making a Left turn at a light and a car swerved into my lane and hit me. Turns out this was someone taking their driver's test. I'm not exactly sure how driver's test car insurance works, but the instructor told me we had to wait for the police and take details of everything. I am guessing the driver did not pass. 5 the kids make minor mistakes and yes, some do make scary mistakes. However, it's the adults that scare me most. Especially the seniors who are up for re exam. Probably the worst test I've ever been on was this man in his 90s. I instructed him to turn onto a street when it is safe to do so, and he turned, narrowly missing a pedestrian. Not only that, but he was driving on the wrong side of the road. He came head to head with another car who pulled over to let him go. He was laughing about it because he was under the impression that it was a one way road. When I got back to the office with him, I cut the test short and got him back in the quickest and safest way possible. He was astounded when I told him it was not a one way street. Me did you see any one way signs? Him no, but I assumed you were going to take me on one. Huh. 6 my best friend's son just failed because he went the wrong way down a busy four Lane road. Luckily, they made it safely into a parking lot and the testing administrator drove them back. 7 my dad did testing for a few years, and he once had a girl stop on railroad tracks. There was a train coming slowly, but still. It takes them a long time to stop. And it blasted the horn right into the car. Passenger side with a window open. This just made her freeze up even more. He had to reach his foot over to her side to hit the accelerator. Eight. Took a test with a girl who drove on the wrong side of the road and took a left turn into oncoming traffic, all in the same drive. It was through my school, and she was banned from taking it through the school because of that.

I was 22 and desperate for a job when my college roommate's dad offered me a position at his investment firm. No experience required, great salary. Just needed to be trustworthy and discreet. Red flags? What red flags? The first week was amazing. Designer office, expensive lunches, everyone treating me like family. Mr. Davidson, my roommate's dad, took me under his wing personally. You're like a son to me, he'd say, handing me envelopes to deliver to various clients. I thought I was living the dream. Twenty two years old, making more money than my parents combined. I bought a new car, moved into a fancy apartment, started dating this girl who was way out of my league before. The job was simple. Pick up envelopes from Mr. Davidson's office, drive to specific addresses, hand them to specific people. Never open them, never ask questions. Client confidentiality, he explained the foundation of our business. After three months, I started noticing weird patterns. The addresses were always residential, never offices. The people who answered doors looked nervous, sometimes scared. They take the envelopes quickly and shut the door without saying anything. One day, I was delivering an envelope to this suburban house when the guy who answered looked terrified. Please, he whispered, I just need two more weeks. My daughter's wedding is this weekend. I had no idea what he was talking about, but something Felt wrong that night. I mentioned it to my roommate, Jake. His face went white. Dude, you need to quit that job, like, immediately. Why? It's the best job I've ever had. My dad's not running an investment firm, Jake said quietly. He's running a loan shark operation. Those envelopes you're delivering, they're threats, payment demands. Sometimes worse. I laughed. That's crazy. Your dad's a businessman. Jake pulled out his phone and showed me a news article. Local businessman under FBI investigation for racketeering. There was Mr. Davidson's photo. My blood went cold. Jake, I've been delivering these envelopes for three months. I know. And when the FBI comes, guess whose fingerprints are all over the evidence? Next morning, I walked into Mr. Davidson's office to quit. He was on the phone, speaking in hush tones. No, the kid doesn't know anything. He's perfect. Clean record, no connections. If this goes south, he takes the fall. I froze in the doorway. He was talking about me. I backed out quietly and went straight to my desk. There was a new envelope waiting with my name on it. Inside was a key and an address I didn't recognize. Sticky note read, emergency pickup. Go immediately. Don't call first. Every instinct screamed danger, but I was terrified of what would happen if I didn't go. I drove to the address. A storage unit facility. The key opened the unit. 2:00 40 seven. Inside were dozens of boxes filled with documents, hard drives, And what looked like financial records. A note on top. Read, if you're reading this, something happened to me. Take everything to the FBI. Tell them about the envelopes. I realized this

I discovered my 16 year old daughter was writing letters to the drunk driver who killed her brother. It's been two years since we lost Ethan. He was walking home from baseball practice when a man named Richard Lawson ran a red light going 60 in a 35. Ethan died instantly. He was 14. Lawson got eight years. Not enough for taking my son's life. But that's how the system works. We've been trying to move for forward as a family. My wife, our daughter, Maddie and me. Therapy twice a week, support groups. All the things you're supposed to do. But there's no manual for putting your life back together after burying your child. Maddie took it the hardest. She and Ethan were only two years apart. Inseparable since she was born. She stopped talking for almost six months after the accident. Wouldn't eat, barely slept. We were terrified we'd lose her, too. Then about a year ago, something shifted. She started engaging again. We joined the debate team. Her grades improved. We thought she was finally healing. Last month, I was cleaning her room while she was at school and found a shoebox under her bed. Inside were dozens of letters, all addressed to Richard Lawson at Riverdale Correctional Facility. Some were sealed and stamped ready to be mailed. Others were open, already sent and returned. My hands shook as I opened one. Dear Mr. Lawson, it Be again. I had another dream about Ethan last night. He was wearing his baseball uniform and smiling. I woke up crying again. I shouldn't have read more, but I couldn't stop. Mom put fresh flowers on his grave yesterday. Dad couldn't go. He still can't talk about Ethan without breaking down. I wonder if you think about him, too. If you see his face when you close your eyes like I do. Letter after letter, Maddie had been pouring out her grief to the man who destroyed our family. Not with anger or accusations, but with stories about Ethan. What he was like as a brother. How he helped her with math homework, how he defended her against bullies. In one letter, she wrote, I'm not writing to forgive you. I don't know if I ever can. I'm writing because you're the only other person on earth who was there in his final moment. The most recent letter was different. It was a response from Lawson. Dear Maddie, he wrote, I don't deserve your letters. I don't deserve to know about Ethan. But selfishly, I'm grateful for them. I haven't had a sober day since I was 19. Until I came here. Your brother's face is the first thing I see every morning and the last thing I see at night. As it should be. I put everything back exactly as I found it and left her room, my mind spinning. Should I confront her? Tell my wife? Call Our therapist? I did none of those things. Instead, I waited. That evening, I watched Maddie more carefully. She seemed lighter, somehow less burdened than she'd been since the accident. A week later, I found myself in the parking lot of Riverdale Correctional Facility. I hadn't planned to come. I hadn't told anyone I was coming. But I

What did you learn? My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place setting and panicked. Her dad, Mr. Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked during that first dinner. When I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again, and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr. Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner, and fixed his own car if they didn't like it, tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious, and clearly tired of his family's expectations. While everyone else was Networking and name dropping. Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr. Richardson called me. Not Sarah. Me directly. I need to speak with you, he said in that cold voice I'd grown to hate. I figured this was it. He was going to pay me to break up with his daughter or threaten to destroy my future. I showed up at his office prepared for war. Instead, he looked exhausted. Marcus has been different lately, he said. Happier, more confident. He told me you've been teaching him things. I nodded, waiting for the trap. He also told me something else, Mr. Richardson continued. He said you're the first person who's ever treated him like he had value beyond our money. I didn't know what to say. My son has been in therapy for two years for depression and anxiety. In the past month, he's been off his medication and doing better than ever. His therapist wants to know what changed. Mr. Richardson leaned back in his chair. I've spent Marcus's entire life trying to give him everything money could buy. But you gave him something I never could. The feeling that He mattered for who he was, not what he had. He pulled out an envelope. This is a job offer. I want you to work for me, not because you're dating my daughter.

One. Freshman year of college, walk into the kitchen area late at night, and there's my girlfriend sitting on the counter kissing one of my good friends. I just left quietly without them noticing and cut off all contact with both of them. So pretty sure I wasn't supposed to see that. Saw them both together about 20 years later at Costco. So I guess it worked out for them. 2. When I started a new job, someone had left a bunch of HR files on the computer I was given. I opened one up, not sure what it was, and I got to see every employee's salary in the company, even the CEO. The next day, it was gone. My boss realized his mistake and logged into my system and deleted the files. It was a memorable experience. Three. I was about eight or nine, and my parents were going to be out of town, so they had me and siblings stay with a family from our church. Once we got to the house, which was really nice by the way, they had one rule. You can play wherever you want, but the basement is off limits. Me, being the little brat that I was, snuck down there first chance I got and was supremely disappointed to only find rows and rows of plants growing under lights. 4 when I was 14 and friend hosted a birthday Party at his house with all the parents invited. Needed to use the restroom, but the main one was occupied, so my friend told me I can use the one in his mom's bedroom. As I walked up to the door, I could hear somebody in there, so I decided to wait until whoever was in there was finished. A good 10 minutes later, my friend's mom, who was hosting the party, and another good friend's stepfather walk out and see me standing there all confused. They asked what I was doing there, and I just said I was waiting to use the bathroom. Surprisingly, they played it cool and just said I can use it now and walked off. 5 1 Christmas Eve, I couldn't sleep at all, so I went to the kitchen to get

A brand new private accidentally called our armorer dad while checking out his rifle, and the entire room froze. We all waited for him to explode. This guy was old school. Zero sense of humor. Walked like his knees were welded shut and barked like he was still in Desert Storm. But without even blinking, he just said, about time one of you ungrateful brats acknowledged it and handed over the weapon like it was business as usual. After that, everyone started calling him dad. It spread like wildfire. He slapped a dad's office sign on the armory door, started ending gear memos with clean your stuff. Love, Dad. And kept a stash of instant coffee and butter crackers labeled Deployment Fuel. He had a terrible haircut, a voice like a broken lawn mower, and still wrote everything down on a clipboard from 1987. But somehow he became the center of that whole company. The joke stopped being a joke when one of our guys got a Red Cross call about his mom. He went pale, dropped to the floor right in front of the CQ desk. Couldn't even stand. Before command could react, the armor showed up, sat beside him in the hallway and stayed. Didn't ask questions, didn't try to fix it. Just stayed until the bird was ready. He packed his bag himself and waited on the flight line till he was airborne. The next Day he was back in the cage screaming about carbon build up like nothing happened. But after that, people showed up early just to talk to him. He'd grunt, pretend to be annoyed, but never turned anyone away. Everyone else saw him as a cranky old E6 with bad knee. We saw the guy who never let a single one of us fall through the

And so I drove the car and 10 minutes into the drive, a warning light comes on and it says, warning, you have no tire pressure, any tire. But it doesn't just say that. It goes beep, beep for like a minute. And that happened every 30 minutes. Oh. And so, you know, maybe there's some issues with that one. You know what cheap used ghost cost?

One. We were playing life and he was the police officer. The rule is if you spin a 10, he gets your speeding fines. I literally pulled open my button down and exposed my breasts and said, what can I do to get out of paying this? He said, ma'am, I am an officer of the law. Are you trying to prostitute yourself to me? A couple of days of flirting and sexual innuendo later, I literally had to spell out that I was trying to F him. We've been together six years now. Two. I threw my panties at him and he kept explaining god of war lore. 3 after chatting for hours on top of a mountain from sunset until like 2:00am, sharing a blanket, me leaning my head on his shoulder, telling him he's attractive, etc, he turns to me and says, how do you tell if a girl is into you? 4 when my boyfriend and I had just started dating, we were lying down watching a movie, but it was a small bed and he was being respectful by giving me space. I kept wiggling backwards to get closer to him, but he kept inching backwards too, because he thought I was just trying to get comfortable and that he was in the way. He ended up sitting in a chair next to the bed. 5 I'm a guy. But I once had an experience where I took the hint but still got rejected. A girl asked me if I had lost my V card yet. We were in high school when I said I hadn't. She said that I could practice on her whenever I wanted. Mind you, we were walking home after school because we lived close. I tried to act on this hint when we got to her house, and she said she was only joking and didn't want things to be weird with us as friends. 6 I asked a guy at a festival to come take a shower with me. He didn't get it. He just repeated that there was only one free shower, and I was like, well, they are big, I'm sure it's fine. He just looked confused and told me I could go first.

My wife convinced me she wanted to have a baby. And for some reason I let myself believe her. The day we got married, she dragged my butt to the hotel room where she had organized the whole rose petals and balloon display. And I guess love really is blind, because three weeks later we saw the two pink lines pop up first. Anna was over the moon. We spent every weekend looking at baby catalogues together. And we had baby names for a girl and a boy. There was just one issue. Anna didn't have many female friends. The two she did have were still living in her hometown, and all the girls in her work were either jealous or bitter towards her. And after reading about how important girlhood is to a mother, I knew I had to do something. So I organised for her to go attend a local feminist group for women around her age. I figured they'd just be left winged, regular people. I wish I had known while dropping my wife to the library that it was the last time I'd ever see her again. Because the woman that returned wasn't my wife. For the most part, anyway. Usually when I see my wife, she wraps her arms around my neck and I twirl her around. But this time I saw something I'd never seen before. Hatred. But she smiled right after and I figured that I had just imagined it. She told me the meet up had gone really well, and I was practically beaming with joy. I had no idea it was the calm before the storm. She continued to attend every Tuesday and Thursday. Sometimes it was even the highlight of her week. And after three months, she came home gushing about how excited she was for our baby girl to be born. I gently reminded her that we didn't know whether it was a boy or girl yet, but that that's when her face turned super serious. I don't need an ultrasound to tell me what I already know. There's no way my body would bring another man into this world. I swear, I thought she was pranking me. But then she proceeded to gag like it was the most disgusting thing in the world. Anna, come on. Boy or girl, it's our baby. That's all that matters, right? She turned away from me and started scrolling through her phone. I jokingly tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention again. Don't you dare! She hissed. Wouldn't understand. You're one of them. The words hit me like a slap, so I did what any husband would do in this situation. I called her sister. You see, up to this point, my wife had been perfect. I was hoping it was just the pregnancy hormones, but I needed to have a safety net in case things went south. And because I was An orphaned foster kid. That safety net had to be her family. According to her sister, Anna had always been extremely easily influenced by the wrong crowds. Usually it was just a phase, but she promised that if our child was a boy and anything happened, they'd be there to step up. I instantly breathed a sigh of relief. Fast forward to the 20 week ultrasound. It was a disaster. When the technician cheerfully announced, it's a boy, Anna actually shoved the wand away and sat up. Check again, she manded. You're wrong. The poor technician looked bewildered. Ma'am, I've been doing this for 15 years. See here, that's definitely. I said, check again, Anna interrupted. I had to physically hold Anna back as she lunged at the woman. The technician called for security, and we were escorted out. The day our baby was born should have been the happiest day of our lives. But even before the baby came out, the nurses confirmed it was a boy. I jumped up with excitement. My wife started screaming harder as if the pain of the news was even worse than the pain of giving birth. And when baby Leo finally met me and his mom for the first time, my wife just lay in bed completely straight faced, holding him at arms length like he was a disgrace. Soon as we got home, I knew it was time to break the news to my wife. Hey, so your family offered to Take the baby in for a while. Yes, yes! A thousand times yes! She exclaimed. Without a second thought. I told her they would be coming in an hour, and her and baby Leo went for a nap together, his last nap with Mommy. I was watching TV when I could hear baby Leo crying. My heart dropped and I instantly ran up the stairs calling my wife's name. But when I got to the top, the door was locked. Something deep in my gut told me it wasn't right. I frantically tried to bang on the door to wake her up, and when it didn't work, I used all my force to kick it down. What I saw made

But then I handed her the video I'd taken 20 minutes earlier and watched her face as she realised everyone now knew the truth. My little sister was born two months prematurely, came out bluer than a Smurf, and spent the first three years of her life hooked up to tubes and machines. Naturally, my parents were super protective of her. They'd stay by her side, buy every toy she wanted, and demand I ditch hanging with friends to babysit her. At first, I thought this was right. She was my chronically ill baby sister. But then she got older, she got healthier. She no longer needed tubes or machines and could live normally. However, by this point, she had Learned that being sick got her whatever she wanted, whether that be materialistic things or just sympathy and attention. It started with her headaches mysteriously coming back whenever she was doing homework. My parents would take the homework away before replacing it with ice cream. And by the time Emma turned 11 and I was 16, she had perfected her act. And that really bothered me because her pain only struck during my moments. When I made varsity soccer, she developed mysterious stomach cramps that required my parents to leave my first game early. When I got accepted into college, she collapsed during my celebrate dinner and we spent the night in the ER, where doctors found nothing. Wrong. The worst part was how she'd smirk at me when our parents weren't looking. She even practiced her pain faces in the mirror. I tried showing my parents once, but Emma had already told them I was jealous of the attention she needed for her condition. My boyfriend, Jake lasted eight months before Emma got to him. She created fake screenshots of messages where I supposedly called her a faker and wished she would just die already. The breakup happened at a coffee shop. Jake slid his phone across the table, showing me the evidence Emma had compiled. He said he couldn't be with someone who treated their sick sister so cruelly. Emma texted me a selfie wearing the hoodie Jake had given me. That was my breaking point. For five years, I had watched her steal everything. So I started watching her closely. Way more closely than anyone ever had. And I noticed a pattern. Every time she was in pain, she. I always grabbed her right side. Whether that's her head, her kidney. Always right side. She always called specifically for mom, always rated her pain between 8 and 10, and always recovered in exactly two to three hours, which was just long enough to ruin what I had planned. Once I knew this, I developed my plan. And last Sunday, it went down better than I ever could have hoped for. We were having our monthly family dinner with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins. 20 Minutes before dinner, I went up to the bathroom, where I recorded a video. I explained in the video that I was about to make a fake announcement.

One. An 18 year old lad, regular customer, was stressing over his exam results and told me seriously if he'd failed that his life was over and he would commit suicide. He was completely serious. Apparently his parents had been putting string pressure on him. I brought him home and called his father out of the house. By this time, the poor lad was in tears. I said to him that he should tell his dad what he'd told me. By this time the father was distraught. I let them both talk for a bit right there and then the father got him out of the car and brought him inside. The update was that he told his parents the whole story. They were horrified and got him into therapy. I've no idea whether he passed the exams or not, but I do know he was alright afterwards. I was very shook up about it. The situation could do easily have gone wrong and I take no credit at all. 2. I carried two medical professionals once and one of them talked to his colleague about that time. He was kindly kidnapped out of the hospital by two guys that took him to a mansion outside the city and asked to examine the heart condition of a man who seemed to be a local Mafia boss that was wanted from the law. They somehow provided him with all the Tools and help and made him operate the boss. They finally let him go and paid him with a big sum of cash, saying they would contact him again for anything else. He said it was of the scariest yet most interesting experiences in his life. And people who work in hospitals apparently have some mad orgies off duty. 3. A 50 year old man admitted to me that he doesn't know how to cook and doesn't have the time to do it, so he'll sneak out late at night to get leftovers from his mother's house. 4. I work Uber Black in Los Angeles. Picked up a customer around midnight from a flight from Mexico to LAX. Had two stops. First stop he waited for some compadres who loaded 5 duffel bags in my SUV. Second stop was from LA to San Jose. 6 hour drive. After 2,500 dollar fare and 400 dollar tip. One never dared ask what was in those bags.

Some of my clients are shockingly bad at giving themselves credit. Holy shit. Like they might get a nearly straight AGPA in a brutal major while battling depression. Or overcome years of phobia and get behind the wheel again. Or write a literal novel. Or raise a kid as a single parent with low income. Or build new relationships after being burned. Or cope with OCD well enough to hold down a job. And they'll talk about themselves as if everyone on earth is better than them, as if their accomplishments are worthless. And I know it's because of depression or anxiety or another condition, but I'm often stunned by how differently I see them compared to how they see themselves. 2. During my training, I was asked how would you feel if a client were to come to you and admitted they were a pedophile that was on the edge of committing seriously horrific acts? Could you see that person as another human being that needed help, or were your personal feelings about the abhorrent behavior too strong? This factor leads some people to not continue my course on to the next level, but it really illustrates the level of non judgment needed in this field. We all have our own personal feelings, of course, but these get talked about in supervision. 3. I quit my last therapist because I made him cry uncontrollably. He tried not to, but he just couldn't hold it back. I felt guilty and won't see him anymore. I think he may have lost a child before. I described watching my aunt grieve over her son's body. I felt so much pain losing him, but was explaining how watching my aunt was dramatically worse. The details about her is what made him lose it. I could tell he was reliving something inside his own head. 4 when I was underage, I got caught with a drink on Bourbon Street and got a minor in possession. I was telling my therapist about it and said that the police caught me with a hand grenade in New Orleans. He didn't realize that a hand grenade was a type of drink, and it was funny to watch him try to process that his patient might have just casually told him that he had been caught with a fragmentation grenade. He took a big long pause and said, where did you even find a grenade? I realized the misunderstanding quickly and corrected him, but for a moment he definitely was thinking, holy shit, how do I deal with this? 5 my professor once shared what a patient said that made her quit her job. I didn't rape my daughter. She liked it. The daughter was six. She couldn't take it anymore. She worked in a rehabilitation center for people who have been sentenced for serious crimes and were forced To get mental help. Really difficult job. And this pushed her over the edge.

One, I brought up a company's awful glass door reviews, and they got so mad they ended the interview. Well, guess I dodged that bullet. Two. When you ask what do you like about working here? And the interviewer talks about the location of the job. It's a great place to live instead of the actual job. 3 this actually happened to me. Interviewer do you have any questions for us? Me what is a challenge this department has recently faced? Interviewer job security. Four.

I didn't last a year there before I left, and now I won't even finish reading job ads that include that line. Five. When you are signing all the forms they give you, and you are taking your time to read over every document so that you can fully understand what you are getting into, and people come in and start telling you that you don't need to read this and that, just sign here and so on. 6. When they tell you what I'm paying you stays between you and me. Don't discuss pay with anyone else. Usually means they are trying to pay you less than your coworkers who do the same job and don't Want you to know 7 I once turned down a job offer because they mentioned that the previous person in the position had quit after a few months, and most of the people I interviewed with seemed stressed out.

Every time I wear sunglasses somewhere and it's cold outside, some cashier or receptionist trying to make small talk will make a comment to me about oh, look at you wishing for warmer weather. Or remind me that there's snow on the ground. Or ask me why I'm wearing sunglasses when it's so cold outside. It's sunny, guys. They're not called hot weather glasses. 5. How computers actually work.

One maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn't care to have my peers know what I was up to, so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues. At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, are you taking this call on a cell phone? I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I'd be happy to continue it the next day when I'd be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point, but did agree with the second. To this day, I wonder what the hell he was talking about and where he was coming From two. When I was a child, my mom paid for something with a check. The cashier remarked that my mom had nice handwriting. My mom flew off the handle and we had to storm out of the shop in outrage. To this day, I have no idea what happened. Maybe it brought up sore feelings from when she failed the doctor entrance exams. Three. At my wedding, we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian at my wedding sister in law who hates me fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the fuck are they supposed to know it's vegetarian? 4. My seven month old was wearing a shirt that had a rocket ship and the NASA logo, and some middle aged woman in the shop said he shouldn't be wearing that because he's clearly not an astronaut. I was dumbfounded. 5. Someone posted a video about 9 11 and someone commented please take this down. You're not from New York. You will never understand this pain. She said this as if only people from New York were in the World Trade Center.

Not sure if this counts, but it was really uncomfortable. 4 I told this guy I played the piano and like half an hour later he said if I wanted you to always remember me, would break your ring fingers, you know, cause they don't heal well. And then you'd always think of me when playing. Suffice to say, I left the restaurant fairly quickly. Five. Friend told me the guy not only asked for a selfie, but posted on Facebook with the caption my queen. First time meeting. 6 he wanted to go for a walk at the park with me at 4:00am. So when I said no, he said, don't worry, I won't rape you and gave me a twisted smile. 7 invited my ex to join us for lunch. 8 this is not my story, but my mother's. My mom was. Was a pioneer in online dating. She was really interested in finding someone special. She agreed to meet a guy for dinner. First mistake and went in to be seated prior to him arriving. He came in, the waitress brought menus, and he set down his Menu and the first words he spoke were asking my mom if she has ever known anyone who had a penis enlargement. He then went on to explain that he had flown Cross County for this operation and it had gone wrong. He went into great specifics about just how wrong. My mother excused herself to the ladies room and left out the back door. We still laugh out loud when she reminds us of her search for Mr. Wright. Nine. He insisted he drive me to the movie theater, which meant he would have to drive to my town, 45 minutes away, back to his town to go to the theater, then back to my town to drop me off. I said I didn't understand why I wouldn't just drive to the theater myself to save the multiple trips. When I adamantly refused to ride, he still drove to my town, bought me a coffee, and still insisted I go in his car. I still said no, citing the fact that it would be dangerous for me to get into a vehicle with a person I didn't know, and I drove myself to the theater where I had a friend meet me for the movie. The guy still came with us to the movie and even paid for me despite me telling him I didn't think it was a good idea, never spoke to him again, and blocked his number.

Five seconds later. One. I asked my surgical team if anyone needed anything while I was out. Two. I was about to have a bowel resection and told the surgeon that he only had my permission to take enough to make one bratwurst. I also told him that I had deliberately let my six pack ABS atrophy so it'd be a bit easier for him to cut through. 3. Apparently I said, don't worry, I'm not embarrassed because I'm a corn star. I have no memory of this, but apparently I did right before I went out cold for my testicular torsion surgery. I was greeted with good morning, corn star when the doctor came for rounds the next morning. 4. The first time I had surgery, I don't know what happened, but I woke up screaming in literally the worst pain I had ever felt, feeling like I was about to die. People were scrambling, doing stuff to me while telling me I was okay. They knocked me out again after probably 20 seconds. That felt like 20 years. I also Learned that if they give you fentanyl and then offer you a stool softener afterward, do not decline it. Five. I'm a man in his mid fifties with a belly. I told them, if it's a choice between me and the baby, choose me. Six. I've seen a patient pull off a Pretty good one. Wanna hear a joke? How do you keep an anesthetist in suspense? Remember, sometimes these words might be your last if you somehow don't survive the surgery. 7. I was given propofol for anesthesia last year and was joking with the anesthesiologist about Michael Jackson. Just before I went under, he started singing Billy Jean to me. 8. The nurse assisting with my vasectomy said, I think I'm going to be sick and ran out of the room. I looked at my doctor and said, that's not the usual reaction I get when I drop my pants. It took him 10 minutes to compose himself. 9. Just before I went under for a colonoscopy, I told the DOC, are you sure this is right? I just came in for a teeth cleaning without missing a beat. He replied, don't worry, we can get there from here. 10. My wife is an anesthesiologist. She introduces herself to some patients by saying, hi, I'm name and I will be your cocktail waitress.

Just this week, a local woman in her late 20s died of a toothache. She had posted on Facebook about needing a dentist over the weekend and decided to wait until Monday. By Sunday morning, she was gone. The infection had spread to her brain. 2. My wife's boss almost died from a pimple. She got a pimple, the infection entered her bloodstream, and she was hospitalized for 11 days. She almost died. Three. You develop cancerous cells every day, but your immune system deals with them. 4. I noticed this after my abdominal surgery. When I turned over in bed, my gut seemed to shift from one side to the other. I mentioned this to my doctor and she confirmed that it was my bowels rearranging themselves. 5. The tiniest injury to your brain can change your entire life. Depending on which part of the brain gets injured, you can lose your senses, control over your own body, the ability to produce or comprehend language, your memories, your personality, etc. Remember to wear a helmet, everyone. 6. Stomach acid is very powerful. It would burn right through us if we didn't secrete mucus every few hours. Seven. Period cramps are essentially your womb suffocating itself to shed the uterine lining. During your period, your uterus contracts. When the contractions are stronger, your womb squeezes blood vessels so tight that oxygen can't reach them, sending pain signals to your Brain this process also increases the production of chemicals called prostaglandins, which encourage even more contractions. There really is no mercy. 8. A third to 1/2 of all fertilized ovum do not result in a viable pregnancy. They are expelled as a heavy period instead. Most women don't even realize they miscarried. 9. After surgery where they move your organs around, they might not function for a day because the body assumes they are dead. 10. Your butthole and your mouth originate from the same cell grouping during development, but the butthole forms first and then the mouth cells form from them. This means your mouth essentially develops from your butt. 11. Some people suffer from exploding head syndrome, which causes them to hear a loud bang when they wake up. Twelve. Your body knows all the answers to your biology exam, but won't tell you. 13. The human body is always making disgusting noises. The only reason you're not aware of it is the ambient noise drowns it out. If you go to one of those super silent rooms that absorb sound, it's a really weird way to reacquaint yourself with your body.

You gave me a necklace with a little diamond family and a heart with our two hypothetical children who we had named James and Jasmine. I wore it for two days before I returned it. I was 15.

He ran out the back door while I awkwardly dressed myself. My mom cried. Same guy. Lost my V card to him and he had covered my parents guest bedroom with rose petals and lit candles. Whipped cream was involved. I thought I had cleaned everything up but missed some whipped cream on the comforter which my mom thought was dried bodily fluid. A lot of it. Guess what? She cried. Same guy. We were doing the deed in the shower at his parents house and his mom came home unexpectedly. Had to come downstairs and explain why I was showering at their house. She called my mom, who cried and then had a group meeting with both sets of parents telling us that we were moving too fast and talking about safe intimacy. Same guy. His dad walks in while we were watching a movie and fooling around under a blanket. The dude very obviously keeps going while having a full on conversation with his dad. His dad Winked. Same guy. We were in my bedroom and my parents were supposedly at the lake. Car pulls up and he jumps out of my second story bedroom window to avoid my dad, who searched the entire house for him afterwards. He couldn't play baseball that week and the coach, also my English teacher, was very mad at me. Same guy. We were doing the deed in the baseball field dugout late one night when a couple walked by pretending they did not see us. Same guy. We were fooling around in the backseat of my car at a local park in the woods and it completely fogged up the windows when a man taps on the door and tells us to knock it off. Earns out it was my neighbor. Same guy. We broke up and for some reason my parents felt bad for him so they let him in with flowers and he slipped them petal by petal under my locked door for two hours while trying to convince me to get back together. All while my parents and his dad are sitting in the living room. Same guy.

You don't actually bite down, you bite up because of your lower jaw. 2. It was never mentioned that Humpty Dumpty was an egg. Three percentages are reversible.

A lot of people are like what? Five. Cats, dogs, and other similar animals can't see directly below their faces because their snout gets in the way. Six. Tear ducks drain tears, they don't produce them. 7. Just like humans, British cows moo in regional accents. 8. During World War 2, the British didn't want the Germans to know they had secret radar technology, so they spread propaganda saying that the good eyesight of their pilots was due to carrots. And everyone believed it. 9. That meme on Facebook that says your rockstar name is the name of your first pet in the street you grew up on was put out so that hundreds of gullible teenagers would post the answers to their bank security questions. 10. Just like a dormitory is a place where you sleep, a laboratory is a place where you labor. 11. The words laser and SCUBA are actually acronyms and they stand for Laser Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. SCUBA Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus. 12. Almost all samples of sea salt that you can buy in supermarkets are contaminated by microplastics from all the crap in the ocean. 13. On average, people have less than two arms. 14. Baby porcupines are called porcupets. 15. You know that old statistic that the average person eats three spiders in their sleep each year? That was an intentionally made up statistic by a journalist to elicit the point that people will believe any statistic the media will tell them. 16. You're probably of average intelligence or below. 17. Your tongue rests at the roof of your mouth. 18. Most cars have a little arrow on the fuel pump symbol to show which side of the car the filling cap is. 19. Taking Tylenol when you have a hangover can severely damage your liver. 20. The word set has most amount of definitions in a single word. 21. To fast means to abstain from eating. You do this every night when you go to bed.

One walking through the capital building with my then four year old son when a man on crutches with one amputated leg got into the same elevator as us. My son said whispering, mom, what happened to his leg? The man heard him and kindly said that he lost his leg a year ago. My son didn't miss a beat and said did you check between the couch cushions? My mom says she always loses shit in there. I was appalled. The man on the other hand, was laughing so hard he was crying. 2. While playing in her pretend kitchen, my four year old was rummaging through the cabinets and says where the fuck is my colander? Before I can say anything, she finds it, sniffs it, looks at her teddy bear and asks did you piss in this? After gathering my composure, I discussed the use of daddy words. 3. My boss has Red Sox season tickets. She gave me a pair so I could bring my then ten year old son. We ended up on the dance cam on the big screen and my sweet baby boy decided to flip Fenway Park the bird. Four I was driving with my kids in the car and was almost hit by a driver making a very stupid maneuver. I responded by angrily saying oh now look at this fucking Guy. My three year old son then continued to repeat that phrase for about a month anytime we were in traffic. Thankfully only in the presence of me. It was hard to correct with a straight face. Five. My son was about four when he decided he was going to buckle himself into his car seat with no help at all, so I decided to let him give it a go. I sat in the front seat and waited to hear the clicks from the buckles. I heard god damn it from the back seat instead. I turned around. Excuse me? Nothing. Click. Click. 6 not a parent, hopefully soon, but was a preschool teacher for five years. I was up in the two year old room saying hi and this toddler brushes his teeth and drops his toothbrush with the response, oh shit. The teacher corrected his behavior with you can't say that! He then replied, oh fuck, I forgot. I walked out dying of laughter. 7 I once caught my youngest son, about 3 at the time, peeing in the corner of his room, right next to the wastebasket and sort of behind a bookshelf. When I asked him why he was doing that when there was a bathroom 10 feet away, he said he was watering the ants. Confused about what ants and why, I went over and peeked behind the bookshelf and I found the ants and the half donut he'd swiped and shoved back there. Along with various bits of candy, a slice of bread, and most of a chicken nugget. Apparently he had seen an ant and decided to cultivate his own little ant farm in his room. It was so absurd that I had a hard time holding it together while explaining to him that the ants would do just fine without feeding them and pissing on them.

He shit himself regularly. Deliberately. 2. He walked around like Master Chief, even teabagged the ground randomly, all while holding an invisible assault rifle. 3. He wrote his crush's name on the wall in the bathroom with his own shit. They caught him brown handed. Also would freak out if someone said Werewolf. 4. He would Jack off in the middle of class. He didn't actually pull it out, but he would aggressively rub the side of his pants and his face would get really red while starring at the girls in the class. Everybody noticed, but a word was never spoken about it. 5. He was on a hair trigger. Would snap and threaten people. Suspended multiple times. Two memorable incidents were when we freaked out at an art teacher, went to his locker and came back with a bullwhip. He made that thing snap and sent everyone running. She barricaded herself in the supply room. Another time someone made the mistake of teasing him about something and everyone laughed and he pulled a knife and screamed who wants to be the first to die? He was expelled and I'm not sure what became of him. 6. He was always running around in the shape of a. 8. If you just said hello to him, he started screeching and attacked you with his lunch box. And once he ate a Kitkat with the plastic. 7. She was afraid of cows. And if you said Moo or mentioned cows, she'd freak out and attack you. I'll give it to her though. She'd even try to attack guys three times her size that were athletes. 8 he once asked me to be his gay slave, so I don't even know how to feel about that. I just wanted some Yu Gi Oh cards that I wasn't even going to use. Nine he always carried around a briefcase, but never opened it. Sat on the briefcase during lunch, classes, etc. It was like the nuclear football. Always in his hand or he was sitting on it. He carried it onto the stage during graduation, got his diploma. Right as he was leaving the stage, he opened it up and dumped a bunch of confetti on the principal. I guess it was the long con. No one questioned why he was carrying it on stage. 10 his dad started a house fire insurance scam and died in the fire. This was around sixth grade. That messed him up a bit. The kid would tap his feet and hands uncontrollably and he talked about shooting people. 11 looking back now that we know what it is, most of the weird kids I knew growing up probably had depression, were abused, or were autistic.

The vast majority of people with a first time seizure will never have another seizure again and will not need lifelong anti seizure medication. Everybody gets one freebie! 2. I once found a ladybug in my room in the middle of winter. I tried to look up if I could feed it somehow and found countless other people asking the same question. The world is full of people who have compassion enough to feed a lone bug in the winter. Three. Crows will let other crows know if you're a good person. Feeding a crow in your backyard can quickly become many crows over time, since the rumor spreads and nearby crows in your area will know you as one they like. They can also be known to be protective of you and even bring you gifts. Suffice to say, crows are one of the most intelligent creatures on the planet and they are truly underrated. 4. If you quit smoking by age 40, your life expectancy is the same as a non smoker. Also, it's never too late to quit. 5. Nobody pays all that much attention to you. Everyone is the main character in their story and thinks you're just another supporting role or an NPC. I find this very freeing. Six. There is a type of mold growing on on around the elephant's foot in Chernobyl. This mold eats radiation and the radioactivity of the elephant's foot has decreased drastically. Since the mold started growing there, it's comforting to me that the planet can heal, no matter how bad the scar we left. 8. Your pets will forgive you if you accidentally step on them. 9. Sometimes dogs in movies have to have CGI tails because they keep wagging their tails. They are just so happy to be there. 10. You can talk to your pet rabbit by quickly pushing your lips downwards and upwards as if you were trying to look up your nose in a mirror. Do it quickly and you're chatting. It mimics the nose movements they make and you can see them wiggle their noses faster out of interest. Copy their rhythm and watch them talk back. Also, stomping your foot like they do, as well as turning your back on them when annoyed is understood too. If they have chewed something they shouldn't have, you can stomp one foot and turn around with your arms folded. Have a look over your shoulder to make sure they see you. They should come to check on you, and if they don't, stop and make sure they see your back is turned. Eventually they get it and come over to make sure you're okay. Then let the nose wiggling commence. You can expect them to do the same to you as well, like when you clean their enclosure.

One, I thought Mick Jagger's name was Mick Jagger, and people just never said his first name for some reason. Two, I thought that horses had toes. Until I was 22, I thought the hoof was a horseshoe and the toes were tucked inside. How did I learn how wrong I was, you ask? I was walking past a cavalry museum and saw a horse statue and loudly remarked, it must hurt so bad when they fold a horse's toes to put them into the shoe. Dozens of horse enthusiasts turned and looked at me with wild bewilderment in their eyes. Three, I was, like, 22, working at a restaurant, making myself a salad, and I asked the chef for bumps, and he stared at me for, like, 60 solid seconds trying to figure out what I wanted. I explained to him I wanted bumps for my salad. I have all the rest of the toppings, but now needed bumps. Guys, my family told me croutons were called bumps my entire life. I called my dad that night and confirmed that bumps are indeed actually called croutons. 4 that you don't have to stand in the shower while the water warms up. 5 my sister was in her 50s when she found out the meaning of you have an addictive personality. She thought after all these years of therapy, that it meant that people were addicted to her personality. We laugh hysterically. When we talk about this in a very sad way. 6. You don't have to rip the plastic top off of your new deodorant with your teeth or pliers or anything. You can just turn the base until it comes up enough to just take it off. 7 that bonsai are not a species of tree, but a way to grow them. Any tree can be a bonsai. 8. I thought that prima Donna was prima Donna and that it meant everything before the singer Madonna and just assumed she was some kind of Universal Queen. 9. Was probably 21 or 22 when I Learned that whole milk is only 3% fat. I always thought it was 100, and when I saw reduced as being 2% I thought why wouldn't they do 50% or somewhere in the middle? 10. This is something my little sister did through high school. We're about eight years apart, so we never overlapped in school. She's always been a straight A student, and I found out she worked extra hard because she wanted to catch up to me in school so we could be in school at the same time. I almost cried.

One. Men's sacks change depending on the temperature. 2. When I was a kid, diaper commercials all showed a hand pouring blue liquid into the diaper. Later I saw a pad commercial that did the same thing. So for years I thought women lost their bladder control once a month and had to wear mini diapers. And also women and babies pee blue. 3. That men don't actually shit for an hour. It's their getaway peace and quiet time. I was thinking every man had IBS. 4. That your periods can last for multiple weeks if you are coming off birth control. Like WTF? My girlfriend here is bleeding for 2 weeks now and doctors are just shrugging like yeah, it's a typical side effect. Crazy. 5. That a guy can accidentally sit on his own gonads. I assumed they retracted. 6. I didn't know that peeing for men is so complicated. Apparently it can shoot in different directions and split streams. Why haven't there been more effective toilet urinal models? Seven when my wife said sometimes women don't want our problems fixed, we just want to vent about them. I think my brain broke in that moment. Eight their peepees float. Nine. Really surprised me when I Learned girls don't poop. Ten. Let's just say things were a bit lower than expected when I first got with a girl lol. 11. When men are peeing And they see poop stains on the toilet. They try to use the force of their pee to clean off the poop stains. My husband's biggest shock was he was using the women's restroom and asked through the stall what the little metal boxes by the toilet paper was for. 12 so I worked as a cleaner at my old school for a while after leaving, and I was very surprised to discover that the girls changing rooms was more disgusting than the boys. I walked in there once, and there were five dried, bloody tampons splattered against the wall. I quit that day. 13 how much mental and physical effort women have to put into their personal security on a daily basis. 14 that feminine hygiene products are taxed extra as a luxury item in my state. 15 honestly, I just found out that at 18, my husband was required to sign up for the draft when he got his driver's license. It was not optional for him. He had to because he is a man. Sixteen. I didn't realize that guys really struggle with showing their emotions. Like, I tell my husband it's okay to get upset over things like I do, and he straight up tells me, I don't know how to do that. Damn it, society! Let men show and feel things.

The teacher asked us what our mother's name was. Everyone answered but me. L never realized my mom had a name. L questioned my entire existence. I went to her straight after school. She was cooking in the kitchen. I asked her, mama, what's your name? She smiled, stopped cooking and came down to my height and told me her name.

Five I didn't realize until a couple of years ago. It's pitch black, as in pitch, aka Tar. 6 I visited Rome with my mom as I was six or 7. We were staying in a line to go to the toilet in Colosseum. And she suddenly pointed to a crack in the wall and said that there is Something there. I checked it out and it was a Roman coin. Of course I thought that it was real and kept it and told everyone I knew about it. I realized that my mom just staged it all only 10 years later. Still amazing memories though. 7. A few years back I realized that the Christmas song I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus wasn't actually about the mother being unfaithful and putting out for Saint Nick, but it was just the dad dressed as Santa. For almost my entire life I thought the mom just got around. I was 26 when I realized otherwise.

One, after we got home from partying, I ate her leftovers from Texas Roadhouse and helped her look for the box, and then blamed our Labrador retriever. Two, I scratched my wife's car on a low wall and didn't say a word. But she noticed in a supermarket car park and she went nuts, claiming the car next her had scraped it and driven off. Being the gentleman, I offered to pay to repair it. Three, I work in a hospital, so I have lots of weekdays off. I got bored one day and went to the casino since I haven't been in years. About 20 minutes in, I won $5,000 on the slots. Immediately cashed out, and I chose to pay the taxes there on the spot. Took the rest home. A few weeks later, my wife had a conference in Vegas and I tagged along so we could make a long weekend of it. The day of her conference, I bought a drink and wandered around the strip doing nothing. When she got out of the conference that afternoon, I told her I won $5,000 on the slots. Of course, she was ecstatic because work had already paid for a room at the Cosmo and she had like $100 per day in PDM. So all that cash was spent on eating at Michelin starred restaurants and going to shows for free. I've never told her I won It at the dumpy casino 20 minutes from our house. 4 I went to the cinema yesterday on my own. Told work I had to go back to wait for a tradesman as my wife had to take her dad to hospital. Not true at all. I just wanted to see the new Deadpool film. Wife thinks I was at work, work thinks I was at home. That's as scandalous as my life will ever get. Lowell 5 I ate all the Pop Tarts and purchased new ones before they knew. Then ate all those and got in trouble for eating just the one box. Six I told my boyfriend I was going home to family for Christmas. I told my family I was going to my boyfriend's family for Christmas. I stayed home and did nothing all day.

As a kid, I was always forced to kneel on rice for hours at a time, and it was an absolute nightmare. I was raised by a single mother who handed this punishment out to me for poor grades, and each letter below an A meant two hours of kneeling on rice. If my report card came back with two b's, two A's, and a C, that would be a total of eight hours straight of kneeling on rice. I remember begging my mother with everything I had not to make me kneel, but she never showed mercy. I remember kneeling down and knowing that this was going to be my life for the next eight hours. Within the first 30 minutes, my skin would experience irritation and damage. The pain was starting to become very noticeable, and the rice would start to seriously dig into my skin. At this point, one hour into the kneeling, my knees would be stiff and locked up, and the rice would start to feel extremely sharp and sore. Two hours in, my knees would become numb, and by this point, I would experience joint pain and muscle pain in my quads. By three hours in, I would usually start to cry because the pain would become so unbearable. It would feel like my knees were on fire, and the rice felt like sharp metal spikes. My knees would be in severe agony, and I remember Pleading to my mom to let me up, but she never did. Around the four hour Mark, I would start to lose circulation and my knees would start to go purple. The pain by this point had decreased as my legs were basically numb by this point. I couldn't feel them or move them. I couldn't stand up by myself either, and it was only when my mom saw my knees turn purple that she would help me stand up. As soon as I stood up, the pain was excruciating and I would often scream out. My mom would let me breathe for a few minutes until my knees turned a normal color again, and she would make me kneel again after making sure I finished the full eight hours or however long I was doing. By the time the eight hours was over, I was usually crying from the pain and my legs would be locked up in purple. My knees would be indented from the rice and my quads would be in pain too. I usually was not able to walk the day after this happened too. Nowadays I have severe joint damage and permanent scar tissue damage in my knee. The nerves in my knee have also been damaged, and I can't even walk up the stairs without my knees giving out or being in pain.

One. I hadn't slept or eaten well for two days. I was in a bus to take a six hour journey at night. A lady sat next to my seat. Since I was single, I took the first row of the bus because shakes will be minimal. I was waiting for the bus to start for 20 minutes. Right the moment the bus was about to start, a girl of my age came in and stared at me. Spoke something to the driver, which I didn't care to listen. She was expecting me to give her my seat. Because if a lady sits next to me, then mine also becomes a lady's seat. The driver conductor were also expecting me to move back. There was only one seat at the last row of the bus. I explained my situation to the girl, but she didn't seem to listen. So as a gesture of courtesy, I got up to check the last seat. Found it was broken uncomfortable. That's why it's not taken by anybody till then. Before I came back, she sat on my seat comfortably. I haven't got enough strength to argue fight at that time. So I simply moved back and made the journey in discomfort. She didn't even mind to say it. Thank you. She can't sit at the last row. She doesn't have time to wait for the next bus. Sometimes girls do get unfair advantage fast. Forward to 3+ months, 6+ hours journey. Festive time. Unreserved bus. So standing traveling for four hours. A fellow guy who was watching me for a long time stood up and offered me a seat. I expressed my gratitude to him. 2. A girl accidentally entered men's washroom. I was urinating. I saw her and shouted this is men's. She shouted oh god and ran out. After I came out, everyone was laughing. She was also a part of that crowd. I shrugged it off with a smile. I still remember I was in sixth or seventh grade and accidentally entered girls washroom. I was treated like a criminal by my teachers and other girls for the entire year. And also got very less marks for discipline on my final report card. 3. Social media we are never called creepy. Guys are even if they are not public transport. We have an entire metro coach for us. But what happens when there is a tired guy looking at the empty women's coach? What about the self made you should always let a girl sit in your seat rule? That's unfair to guys career. Even if we say that we are very much career minded. Girls know that even if we don't get a job, we can still bake. Whereas for a guy it gets difficult. A girl can do a man's job and she will be applauded. But if a guy does a pink collar job, he is faced with Mockery most of the time. Remember a guy nurse 4. So when it comes to advantages, being a girl is one of the biggest advantages itself. Girls are not bound to work. It's okay if they choose to stay at home and have fun. It becomes easy to get your things done if you are a girl. People gladly do that. Cute smile and puppy eyes do wonders. Girls do not have much pressure to perform very good in bed. Frankly, it's more on guys. Girls have more options when it comes to dresses and accessories. Getting late is as easy for girls as Hussein bolt to win the race. Girls are not bound to initiate when it comes to dating. Girls can cry, nobody raises their eyebrows. And now comes the stomachache. I don't even remember how many times I've used this stomachache to excuse myself from boring lectures, boring people and boring parties. It does wonders. Isn't it unfair? It is. But hey, before you guys start complaining how difficult life is for you, know that it isn't easy for girls either. Everything has its perks as well as pitfalls. So chill.

The presentation included 64 Powerpoint slides about the new standardized forms. Colonel stopped on Slide 12 to tell a 15 minute story about his childhood golden retriever. By slide 30, people were swaying from heat stroke. Our first sergeant kept mouthing I'm sorry from the side of the stage while the Colonel clicked through comparison charts showing the efficiency improvements in the new system. A 3% reduction in processing time for canine dental appointments. The highlight was a 10 minute video demonstration of the proper way to input a dog's canine tooth measurements into the database. The narrator kept saying, remember to tab, not enter with the gravity of someone explaining nuclear launch codes. The briefing finally ended. The colonel asked if anyone had question. The silence was deafening. Then some brave soul from the back called out, sir, how many dogs do we actually have on this entire post? The colonel looked confused, checked his notes, and finally admitted, I Believe it's four. 4 dogs, 300 soldiers. 4 hours of our life. The ultimate military equation. Maximum personnel, minimum relevance. I still have nightmares about those dental forms. And I've never even met one of those four dogs.

During a winter field exercise in Germany, our comm specialist got fed up with his radio battery dying after just a few hours in the freezing temps. Standard army issue batteries just couldn't handle the cold. Unlike the rest of us, complaining but doing nothing, this guy had an idea. He took an MRE heater packet, wrapped it around his spare battery with duct tape, then stuffed both inside an extra wool sock. He added hand warmers on each side for good measure, securing the whole contraption to his plate carrier. Platoon sergeant noticed this bizarre lump on his chest and asked what the hell he was doing. Battery warmer, sergeant, he replied nervously. Chemical reaction from the MRE heater keep lithium ion cells warm. Should double the battery life. The sergeant stared at him for a solid minute. If you burn down the talk with that science project, I'll personally ensure you spend the rest of your enlistment cleaning latrines with your toothbrush. Two days into the exercise, everyone else was constantly swapping dead batteries while this guy's radio kept working. By day three, half the platoon had their own sock wrapped battery packs. Even the sergeant had one, though he'd deny it if you ask. Italian commander spotted this trend during his walkthrough and demanded an explanation. After hearing about the hack, he laughed and called it tackle innovation. A month later, the battalion SOP was Updated with an official procedure for field expedient battery Thermal management that was basically put battery in sock with MRE heater. The guy never got an award, but his sock solution save thousands in replacement battery.

So I served her the truth with her last latte. I used to be a Starbucks barista, and we had this woman who'd come in every morning and order, I shit you not, a double tall vanilla latte with three eights. A pump of vanilla, not half a pump, not a third. Three eights. She even made one of us Mark the bottle pump with a Sharpie to show exactly where three eights landed. Karen was her name, and making our lives hell was apparently her full time job. Every single morning was the same ritual. The first cup we made was always wrong. Sweet, not sweet enough. Wrong temperature, wrong foam density. She had a new complaint locked and loaded before she even tasted it. This is why I have to budget extra time for coffee, she'd say to whoever was behind her loud enough for us to hear. They just can't seem to get it right the first time. Then came the corporate complaints. Every week was another call about our incompetence. And then she'd walk in the next day with that little smirk asking if we'd received her feedback. One morning, she held up 15 construction workers because her phone wasn't glossy enough. When one muttered about being late for a job site, she laughed. Maybe construction workers should stick to gas station coffee if they can't appreciate quality. She said it loud. Made sure Everyone heard, then asked me if those people even tipped. I should have known then. She was gearing up for something worse. Breaking point came on a Thursday. Maria was working the register, and she's literally the sweetest girl. Third generation American. Her parents ran a restaurant downtown. Karen took one look at her that morning, and I saw something shift in her face. I made Maria remake her drink three times, then stepped aside and made a phone call. Twenty minutes later, two ICE agents walked in, and Karen pointed at Maria and said she looked suspicious and was probably illegal. Maria had to leave the floor, hands shaking, while agents checked her documents in the back her driver's license, her passport, while a store full of customers watched. She came back crying, and Karen just stood there with her arms crossed, waiting for her remade drink like nothing happened. I was done. When Karen inevitably complained about her fourth attempt, I took her cup and thought, I'm not wasting another second on this horrible woman. I walked to the machine, waved the steam wand around for show, and handed her back the exact same drink. Perfect, I said after taking a sip. See? Was that so hard? Holy crap, it worked. That's when I knew this bitch had been playing us for a year, and now I had her number. From that day forward, I gave Karen the same drink back. Every single morning. I take her cup. Do my little performance behind the machine and hand back the identical drink. Much better, she'd say. Finally, someone who can follow directions. Eight months of this. Eight months of watching her sip the same wrong drink she just rejected and declare it perfect. My co workers caught on, and we take turns doing the fake remake, trying not to laugh. It became a game. How long could we seem nothing? How dramatically could we not make a drink? Then finally, my last day came. I had a new job lined up, apron ready to turn in. And guess who paid me a visit. Karen came in and ordered her usual. I made it with extra care. Exactly three eighth of a pump. Precisely 165 degrees. Foam like silk. She took one

Have you ever been accused of stolen valor? I wore my dress blues to my son's high school graduation. 22 years Marine Corps, four deployments. I'd earned it. My son had asked me to wear them during the reception. This guy approaches me, already filming with his phone. Which battalion were you within Fallujah? I answered. 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Wrong. They never deployed to Fallujah. Stolen Valor! He shouted, drawing a crowd. I calmly explained that three five absolutely was in Fallujah during Operation Phantom Fury. Prove it! He demanded, getting in my face. Where's your Combat Action Ribbon? What's your MOS? Before I could answer, he swung at me. Poor decision. I sidestepped. He stumbled into the Juice Bowl. Mind you, dude was about 5 foot 4, 280. Slowest punch ever. Campus security detained us both. When police arrived, the guy kept insisting he was protecting the honor of real veterans. The officer asked for his service details. That's when he admitted he never actually served, just studied military history extensively. My phone rang while we were sorting this out. It was my old platoon commander calling to confirm our reunion next month. I put him on speaker, introduced him to my new friend, and watched the color drain from the guy's face. Charges were filed for assault. I dropped them after he agreed to volunteer at the local VA hospital.

As a kid, I was always forced to kneel on rice for hours at a time, and it was an absolute nightmare. I was raised by a single mother who handed this punishment out to me for poor grades, and each letter below an A meant two hours of kneeling on rice. If my report card came back with two b's, two A's, and a C, that would be a total of eight hours straight of kneeling on rice. I remember begging my mother with everything I had not to make me kneel, but she never showed mercy. I remember kneeling down and knowing that this was going to be my life for the next eight hours. Within the first 30 minutes, my skin would experience irritation and damage. The pain was starting to become very noticeable, and the rice would start to seriously dig into my skin. At this point, one hour into the kneeling, my knees would be stiff and locked up, and the rice would start to feel extremely sharp and sore. Two hours in, my knees would become numb, and by this point, I would experience joint pain and muscle pain in my quads. By three hours in, I would usually start to cry because the pain would become so unbearable. It would feel like my knees were on fire, and the rice felt like sharp metal spikes. My knees would be in severe agony, and I remember Pleading to my mom to let me up, but she never did. Around the four hour Mark, I would start to lose circulation and my knees would start to go purple. The pain by this point had decreased as my legs were basically numb by this point. I couldn't feel them or move them. I couldn't stand up by myself either, and it was only when my mom saw my knees turn purple that she would help me stand up. As soon as I stood up, the pain was excruciating and I would often scream out. My mom would let me breathe for a few minutes until my knees turned to normal color again, and she would make me kneel again after making sure I finished the full eight hours or however long I was doing. By the time the eight hours was over, I was usually crying from the pain and my legs would be locked up in purple. My knees would be indented from the rice and my quads would be in pain too. I usually was not able to walk the day after this happened too. Nowadays I have severe joint damage and permanent scar tissue damage in my knee. The nerves in my knee have also been damaged, and I can't even walk up the stairs without my knees giving out or being in pain.

I'm firing him tomorrow. That night, I noticed Jake's social media photos at the beach restaurants looking happy. But something felt off. The smiles never reached his eyes. I remembered my crisis intervention training and texted Jake, are you really okay? His response came at 3:00am. No, I've been sitting with a gun for hours. I called emergency services immediately. When Jake returned two weeks later, Tom demanded a meeting with both of us. You need a better excuse than personal issues, Tom started. I slid a sealed envelope across the table. This is from Jake's psychiatrist. Tom opened it, face changing as he read. I didn't know, he whispered. The next day, Tom gathered everyone. We are implementing changes. Mental health days are now part of sick leave. No questions asked. Six months later, our productivity is up 32%. Turnover dropped by half. Yesterday, Jake got promoted to team lead. As we celebrated, he said, you know what's crazy? I almost didn't text you back that night. What changed your mind? I asked. You were the first person who noticed something was wrong. Behind my perfect social media life. The best excuse to call off work isn't an excuse at all.

I'd only been at the company for about six or seven months when I got really sick. It started with me collapsing in the server room. One day, my coworker found me running a crazy high fever and took me straight to the hospital. Everyone at work was super understanding, and they let me work from home while I tried to recover. But things didn't get better. A week later, I collapsed again, and this time, my parents got me admitted to the hospital. I was barely able to walk, talk, or even eat. It felt like my body was shutting down. I didn't know what was wrong, and neither did the doctors. But it was bad. Since it was the weekend, I wasn't too worried about work until my phone rang. I couldn't even talk, so my mom answered for me. Apparently, my boss had called to ask me for files on a project I wasn't even working on. My mom, in her calm mom voice, let him know I wasn't exactly in a position to help. She told him I was in the hospital because they were running tests to figure out why I needed blood transfusions, had lost almost 50 pounds in two months, and couldn't keep food down. She gave him my room number and told him he could visit if he wanted. I didn't expect anything to come of it, but Soon, my hospital room was filled with flowers, cards, you name it. My boss felt awful for not realizing how sick I was, and my coworkers went above and beyond to support me. I ended up being diagnosed with Lupus after 10 days in the hospital. It took me five weeks to get back to work. But when I did, my team treated me like gold. If I even looked tired, they sent me home to rest. Not every boss or workplace is like that, and I'll always be grateful to have had a team that genuinely cares.

When I was 11, my mom's boyfriend, Greg, would throw things when he got mad. He was a big guy with hands like hammers, always smelling of cigarettes. One night, he was yelling about the internet being slow. While playing his online poker games. He grabbed my cat, Milo, an old orange tabby who'd been with me since kindergarten, and threatened to throw him outside where he belongs. I panicked and stepped between them, heart pounding in my chest. Greg shoved me hard against the wall, knocking down my school photos. Then he tripped over the coffee table and smashed his head on the brick fireplace. Blood everywhere, soaking into our beige carpet. Two hours later, my mom came home from her night shift. I heard her gasp, then start yelling at him for drinking again. When he didn't answer right, she called 9 1 1. At the hospital, they found he had bleeding in his brain. While fixing that, they found a tumor. A big one. The doctor said the accident probably saved his life. After surgery and recovery, Greg became different. Calmer. No. No more throwing things or yelling. The tumor had been making him angry for years. Without it, he turned into someone who taught me to fish and help with my science projects. Last month at my

My wife and I had been trying for nearly a year. When she took another pregnancy test, as had become routine. She came out holding it, asking, does that look like a line to you? It was faint, but it was there. We were ecstatic. I ran out to buy a better test, and when that confirmed it, we nicknamed our baby tortellini. For nine days, we lived in pure joy. Then, on December 22, I woke from a nightmare that my wife had miscarried. I don't believe in omens, but that morning she found blood. The doctor confirmed our worst fear. We lost our child. Grief hit us differently. I wrote a tortellini a letter and tucked it away with the positive tests in my sock drawer. My wife coped by collecting children's books, filling a bookshelf in the room we had planned as the nursery. When her doctor gave the green light, we decided to try again, expecting another long wait. But suddenly, my wife held up another test. Pregnant. I looked up from my book and said, so soon? I wasn't ready to celebrate. Fear overshadowed excitement. I avoided touching her stomach, afraid of getting attached, only to face heartbreak again. But hope doesn't cause loss. And joy doesn't erase grief. We've now passed seven

My therapist showed up at my house uninvited at 7:00am on a Saturday. I was in my ratty SpongeBob pajamas, half asleep when I opened the door, and there she was, Doctor Winters, standing on my porch with two coffees and a paper bag. After my third suicide attempt, my sister found Doctor Winters through some mental health form. Her office was this dingy converted storage room above a Vietnamese restaurant. The whole place smelled like pho, and there was this massive water stain on the ceiling shaped exactly like Australia. First session, she didn't take notes, didn't ask about my childhood, just stare. Stared at me for like, 40 uncomfortable seconds and said, your Lexapro isn't working. I can tell by your pupils. She was right. I've been on it for seven months and still couldn't get out of bed most days. She had this weird rule. No tissues in therapy. Said crying without wiping tears away forces you to sit with emotions instead of cleaning them up. There was this dead plant on her desk she'd sometimes point to and say, depression looks like that, but your brain isn't actually dead yet. During our fourth session, her phone kept buzzing. She acted eight times in an hour. When I finally said something, she just said, sometimes boundaries need breaking. Then prescribed me Wellbutrin instead of the Zoloft my previous doctor recommended.

One. When my dad started pursuing my mom at the college that they met at, he went to the records office and got her schedule. Apparently, anyone could do that at the time. And waited outside of each of her classrooms to walk her to her next class. He did this for like a week. She thought it was both slightly annoying and romantic. Today, that shit would be considered stalking. Two. I went out with a girl, and I would get out and open the door for her when we went out in my car. After about the second day, she complimented me on being such a gentleman and that no one has done that for her. I laughed. Then I told her I forgot to tell her the inside door handle on the passenger side car was broken, so that's the only way to open the door. Well, anyway, it worked, I guess. I've been married to her for 12 years, and she's the mother of my two kids. Three. It used to be cute to hear stories of. When I first met her, she wanted nothing to do with me. I showed up to her job with flowers every day until she said yes, and we eventually fell in love. Nowadays, that's just straight up harassment. Four. Throwing rocks at someone's window to sing to them in the middle of the night. 5. A duel to The death to win a woman. Or even just a fist fight over a woman. Like, no matter who wins, you know she's just gonna pick the guy she likes better regardless, right? 6 armed combat with lethal weapons has definitely gone out of fashion as a romantic gesture.

When I was a waiter in downtown Phoenix 20 years ago, I had a street person on retainer. Parking was difficult for lunch shift. Our restaurant couldn't wouldn't validate employees parking, so we had to use the meters on the street. Since the meters had a two hour limit, you needed to park close enough to be able to run down and feed them in the middle of the lunch rush. Spaces were very limited. One day soon after starting, I passed the same bum for the third night in a row panhandling. He wasn't at all vocal, just tried doing funny dances and making people smile. Then he'd tell you to have a nice night. Never outright asked for anything, and was never rude or aggressive. I gave him a couple bucks a few nights in a row and started to notice him during the day too once we became familiar. The first time I saw him after pulling in for a lunch shift, I gave him a handful of change for my coin cup in the console and told him if he fed my meter with it all day, I'd throw him some cash again after my shift. Found out then that his name was Mike. Two hours later, it's noon 30 and the crew is dashing down to feed their meters or asking whomever is going down to do it for them. I gave someone a Couple of quarters and asked them to check on mine while they were at it, just in case. They were back in five minutes reporting that my car was good, the hostess's car was good, and two other servers book ending my car were good. All of us until after two PM. Some homeless guy is feeding all the meters on this side of the block. The next day, as I was making my way around the gauntlet of one way road surrounding the building housing my restaurant, I saw Mike. He was standing in a parking space right by the bottom of the escalator leading to my work. And as soon as he saw my car, he pulled his pants leg up and did a little chorus line dance move to get my attention. He'd been standing there holding the spot for me for the past 15 minutes. Thus it began. Mike held a parking spot for me nearly every morning for the next two years. He fed my meter and the meter of any other staff I asked him to. I started keeping car cleaning stuff in my car. Windex, armor, all. And would give him towels from the restaurant to detail it up once a week. He knew what bar I hung out at and where I sat. He'd track me down when meters were about to expire or he needed a buck. Everybody at the restaurant and the bar across the street started calling him my Bum. He was my friend, though, too. His name was Mike. He just didn't live anywhere because life is more complicated for some people. But, yeah, I had a guy once. A true downtown concierge.

Made you realize he she is really, really smart. One. One time, my drunk uncle was in jail and needed bail money. And being that my dad was the only one in the family with any real savings, they all looked to him to fork up 100% of the cash. Having been asked, he realized this situation had two possible outcomes. One, pay for his bail and never get the money back. Two, not pay for the bail and the whole family blame him for it. So my dad decided to throw them a curveball. He told them that whatever the rest of the family raised for the bail, he'll not only match it, he'll offer double whatever they raised together. Nobody in the family offered even a single cent. Blame averted. 2. I knew two guys, an undergraduate, who would play mental chess. As they passed in the hall, one guy would say night to Queen 3 or whatever. The other guy would roll back his eyes for a second and then nod to acknowledge the move. Both guys then kept walking in opposite directions. Later that day, when they passed again, the second guy would declare his counter move. A game could last days. And they never forgot where any of the pieces were. Each had a mental image of the board. Sure, they might have been faking, but these guys were always first and second on the Dean's honor list. For all Four years of my undergraduate, I knew them pretty well. I think the mental chess was legit. Three. Lazy people are the best at this. I witnessed a kindergarten who couldn't draw straight lines, keep his pencil still and drag the paper around to draw a triangle. Four. Gotta plug my dad in here. Had some friends over, and just to mess around, we asked him the definition of random words in the dictionary. We opened it to the letter I and asked the definition of 10 to 12 letter three to four syllable words. Not only did he nail all of them, but most definitions were verbatim. When we got to the 10th word, he goes, the verb or the noun? And we lost our minds. It was seriously ridiculous. We were freshmen in high school and could hardly pronounce the words we picked. Turns out he read the whole dictionary over the summer when he was 16 and bored. Guy is still the smartest person I've ever met.

At my school, it wasn't fidget spinners or slime that caused chaos. It was something we accidentally invented called tension duel. It started when someone noticed that certain teachers gave out detentions more easily than others, and someone joked about ranking them like a video game. Within a week, someone designed a chart. Boss level Mr. Grayson. Detention rate 9 out of 10. Weakness pretending to cry. It blew up. Soon, laminated character sheets were passed around with teacher stats, complete with icons like Sympathy Drain, Homework Ambush, and Field Trip Shield. Everyone started creating detention avoidance builds and combo moves to survive tough classes. We developed point systems. Avoid a pop quiz plus 5. Make Mister Lunde laugh and skip the assignment. Plus 10 Trigger missus Hardy's Extra Homework Penalty minus 15. This school became a live strategy game. Students were calculating risks before asking questions or going to the bathroom. It escalated when someone created an app version with animated avatars and real time daily quests like survive algebra without getting called on. It was surprisingly effective. Kids who normally slacked off were suddenly participating just to level up their standing. The school only caught on when a group of students refused to go to the nurse because the app said she had a stealth debuff that notified teachers if you were faking. The final straw, a sophomore tried to trade detention time with another Student like, it was currency. The principal shut it down overnight. But weirdly enough, discipline incidents dropped for months afterward. Everyone was still playing, just off the grid. We might have lost the app, but the strategy stayed. And so did the best attendance the school had seen in years.

For the next six months, I texted and called the jeweler asking, hey, just tell me what amount to put and I'll mail you the check. And there was always a reason she couldn't tell me. Oh, sorry, I'm out right now. I'll find it and text you later. Her shop was a few hours away from where I live, so it wasn't feasible to stop by and handle it in person. I tried for six months, but after that, I stopped calling, texting, and just figured I got the ring for free. I wouldn't tell my spouse because I don't want her to think I took advantage of the situation or that somehow the ring isn't as meaningful because I didn't pay for it.

Going anonymous? Because you never know. Many years ago in Canada, I lived in an apartment shared with a couple of other students. Canada is cold. As students, we each had a room and a central kitchen. Heating was included in the rent. Great. We just set the kitchen heat control thermostat to 72 degrees. This was great in September, even October into November and onwards. We enjoyed the comfortable ambient temperature you would expect for a heated apartment. Sometime in late November or early December, the landlord began to complain that his heating costs were too high. He asked if we would mind setting the heat to 60 degrees while we were on campus in classes and overnight sleeping. And 70 degrees when we were there during the evening. Sure, no problem. Reasonable. We complied. In January, the landlord complained again about heating cost being too high. We thought we had been flexible enough. We were doing as reasonable measures and were paying the same rent as we had in September through November. Heat was supposed to be included in the rent. Landlord asked if we would do 50 degrees for days and 60 degrees for evenings and overnight. We declined. Not reasonable. We were paying for heat. There was a discussion and some negotiation. Then that landlord made a strategic blender. One day, he said he would be doing maintenance while we were in class. When we

One of my best friends ran our school's black market, and he dealt in handmade custom knives. You see, his dad was a blacksmith and for some reason had no problem cranking out professional knives and even swords for his son to sell in school. It was the school's biggest kept secret. Until one time after Halloween, my friend sold to a kid who was known for being mentally unstable. I remember specifically telling him not to do it, but he shrugged me off, saying the kid was paying 25% more than the knife was worth and to not sell would be bad for business. Well, two days after he sold the knife, I was sitting in English literature class, which I happened to share with the kid who had bought the knife. We were just getting started discussing the themes of some shakespearean play when the mentally unstable kid walked in. Some sort of samurai. He proceeded to unsheathe the goddamn katana and just eyeballed the teacher. Every single student instantly got back against the wall as fast as we could, and I remember someone even peed themselves in fear. We all watched as the students started inching closer to the teacher, Katana in hand, muttering something to himself. Well, as soon as there was enough of an opening between him and the classroom door, everyone made a run for it, leaving the teacher completely alone. We all scattered and started screaming around The hallways, trying to draw attention. But by the time other staff members caught wind of what was happening, it was too late. Teacher was alive, but he was missing a hand. And the student was gone. From what came out in court later is that this teacher had previously done inappropriate things. We'll call it. To that student's sister. And so as revenge, the

The teacher asked us what our mother's name was. Everyone answered but me. L never realized my mom had a name. L questioned my entire existence. I went to her straight after school.

Of course I thought that it was real and kept it and told everyone I knew about it. I realized that my mom just staged it all only 10 years later. Still amazing memories though. 7. A few years back I realized that the Christmas song I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus wasn't actually about the mother being unfaithful and putting out for Saint Nick, but it was just the dad dressed as Santa.

One. He used to masturbate in the boys bathroom. Not in a stall, out by the sink, so that he would be seen by whoever walked in. He enjoyed getting caught. This bizarre behavior started in the sixth grade and lasted until he was 16 when he stopped going to school because he was arrested. When he was 16, he shot and killed his own father. He loaded his body in the back of his truck and drove around town hoping for someone to see. When nobody admired his handiwork, he went to his aunt's house and tried to persuade her to look in the bed of his truck. He told her that he had killed a deer and she should come look. The aunt did not want to see a dead animal, so she didn't look. He drove around a bit more before someone finally saw and reported him. He was arrested and has been in prison ever since. 2 this was primary school. We would have been around 10 years old.

The school thought he tried to walk home, so they start searching everywhere, only to have him pop out of his own locker at the end of the day. 4, he would howl like a dog. He'd get in trouble daily and get under the table panting and bark and growl. One day was an extra bad episode, and we all thought it was funny, being 5 years old at the time. And after that day, we didn't see him anymore. The state took him. Turns out he was kept in cages with the dogs at his house and Learned dog behavior. Wonder whatever happened to him.

One, after we got home from partying, I ate her leftovers from Texas Roadhouse and helped her look for the box, and then blamed our Labrador retriever. Two, I scratched my wife's car on a low wall and didn't say a word. But she noticed in a supermarket car park and she went nuts, claiming the car next her had scraped it and driven off. Being the gentleman, I offered to pay to repair it. Three, I work in a hospital, so I have lots of weekdays off. I got bored one day and went to the casino since I haven't been in years. About 20 minutes in, I won $5,000 on the slots. Immediately cashed out, and I chose to pay the taxes there on the spot. Took the rest home. A few weeks later, my wife had a conference in Vegas and I tagged along so we could make a long weekend of it. The day of her conference, I bought a drink and wandered around the strip doing nothing. When she got out of the conference that afternoon, I told her I won $5,000 on the slots. Of course, she was ecstatic because work had already paid for a room at the Cosmo and she had like $100 per day in PDM. So all that cash was spent on eating at Michelin starred restaurants and going to shows for free. I've never told her I won It at the dumpy casino 20 minutes from our house. 4 I went to the cinema yesterday on my own. Told work I had to go back to wait for a tradesman as my wife had to take her dad to hospital. Not true at all. I just wanted to see the new Deadpool film.

Three years ago, I was working as a social worker when I got assigned to the worst case I'd ever seen. Two siblings, ages 6 and 8, had been locked in a basement for most of their lives by their biological parent. When we found them, they could barely speak, had never seen sunlight, and were so malnourished, they looked like skeletons. The foster system was overwhelmed, and nobody wanted to take two severely traumatized kid who screamed at every loud noise and couldn't use a bathroom properly. That's when my wife and I made the decision that changed everything. We brought them home, knowing it would be the hardest thing we'd ever do. For months, they wouldn't eat at the dinner table because they thought it was a trap. They hoarded food under their beds, in their closets, even in their shoes. Convinced we'd stop feeding them, they flinched every time we raised our voices, even to call them for dinner. The little girl, Sarah, would only sleep in the closet because open spaces terrified her. Her brother Jake hadn't spoken a single word in the three months they'd been with us. They had nightmares every single night. Sarah would wake up screaming, thinking she was back in that basement. Jake would wet the bed and then try to hide it because he expected to be beaten. Simple things like turning on lights or opening doors would send Them into panic attacks. But slowly, things started to change. Sarah began sleeping in her bed instead of the closet floor. Jake started making eye contact instead of staring at walls. They both began to trust that food would always be there, that we wouldn't hurt them, that this was their real home. Now. We thought we were making real progress. Then December came around, and I started putting up Christmas decoration. That's when I noticed both kids watching me. With your terror in their eyes, backing away from the tree like it was going to attack them. When I asked them what was wrong, Sarah whispered that the bad people used to hurt them more during the light time, because it made them cry louder, and the neighbors couldn't hear them. Over holiday music. I realized they had no idea what Christmas actually was. They'd never gotten presents, never seen Santa, never experienced the joy that every child deserves. Instead, their violators had used the season as an excuse for horrible things, telling them that nobody cared about them, while other kids got gifts, that Santa only visited good children, and they were too broken and worthless. When I gently explained what Christmas really meant, family, love, presents, and a magical man who brings joy to children, Sarah looked at me like I was telling her fairy tales. Just stared at the floor, refusing to believe anything good could happen to him. They couldn't comprehend that a holiday could Bring happiness instead of pain. On Christmas Eve, I stayed up all night setting up the most magical Christmas morning I could imagine. I left cookies half eaten, milk glasses empty, and muddy boot prints leading from the fireplace to the tree. I wrapped dozens of presents and filled their stockings until they overflowed. I even left a note from Santa saying how proud he was of them. But what happened Christmas morning broke me in the best possible way.

Everyone would laugh while I struggled to breathe, my chest tight and vision blurring like I was drowning. He'd introduce me to girls at parties by saying, this is Chris.

I stayed friends with him because I thought that's what I deserved. The worst part was how he'd escalated over the years. If I had an attack during a movie, he'd pause it and announce to everyone, Chris needs assistance. Reboot. If I panicked before a test, he tell classmates, Chris, dot X E has stopped working. At restaurants, he tell waiters I was buffering when I couldn't order. It got so bad that people started calling me error message Chris behind my back. Even strangers knew about my condition because Tyler made it his signature joke. Last month, Tyler got accepted to Columbia Law School, his absolute dream school, the one he'd been working toward obsessively since freshman year, pulling all nighters and sacrificing everything for his LSAT score. He Threw this huge Celebration party at his parents massive house and invited everyone from our friend group, plus extended family, neighbors, and most importantly, the girl he'd been trying to impress for months, Jessica. Jessica was gorgeous, brilliant, and completely out of his league. She was getting her PhD in clinical psychology and had always been genuinely kind to me about my anxiety, even offering helpful breathing techniques. Tyler had been planning to ask her out after the party, convinced that his law school acceptance would finally make him impressive enough to win her over. During his speech, Tyler started getting emotional, talking about his dead grandfather, who had wanted him to be a lawyer but passed away during Tyler's sophomore year. His voice began shaking as he described visiting his grandfather's grave that morning to tell him the news. I could see the signs immediately.

For as long as I can remember, my sister Claire has tried to compete with me. She's two years older, but whenever I achieved something, she found a way to one up me. When I got engaged, she got engaged six months later. When I bought my first house, she bought one down the street. But nothing compared to what she did when I got pregnant. My husband and I struggled for years with infertility. After two heartbreaking miscarriages and countless doctor visits, we finally got the news that we were expecting. It felt like a miracle. From the moment I saw those two pink lines, I already knew the name I wanted for my daughter. My grandmother raised me. After my dad passed and my mom checked out, she was my entire world. Her name was Evangeline. And before she passed, she used to say, if you ever have a little girl, I hope she carries my name. I told Claire the name one night when I was three months pregnant. I thought we were having a sister moment. She smiled and said it was beautiful. I should have known better. Two months later, Claire announced she was pregnant, too. She acted surprised and thrilled that our babies would grow up together. I was genuinely happy for her. Until the family baby shower she threw for herself. As I walked into the decorated venue, I saw a giant sign that nearly knocked the breath out of me. Welcome baby of Angeline. I froze. I thought it had to be a coincidence, but no. Claire got up and made a speech about how she always loved our grandmother's name and how it was perfect for her daughter. I pulled her aside after the speeches, trying to keep my voice steady. Claire, you knew I was naming my daughter of Evangeline? She smirked and shrugged. Well, I'm due first. Nothing stopping you from picking something else. I was stunned. My entire family just stood there awkwardly pretending not to take sides. My mom even whispered, it's just a name, honey. But it wasn't. It was the one promise I made to my grandmother. I went home that night and cried harder than I ever had through our infertility journey. But the longer I sat there, the more my sadness hardened into something else. Termination. If Claire wanted to play dirty, fine, but she underestimated me. I spent the next few weeks quietly gathering every piece of paperwork I needed. See, Claire hadn't actually filed any legal paperwork yet. She was calling the baby Evangeline, but hadn't registered the name officially. Meanwhile, I expedited my own legal name reservation with the state. In our state, you can pre

I still do. So going anonymous for this one. A few years ago, I started working from home. At first I worked in customer service answering calls, but eventually I was given the opportunity to help out with another department. I trained under this guy who showed me what to do, which was basically filling out the same information on various websites over and over again. It was easy, but a bit mind numbing. There were thousands of these to do, and I was just one of the people working on the pile. At first I worked hard to help clear the queue, but then my boss quit and a new person took over who was disorganized in the extreme. A few weeks into his attempt at managing the department, a major component I needed to do my job stopped working. I reported this to my boss, and to my boss's boss, and to my former boss. Basically, um, hey, I can't do my job because this program isn't working. I was basically told it was being worked on, but given nothing else to do. So day after day, I logged in and then proceeded to watch YouTube videos, play games, read books. As long as I was near my desk to respond to direct messages, which came in frequently, I was golden. Eventually, I got pretty bold and started going to bed to Take naps or just heading out to live my life while on the clock. I had the app we used for communication on my phone, so if anyone messaged me, I could respond from wherever I was and appear totally industrious. I knew I was falling into terrible habits, felt guilty, and figured it was just a matter of time before I was discovered. But this literally went on for 18 months without a single person noticing. I was doing nothing and getting paid for eight hours of work a day. Eventually, my new boss was fired or quit. At the same time, the other person working alongside me also left, and suddenly I was the only one left. I was by default in charge of the department. Realizing this, I quickly went to work to fix everything. It took several months for me to clear the queue, and I worked my butt off. The day I finally caught us up to speed, I was heralded as a hero and given a huge bonus and a new computer. I was also given two employees to train to work under me to help maintain the newly imparted order. The problem is, three employees doing the job is too many. When I evenly divided the work, we had almost nothing to do and could all finish our work in an hour. So eventually I started giving almost all the work to the other two employees and started focusing on running the department. This was literally the easiest job in the world. Every day, I would log in and assign tasks to the two employees, organize all the tables, and then basically go back to watching videos online or doing whatever I wanted with the rest of my day, while again, getting paid for eight hours. I am keeping the details pretty vague and writing this anonymously because that's what I'm still doing. I do about 10 minutes of work a day, and it's been two years. Oh, and everyone at the company thinks I'm just wonderful. I just had a job review and was given another raise.

What is the best real life example of this? You have seen one? I once was a temp at a tiny office on a construction site in around 2003. I was only there for one day while the regular person was on some training. They sat me down and told me that I just needed to copy all these numbers from one program to another. So I selected them, hit Control C and Control V. They stared at me. Turns out about 60% of this woman's time had been spent manually typing numbers from one place to another. Two. I worked in a C and C shop. There would be a pile of jobs that needed to be done for the month. Some took days to run while others were generally quick. The record for jobs done in one day was eight. What I did was look through all the jobs and organize them by setup. Meaning every job has a setup time. Can take an hour to get all the tooling together, set up the cutting table and setting the part square to the table so the machine can gauge where the part is. So when I insert the code into the machine, it can run flawlessly and drill, mill, tap whatever within a literally hair measurement for every single job. The majority Of parts use standard tooling, and I have an automatic tool that changes with 20 pockets. I figured out how to line up the jobs so they all have the same setup. Blew the record out of the water with 30 jobs done in one day, saving the company tens of thousands in work hours, all because I didn't feel like doing all the setups that day. Three. I worked a summer at a mortgage company as an underwriter assistant. My only job was printing documents and then hole punching them to put in folders. They had a super fancy Xerox printer that did my entire job for me. But the underwriters at this company didn't know how to click through printer settings to make the machine hole punch as it was being printed. I showed them how to do it, and they resisted it super hard. So I got to keep my job. But what was supposed to take me all day literally took me

One. My wife and I tried to conceive several times, and after a year we thought there was something wrong. I went down to the doctor and got told I was all good, and it really scared her. Sure enough, she went down and found out she was most likely never going to have another child. Her first was from another man, and it was a total nightmare for her. She delivered early due to umbilical cord being wrapped around my son's neck. They were trying to save both of their lives and did a fair amount of damage in there. It broke her inside, and for the next seven years, she always seemed to be on the edge of tears if she saw another baby. One day I came home from a long trip and she began talking about babies again and asked what I thought. I had dreaded this, as I knew it was a soft spot for her, so I told her I was fine with just our son. His dad was never in his life, and as far as my son knew or cared, I was his dad. I laid it on thick, saying, it's great this way. Only one kid to care for. Makes it cheaper and easier. He was already seven, so we only had 11 more years to go before we had less responsibilities. I brought out every selling point and more When I was done making an ass of myself, my wife said, too bad, asshole, I'm pregnant. For the next two weeks, I was in the doghouse and in shock, not knowing how the hell she got pregnant. When every expert said no way it was going to happen. One said we had a better chance of winning the lotto while getting struck by lightning. She gave birth to not only one, but three years later, another baby girl. And we were done. 2 when my wife and I married, we felt madly in love. Our relationship was perfect. Nothing else in the world mattered. We'd live happily ever after. Then we came home from the honeymoon and launched full speed into real life. My first big surprise. Those little idiosyncrasies you thought were so cute when you were dating. They become really annoying.

I suppose mine would technically be two things, since it was a guy walking into my E R. And saying, I'm having a problem with my left Johnson. Our triage nurse made him repeat himself twice. And seriously, Kudos to her for keeping a straight face, because she followed protocol and got him seated in the waiting room. It was a busy night, and he didn't seem to be in excruciating pain, so it was a while before I got to him, which meant there was plenty of time for rumors to fly about him. I think everyone on my shift asked me at some point if I had heard about the guy here with two, uh, cylinders. We were mostly joking at that point. People come to the ER all the time with no knowledge of their bodies and how they're supposed to work. So the general consensus was that he actually meant his left testicle, not his left main guy. Since testicle problems are one of the most common injuries we see, I was prepared to be disappointed and just see a guy who'd been hit in the balls. Finally, it was his turn at bat, so to speak, and I got him into a cubicle, snapped my gloves on, and told him to lower his pants. And then this man showed me his two Johnsons and what two Johnsons they were. He had a condition called diphalia. Where there's a split in half as it's developing in the womb and you end up with two. It's very rare, maybe one in every few million people. And most people who have it don't have two identifiable fully formed ones. They'll have a regular one and a tiny one if they're lucky, and two tiny ones if they're not. But not this guy. This guy had two identical, rather large manhoods just hanging out next to each other like hot dogs in a package. This totally average looking guy was just walking around with 18 inches of Schlong in his pants. I really, really hope I stayed professional. I swear I tried, but I know I said wow. The funny thing was he seemed surprised that I was surprised. Between that and how he checked into the ER, it's like he thought all the rest of us were walking around with twins, too. I'm not sure how much medical care he'd received in the past. Most people with diphalia have one of them removed at birth, but clearly this guy's parents had chosen to let both of his live long and prosper. Now, what was the problem with his left one that brought him to the ER, you might ask? He said he'd been doing the deed the night before and only one of them had functioned as usual. He was used to them performing in tandem like trained seals. I had so, so many questions. I wanted to Ask. But unfortunately all I could really tell him was that I had no idea why that would happen. It was probably not an emergency. And write him a referral to a urologist. I don't think a day has gone by that I haven't thought about this man and wondered how he and his two pals are doing. He said on his intake form that he was bisexual. I hope he's thriving.

When my son was in elementary school, he was beaten up by two older students to the point he required hospital care. Since the two boys were going into high school next year and it was the last day of school, both the principal and superintendent said there was nothing they could do. I called the police and had them charged. One officer went to the hospital and saw my son, and two more took the boys away in handcuffs. At the school. When the case went to court, I told my son to be honest and don't guess. The boys had been in trouble before. So the parents hired a good criminal lawyer. My son was on the stand for over an hour being grilled by the lawyer, and the judge was getting fed up. The lawyer asked my son how he knew who was kicking him. Basically, he said I was being kicked by a DOC Martin shoe, which was on a foot, which was on a leg, which was on a body, and his head was on it. I could see the judge shaking in silent laughter and the stenographer laughing in her dictaphone. The courtroom was silent with muffled laughter. The lawyer also stood away from my son and holding his ear, said he had bad hearing and to speak up. My son was very nervous and scared, showing it by speaking very quietly. Finally, my son turned to the judge and said, could he ask a question? The judge said, sure. My son said, in which ear is he hard of hearing? Because he is going back and forth between both ears. Same muffled laughter. The judge glared at my son and said, if his hearing is that bad, he will be ending his questioning with a wink to my son. He told me later. Apparently this went on with all the other witnesses and the case was dismissed. From all the conflicting statements, this lawyer must have cost the parents a bundle. The police officer in charge of the case visited us about a month later to see how my son was doing. He also said that he was impressed with my son in court and gave him his card all our children make us proud.

One. My son was in the fourth grade when his science teacher called, furious that he had been disrespectful in class. I asked her what had happened. She said, I was teaching the students the difference between mammals and fish. I told them that sharks are mammals and whales are fish. He interrupted me and told me I had made a mistake. I, of course, told him I was right and he said, who gave you a diploma? I told her I would talk to my son about his rudeness. I then called the principal and made an appointment to see him and the teacher together. In the meeting, I asked her to repeat her story and she did, still insisting that whales were fish and sharks were mammals. The principal just shook his head and said, and I hired her. I did talk to my son about being polite to everyone, even if they are wrong. 2. My son was in fourth grade. He came home with a math paper that was marked F. I read through the problems and realised the answers were all correct. I called the teacher and he said that my son needed to show his work on the paper. I replied, he didn't show his work because these problems are easy and he did them all in his head. I told him that if he wanted to take off some points, For not explaining that was one thing, but an F was completely unacceptable in the course of the conversation. The teacher said son needs to recognize that two plus two does not always equal four. I almost choked on my drink spitting out em. I think it does always equal 4. The teacher went on a long rant about how he was an engineer who quit to teach math and that I probably couldn't understand something so complex, but that he could write some computer modeling that would show that 2 + 2 did not always equal 4. I took a deep breath, thought thank you for mansplaining, and said, interestingly enough, my career is one of a system engineer. I spend my days creating and running computer models. I can assure you that if you input the same data each time, you will get the same result. I. E. 2 + 2 will always compute to 4. It's only if you change the input data that you will get a different result. Of course, then that will be a new algorithm and not the original 2 + 2. At that point I knew 4th grade math was going to be a lost cause for my gifted and talented 10 year old and told him to complete the work accurately and don't worry about the grade 3. We had just moved back to Wisconsin from living abroad. I was called by my second grade son's teacher at his new school To inform me that he wouldn't stop lying about living on a fictional island called Saipan, we came in to pick him up from school. The teacher pulled down a scroll map and showed us that he was pointing to an empty spot in the middle of the ocean called Saipan. We had the pleasure of informing her that her map was wrong and that indeed there is an island exactly where he indicated called Saipan, where we had just relocated from. Awkward, to say the least. 4. My daughter was in the third grade and came home with a math assignment having to do with exponents. Now I am not a math person. The job belongs to her dad, who is a chemical engineer. I did notice, however, that she appeared to have confused the term cubed as being to the fourth power instead of the third. When I pointed this out, she insisted vehemently that her teacher had taught her cubed was to the fourth power the very day. So though my head was exploding, I could see that there was no point in arguing with her. It was time to hand this educational debacle over to the chemical engineer. My husband also did his best to convince our darling daughter of the fact that cubed is indeed to the third power, but to no avail. At this point she was very upset and tearfully said, daddy, if I do it the way you say, I will get It wrong, and I don't want to get it wrong, her father assured her.

What do you mean, you did? And I can tell you. Listen, I can tell you whatever details you want to know. I'm guessing he hasn't said anything about this to you. No, he hasn't said anything about this. Not a damn thing. Now, who are you again? Who are you? Are you a friend? Do you work with him? We went to school together back in the day. What? You went to school with him? Listen, I'm just gonna tell you the story right now, okay? Yeah, you. Yeah, yeah. I need for you to tell me right now. That's what you're gonna do. You gotta tell me right now. Okay. Okay. So we were teasing each other, and, you know, it was just kind of like playful, innocent flirting, like it wasn't a big deal. And, you know, I'm the one that brought up the fact that we should get married. Get married? I know, I know. It was crazy. We hadn't even kissed at that point. You never kissed, and you're bringing Up marriage. I am so confused. What is this? He was confused, too. That's why when I brought up the marriage, he said Ew, and he ran away, so I chased him. What the hell are you talking about? I chased him, and I made him kiss me. You sound like you're 5 years old. No, we were older. It was fourth grade, Garden View Elementary. What? I was 7, maybe 8 years old. Eight years old? You acting like this happened yesterday. Why would you phrase it like that? In the beginning? This a 20 years ago you're talking? No, I'm just apologizing. I mean, he's a married man, and I'm dealing with a lot of guilt. Guilt? For some you did when you were seven. I know, I know, I know. You probably hate me. I hate myself. I hate you. I think you're insane. Oh, god. See, that's. Some may call it crazy, but I call it my healing journey. Oh, good Lord. I'm supposed to reach out to the partners of my exes and apologize for the stress or grief that I've caused them? It's not your ex when you're seven years old. Nobody's an ex that seven years old 20 years later. That's not what my book says. Well, you can take your book, and I'm gonna tell you where you can completely shove it. Oh, wow. Okay. I, uh. I have about 400 other women to call after this. 400? Yeah. What is going on? I'm just calling for your forgiveness. Of course I forgive you. This happened in elementary school. I didn't even know him. Of course we weren't married. We were at 7. Is that. Is that it? Is that what you need? Lady, I need one more thing. What? What does you mean? As part of the healing journey, it has to end back where it began. What? What are you talking about? Means I need to kiss your husband one more time. Are you crazy? Finish the cycle.

Hi. Can I speak with Kevin, please? Yeah, that's me. Hey, Kevin, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, like the, the radio show? Yeah, exactly like it. It is it, as a matter of fact. Okay. How are you doing? Uh, I'm, I'm doing all right. Well, thank you for listening. Yeah, I. I mean, I don't, like, listen, listen. I'm sort of just aware you're there. That's what I prefer. I prefer people who just kind of know we exist but don't actually know the show. I take back my compliment. Yeah. So, Kevin, seeing as you don't listen a lot, or maybe you have never listened before in your life, do you know what a second date update is? Um, no, not really. Okay, well, it's a segment we do on our show where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back afterwards, they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and find out what went wrong. So somebody emailed us about you. Oh, who? Her name is Lindsay. You served her some coconut shrimp and then just sort of disappeared on her? Um, I don't know if I'd characterize it that way, but, yeah, I, I, I kind of know her. Kind of know her. Okay, that was kind of a happy laugh. Uh, what's that? I mean, you sound positive about Lindsay. Oh, No, I, um. I didn't think that she was that into me, given how we last interacted. What. What do you mean? Well, I mean, we. We. We met at this party that I was working, right? And we were friendly and chatty, and I thought, you know, there's a possibility that something will happen. And then, you know, she invited me to this party at her house, which I thought was a good time. And she said it was like a. Not like a full dinner party, but there's gonna be some food and friends. But it didn't really turn out that way. Really? She told us the opposite. She said that she thought you had a good time and was concerned that maybe one of her friends, like, scared you off. Oh, no, I had no problem with her friends. It was the way she ran the thing that sort of kicked me off. What she do? Yeah. She actually made you mad? For a little bit. She asked if I would, like, go by the grocery store and pick up a couple of things on my way over, which, you know, it's fine, I suppose. It's a pot luck kind of thing. Um, such. So I, you know, I go to the grocery store, I get to her house, and she and a friend are still, like, decorating and putting the place together, and she shows me to the kitchen and says, all right, you know, sort Of get started, I'll, you know what, be in and, you know, check on you. What? Oh, wait a minute. She made it sound like she invited you over early so that you guys could have some one on one time before the party. Yeah. Not so that you could do her work. Yeah, there was not a whole lot of one on one time aside from her coming in and like, tasting the things that I was trying and making suggestions on how to fix it. Like, you know, a little more red pepper, a little less salt, things like that. So it's one on one time with you and a stove, making food for her friends? For the most part, yeah. And then she criticized what you were making a little bit. A little bit. Okay. So did you ask her about that? Did you go, hey, maybe you wanna join me in here and help me cook? I didn't get that far, cause then people, like the rest of the guests started showing up and they all brought, like, pre made stuff. So while I'm the only one in the kitchen making the hot stuff, and, you know, as soon as it's ready, like, you know, I. I finish a plate of tomato caprese or whatever, like, they come in and hustle the plate out of the room to the party, and I'm left there with empty counters and more things on the stove. So Shut up. I felt like I was. I was working the party. I wasn't participating in it. I mean, did at any point, did you just think, like, I must have misunderstood what she wanted from me and she actually is gonna pay me for this? I mean, that's the only thing that I could think of. Given that we met at a catering event, she must have thought that, you know, that's. That's what I do, you know? Did she pay you for your services? No. No, that's the thing. Yeah. She didn't even, like, reimburse me or anything for the groceries she asked me to pick up on the way over. Really? She didn't reimburse you? All right, well, yeah, I went to a party and worked it and paid for it and ended up losing money on it. All right, well, I think we need to be Bill collectors here and try to get your money at least, Kevin, because she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. What are you talking about? I mean, Lindsay's listening. Lindsay, you there? Uh, yeah, hi, I'm here. Oh, Lindsay, you dog. Um. Oh, okay. What's happening right now? I'm really sorry, Kevin. I did not mean to give you the impression that I hired you to cook for my party. Um, it's kind of hard for me to draw another conclusion, given that what I did that night was

I was 15, hiding in the bathroom stall during lunch again. It was the only place the bullies wouldn't follow. The cold tile floor had become weirdly comfortable over the past semester. I'd spend entire lunch periods there, back against the wall, knees pulled up so nobody could see my feet under the stall door. That morning started like any other. Woke up dreading school. Skipped breakfast because my stomach was in knots. Missed the bus on purpose so I wouldn't have to sit alone while everyone stared. Dad didn't notice anything was wrong when he dropped me off. He never did. First period, someone had written X yourself on my desk. Second period, my English essay was passed around and laughed at. By third period, I'd already had my backpack dumped in the hallway twice. Nobody helped. Teachers saw it happen and just looked away. One even side, like I was the problem. Lunch was when it got really bad. The cafeteria was just one big stage for humiliation. Last week, they poured milk over my head. The week before, they'd stolen my phone and posted photos pretending to be me. The comments were still coming in. So for the past month, I've been collecting pills. One from Mom's medicine cabinet, two from Grandma's purse when she visited. A handful from the medicine drawer at home. Last night, I wrote four notes. One for mom, one for dad, one for my Little sister Emma. And one that just said, it's not anyone's fault. I'm just tired. That last one was for whoever found me. I folded the notes neatly and put them in my wallet. Picked out the perfect song for my last moments. Something quiet and sad that I've been listening to on repeat for weeks. I'd memorized every word. This morning, I hugged Emma extra tight before she got on her bus. She looked confused, but hugged me back. I almost broke down right there. She was the only one who'd really miss me. But she was only 8. She'd forget eventually. I took the Altoids tin out during homeroom and counted the pills one more time. 23. Internet said that was enough. When lunch period started, I went straight to the bathroom in the west wing. Nobody used it because it was far from the cafeteria. I locked myself in the last all, the one against the wall. Took out my water bottle, set my phone on the toilet paper holder. Positioned my headphones just right. Then I opened the Altoids tin and poured the pills into my palm. My hands were shaking, but I felt calm somehow. Like I was finally taking control. I put on my headphones to listen to one last song. That's when Mister Ray knocked on the stall. So

Every Friday night when I was 9, my mom would drop me at Uncle Pete's house while she worked her late shift at the hospital. Uncle Pete wasn't really my uncle, just my mom's friend from high school who lived in our neighborhood with his three cats in a house that always smelled like cinnamon, air freshener and microwave popcorn. I loved going to Uncle Pete's because he let me stay up late watching movies. The other kids at school talked about, movies my mom said were not appropriate and would give me nightmares for weeks. I never got nightmares at Uncle Pete's house. I was too excited about being treated like a grown up. Our little secret, Uncle Pete would say, handing me a bowl of ice cream bigger than my head with extra chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Your mom works so hard, and she's just trying to protect you. But you're mature for your age. I can tell you can handle it. I'd sit cross legged on his living room floor, eyes glued to the screen, while people got shot, stabbed, or chased by monsters with bloody teeth. The living room would be dark except for the glow of the TV, making everything feel more intense. Sometimes there were scenes where people were kissing and taking their clothes off. That made me feel weird and squirmy. But Uncle Pete would Just laugh. Cover your eyes if you want, he'd say. But he never fast forwarded through those parts like my friend's parents did during sleepovers. Instead, he'd watch me watching the screen with this little smile. I didn't understand back then. When particularly scary scenes came on, I'd hide my face in a pillow while Uncle Pete took pictures with his fancy camera. Your face is priceless, he'd tell me. I'm making a scrapbook of movie night reactions. Someday, when you're older, we'll look back at these and laugh at how scared you were. I was secretly proud that he thought I could handle these grown up movies. When other kids at school talked about Freddy Krueger or the Exorcist, I could casually mention I'd seen them, too. It made me feel special and older than my age. Sometimes Uncle Pete would invite his friend Gary over. They'd sit on the couch behind me, talking quietly and laughing at things I didn't understand. Gary always brought me candy that my mom never bought. Those sour worms that made your tongue hurt. But in a good way. She's so into it. I once heard Gary whisper to Uncle Pete during a movie, you were right. One Friday night, my mom picked me up earlier than usual because the hospital was short staffed and she got to leave early. Uncle Pete didn't hear her knock because the movie was so loud. A scene where a teenage girl was running through the woods, From a man with a mask and a chainsaw. She used her spare key and walked in during a scene with the girl screaming while the masked man stood over her. I'll never forget my mom's face when she saw what was on the TV. Her eyes got really big and her mouth made this tight line. She didn't yell like I expected. She just grabbed my hand very calmly, told Uncle Pete we won't be coming back, and walked me to the car in silence. Next day she sat me down at our kitchen table and asked exactly what movies we'd watched and if Uncle Pete ever acted strange around me. I didn't understand why she was so upset about some movies when she was the one who left me there every week. He said, you know I'm mature for my age, I told her, defensively, picking at a loose thread on my sleeve. He takes pictures for his scrapbook when I get scared. And sometimes his friend Gary comes over and brings me candy. My mom's hands started shaking so bad she spilled her coffee. She called her sister, who came over right away. They

Oh, my god. I was just about to do the same thing. Our phones were switched. I know. I hate this stupid school. They are the only ones who take our phones for assemblies. It's so annoying. Anyways, when can we meet? Uh, about that. What? My family and I were going on a road trip right after school, and we already left. We are an hour away, and trust me, I can't make them mad by asking to go back. You're lying. What the hell am I going to do with your phone for however long you are gone? I'm gone for the weekend. What? I can't wait three days. I have things to do. You know, sorry, Adam, but I don't know what to say. You're going to have to wait. Wait. How do you know who I am? Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I heard of you, at least. But how did you know it was my phone? When you texted me, I clicked on the notification and it showed your messages. Your last text was from your mom. So we are going through each other's messages now? No, no, it wasn't like that. I didn't mean to. Ha ha. I know. I'm just playing with you. So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice. Unless you wanna drive six hours to meet us at our first stop, be my guest. Yeah, I don't know about all that. Anyways, let's make this interesting. How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes. Hey, I have a question. Are you still dating Emma? Emma? How do you know about her? Everyone was talking about you guys and how great of a couple you were. Oh, well thankfully that's no longer. Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Cause now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Oh. Anyone in mind? Uh, I don't know. I guess you could say I have a little crush. Really? Who? Ha ha. You aren't gonna find out that easy. Oh, my god, you are really going to make me wait? Well, you are making me wait 3 days for my phone, so I think you can wait as well. Okay, maybe you're right. Ha ha. It's getting kind of late. I think I'm gonna head to bed. Okay. Good night, Adam. Good night, Lily. Good morning, Lily. I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh, yeah. Ha ha. I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Ha ha. I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud One. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm six hours out. Oh, my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. Ah, I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. I was gonna complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Ha, ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Oh. Okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

You know, she'll be like, oh, my god, turn it off! The dog's about to die. But five minutes later, she'll be like, so anyway, he kept the heads in the closet and the neighbors heard noises. They'll cry if a golden retriever gets a paper cut, but somehow have zero problems listening to real 9 1 1 calls from 2,003 at 2:00am with captions while excitedly smiling. And if you ask them why, they'll hit you with, nah, because it's psychological. It's like how the brain works. No, no, no, he ate people. This is not therapy. And the scariest part? They'll finish the entire series, shut the TV off, look you dead in the eyes and go, anyway, I think I want a lavender oat milk latte. I'm sorry, I'm not ready for that. You were just watching a man dismember humans while folding laundry, but somehow you can't handle a fictional dog death?

My dad cheated on my mom with my stepmom, and my parents ultimately got divorced, which was really hard on our family. My mom ended up moving back to her home country in Europe, while my twin sister and I had to stay with our dad. I, seventeen f, live with my dad, my stepmom, and my younger brothers. Last year in September, my twin sister and I had a volleyball game at school. My dad was usually the one who picked us up from our games and practices, but he was out of town that night, so our stepmom had to come pick us up. She arrived an hour late because she took a nap and completely forgot about us. As soon as we got in the car, she started going on a rant about how we disturbed her nap. Long story short, she ran a stop sign at an intersection and we got into a horrible accident. I was hospitalized for weeks while my twin sister passed away. That night, I lost my best friend, who I shared everything within a single night. My sister knew exactly how I felt about everything because we experienced life together. We came into this world together, but now it's just me, and I constantly feel like a zombie walking through life. I'm not going to end my life, but I often consider it because Living is unbearable without my sister. After the accident, I stopped eating dinner with the rest of my family because it feels wrong eating without my sister at the table. So I eat alone in my room. But last night, my dad insisted I eat with the two of them downstairs. Dinner started off normally until my stepmom announced to my little brothers and I that she was pregnant. My brothers were really happy and asked for the gender of the baby, to which my stepmom excitedly told them that it was a girl. My brothers kept talking about how excited they were about getting a younger sister. When my stepmom mentioned how they could help decorate her nursery, I looked up and asked her which room she'd be using. She then excitedly exclaimed that she was going to use my twin sister's room. She mentioned how she already started removing things from her room in the morning and began putting them in the attic. I asked her why she didn't bother telling me before she went ahead and started moving my sister's stuff because it was a big deal to me. Aside from me, no one else has been in her room since her passing, and sometimes when I miss her, I sit in her room or fall asleep in her bed to feel closer to her. My stepmom got really defensive and told me that I needed to accept that she was having a baby and needed the Empty room. I told her that I understood, but a heads up would have been nice. She looked at me and said that she didn't need to tell me anything because she was the mother of the household. She said she was doing what was best for the interest of her baby and she didn't need my negativity. I stayed silent, trying to tune her out, but I snapped when she mentioned how I'd be getting a new sister who I can build an even stronger relationship with, and that I needed to move on because nothing would bring my twin sister back. I knew I was getting angry, so I excused myself and left the table. I continued walking away until my stepmom said, I don't understand what her problem is. She couldn't even bother to be happy about my pregnancy, but she's angry about me moving things out of an unoccupied bedroom. I turned around and stared at her in disbelief.

One. As a kindergarten, I once fell asleep in the bus. When I woke up, the bus was in the garage and I had to yell to get someone to get me out. So to this day, every bus driver in my school district needs to walk to the back of the bus and check every seat before they park the bus. Seems like a good rule to have. Two. My older brother got a curfew enforced at Boy Scout camp when one of the leaders noticed him walking around the area in the daytime with his eyes closed, counting steps. He may have just been practicing being blind, but the adults assumed he was figuring out how to get around at night without light so he could get into some kind of mischief. Which, knowing my brother, was also possible. Three. Minor one, but when I was in elementary school, we had one of those bridge building challenges using toothpicks and hot glue. My partner and I realised if we just coated the entire thing with a thick ass layer of hot glue, it would make our bridge strong as hell. So we used like, a full pack of hot glue sticks, like 20 of them. It was more glue than toothpicks. So after that, they limited the number of glue sticks you could use. Four. In history class in high school, there was about 10 of us. Really close. Friends. We would take every opportunity to make your mom jokes. A couple months into class, the teacher made us sign a treaty promising to stop making fun of each other's moms. We signed it and started making fun of each other's dads. Five. My junior high made a rule against yoyos in class after I tried to do a trick and my yoyo flew across the room and broke a glass speaker set. I'm sorry, guys. 6 in middle school, I would use sharpies to tattoo myself. Other kids thought it was cool, so I started charging $1 per drawing wherever they wanted. Principal found out, and after I wouldn't stop, she put a ban on sharpies for the entire school. Even the teachers couldn't bring them in. I'm a tattoo artist now. 7 my elementary school was located in the center of the neighborhood, and my fifth grade class was the first to get outdoor trailers for classrooms. We'd ask for bathroom passes and then walk home. Next year, they built a fence around the school.

She's a mysterious and unpredictable creature. Half private investigator, half emotional Siren. She looks soft and harmless until you forget something insignificant. Then she transforms into a storm, ready to list every mistake you've made since 2,018. Her memory is sharper than a search engine. Can't remember what you said three weeks ago. Don't worry, she does. She steals all your comfy clothes and somehow claims them as hers. And forget about enjoying your food. Whatever's on your plate becomes five star cuisine the moment she sees it. She never asks directly, but expects everything. And the worst part? You do everything because she has you wrapped around her perfectly manicured little finger. She can switch from cuddly to chaos in 30 seconds, and no one knows why, not even her. But you still apologize because resisting her not worth the risk. And when she's mad, you can try gifts, dances, even a full magic show. She won't budge. But the second she decides, everything's fine, guess what? Everything's fine. Still, despite the chaos, she's the only creature who can make your whole day with just one look. At least until the next emotional earthquake. Subscribe and send this video to your girlfriend.

One that birds don't live in nests. Nests are just where they keep their eggs. Birds just sleep in trees. 2. My grandson just figured out I am his mother's mother. He just can't understand why I tell him we have to ask his mum to do some things. Why can't I just tell his mum we are going to do something? I am her mom, therefore her boss. 3. Growing up, my grandparents religiously had a three PM Pepsi time. Like tea time I guess, but with Pepsi. Every time we were over there it happened. We all enjoyed a crisp, fizzy, cold Pepsi. At 43 years old, I was telling that story this week when I suddenly realised theirs were most likely spiked. 4. Soft drinks are called soft drinks because they don't contain alcohol. Hard drinks do. Five. When getting an eye exam, you are asked which looks better, one or two. If they are identical or too close to call, you have a third option the same. They never told me that. 6. Eminem calls himself Eminem because his name is Marshall Mathers. 7. That they call it footage because film is measured in feet. 8. About 10 years ago I got a Logitech Wave keyboard and mouse. I love them and use them until they wore out. Recently I bought a new wave set. The new set was almost the same, but the scroll wheel on the mouse Spun freely instead of clicking. This made scrolling through websites easier, but was hard for precise tasks like switching weapons in games. I've been using it for a month. Today I discovered the button below the scroll wheel changes it from Free Spin to clicking. I didn't know this and it made my day.

One. When I was a little kid, my mom told me that if I pulled the fire alarm, it would spray ink on me so that the fire department would know who pulled it. That kept me from ever pulling it as a prank. Fast forward to when I am 26. I was in grad school and happened to be around when someone was doing a fire safety drill. They asked if I wanted to pull the handle. I promptly replied that I had on a new shirt I didn't want to get ink on. They looked at me like I had three heads. After learning the truth, we all had a good laugh in the end. Called my parents immediately after to share the story. They were dying laughing. 2. Melon isn't supposed to be spicy. I am allergic. 3. This little piggy went to market means that little pig got sold off for meat. I just thought she was doing her shopping. 4. Puffer fish inflate with water, not air. 5. Gargling with warm water and salt actually does help soothe a sore throat and it wasn't just my mom pushing a placebo on me. 5. Not me, but I recently found out that my 32 year old husband has been going around telling people that his wife is a really big fascist. Come to find out he's thought since childhood that Was a term for someone who is into fashion. 6 I am a non native English speaker and for 25 years I thought awful was more positive than awesome. Like a combination of awesome and beautiful. This is your wife, and she's pregnant. Whoa, that's so awful, man. 7 the house my grandparents lived in had a decorative G above the garage. I was 20 when I realized it represented their last name and was not G for grandma like I had thought since I was a little girl.

Your name is not on the list, he said coldly. I saw my wife and daughter watching and laughing from a distance, but I said nothing and left. The next day they came to me in tears, begging for help for a reason I never could have expected. The guard checked the list again, but simply shook his head expressionlessly. I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave. Just then I turned toward distant laughter. There stood my wife and daughter. My wife wore a pure white Chanel suit with a Cartier necklace gleaming at her throat. My daughter was in a Vera Wang white wedding gown, a diamond tiara adorning her hair. She held the latest iPhone in her hand, pointing the camera in my direction. She was probably live streaming on social media. Comments flooded the screen with heart emojis floating up. Messages like best drama ever and serves dad right danced across the screen. My wife and daughter wore triumphant smiles. Surrounding guests watched me with confused expressions. Some looked away apologetically. In that moment, I understood everything. This was no coincidence. It was all planned. The missing invitation, my wife's words, everything had been preparation for the scene. I quietly turned on my heel, walking back through the lobby. I felt concerned glances from acquaintances, but kept walking straight ahead. Dr. Johnson tried to call out to me, but I just returned a Smile without stopping when retrieving my car from valet parking, the young staff member showed an apologetic expression. His earlier bright smile had vanished. Take care. I nodded slightly at his words and got into my car. The Plaza Hotel's imposing figure in my rearview mirror gradually grew smaller under the cloudless blue sky. I drove in silence. New York skyline of high rises felt colder than usual. My phone screen kept lighting up with notifications from my daughter's social media live stream. It seemed thousands were watching simultaneously. I turned off all notifications and put the phone in my bag. Then, with a deep sigh, I headed home through Manhattan's bustle. On social media, a storm was already raging. The hashtag Walker family scandal quickly became trending, with angry comments pouring in from my daughter's live stream viewers. The video had been shared with the Boston fiance's family, and the Harrisons were furious. Pharmaceutical industry VIPs invited to the wedding were also raising protest one after another.

So I'm in freshman year of high school, and the other day we were having a class all about relationships, consent, that kind of stuff. One of the questions which was asked by the teacher was boys in the class, hands up if looks matter to you in finding a partner. Literally every single guy put their hand up with mine. Damn near going through the roof with how strongly I agreed with that statement. Catch me ever mingling with a Beluga? Anyway, the teacher went on to ask the same question, but this time catered towards the girls. She said, girls, put your hand up if looks matter to you in finding a partner. And out of the 14 girls in that class, only one was honest enough to put their hand up. The teacher seemed pleased at this discovery and started to go into a speech about girls being less superficial. But this was when I felt a divine duty calling my name. I interrupted, saying, I believe every single one of them is lying. All the girls looked at me and a conversation erupted with me being called misogynistic from every direction. When the class calmed down, the teacher told the girls to hear me out. I went on to explain that looks do indeed matter to them. All at Least the guys are willing to admit it. The girls were not willing to admit it because they did not want to look like a holes. I then said, I can prove my theory right here and right now. Everyone looked kind of confused at me, and so I shouted, Jessica, you see Roger over there? If Roger could make you laugh like no one else and treated you like a princess, had every personality trait you dreamed of, and even more, would you date him? For context, Roger was one ugly dude. He had an underbite which made his jaw stick out. He had a larger than life nose, an unbelievably large and square head, acne riddling him from top to bottom, and overall, just had the facial structure of a deformed alpaca. He also rocked the bowl cut. Well, when I asked this, Jess began to stumble on her words and couldn't answer me. Thank you. See? I yelled, before moving on to my next victim. Veronica, would you date Roger? She shook her head silently. And so, one by one, I went around the entire class asking every girl if she would date Roger. The teacher tried to get me to stop and calm down, telling me I had proved my point. But I didn't stop until I had asked every single girl. And so Roger was rejected 14 times, and he never even asked anyone out.

Too late. What happened? Just weeks before my wife's birthday, I was caught cheating with a 20 something year old laundromat lady. I told her it's because I fell out of love, but honestly, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but her face used to be so smooth. Now she has lines that make her look older than she is. And there's this constant frown that makes it look like she's mad all the time. After our divorce, I never heard from her. And my best friend lived two hours away, so things were rough. By this point, I had a really busy career, a new pregnant wife, and two stepkids. So when work sent me to a networking party right in his hometown, I was pretty excited. Until all eight of my calls went unanswered. In hindsight, I should have noticed that his almost year long silence was well worth questioning. But anyway, the party was definitely a success. And just as I was getting ready to leave, guess who I saw? My best friend. By this point I was pretty tipsy, so I gave him a big hug and he looked super surprised before weekly hugging me back. I told him I tried calling so we could hang out. That's when he broke the news. I just got back from my honeymoon, so I was trying not to be on my phone. I still didn't See what would come next. I spit out a rush of questions like, who is she? Where is she? What's her name? Where'd you meet her? How long have y'all been together? He looked down at his feet before answering with two words. It's Emily. I still remember the feeling in my stomach when I realized he wasn't kidding, and I immediately wanted to unalive myself. Before I could say anything. Told me I didn't get to have an opinion about it because I had treated her like poop and ended up choosing a cleaning lady over her. Apparently, he didn't do anything wrong since he asked her out two years after the divorce. I spent the rest of the weekend drinking alone, trying to process what I just heard. It was the first time I questioned whether our divorce was the right decision. But ultimately, my. My ex wife was older now and probably even less attractive. So I figured it would be wrong to be with someone that I didn't even like to look at. Regardless, the betrayal hit hard. So when I returned home,

Everyone warned us about teenage adoptions being impossible. When we met Jake at 15, he'd been in the system for eight years and had this reputation for running away from every placement within weeks. The case worker pulled us aside before our first meeting. This kid's been through 12 homes, she said. He's smart, but he's got walls built so high you'll need a ladder just to see over them. Jake sat there during our meeting, hoodie pulled up, earbuds in, completely checked out. When I asked about his interests, he just shrugged. When my husband mentioned we had a spare room he could decorate however he wanted, Jake actually laughed. Not a happy laugh. You'll change your mind, he said. The first words he'd spoken. They always do. We brought him home on a Tuesday. The first few days were awkward, but not terrible. Jake would emerge from his room for meals, answer direct questions with one word responses, and disappear again. He reminded me of a feral cat we'd once tried to help. Always ready to run. By Friday morning, his room was empty. I found a note on his pillow that just said, thanks, but this won't work either. Don't take it personally. My husband wanted to call the case worker immediately. Maybe we're not cut out for this, he said, pacing around Jake's abandoned room. Maybe everyone was right about teenage adoptions. But something bothered me. Jake had Only taken his clothes and phone charger, but left behind the speed up composition notebook I'd seen him writing in constantly. He carried it everywhere, protective of it like it contained state secrets. Against my better judgment, I opened it. I expected angry rants about foster families or maybe song lyrics. Instead it was full of detailed observations about every family he lived with, written like some kind of scientific study. Day 3 with the Johnsons. Dad yelled at mom about leaving dishes in the sink. He apologized later, but she didn't talk to him for two hours. They'll probably divorce within two years. Day 7 with the Peterson's. They keep asking if I'm settling in okay, but what they really mean is are you going to steal anything or burn the house down? Mom hides her jewelry box when I'm around. Day 12 with the Rodriguez. They fight about money every night after they think I'm asleep. Foster care stipend isn't enough to cover what they thought it would. I'll be gone by the end of the month. Skipping score. Documenting every family's dysfunction like he was gathering evidence that no one actually wanted him. The entries got more cynical as they went on, like he was building a case against hope itself. The last entry was about us, dated three days ago. Day 3 with the Millers. They seem happy, but give it time. Nobody actually wants a broken 15 year old with trust issues. Mom keeps trying To make conversation. And dad bought me expensive headphones. Like that'll make me stay. They'll realize I'm too much work soon enough. Close the notebook and felt my heart break a little. This kid wasn't running because he was bad. He was running because he was convinced everyone would eventually give up on him anyway. I drove to every place a runaway teenager might go. Bus station, public library, McDonald's, the mall. Nothing. Finally, at 2:00am, I tried the 24 hour diner downtown. There he was, in a corner booth, that same notebook open in front of him, writing by the light of his phone. I slid into the seat across from him. He looked up, genuinely shocked. How did you find me? Lucky guess, I said, signalling the waitress for coffee. So what's your prediction about us? What's going in the notebook tonight? His face went red. You read it? Yeah, I did. And you know what? Your observations about people are scary accurate. You picked up on things about those families.

My mother has always believed every room exists for her grand entrance. And I don't mean that in the cute, she lights up a room kind of way. I mean it like, if there was a funeral, she'd show up in sequence. My sister got her master's degree. Mom spent the entire graduation dinner talking about how she made it all possible by giving birth to her. It started small, almost dismissible. At my eighth birthday party, she blew out my candles because this smoke was getting in her eyes. By high school, she turned every parent teacher conference into a performance review of her parenting skills, while my grades sat ignored on the desk. When my brother James got into med school, she threw a party for herself with a cake that said, proud mother of a future doctor. James wasn't even in half the photos. We Learned to work around her like she was bad weather. My sister started having two parties. James stopped sharing good news until after it happened. And I just went quiet. We thought we had her figured out until James met Sarah, this sweet kindergarten teacher who somehow saw the best in everyone, even my mother. They dated for seven years while mom tried everything to break them up because Sarah wasn't good enough for her baby boy. She crashed their date nights, claiming emergencies and told Sarah's Parents that James was exploring his options when they got engaged. She wore black to the announcement dinner, telling everyone she was in mourning for her son's freedom. And then she pulled her biggest stunt yet. The wedding. James had begged her to behave and bought her a beautiful navy blue dress the morning of the ceremony. She agreed to wear it, and we all felt so relieved. But we should have known better. I was helping James with his cuff links when I heard gasps from the corridor. And then I saw her. My mother, floating down the hallway in a full white wedding dress with a train, a veil, the works. Hers was more elaborate than Sarah's. Simple, elegant choice. She bought it in secret, hidden it at her sister's house, and had been planning this moment for months. James went pale as he processed what was happening. Seven years of Sarah's patience, thousands of deposits, 200 guests waiting, and our mother had turned it into her show. She brushed past us, adjusting her veil with practiced nonchalance. Oh, this old thing. I just thought it would be nice to feel included. That's when it clicked. Watching my brother's shoulders slump as he texted Sarah not to come out yet, I realized I could either let her ruin this day or make her the center of attention in a way she'd never forget. I grabbed the largest glass of red wine I could find from the reception setup. And asked the bartender to fill it to the brim. Then I made my approach through the crowd of whispering relatives, calculating the angle like I was lining up a pool shot. She was holding court near the altar, surrounded by horrified aunts, spitting some story about how traditions are meant to be challenged. I walked up, turned to gesture at something behind her, and executed the most perfectly choreographed accident of my life. The wine hit her dress like abstract art, a massive crimson splash across the pristine white that spread fast through the fabric. The veil turned pink. Train looked like a crime scene. I dropped to my knees immediately, groveling and sobbing about my clumsiness. Oh, god, mom, I'm so sorry. Your beautiful dress. I even produced actual

Our principal, Mister Walsh, had this power trip thing where he'd confiscate phones and make you pay $25 to get them back. He called it a responsibility fee, but everyone knew it was just illegal theft. The worst part was that you keep phones for weeks if you couldn't pay. And parents rarely fought it because they figure the school knew what they were doing. This quiet kid, Danny, was in my lunch period when it happened again. He was texting his mom about picking him up early for a dentist appointment when Walsh swooped right behind him with his usual grin. Walsh forcefully grabbed Danny's iPhone and started his usual power speech. Mister Peterson, you know the policy. Phones are a distraction from learning. You can retrieve this on Friday for the standard fee, or we can call your parents to discuss your inability to follow simple rules. Danny just sat there, calm as anything, and said, okay, but you should probably know that phone is worth one two hundred dollars. It's the new iPhone 17 Pro Max my dad got me for making honor roll. Walsh actually laughed. Like, threw his head back and everything. Nice try, kid. I've heard every sob story. Pay the $25 or wait until Friday like everyone else. Danny shrugged. Alright. Can I at least get a receipt for the confiscation? You know, something that shows you took my property. And when I can Expect it back. We don't do receipts for disciplinary actions. Interesting. Danny pulled. Pulled out a completely different phone from his backpack. This kid had two phones. He dialed 9 1 1 right there in the cafeteria while Walsh watched. Hi, I'd like to report a theft in progress. Someone just stole my 1 200 dollar phone. Refuses to give me any documentation and is demanding money for its return.

His name was Dylan, and from day one, he positioned himself as the school's biggest victim. Every week, Dylan had A new story about someone being mean to him. Kids were stealing his lunch money, destroying his homework, spreading rumors about him online. Teachers loved him because he seemed like a sweet, quiet kid who just couldn't catch a break. He'd show up to class with the sad stories about how the popular kids were making his life miserable. Dylan got special treatment everywhere. Teachers let him eat lunch in their classrooms to avoid the bullies. He got extensions on assignments because he was too stressed from harassment to focus. The Biden's counselor even started A whole anti bullying campaign because she felt so bad for him. But here's what was weird. No one knew who was actually bullying Dylan. Every time A teacher would investigate his claims, the evidence would mysteriously disappear. The kids he accused would have perfect alibis. Security cameras would be broken or positioned wrong. This went on for two years. Dylan built this whole reputation as the school's most persecuted student. The truth started coming out completely by accident. This kid, Jake, in my chemistry class, had been struggling with anxiety and depression. He'd started missing A lot of school and seemed really withdrawn. When he finally came back after A week long absence, he looked terrible. During lab, Jake's hands were shaking. So bad, he could barely hold his test tubes. Our teacher pulled him aside and asked if everything was okay. Jake broke down crying and said he'd been getting these horrible anonymous messages for months. Someone was at the counselor involved, and they started investigating Jake's phone and social media accounts. They found hundreds of messages from different fake accounts, all targeting Jake with the same writing style and specific details that only someone at our school would know. The IT department got involved and started facing IP addresses. Every single threatening message came from the same computer. One of the library computers that students could use during lunch. Security pulled the footage from the library cameras. And guess who was sitting at that exact computer during the times

When my daughter was three years old, instead of teaching her the word look, I taught her the word behold. And so from that day on, every time she wanted to show me something, she'd tug my arm and say, daddy, daddy, behold. My wife and I thought it was extremely funny and innocent. And it was. Until it wasn't. Fast forward a few weeks. My daughter and I were grocery shopping, and as I was picking out some apples, my daughter started tugging my arm. Daddy, daddy, behold the vegetable. She then pointed at a man in a wheelchair 20 feet away. My. My jaw dropped and I started laughing my head off. I knew I shouldn't laugh, but hearing my four year old daughter say that combination of words sent me into hysterics. Well, the man turned his head directly at me. He saw me laughing my butt off, all while my daughter was pointing straight at him. He gave me a dirty look and rolled away. And when he did, I felt so embarrassed. I turned to my daughter, who was very confused about what was so funny, and I told her she couldn't point at disabled people or call them that word. What's a disabled person? He innocently asked me. Don't play dumb with me, Missy. I responded, no, I'm serious, daddy. I was a little taken aback. Well, a person in a Wheelchair is called a disabled person, and the word vegetable should never be used when talking about them. Got it? She nodded. Okay, daddy, but I didn't mean behold the disabled person. I mean behold the vegetables. She then pointed in the same direction she did previously, but now, with the man gone, it was obvious that the whole time she had been pointing at the vegetable aisle.

Three days after my 14th birthday, a man broke into our house to steal some things. I was home with my eight year old sister. He didn't know we were in the house, so I grabbed a cordless phone, took my sister down to the basement, and hit her in the bathtub. I dialed 9 1 1 on the phone and told her to tell the operator what was happening. I then unlocked the gun safe and took out my dad's short shotgun, the kind with two pistol grips. I loaded it and went back to the bathroom. My sister laid down flat on the floor on the tub and talked with a 9 1 1 operator. We lived in a remote area, so I didn't know how long it would take for the sheriffs to arrive. I remembered a conversation with my dad where he said, in a life or death situation, any indication of aggression is enough. Protect yourself. The bathroom was locked when the intruder got down to the basement. He eventually tried to get into the bathroom. I said, please leave us alone. I called 9 1 1. I'm scared and I have a gun. The man said, are there any pills in there? To which I replied, no. Then he said, I don't believe you, and kicked the door in. I pulled the trigger, which laid me on my back because I A scrawny 100 pound kid had loaded a 12 gauge pistol grip, short barrel shotgun with a Buckshot shell. It also blew out my eardrums. So imagine the next moments without being able to hear anything. If you're concerned about my sister's ears, the 9 1 1 operator had told her to cover them tightly when she overheard my exchange with a man. I got up and the man was in two pieces. Everything smelled like metal and fireworks. Kind of like when you're deer hunting and accidentally got. Shoot them. The shotgun had cut him in half. His legs were against the wall opposite the door. There were

Sir, this is a Wendy's moment. I once had a woman come through the drive through and try to order macaroni and cheese. I politely informed her we did not have that. She insisted we did. I told her we definitely didn't. She got angry and yelled at, yes, we did. I told her, ma'am, I've been working here three years. We have never had macaroni and cheese. It's not something we serve. Would you like to order something else? She says, yes, you effing do. I can see it on the menu board. It's right there, right in front of me on the menu. I tell her, I'm really not sure what she's looking at, but we don't have Mac and cheese. And if it really does say Mac and cheese on our menu board, then that means someone vandalized it. She says, no, it's definitely part of the menu board, and it's real, and we do have it. And she isn't leaving until she gets her Mac and cheese cue. Quite literally 10 minutes of this back and forth, all while she's holding up the drive through line. I finally got the manager to come over and deal with it after asking him for the 15th time, because they don't pay me nearly enough to deal with that for that long. The woman absolutely refuses to accept that we don't have Mac and cheese. She also refuses to order anything else. And Won't move her car until we give her the Mac and cheese that we don't have. We have a line of cars wrapped around the building now and everyone is pissed. It's been half an hour and the line has not moved. The manager tells her if she doesn't leave he's gonna have to call the cops. She screamed. She can't understand why we're doing all this and why we won't just serve her Mac and cheese when she can clearly see it on our menu board right in front of her. So we do have it, and why are we lying to her? My curiosity and exasperation finally got the better of me. So against my better judgment, I exit the building, walk along the outside to the drive through order screen where this woman's car is. I tell her to please show me on the menu where it says the words macaroni and cheese anywhere. She points and confidently says, right there, with all the conviction of someone who is absolutely sure they just prove some big dumb idiot wrong and that they will be hailed as a hero. I look where she's pointing. I see it. I sigh heavily as a bit more of my soul dies. I compose myself and say as politely as I possibly can, ma'am, that is a picture of the orange slices that come with the kids meal. We do not serve Mac and cheese. Please drive away before the police get Here she looks confused, looks at the menu board again. The realization dawns on her and she drives off without a word. I go back inside and scream in the walk in freezer for 10 minutes and quit that job.

I wrote an answer that was so bad they had to modify the textbook. Took a class on Greek history my senior year in college because my roommate said the professor was cool and the class was easy. Well, cool and easy. A relative, my roommate, was a classics major and knew Greek history inside and out. He was also a genius, so everything was easy. We had our first test that covered everything we Learned so far, like chapters one through eight in the textbook, or so I thought. It was also on the intro to the textbook, even though we never reviewed or discussed it in class. Apparently, the professor emphasized this in the class before the test, but I wasn't there. I stay up all night cramming for the test and feel great as I'm taking it the next day. Until I get to the last essay question, which was worth 25% of the grade, and said something like, according to the textbook intro, there were five reasons why scholars debate whether Crete was one of the locations in the Odyssey. Name one and explain it. Crap. This never came up in class or in the rest of the textbook. So I rack my brain for something even remotely coherent and remember an episode of jeopardy! About when Crete was supposedly discovered or something. So make up some nonsense about how because the Odyssey was Written around 800 BC, but Crete wasn't discovered until later. Then it couldn't be Crete. Thought I might get points for writing more than 100 words, but fully expected to max out at a C the following week. The professor is giving out the graded tests. He's making a bit of a show of it, commenting on how the class did overall and calling out a few people that really whiffed in a kind of funny, not too harsh way, but still pretty embarrassing. And he's given out everyone's but mine. And then we have Mr. Davidson. Mr. Davidson didn't show up to the last class before the test, and apparently didn't talk to anyone that did. How do I know this? Because his answer to the last essay wasn't even close to anything that was in the book. The whole class is looking at me. My roommate is trying to contain his laughter. A girl I was into was giving me a sad, pitiful, must suck to be you face. I'm beat red at this point. However, after rereading it a few times, I was curious, so I handed it to the chair of the department and asked him to read it. He laughed because the answer was just, well, dumb, but then started to scratch his head. You see, while Mr. Davidson didn't do the assigned reading, he has identified a sixth and perhaps better answer than what was in the book. So reluctantly, I'm giving him full credit. And we reached out to the author and suggested he include an update in the next edition. Next time, though, Mr. Davidson, please just do the reading. It was great. The best part was that my roommate missed something minor and wound up losing a few points. So I pulled a better Mark.

You no longer are in one. I broke up with someone I was dating for over two years because of a grilled cheese sandwich. She had an insanely complicated relationship with food, but it wasn't because of weight or anything. She grew up poor and so did I, and when she became an adult, she got a job and only ate, quote unquote good food. I, however, didn't care at all about food and just ate whatever. She took cooking classes, shopped at expensive grocery stores, and had a fully decked out kitchen. She insisted on cooking and it would take her forever to make anything anyways. I was coming off of a 12+ hour shift for the fifth day in a row and I just wanted to eat something because I hadn't eaten all day. So on my way to her place, I picked up some Wonder Bread and some Kraft Singles. I got to her place and started making a grilled cheese sandwich. She objected, said she would make something real to eat. I wasn't interested. I finished making the sandwich and I went to quickly use the bathroom. When I came back, she threw my food out and was looking for something in the fridge to make. I was so mad, I just grabbed my coat and said, fuck this, I'm out of here.

Because that's gay. I overheard my girlfriend ask her sister if she thought I was a twink because she was noticing strange things about me. She said that I belonged in the kitchen from the way I was acting, that I was baking, cleaning more, and I was talking to my lady friends more. When I heard her say this, I felt so betrayed because I was so ready to marry her. The weird thing was that her father thought the same thing. He even hated me because according to him, I dressed and walked like a girl all the time. He straight up told my girlfriend behind my back if she enjoyed eating me out because I didn't have anything that was gonna make him a grandbaby. I was only able to get into good graces with him because I recently started making my own almond milk. He's been loving it because Lactaid milk is too expensive. He's lactose intolerant, and apparently I'm a girl. But me making almond milk is literally what settled our differences. After that, I got super into growing my own produce and using my machine to make our own milk. We've literally saved over 600 bucks a year just for me making us milk at home. But apparently, to my girlfriend, doing that was girly and gay. I was like, isn't that, I don't know, sexist? She was like, I'm Literally a girl. It takes one to know one. I was getting pretty annoyed with her, but it didn't faze me much. I could tell she was starting to actually get annoyed with me though. She started asking me for more opinions on her clothes, and whenever I criticize what she wore like she asked, she'd always say something like fine, you wear it. Then she'd do that, grab my butt more, and would put makeup on me in my sleep. At this point I started accusing her of being lesbian for wanting me to be a girl so badly. That must have gotten annoyed at that because then she stopped sleeping with me completely. She became so distant with me after that and it left me super lonely since I didn't have any friends. So I started posting more about my homemade oat milk and almond milk and all of my boys were super supportive of me, even asked me to put them on because they wanted the Neutra machine I was using for their own places with their girls. Even my girlfriend's friends started to hit me up. They asked me to make milk with them so they could try it. So I made them their own batches and gave them to my girlfriend so she could give it to them. I did. She threw my milk right back in my face. She got mad at me for talking to her friends and accused me of cheating because She was upset with me. I was like, so what is it? You're mad at me because I'm apparently gay, and now because I'm cheating on you with girls? Girl, make up your mind. Then she was like, that exact sassy behavior proves my point. Then our argument erupted, and she went to my kitchen, took my Neutra machine, and smashed it. At this point, I left. I went to my homeboy's place and crashed on his couch. I couldn't believe I was gay just because I liked being in the kitchen and using my Neutra machine. Girls don't have to put up with that. Only guys. At this point, a mouth is a mouth, right

I forgot my wallet while standing in line at the cafe. I ordered and realized my wallet was missing, so I said I'll just zip out to my car and pay when I get back. I was parked right outside. This guy behind me says he'll pay for my drink and I tried insisting I would pay, but he pulled out cash and paid before I could really do anything. I said thank you and chatted while waiting for my drink. I was on my way somewhere, so as I'm leaving he leaves too and asks if he can have my number. I was honest and said I was on my way to see my boyfriend. This guy just snaps, grabs my coffee, throws it across the street, and tells me I'm leading him on and I'm a bitch. And then he storms off. I just went to my car, got my wallet, and bought my own coffee. The owner saw the whole thing and told me he's now banned from the cafe. Apparently he'd done similar things with other women and this was the last straw.

If either of you ever cheats on someone, don't expect me to stand by you. That kind of betrayal goes against everything I've taught you. Sarah was a junior, attractive, intelligent, and somehow she chose me. We hit it off right away, having similar musical tastes and spending hours debating everything and nothing. Everyone adored her. She even paid for family dinners. And dad treated her like the daughter he never had. Then there was Marcus. Marcus and Sarah started hanging out when I wasn't around. At first it seemed innocent. They got along wonderfully. And Marcus would help her with her college application since he'd recently graduated. Or they'd talk about music, since both played guitar. The way my brother and girlfriend got along seemed nice. At the time. I was so naive. Looking back now, I can see all the signs I missed. I even boasted to my friends about how blessed I was to have a partner who fits so perfectly into my family. I didn't notice how their conversations would stop when I entered the room. Or how Sarah would smile just a bit too much when Marcus came home. But when you're 15 and in love, you don't look for betrayal in the people you trust most. Even when it's right in front of your face. One Tuesday afternoon in October changed all that. That day stands out because Coach Stevens had a family. Emergency. So track practice was canceled due to an unusually warm fall day. I thought I'd surprise Sarah with some unplanned plans. Instead, I got the surprise of my life. Sometimes I wonder if things would be different if practice hadn't been canceled. If I hadn't come home at precisely the wrong moment.

I was questioned by multiple people multiple times, and the pressure of it all cause I kind of lost it. He asked the question, I looked across the table at her, and she told her dad to stop it. Her dad smiles and jokingly says that he'd really like to hear my response, and her uncle also said he'd like to know. I looked at my date and said, can I talk to you alone for a minute? To which her dad laughs loudly and then says I made him nervous. So everybody is laughing now and I guess it was a big joke. Then I said to my date, hey, can I talk to you alone for a minute? I stood up in place kind of. It was one of those long bench seats and I couldn't push it back cause other people were sitting on it. Then her sister says, oh, there are no secrets in this family. Speak your mind! People then laugh again and everybody starts making jokes about not having secrets. And this man who married into the family somehow tells me that he remembers being in my place and he says, let me give you some Advice the best thing to do right now is speak your mind and be honest. Then others join in and echo his sentiment. All jokingly, I think. Dot. So I looked at my date, and she says something like, you can tell me anything here. We're all family. She also, I think, was joking.

My daughter went to private school. In elementary school, there was one teacher whom every student wanted to have for first grade. She was an extremely excellent teacher. Well, one year, this teacher asked for a raise because she had been at the school for five years and she was a very popular teacher among students and teachers alike. The head of the school turned down her request, and as a result, she left the school to work in the public school system. Well, as wonderful as she was in the private school, she was equally popular in the public school. She cared about each and every student in her class. One particular female student truly adored this teacher and decided to bring her a present every day. This present was a pretty White Rock. The teacher put the rocks, one next to the other, around the perimeter of her desk. Pretty soon, the teacher had to make a second row of these pretty rocks. But they were pretty and she wanted to honour the students. So there they sat on her desk. One day, the school invited the local police to visit with the students in their classrooms. Just a basic, hi, we are your friends. If you ever need help, don't be afraid to ask a police officer, because we are here to help you. Then they allowed the students to ask questions. After 10 minutes of Answering questions, it was time for the students to go outside for recess. Once the students were outside, one of the policemen pulled the teacher aside and asked her about her rock collection. The teacher innocently replied, they are pretty, aren't they? One of my students brings me one every day for a gift. The policeman said, um, ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to point out who this child is, and I will have to confiscate all your rocks. The teacher looked at him, perplexed about what the problem might be, so the policeman explained that those pretty white rocks were crack cocaine.

She ripped apart my dresser drawers, throwing clothes everywhere. My dad appeared in the doorway, took one look at the chaos, and immediate at least sided with her. No questions asked, no evidence needed. She grabbed my phone and smashed it against the wall. The screen shattered into pieces. Dad yanked me out of bed and dragged me to the kitchen, where she was already on the phone with military boarding schools. I could hear her describing me as a troubled thief who needed immediate removal. I ran upstairs and started shoving clothes into my backpack. She followed me, screaming that I was proving her point. Dad blocked the doorway, saying I wasn't going anywhere until the school van arrived in the morning. That's when I remembered the $800 in birth, a money I'd hidden inside my old teddy bear. I ripped it open, grabbed the cash, and told them both exactly what I thought of them. Stepmom lunged at me, trying to grab the money. I shoved past dad and bolted down the stairs. She was chasing me, yelling about calling the police for theft of my own birthday money. I sprinted out the front door and heard Dad's car starting behind me. The headlights lit up the street. As I cut through backyards, jump fences, Missus Henderson's dog started barking, which woke up half the neighborhood. I made it to The main road and flagged down a taxi. The drive. Ever look suspicious when a kid with a backpack and cash wanted to go to the bus station at 3 a m? I lied and said my parents were getting divorced and I was moving to my aunt's. At the station, I bought a ticket to Portland, where my aunt lived, three states away. The bus didn't leave until 6 a m, so I hid in the bathroom stall, watching through the crack for my dad's car. Security kept walking past, asking if I was okay. When the bus finally arrived, I was the first one on. Halfway through the trip, my seatmate showed me a news article on her phone about a missing teenager from my hometown. There was my school photo with the headline, family fears teen was abducted. I pulled my hood up and pretended to sleep while she read the article out loud to other passengers. They were all talking about how worried my poor parents must be be. 12 hours later, I was standing on my aunt's porch, ringing the doorbell. No answer. I sat down to wait and pulled out the spare key she'd shown me years ago, hidden under the fake rock. The neighbors across the street were staring at me through their window. Twenty minutes later, a police car pulled up. The neighbor had called thinking I

I forgot to grab my towel, so I just walked out of the bathroom. Anyway, my husband's blind, so he can't see anything. But usually he's always telling me to dry my hair. Today, though, he didn't say a word. His face even turned red, like he was embarrassed. David was leaning back against the headboard. I was thinking maybe he was thirsty. In just a few minutes, I noticed him swallowing a few times. David's always a little distant with me. He doesn't want to bother me, so even when he needs something, he never asks. With that in mind, I decided to go downstairs and get him a cup of warm milk. But by the time I came back up, David had already gone into the bathroom. I put the milk on the nightstand by his side of the bed and grabbed his slippers, heading towards the bathroom. I waited outside for a while, but there was no sound coming from inside. I couldn't help but ask. You need any help? I forgot my towel. Could you? David hesitated. Of course. You can always ask me for anything. Don't forget we're married. Honestly, I felt a little down. It seemed like the only time David ever asked for my help was when he had no other choice. It made me feel like I wasn't doing a good job taking care of him. I searched around, but couldn't find his towel anywhere. Maybe the maid took It and didn't put it back, so I had to grab the pink towel I just used myself. I knocked on the bathroom door. I couldn't find your towel, I said, a bit discouraged, since I couldn't really help. If you don't mind, you can use mine, I added. I mean, it's just the one I dried off with, so it might still be a little damp. There was no response from inside. Maybe he didn't like the idea. I just wiped off some water after my shower, so it should be pretty clean, I explained, trying to make it sound reasonable. Still nothing. Well, I'll go downstairs and check the closet again. Maybe there's a brand new one. Then David's voice came from inside, quiet but clear. I want yours. What? I asked, confused. Your towel. Thank you. Suddenly a hand with sharp knuckles appeared from the crack in the door. The back of his hand had veins that popped out a bit, and I could see the muscle definition in his forearm. With water dripping down. It was pretty distracting. I quickly shoved the towel into his hand, not daring to look too closely. In the three years we've been married, he's never let me touch him. A few times, after I had a few drinks, I tried to jump into his arms, but I always woke up the next morning alone, wrapped up in blankets. I figured he must not like me. Maybe he only married me Out of necessity. I also heard that he's always had a crush on someone else. So I guess that's why he's always kept himself distant. The bathroom door opened. David came out with his bare torso wrapped in my pink towel. Even though he's blind, he still takes care of his body. His muscles were so well defined, they showed even under the towel. Why didn't you let me get your clothes? He asked, smiling shyly. That's the David I know. Suddenly the towel around his waist slipped. I froze for a second, then quickly turned away and shut my eyes. It was shocking. David's voice sounded a little hurt from behind me. Mira, I didn't mean to. I moved toward the bathroom, trying to comfort him. I'm just going to wash up. Take your time getting dressed. Don't worry, I won't peek. Splashed cold water on my face. I quietly tiptoed over to the laundry basket to grab my underwear, but it wasn't there. I clearly remembered tossing it in. I started searching through everything, layer by layer. David must have heard me opening drawers. Mira, what are you looking for? I'm looking for the new face cream I bought. I forgot where I put it. It's in the second drawer on the left, replied giving me the exact location. At the same time, I opened the bottom drawer on the right. There I found my underwear, and underneath it, David's grey towel.

But for the first 15 years of my life, I was introduced to the world as someone I wasn't. When I was six, I tried calling my mother mom at the grocery store. She bent down to my level and whispered sharply, you don't call me that in public. I'm Auntie Megan, remember? I nodded, confused, and went back to pushing the little cart she gave me to stay distracted. Whenever we went anywhere, it was always the same Megan, my actual mother, would introduce me as her niece. This is my sister's daughter, Fallon, she'd say, with a bright practice smile. I had to smile, too. That was part of the routine. She never talked about my dad. When I asked, she would change the subject or pretend she didn't hear me. Once in third grade, I pushed harder. She snapped, said it was complicated and that I shouldn't bring it up again. We lived alone in a two bedroom rental in a small town. It was just the two of us, but she never let me put up family photos at school. My about me poster in second grade had to say I lived with my aunt. When the teacher asked why, I just shrugged. Extended family events were rare. When they did happen, I had to go with Megan's older sister, Claire. Claire would pick me up, brush my hair, and make me call her mom around everyone. I didn't like it. Her hugs were Stiff. And she never remembered my birthday. Claire acted like I belonged to her at church, school meetings, even a dentist appointment. Once I had to sit next to Claire while she signed in as my mother. All my school records had her last name on them. Megan handled the paperwork in secret and said it was just easier this way. When I was 14, my school counselor called me in after a group presentation where I talked about my aunt. She asked why I never mentioned my parents. I got nervous, then defensive, and eventually just shut down the conversation. She didn't push, but she watched me differently after that. One night, I was digging through a drawer looking for a flashlight. I found a small envelope with my name written in cursive. Inside was a folded piece of paper. My birth certificate. It listed my full name, my birth date, and Megan is my mother. The space for father was blank. I waited until the weekend to bring it up. Megan looked at me for a long time, then said it was a legal mix up from when she was very young. She didn't explain further. That was the end of the conversation. After that, things changed. I stopped calling Claire mom. I stopped calling Megan Auntie. I didn't say anything else, but I started to pull away. Megan didn't force the names again, but she became stricter about my online presence. She deleted my Facebook account when I used her last name. When college application season came, everything became a mess. All my records were under Claire's name, and every form had to go through her. Megan acted like it was normal. She filled things out like it was her right. I wanted to scream, but I kept quiet. The confirmation came in the most unexpected way. Megan's mother, my grandmother, was in the hospital for a short stay while I visited. She looked at me and said Megan was just a

When I turned 8, my parents threw me this huge party. All my friends came. We had a bouncy house, pizza, the works. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. But right as we were about to cut my Ninja Turtles cake, my mom pulled me aside with this panicked look. Honey, we need to tell everyone to go home right now. Daddy is very sick and needs to go to the hospital. I was devastated. My friends left confused, some crying because they thought someone was dying. The bouncy house guy packed up, while I sat there in my party hat, watching my perfect day crumble. Dad spent three days in the hospital for what they said was a severe stomach infection. I felt so guilty for being upset about my ruined party when he was suffering. But this became a pattern. Every single birthday for the next 10 years, some crisis would strike right before or during my Celebration. When I turned 9, my mom got food poisoning an hour before my sleepover. When I turned 10, my grandma fell down the stairs during my bowling party. 11 was my dad's appendix acting up. 12 was our car breaking down on the way to the amusement park. By 13, I started having panic attacks before my birthday. I'd wake up wondering what disaster would ruin it this time. My friends stopped expecting invitations. Some parents whispered that our Family was cursed or unlucky. I began asking for quiet celebrations instead. Just cake at home, please. But even then, something always went wrong. The power would go out, someone would get injured. There was always something. When I turned 16, I didn't even want a party. I just wanted to go to dinner with my parents. But halfway through appetizers, my mom clutched her chest. I think I'm having heart palpitations. I started telling people I hated birthdays. Friends thought I was being dramatic. Just bad luck, they'd say. By 17, I was seeing a therapist for what I thought was birthday anxiety disorder. She kept asking about my family dynamics, but I defended them. They can't help that emergencies happen. When I. I turned 18, I didn't even tell them it was my birthday. I was planning to just let it pass quietly, maybe treat myself to coffee later. But that afternoon, I came home early from school and overheard my parents on the phone with my aunt. Yeah, we're free for dinner tonight. My mom was saying. Cheerful

There was this kid at my school named Reggie who always got stuck with the worst group projects. He was quiet, pretty heavy, and got super nervous talking in front of people. But what really sucked was that teachers always put him with the kids who didn't want to do any work. This one semester in our American history class, Missus Patterson assigned this huge project about the Civil War worth, like, 30% of our grade. And guess who got stuck together? Reggie and these three kids. Ashley, Connor, and Blake, who literally never did anything in class except scroll TikTok. I sat behind them, so I heard everything the first day they met. Ashley goes, okay, Reggie, you're, like, really good at this stuff, so you can just handle it. Connor laughed and added, yeah, we'll help present or whatever. Blake didn't even look up from his phone. Reggie tried to speak up, but guys, it's supposed to be a group thing. We each need to do a section. Ashley rolled her eyes so hard, I thought they fall out. Look, we all know you're gonna end up doing it anyway. Save us the trouble. They started calling him try hard Reggie behind his back. I'd hear them in the hallways making jokes about how he probably stayed up all night color coding his notes, which, knowing Reggie, he probably did every week for three weeks. Reggie would ask them to meet Up every week, they'd have some excuse. Ashley had cheer practice. Connor had to work at his dad's shop. Blake was just straight up like, nah, I'm good. So Reggie did everything. Ate all the slides, wrote the entire script, even edited this whole video presentation with music and everything. I know because he stayed after school every day working on it in the computer lab. The night before it was due, I saw him in there at, like, 7 p m, still working. His mom came to pick him up, and she looked worried. Honey, where's your group? She asked. Reggie just shrugged and said, they're busy. Presentation day comes around, missus Patterson calls their group up first. Ashley, Connor, and Blake walk up there, all confident they own the place. Reggie followed behind, carrying his laptop and looking nervous as always. They start presenting, and honestly, it was really good. Reggie had done an amazing job. But here's where it gets messed up. When Missus Patterson asked who did what? Ashley jumps in first, I handled all the research on the battles. Connor goes, yeah, and I wrote most of the script. Blake nods along. I did the video editing. Then Missus Patterson looks at Reggie. And what was your contribution? Before Reggie could answer, Ashley cuts him off. He helped with some of the formatting. Some of the formatting? I wanted to scream, Missus Patterson wrote down their contributions and gave them all A's. Reggie got The same grade. But you could see on his face that something inside him had broken. The next day, Reggie walked into class carrying this thick Manila folder. He went straight to Missus Patterson's desk and said, can I talk to you after class? During lunch, I saw him in her classroom through the window.

I've always noticed how everyone gets super tense whenever Aunt Alana is mentioned or shows up at family gatherings. She's my dad's older sister, and there's like this unspoken rule that we don't talk about certain things around her or ask her certain questions. Growing up, I just thought maybe she was super sensitive or had depression or something, but the way everyone acts is way too strange for it to be just that. Whenever she visits, which is rare, maybe once every two to three years, my parents start acting so weird. Like a week before my mom deep cleaned the entire house, rearranges furniture, and hides certain family photos, my dad gets all quiet and starts drinking more than usual, and they both give me and my brother this weird lecture about being respectful and not bringing up the past, even though they never explain what past we're not supposed to bring up. The last time she visited before this weekend was at my cousin Edwin's graduation party three years ago. Everyone was having a good time until Uncle Rowland made some joke about how Edwin's girlfriend looked like someone from the family and the entire room went silent. My Aunt Alana just got up and left without saying anything. No one went after her. No one explained why that comment was so bad. Everyone just pretended nothing happened and kept eating cake. The mood Was completely ruined. So fast forward to this weekend. My parents were hosting a birthday dinner for my cousin Amber. She's 25, and somehow Aunt Alana agreed to come, which was already surprising because she usually skips these things. My mom spent three days cleaning and rearranging stuff. She even took down the family portrait from our living room wall, which was super weird because that photo has been there since I was like, 12. When Aunt Alana arrived, I swear the temperature in the room dropped like 10 degrees. Everyone was being polite, but so awkward. My dad kept refilling her wine glass like he was trying to get her drunk or something. And my mom kept starting random conversations whenever there was even a second of silence. My brother, he's 19, kept giving me these looks across the table like, WTF is happening? Because the tension was unbearable. Then during dessert, Amber started talking about how she's been using one of those DNA ancestry websites to make a family tree for her anthropology class. The moment she mentioned this, my dad literally choked on his drink, and my mom dropped a spoon so loudly, I jumped. Aunt Alana just sat there with this weird smile that didn't reach her eyes at all. Amber kept going, completely oblivious to the tension, about how she found some interesting patterns in our family history, how she wanted to interview everyone for her project. When she asked Aunt Alana if she'd be Willing to talk about the family history from her perspective, my Uncle William practically shouted about needing more ice for the drinks and dragged Amber to the kitchen. I was so confused and honestly kind of angry at this point because I felt like I was the only one not in on some huge family secret. So after dinner, when everyone was in the living room, I decided to follow Antilana when she went outside for some air. She was standing on our back porch just staring at the stars, and I awkwardly asked if she was enjoying the party. She gave me this look that was so sad, it actually made my stomach hurt. she asked me if I'd ever felt like I didn't belong in my own family. Before I could answer, she said something about how blood isn't always thicker than water and how some secrets should stay buried. I was about to ask her what she meant when my dad came running outside looking panicked. He tried to act casual, but I could tell he was freaking out that I was alone with auntelena. He made some excuse about my mom needing help with the coffee and practically dragged me back inside. Later that night, after everyone left, I confronted my parents. I told them I was tired of being treated like a child and demanded to know what the big deal was with Aunt Alana. They tried to change the subject at first, but I wouldn't let it go. I said I was going to ask her directly next time if they wouldn't tell me. That's when my mom started crying

My stepson killed one of his bullies in high school. He has a cleft palate, and it's a pretty bad one. All his life, he's been bullied for it. His mother and I have done everything we could to stop the bullying, but it never ceased. We contacted administrators, moved, switched schools, tried everything. Eventually, we decided on an online homeschooling program. Unfortunately, one of his bullies from his last school knew where we lived. He'd come by and taught my stepson regularly. My wife and I were never around because the kid would come while we were working. One day, after my son tried ignoring his previous taunting, the bully figured it must have been a good idea to break in and find him. He threw a brick through our back window, which was in the guest bedroom, and proceeded to attempt to enter. Now, I partially bumble myself for what happened next. My son never knew his real father. And so since I've come in, I've done everything in my power to fill in, and we grew pretty close. I ended up trusting him enough to tell him where I kept my gun. Seeing as how his mother and I work so often, I wanted him to be able to protect himself if anything were to happen, if we were gone. So he grabs my gun, opens the door to where the bully was, and shot Him in the chest twice. He died before the ambulance reached the scene. My son was never charged for anything, as there was obvious evidence of a forced entry. And the neighbors claim that the bully repeatedly said he was gonna kill my son when he got inside. This happened almost 10 years ago, when my son was 15. He's been to so many different psychologists and therapists since then. Something in him changed that day. Like he blamed himself for years. He tried to isolate himself from the world. He became a heavy alcoholic and even attempted to kill himself. He blames himself for taking another human's life, even though he knows his was in danger. Seeing what happened to my boy, it's heartbreaking. I sold the gun, never got another one. To this day, he still has that look of grief and guilt in his eyes. I'm starting to believe no amount of tears will ever wash it away.

We need you to come immediately. Her voice trembled. Lily's refusing to speak to anyone. My heart stopped. Lily, my bubbly seven year old who never stopped talking, refusing to speak. The same girl who gave a presentation on butterflies to strangers at the park last weekend. I dropped everything and broke every speed limit driving to her school. The halls were eerily quiet, my heels echoing against the colorful tile floors lined with student artwork. Lily's butterfly drawing stared back at me from the star student wall. I found my daughter curled into herself in the corner chair, knees pulled tight against her chest. Her eyes were vacant, unfocused. Her yellow dress, her favorite, was wrinkled and dirty at the hem. The sparkly butterfly clip I'd fastened in her hair that morning was gone. Lily bean! I whispered, kneeling beside her. When I touched her shoulder, she flinched like my fingers were made of fire. I'd never seen her like this. Not when she fell off her bike and needed stitches. Not when our dog died. What happened? I demanded, turning to the counselor, fighting to keep panic from overtaking me. She shifted uncomfortably. We're not sure. She was fine at recess, then her teacher sent her to music class. When Mister Roberts brought her back, she was like this. The principal joined us, his tie slightly askew. Children sometimes have emotional episodes. He said, not meeting my eyes. Perhaps something upset her with her friends. I took Lily home that night. She wouldn't eat dinner, wouldn't talk. Just clutched her favorite stuffed rabbit with the missing ear. While helping her change into pajamas, I noticed dark purple bruises encircling her wrists like macabre bracelets. My stomach lurched. Baby, who did this to you? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Her tiny voice finally broke through. So quiet I had to lean close. Mr. Roberts said, it's our secret game. If I tell, something bad will happen to you and daddy. My blood turned to ice. Mr. Roberts, the beloved music teacher who'd been with the school for five years. The one parents fought to have their children placed with because he made special time for talented students. I called the police that night with a child psychologist. Help! The interview revealed everything. For months, Roberts had been taking special students to the supply closet.

So I was hanging out with her, getting to know her, and I guess she had reached a point where she was ready to go home. And she asked me to call Her, an Uber. And, uh, she left when the Uber came. Okay, all this sounds pretty tame so far. Pete, I'm not outraged yet. Were you just hanging out with her cause you felt bad? No, I mean, she was cute, and it was. We were having a fun time. Okay, okay, so what. When did it go south? Well, when she left, she never paid for the Bill. What? She just left everything out on the table. Her drinks and the guy from before that ditched her. Shut up. Oh, that sucks. That's a big tab. But she probably just forgot if she was wasted. I mean, who hasn't wandered away from a bar and been like, oh, didn't realize I didn't pay for that? I mean, she bolted out of that bar like she was on a mission. Wait, so you think that she left you with the tab on purpose? I don't know. It felt like that. How much? How much are we talking here? It was expensive. Not something I was ready to pay for. Oh, no. So you didn't really intend on even going on a date that night, and you kind of wound up in a date situation. And then not only that, you had to pay for her drinks and some other dudes drinks. He went on two dates. Kind of. Hey, yeah, I went on two dates, and I didn't get any action from anybody. I didn't even meet the first guy. Haha, well, maybe you can get some action now because Patricia is actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Hey!

As soon as he started talking about doctor's office, I was screwing with him. And then as soon as he said the pregnant thing, I was like, I can't do it, man. Yeah, that's. That's intense, man. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna contact. I'm not gonna do anything. But look at the timing. I'm sorry, I. I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but if you're talking about. You hooked up a month ago and she's just now going to a doctor's office. No, no, no, I use. We use Protection. Definitely. Sometimes it can fail, you know, that's not 100%. I just can't believe that happened. I. Yeah, neither can I. I don't know what to say. I mean, like, it's nothing like this has ever happened to me before. This is. I can still, you know, try to call back and get her on the phone at some point and see if I can get involved. no, no, I don't wanna Get involved in any way. Do you think that there's any way that maybe this is, like a new boyfriend? I'm just trying to look at, like, some sort of positive out of this. That she wants to have a baby with. I don't know. I don't know. I think it's pretty obvious here, Harry. Yeah. She was at the bar drunk, hooked up with you, realised that she made a mistake, probably feeling guilty, of course, not calling you back because she has a boyfriend who she thinks may have gotten her pregnant. Oh, man. Oh, this is so insane. Yeah. I mean, I had no idea. She seemed single. Yeah. Did she ever say to you throughout your day, did she seem like she had a boyfriend or anything at all? Not at all. Did she seem like she had a bun in the oven at all? No. No. Okay. I don't know. Some guys are attracted to that. I don't know. She was at a bar drinking all night, Jubal. I think that's a pretty indication. Good indication. Not really. I just can't believe that happened. Well, this is normally the time where I'm like, hey, do you wanna go on a second date? We'll pay for it. Uh, I don't really know how to handle this one at all. What do we do? Um, I guess I can send you out on a date with a text messenger. Somebody text into the show. Do you wanna Date with just a random person from the show? You know, I think. I think I should be more cautious on who I go out with. Yeah, exactly. Because trust me, you don't want to date with anybody that's texting into our show at 7, 8, 5, 9, 2. Alright, well, at least you got your answer. Yeah. Yeah. I hope for you that like, seventeen years from now, some kid doesn't show up and go, hey, we have the same nose. You hooked up with my mom years ago. Oh god, that is not funny at all. I think it is a little bit.

I never expected to be hiding in a bathroom stall at my own wedding. But there I was, wedding dress bunched around me, sobbing silently while guests waited outside. It happened just 20 minutes before I was supposed to walk down the aisle. My maid of honor had pulled me aside and shown me texts from my fiance to his ex girlfriend from the night before. Explicit messages promising to meet her after our honeymoon, saying our marriage was just for show and that he'd never stopped loving her. My hands shook so badly, I dropped the phone. I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in, ignoring the knocks. My mind raced through the mortgage we just signed, the 200 guests waiting, and the shame of calling it all off. The bathroom door opened and I heard my mom's voice, calm but firm, asking everyone else to leave. Then she knocked gently on my stall. Honey, let me in. I unlocked the door. She squeezed into the stall with me and didn't say a word about my ruined makeup. She just asked what happened. And I showed her the texts. Her face hardened as she read them. What do you wanna do? She asked. I shook my head, unable to form words through my tears. Because whatever you decide, I'm with you. If you want to walk out right now, we'll walk out. If you want me to go out, There. And tell everyone to go home. I'll do it, I whispered. I can't marry him, but I can't face everyone out there. She nodded and said, you don't have to. He helped me to my feet and said, wait here. Five minutes later she returned with my dad, who looked like he was barely containing his rage. My mom had a plan. Dad's going to pull the car around and you're going to leave with him right now. Go to our cabin. I'll handle everything here. I stared at her, not comprehending how she could sound so calm. But what will you tell everyone? What about all the money we spent? She cut me off. None of that matters. She turned to my dad and said, take her out the back way. As my dad LED me through the kitchen, I looked back to see my mom straightening her dress before walking toward the ceremony space. I spent that night at our family cabin. The next morning.

I Learned early to stop asking when other kids got new clothes for the school year. I wore hand me downs from cousins. When friends went to movies, I stayed home. By high school, I had internalized it completely. We were the poor family. Dad worked construction, mom cleaned houses. Every Bill was a struggle. Every expense was carefully calculated. I got a job at 15 bussing tables just to buy my own school supplies. I never questioned it. Never doubted their word. Until the laptop incident. I was 15 and needed to finish a history report. Dad's laptop was on the kitchen table, still logged into everything. I opened a browser to research my paper. When I saw the tab, his banking app was still open. My heart stopped. Checking account, $23,000. Savings account, $157,000. Investment account, $89,000. I stared at those numbers for 10 minutes, refreshing the page, thinking it was a mistake. But there it was. Nearly $270,000 just sitting there. While I'd been wearing the same three shirts to school for two years. I confronted them that night at dinner. Why do we Live like we're broke when we're not. Dad barely looked up from his meatloaf. That money is not for spending. It's for emergencies. And your college fund. But I've been working since I was 15 to buy basic things. Builds character.

Quietly. So I worked at this coffee shop downtown for three years. Not the fancy chain one. The small, local place where regulars knew me by name and I knew their orders before they even got to the counter. My boss, Kevin, was this guy who'd inherited the shop from his dad, but acted like he built the place himself. He'd show up maybe twice a week in his BMW, check the register, and complain about something before disappearing again. I opened the shop five days a week at 5:00am. I ordered supplies when we ran low, fixed the espresso machine when it broke down, and even made our Instagram posts that brought in college students. Basically, I ran the place while Kevin took credit. The worst part? He paid me exactly minimum wage the entire time. Every six months, I'd ask for a raise, and he'd say, business is tight while wearing his new designer watch. Meanwhile, I couldn't even afford to fix my car is broken AC. Then last summer, I finally asked for a manager title and $2 more per hour. Kevin laughed and said, you're just a barista, not management material. That night, I decided I was done. But instead of quitting right away, I made a plan. Spent two weeks writing down every single thing I did that wasn't in my job description. All the ordering details, the maintenance tricks for the machines, the special recipes, our regulars, Loved the Instagram account, password, everything. Then I took that list and erased it from my phone. I didn't need it anymore because I knew it all by heart. It was just my insurance policy. On a Friday when Kevin actually showed up, I handed him my 2 weeks notice. He rolled his eyes and said, whatever, I'll just hire someone new on Monday. During those 2 weeks, I was the perfect employee. Came in early, stayed late, smiled at everyone. But I didn't train anybody because Kevin never hired anyone. Why waste money on overlap?

I was at my neighbor's graduation party when I spotted a photo on their wall that made my heart stop. It was an old picture of my mom when she was younger, standing with her arm around my neighbor's dad. Mom never mentioned knowing these neighbors before we moved here last year. She he always acted like they were strangers. I grabbed my soda and walked closer to the picture, trying not to look weird while I stared at it. The photo was dusty, looked about 20 years old. My mom was wearing a college sweatshirt, and she was smiling super big with her arm tight around this man I only knew as Mister Peterson from down the street. I took a quick picture with my phone and tried to act normal when my neighbor's mom offered me some chips. The whole time she was smiling at me, but her eyes looked kind of sad or worried. When I went to the bathroom, I. I noticed more old photos in the hallway. In one of them, my mom was holding a baby, and missus Peterson was right beside her holding another baby. I felt my hands get all sweaty and my heartbeat really fast. The weirdest part was that the babies looked exactly the same, like twins. I stood there forever trying to make sense of it. My birthday is the same month as my neighbor Jake. We're both the same Height with the same color eyes went back to the party. But everything felt different now. I watched Jake laughing with his friends, and I noticed how his laugh sounded just like mine. I even caught Mister Peterson staring at me a few times like he was checking for something in my face.

After being intimate with the fourth girl of my young life at the time, I decided to get an STD check. Not for any physical reasons, mostly for emotional reassurance. Anyways, I called my neighbor across the street, who is three years older than me, and I told him that I made an appointment to get checked, and I asked him what it entailed. He said it wasn't too bad. They took a sample, swabbed his Schlong, and checked his blood, so I felt pretty prepared going in there. A few days later, on my way to the clinic, I was feeling pretty nervous to nut in a cup, but I reassured myself that it was going to be fine. When I finally got there, an older lady called my name and handed me a clear cup and escorted me to the restroom and said, please go in here. I was picturing a different room to choke my chicken comfortably, but I had done the deed in worse places before, so this wouldn't be a problem. I remember looking around for some adult entertainment material because my neighbor said that they provide you with some, but there was nothing. Disappointed, I said, oh well, not like I haven't used just my imagination before, so I began jerking it over the sink. I remember amazingly rubbing one out pretty fast, almost too fast. So I thought that I'd wait in there an additional 10 minutes because I didn't want her to think that I was some type of freak. After waiting in there for what felt like an eternity, I finally handed the cup full of my children back to the old lady nurse, who acted impatient and upset that I took so long. I began following her down the hallway. The woman set the cup on this desk table thingy, looked at it, and then picked it up again and she jiggled the cup a little bit. I held my breath as I looked at her face. As I saw it turn from confusion to sheer horror. She turns to me and goes, um, sir, we only needed your urine.

I remember this. I had so many people stop me, literally stop me on the street and say, what was that crazy woman's problem? Yeah, me too. Apparently, her ex made reservations at the restaurant where they had gone on their first date. Yep. And also suggested that she wear an outfit that he really liked and remembered from back when they were dating. Bad news. We told her it's probably a bad idea to go through with that and not tell your husband. It's not fair to not tell him. And then this happened. You guys are causing so much drama right now. You're attacking me. I called cause I was trying to prove to my girlfriend that this wasn't a big deal, and you guys are making this a big freaking deal! So obviously she didn't like our advice and said it didn't matter what we say because her and her ex are just friends, and she swore nothing was going to happen. And she definitely was gonna go through with the date and not tell her husband because she didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Well, after that aired, guess who sent us an email. Oh ho! Thank you for your email. Thank you for agreeing to do the awkward Tuesday phone call. How Are you, uh. I guess I'm okay. Guys, how's it going? Not too bad. Hey. I'm sorry you had to hear about it this way. Yeah, it could have gone a lot better. Did a friend. Did a friend tell you to listen to it online, or did you actually hear it as she had called in live, like, driving to work? A friend of mine told me that it was on there, so I did check it out online. Now, if I had heard this and it was my wife or girlfriend, I heard, they were going out with their ex and not telling me about it, I would have been fuming. What were you feeling when you were listening to it? Uh, I just. I kind of couldn't believe it, you know, I was just a little bit in shock and disbelief, I guess. I mean, I know my wife would never cheat on me, but I just couldn't believe she would keep it a secret for me. That just. Yeah, blew my mind. I think that was my biggest issue is. Look, if people want to be friends with their exes and go out to dinner with their exes, why? But, I mean, the fact that she wouldn't tell you was what was disturbing to me. Yeah, that was. That was what bothered me also. We do our best in our marriage to not keep any secrets from each other, and this is clearly a violation of That. Is this the first time that something like this has happened where she's not told you something? As far as I know. Right. We've been married for two and a half years. This is definitely the first that something of this magnitude has come along. So, I mean, are you okay with her being friends with her ex? You know, she does have another ex boyfriend that she's friends with. I have an ex girlfriend that I'm friends with. It's no big deal. Right. You know, the idea doesn't necessarily bother me, but definitely some of the details about this guy's dinner plans, as well as the fact that it's being kept a secret, definitely have gotten under my skin a little bit. So you emailed in, and our producer, producer Boyd, called you and asked if you would do an awkward Tuesday phone call, and you agreed. Does that mean that you wanna call the guy or you wanna call your wife? I wanna call my wife. Right. Oh, god. Okay. I was hoping for the guy, dude. And why do you wanna call her? What do you wanna say to her? I just. I wanna confront her about the dinner. I wanna find out what happened on the dinner. She. She went ahead and went and they went out. Oh, she did it. I mean, it's happened already. It happened. And I didn't say anything about it to her because I wanted to see what she was Gonna do. And, you know, she told me she was going to hang out with her girlfriend. Oh, she straight up lied, so. Yeah. And you knew what she was doing the whole time? How do you know? Well, how do you know that that was what she was doing that night? Cause she ended up wearing the outfit oh my god, that guy asked for. How do you. How do you know that was the outfit? She made mention of it like years ago, and she's probably forgotten about it, but she told me at one point she was like, you know, that guy used to really like this dress or whatever. What do you think? I'm like, it's fine. And, you know, she never. I don't think she's ever worn it since then, so. Yeah, so she busts out this old dress that she used to wear with her ex boyfriend. I'm going out with my girlfriends tonight. And the whole time you know exactly what she's doing. How did you even bite your lip? You know, it was really hard. It was really hard to not say anything. It was really hard when I know all the details of what's going on in that. But I trust her and I just kind of had to let her do what she's gonna do. What are. You are so calm right now. Like I am fired up for you. How do you trust her when you know she's flat Out lying to you? Yeah, I guess it's just something that you establish some trust before you get married to someone. And I do trust her now. It's your wife, so I don't want you to be offended by this, okay, but the fact that she would go out with her ex and then go to this restaurant that they went on their first date to, and then dress in the dress that he wanted her to, is she the kind of girl that loves attention like that? You know, I don't think that she does want the attention. I just. From listening to it online, I think she just kind of thinks it's not a big deal. I mean, you think that this guy has other intentions, right? Because that's not something that you do with a friend. You don't say, let's go down memory lane to our relationship past. No, I. I know he's got an agenda. I mean, he is a guy. I'm a guy. I, I know exactly what he's thinking. I. Right. I don't think she's aware of it, and I think, you know, she just decided to keep it to herself. Wow. Your wife got pretty upset at us when we talked to her and the listeners. I'm guessing when you call her, she's not gonna take it super calmly. You know what? I have no idea what she's gonna, um, how she's gonna react. That go one of two ways. Either she gets Pissed at you, which she really shouldn't. That's a bit of a double standard, I think. Yeah, right. Or she just kind of gets sheepish about it and tries to apologize and backpedal, which will be fun to listen to either way. So thank you for agreeing to do this awkward Tuesday phone call. We'll play a song. Come back.

Hmm. It was a date that they weren't even on. What? Actually, a date that had nothing to do with them at all. But they think that they screwed it up, and they want us to help fix it. Barbara is on the phone with us. Barbara thinks that she ruined her son's date. Oh, no. Hey, Barbara. How you doing? Oh, I've been better. How are you? I'm not too bad. So this is an interesting story. We got your email, and you feel like you ruined your son's date? Honestly, I don't think I know. You know? Oh, okay. Tell us what you did. Oh, gosh. I became the mother I swore I'd never be. I have a son, Jeremy. He's 21, but he still lives home with me. And he went out on a date with a new girl, and I wasn't really sure of where he was and what his plans were, but it, you know, got to be rather late, and I got a little antsy, you know, cause he. He. He's usually home at a decent hour, and, um. Well, I got kind of worried and started calling his phone. Oh, no. Okay, how many times did you start calling his phone? Oh, god, at least 6, 7 times. It just kept going straight to voicemail, which made me even more anxious. Okay, So what did you do, Barbara? Well, I kind of. I guess at my age, you shouldn't be doing the social medias thing, but I went on his Facebook page and I posted on his page to all his friends. Does anybody know where Jeremy is? No. Oh, my god, please have him call his mom. Oh, Barbara, you know, you know, he's. You know, he's 21 years old, right? Barbara, you know, all I can say is it was like one, two o'clock in the morning and. And I went overboard, I really did. But it was 2 o'clock in the morning, so whatever was going on, clearly I ruined it. Oh, and I know what's going on at 2 o'clock in the morning. You ruined that! Okay, let's not go down that road, okay? So what. What was his reaction then to that? I mean, I'm assuming he came home at a certain point. Yeah, he. He was. He was pretty angry. What did he say to you? He just came in, slamming the door and screaming at me. How could you do that? That was the best date I've had in a year, and you ruined it! You ruined it! He just stormed off and I'm. I'm, like, trying to talk and I'm saying, what did I do? What did I do? And he starts screaming at me. Facebook, mom, you Facebooked it! So, Barbara, you actually now think it's a good idea to continue this line? And call his date is what you want us to do? I mean, I. I just don't know what else to do. It's. It's. Apparently he really, really liked this girl, and things were going quite well, and, uh. Yeah, things turned after I did what I did. So. How do you have this girl's phone number? Really? Yeah, really. How do you have it? I went in his phone. Oh, my gosh, Barbara, you're just making. You're making things worse. You know that, Barbara? Well, I was hoping with you guys, I could turn things around. Maybe we could fix this. No. So your goal is to get this girl on the phone and convince her to go back out with your son? And I swear I'll stay away. Oh, my gosh. If I got this call from a guy, I was dating his mom, I would run 8,000 miles in the other direction. Well, at least she's sweet. It's not like. I mean, can't we turn it into something? I mean, can't we laugh? Find the laughter in it? I think. I think it's funny. Yeah? Yeah, well, for us. Not for her son, for sure. Well, I know not for him, but maybe if we can make her to laugh, she'll reconsider. If I swear to stay away until the wedding. Yeah, maybe. Well, don't say. Don't bring up the wedding thing. That might be a bit much. I promise. Okay, so if you make this call, And she doesn't wanna go out with him again. And then she ends up calling your son and saying, hey, can you tell your mom to back off? He's already mad at you. Don't you think he's gonna get even more pissed? Well, I mean, the way I look at it is they don't have a second date anyway. Yeah, so if she goes out with him, it's a win. If she doesn't go out with him, then it's status quo. Yeah, I guess. You can't make her talk to him less if she's not talking to him after the date. Have I meddled in my son's life over the years? Of course. But this is probably me at my absolute worst. And if you guys can help me fix this, it would mean everything. Cause I, I, I just got crazy. I got crazy, you know? Well, we'll give it a shot. We'll play a song, come back, call her and get your second date update. Sort of. I don't

Six years after our baby girl was born, my wife was sitting on a bus that crashed into a pole. And because of where she was seated, she was the only one that died. And I always swore to myself that I wouldn't date again until Aria was older. I knew I had to be the one that would hear about her first period, her first real crush, and her first heartbreak. So by the time she turned 14, we were more like best friends than anything else. I still don't know how she turned out so well. I never had to tell her to do anything more than once, and she was grateful for everything she had. Honestly, sometimes it felt like she was my role model. It was around this time that I met Veronica. She was the type of woman to laugh at your joke when the rest of the room was silent. And when I realized I had a crush on her, I got scared. I didn't want to confuse Aria in case it didn't work out. But I knew I couldn't be single forever, so I decided to just take things slow and very private. We went on one date a week, and she already knew about Aria because of the photo frame I kept in my office. And on our one year anniversary, I finally told Aria about it. No effing shit, dad. You're really terrible at hiding things. From me, she said. I burst out laughing. And the next week we hosted a barbecue and invited her. I had no idea how bad things were about to get, because they hit it off immediately. Veronica complimented Aria's vintage band T-shirt, and suddenly they were deep in conversation about music I'd never heard of. It felt easy, natural, like maybe I could actually do this. And on our two year anniversary, the month was filled with cardboard boxes and moving vans. Veronica moved in with us. The first week was amazing. Aria had someone to complain about period cramps with, and I could hear them laughing all night. But one Friday, everything changed. I came home from work to find Aria in her room with the door locked, music blasting. Usually she listened to the Arctic Monkeys or Tame Impala, but suddenly that had been replaced by Nicki Minaj and Cardi B. When she finally came down for dinner, I barely recognized her. My sweet Aria had her face caked in heavy makeup, dark smoky eyes, bright red lips, foundation so thick it looked like a mask. She was wearing a dress so short she couldn't even sit down properly. What's with the new look? I asked, trying to keep my tone light. She just shrugged and kept eating. Veronica and I exchanged glances, but didn't push it. Teenagers experiment, right? Except things only got worse from there. Aria was getting dressed coded at school every day, and one Day I caught a package in the post from Victoria's Secret and saw that she had spent $300, all her saved up birthday money on red undergarments. Then came the boys. First it was Jake from her math class, then Tyler from the debate team. First she told me they were just friends, and I believed her. But they'd show up at all hours, honking their horns instead of coming to the door. This isn't like her, I told Veronica one night. Something's wrong. Veronica sighed. She's 16. This is what 16 year olds do. She's testing boundaries. I wanted to believe Veronica was right, but my gut told me something else was going on. Aria had gone from my best friend to a stranger in just a few months. And then came the moment when everything clicked. Fast asleep at 2:00am when I heard the front door creek open. I looked out the window and saw Aria getting into a car I didn't recognize. I didn't even waste time putting on pants, just grabbed the car keys and followed them. They drove to a quieter part of town. Nothing dodgy, just less houses, no streetlights. I turned my lights off and made sure to keep my distance. That's when I saw it. A man who looked like he could be in his 40s getting out of his car to let Aria out. When I saw him lean in to kiss her, my jaw dropped so hard I could practically Hear it crack! I jumped out and ran towards him to beat him until his organs were the same consistency of a smoothie. Dad, what are you doing? Aria yelled as if she was surprised to see me attack him. She then jumped on my back and forced me off of him. Dad, I thought this is what you wanted. By this point, she was in tears, and even through the anger, I instinctively stroked her hair. The man had driven away, and we were sitting together on the sidewalk. Now that you have Veronica, you don't need me anymore. I was just trying to find a new man to take care of me when I turn 18. Stared at her blankly, unsure if this was a lie to get her out of being in trouble. But then she continued, it's what Veronica told me to do, I could have all the gold in the world and I would still need you. Once she finally believed me, I ordered her an Uber to my mom's house because I knew there was no way I would drive safely after hearing that. When I got home, Veronica was already awake and waiting for me at the door. She draped herself over me, kissing my neck, and I kissed her back because I wanted Veronica in prison. But I knew I needed a confession first. Full story on channel link below.

My dentist, Doctor Martinez. Everyone in town loved him because he was so gentle and never hurt anyone during procedures. I went there for years. Never felt a thing during cleanings or fillings. He'd always say, you won't feel this at all. And he was right. I actually looked forward to dental appointments. But my breath got worse even though I brushed constantly. Food started getting stuck in places it never did before. My girlfriend mentioned my smile looks different, but I couldn't see it. Doctor Martinez always had explanations. Genetics, he'd say. Some people just have softer enamel. He prescribed expensive mouthwash that made everything worse. During one appointment, I felt something sharp fall into my mouth. Doctor Martinez quickly suctioned it out and said it was just a piece of old filling. The receptionist always looked nervous around him. She'd stutter when scheduling my next appointment. Once I caught her crying in the bathroom after he yelled at her about patient files. My insurance started rejecting more claims. They said I was having too many procedures for someone my age. Doctor Martinez got angry when I mentioned it. His hands shook while he worked on my mouth. That day, I started getting bills for procedures I didn't remember having. When I questioned them, he showed me consent forms with my signature, but I never remembered signing them. I noticed he always scheduled me for the last appointment of the day. The Parking lot would be empty. Other patients in the waiting room looked miserable. Everyone had bandages or swollen faces. But they all praise Doctor Martinez when asked, their eyes looked dead, though. The tools he used looked different from other dentists I'd seen on TV. Sharper, more aggressive looking. When I asked about them, he changed the subject immediately. My friends started avoiding me. They said my breath smelled rotten, even after brushing. Some made excuses not to sit near me at restaurants. My teeth started shifting. Gaps appeared overnight. I'd wake up with my mouth tasting like metal. Blood on my pillow became normal. Doctor Martinez said it was just adjustment periods from all the work. He installed a new chair that reclined further back than normal. I felt completely helpless lying in it. The restraints seemed tighter than they needed to be. Started taking photos of my mouth at every visit. Way more than seemed normal. He'd zoom in on specific teeth and mutter numbers under his breath, like he was calculating something. Then he began asking personal questions. How much money I made, if I lived alone, whether I had family in town. He wrote everything down in a separate folder. One day, I arrived early and found him in his office counting cash. Big stacks of bills spread across his desk. When he saw me, he quickly shoved everything into a safe. I'd never noticed before. He offered me a payment plan for future work. He Already knew exactly what procedures I'd need for the next five years. The timeline was eerily specific. Then I moved to college and had to find A new dentist. That's when everything fell apart. The new dentist took one look at my mouth.

My seven year old daughter came home from school with a strange question. Mommy, why does the crossing guard know where I live? My heart stopped. Our crossing guard had been there for months. Friendly, helpful, always waving at the kids. But Lily said he'd been asking questions. What time does daddy leave for work? Which window is your bedroom? Do you walk to school alone on Wednesdays when Mommy has appointments? He'd even asked if we had a dog, security cameras, or if grandma ever babysat overnight. Lily mentioned he knew our car wasn't working and that we'd been walking more often. I thought she was confused until I checked our neighborhood app. Three other parents posted similar concerns. Crossing guard was asking their kids about family schedules, home layout, who had keys. One mom said he offered to walk her daughter home when she missed the bus. Another said he'd asked her son about the family's vacation plans and whether they used a house sitter. A third parent mentioned he'd been asking about which kid had working parents versus stay at home moms. The school said they'd hired him through a temp agency. He passed all background checks. They insisted. But something felt terribly wrong. Why would a crossing guard need to know our children's bedroom windows? Why was he memorizing our daily routines? Why did he care about our work schedules and home security? At first, I told Lily to stay close to her teacher after school. But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. Crossing guard with no real credentials, just watching our children, gathering information. I decided to test him. The next morning, I told Lily to say daddy was going out of town for work. A complete lie. Within an hour, I got a text from an unknown number. Heard your husband's traveling. I could check on you and Lily if you need help. The message included details about our house that only someone who'd been watching would know. Our broken porch light, the loose gate latch, even that our name

You did not ask to go in there. So you set this whole thing up on the radio? Yeah. I thought it would be a good idea to have this conversation this way. I've wanted to talk to you and figure out what was going on, and you were not answering me. Well, I wasn't answering you because you were a liar. I don't wanna go out with you again. I'm not a liar. It's not what you think. It's not that at all. Why did you. It's not. Wait, wait, so did I not? Am I imagining the baby, or. You are not imagining the baby. Um, but that is not my baby. What? Somebody. It's somebody else's baby. Whose baby is it? It's a friend of mine. She's another single mom, and we share babysitter sometimes when we go out. Oh. Oh, okay, that makes total sense. So it's your friend's secret baby? It's not a secret. I think it's the point. Jubal, that's a normal baby. No, it's a secret baby. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, so, Courtney, then why didn't you tell me about it? Why would you need to know that my friend's baby was sleeping the other room? I don't. I mean, you weren't supposed to go in my bedroom. Why were you going in my bedroom? Because I had to pee. We were drinking all night, and So I had to use the bathroom, and that's the one I found. It was the closest one. Well, it wasn't the bathroom, that was my bedroom. The bathroom was right next to it. What? I. The bedroom, bathroom, it doesn't matter. You have a second kid that you didn't tell me about, and that's, that's nuts to me. Why did you tell me that? Dude, that is not true. I just told you the truth. Yeah, whatever. I don't believe you, I, you told me everything about the situation, about yourself. You're super open with me, and you would have told me about that. I don't know why you wouldn't have prepare me for the situation that we were walking into. Because the other baby had nothing. That had nothing to do with what was going on. Okay, you're a moron if you think that I was gonna have a secret baby and try and hide it from you. Like I had this plan to like, be this evil genius behind your back. That's a good point, Jason. Why would she hide a baby from you? I mean, if you guys did start dating, at some point she's gonna have to introduce you to the baby. I don't know, maybe she was waiting to introduce me to the baby. Like, on the second date, maybe. Let's keep going after that. Maybe on the third date. She's got like a seven year old. Just kids showing up everywhere. Just secret Kids left and right. The kids popping up everywhere like Will Chamberlain kid. Oh my god. Have you been burned that bad by other dates? Dude, maybe you're the one who has some issues. Cause I'm telling you the truth. I don't have time to plan these evil schemes, okay? I'm a single mom. The reason that I share this babysitter is cause it's hard. It's really hard to support a kid. Yeah, so my friend and I do this together, okay? We do it together when we decide to go out and try to get out there in the dating scene. I don't do this often. You seemed like a really great guy and I wanted to give you a chance. I'm being completely truthful, okay? I don't need you to attack me. I don't need that. I don't have time for that in my life, okay? But I really think you're a really great guy. And if we can move past this silly secret secret baby theme that you think I'm doing. Jason, would you like to go out with Courtney again? We'll pay for a second date and she can prove to you that she does not have a secret baby. I can't believe she even has to. That's so dumb. I know. Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna have to say no because. But the one she called me a moron 2. Oh, what? You are being a moron. I spent. I spent a few hours with Her that night. And if I had to make a guess on whether she was telling the truth right now or not, I would say probably not. So you still. Wow. No. You still think she's lying about the baby? Oh, my gosh. Well, I also think that maybe the fact that she called a radio show makes me think she wants attention a little bit. And. Or maybe you have communication problems and you should answer your text back. All right, well, I happen to think I'm a really good person and a really good judge of character, so I'm sorry that you think that, but. A little paranoid, maybe? Yeah. Good person, a little paranoid. Jason, thank you for your time. Yes, thank you for your time. This is a great way to spend my morning. Sorry you're ambushed with a secret baby. I hate those secret babies, Courtney. Well, I'm sorry. No second date for you. His loss. It's totally fine. Yeah. You know, the one thing I Learned in all this is I guess I should have posted my secret baby to my dating profile. Yeah, use that in your dating profile. In your bio section. I have a three year old and a secret baby. I hit you up and ask questions about that.

My twin sister was better than me at everything, and she made sure we all knew it. It all started with a scoop of ice cream when we were 6 years old.

Meanwhile, hers tasted amazing. Good job! Our parents yelled. We always knew you were the better twin. They laughed like it was a joke, but I knew it wasn't. Fast forward to ninth grade when we had our first set of finals. Vanessa had gone on and on about how studying was a waste of time and she'll only be young once. Well, I was studying in my room at 2:00am when she burst through the door looking for a charger. As soon as she saw me in front of my open textbook, she froze and stood like a deer caught in headlights. You're studying? What the f? I just rolled my eyes and shut the door. Over the next few days, Vanessa was practically glued to the books. At first I was happy for her until the results came out. I didn't even have to ask what she got because she came running up to me and waved a piece of paper in my face. Ha ha! You fat bitch! I got an A+! Let Me see what you got. I showed her my A. She bent over from how hard she was laughing. I effing knew I was smarter than you. But the worst part came later. When we were all at the dinner table. My sister whipped out a laminated copy of her exam paper. My parents didn't even wait to ask me what I got before singing her praises. Meanwhile, our dad was beaming with pride. I got an A, I whispered when the kitchen got a little quieter. You need to start being more like Vanessa. My mom instantly responded. From there, I started to isolate myself from the family. I'd spend all my time at home with our black cat, midnight, and killed any urge to talk to them. By the time college applications came around, I was practically buzzing with excitement to finally move out. Vanessa was beside me when she got the email from her dream college. She was bouncing up and down on the chair faster than a trained window girl. There it was, in plain red aerial font. Rejected. I could see the light in her eyes die out after just 10 seconds of

My parents had one non negotiable rule about dating absolutely not until college, or they would ship me off to my grandmother's house in rural Montana, where the nearest boy my age lived 40 miles away. They had already threatened this twice when they caught me texting guys from school. After they confiscated my phone for a week and made me write a five page essay on why teenage romance destroys academic achievement, I was completely desperate. Problem was that I was hopelessly infatuated with Adrian, the smartest guy in my A P. History class, and I was running out of time because he was transferring schools at the end of the semester. I carefully analyzed their exact wording of the role. They specifically said no dating and no boyfriends, but they never mentioned anything about academic partnerships or study groups. This became my loophole. I approached my parents with a proposal for a peer tutoring exchange program where I would help struggling students with English while receiving advanced help in subjects like calculus and history. I emphasized how this would strengthen my college applications and demonstrate leadership skills. I didn't mention was that Adrian would be my primary tutoring partner. My parents were thrilled and immediately extended my after school privileges specifically for tutoring activities, allowing me to stay out until eight PM for these educational purposes. For the next month, Adrian and I met three times a week. At the library, coffee shops, and eventually each other's houses when parents weren't home. We genuinely did study together. But we also made out constantly and had deep conversations about everything except academics. When my parents checked on our progress, I showed them my improved calculus grades and Adrian's essay improvements. The system worked perfectly until something completely unexpected happened. Our fake tutoring program actually transformed both of us into academic monsters. Adrian, who had been struggling with writing, suddenly started producing essays that made our teachers weep with joy. I discovered that explaining complex literature concepts to him helped me understand them more deeply than I ever thought possible. Within six weeks, we had both raised our G P A.

What is the most insane way a spouse has tried to screw the other? My buddy Calvin thought he hit the Jackpot when his wife Megan finally got pregnant after three years of trying. They've been to doctors, done all the tests, spent thousands on treatments. Nothing worked. So when she came running into the kitchen that Tuesday morning, waving a pregnancy test around, Calvin literally cried happy tears. But here's where it gets weird. Megan suddenly became super protective about doctor visits. He wouldn't let Calvin come to any appointments, claiming they made her too anxious and stressed. She said the doctor told her stress was bad for the baby, so she had to handle everything alone. Calvin thought it was sweet how much she cared about their future kid. For five months, Megan would leave for these appointments every few weeks. She'd come back with stories about how the baby was doing great, growing perfectly, all that good stuff. She even showed Calvin a few ultrasound photos. Blurry, black and white pictures that honestly could have been anything. But Calvin was so excited, he didn't question it. Then one random Thursday, Calvin came home from work to find divorce papers sitting on the kitchen counter. Megan was nowhere to be found. Just a note saying she'd moved out and her lawyer would be in touch. Calvin was completely blindsided. It seemed fine talking about baby names just the week before the divorce papers were insane. Megan Wanted alimony, half of everything. And here's the kicker. Immediate child support payments. Because of all the prenatal medical costs, she claimed she needed money right away for special vitamins, extra doctor visits, all kinds of pregnancy related expenses. The papers said she was already five months along.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. I picked up the phone. It was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was Scared of him, I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for A new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw A black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant, so I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into A park, where I found A police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead, he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father, he's doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like A James Bond villain. I asked him if He was going to take my life away and all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My baby girl. I love her, but we both know she's a hoe.

I saw a man in his late 50s walk in with a little girl about 9 years old. At first I thought they were just on an innocent daddy daughter date, but as soon as they sat down, he asked her, so what's your name? My brain immediately went on high alert. I tried to keep my cool and scope out the situation, but as I was walking over to take their order, the man glanced my way and I overheard him tell the little girl, don't say anything, I'm going to try and place the order. He ordered a steak for himself and French fries with nuggets for the girl and a virgin Shirley Temple, and he winked at her right after he said that. I was absolutely horrified, and when I looked at the girl, she had a soft smile on her face and gave him a thumbs up while making a zipping motion over her mouth and pretending to throw away the key. As I was waiting for their food to be prepared, I was listening in on their conversation and he kept asking her things like what school do you go to? What's your best friend's name? And he was writing every single thing she said down in his notepad. In fact, as I peered over his shoulder, I I saw he had a list of 100 questions and was reading them off at That point, I couldn't hold back any longer, and as I explained the whole ordeal to one of my co workers, she agreed that I should call the cops. I called them and said there was a weird grooming situation going on, and within five minutes, they were at the door. I LED them over to the table, and the girl started crying. As the man was LED outside of the restaurant for questioning, I heard the cop tell the girl, don't you worry. We won't let him get you. You're safe with us. But that made her cry even harder. She kept asking for her mommy. So we dialed her mom, who showed up at the scene within five minutes. And she was livid. She started yelling at us all, calling us unprofessional, and I had no idea what she was on about until she explained that the man who was dining with the girl was her father, and he had just gone through a traumatic brain injury and was working on getting his memory back. It was their first daddy daughter date since he'd been released.

I worked in Disneyland when one day two women came in with two little girls. One was in a wheelchair and the other looked extremely down. And the two women were nurses and were asking for a refund on the girls tickets. I asked why they wanted a refund and they told me a story I'll never forget. The two girls were here on holiday with their parents, and just a few hours ago they were driving to their hotel when they all got into a horrible car accident. Their mother had her dome cut clean off right in front of them, and their father slammed his dome into the steering wheel so hard his dome practically exploded everywhere. And so they were here trying to refund the tickets to get the girls money to get them back home. My heart absolutely sunk, not only because of the story, but because of the look on the girls faces. It was faces of pure pain and numbness. I refunded their tickets immediately and told them I'd be their private tour guide for the day with they were not expecting. I walked them to the VIP viewing area for the parade, and on the way down, I pulled out every kid joke I could think of. I had been a tour guide for over a decade and I knew how to make kids smile, but nothing worked. Just stared blankly the whole time. I left them for a second to go backstage and bawl my eyes out, and when I came back out, I brought them to get ice cream. I also took them on every ride, but they wouldn't smile, wouldn't laugh, wouldn't speak, and wouldn't even cry. The nurses were loving it, and we're trying to get them into it, but it just wasn't working. We finally reached the viewing area of the parade, and it was there that I honestly saw true magic. I had called the parade department to let them

I've been wearing a prosthetic leg since I was nine after bone cancer took my real one. By high school I've gotten used to explaining it to new teachers, showing my medical documentation, and moving on. Most educators were understanding and supportive, but Mrs. Henderson, our long term substitute for AP Biology, was different from day one. She kept making comments about kids these days faking everything for special treatment and would stare at me whenever I use the elevator or took extra time transitioning between classes. I tried showing her my 5:04 plan and medical records, but she just rolled her eyes and muttered something about convenient paperwork. The breaking point came during a lab practical. I was working at my assigned station when she approached with this smug expression. She whispered that she'd dealt with attention seeking students for and that my little act wasn't fooling anyone. I explained again that my prosthetic was real, even offering to show her the attachment point, but she just smiled coldly. Prove it, then she said, loudly enough for nearby students to hear, if it's real, you won't mind me checking. Before I could react, she grabbed my prosthetic leg and yanked hard, trying to pull it off like it was some costume piece. The pain was excruciating as the socket twisted against my residual limb. I screamed and fell backward, knocking over lab Equipment. As she continued pulling, convinced it would just pop off, the entire class stopped working. Several students started yelling at her to stop. My friend Jake was recording everything on his phone, initially thinking it was just another teacher student argument, but quickly realizing what was actually happening. Missus Henderson kept yanking, getting frustrated that my leg wasn't coming off easily. She was actually damaging the prosthetic.

Hello? I was looking for Jason. Yeah, it's Jason. Who's this? Hey, Jason. How are you? My name is Jubal, and I host a morning radio show called Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. What? Sorry. My name is Jubal. What is this about, please? Well, actually, one of our listeners emailed us about you and asked if I could get you on the phone and ask you a few questions. Wait, so this is the radio program? Yes, and somebody who listens to our show emailed and asked if we could get you on the phone. Okay. And it's about what? It's about a date that you went on recently. Uh, he's like, this just keeps getting stranger. I know, it's weird. Yeah, it's a segment we do on our show called The Second Date. So you recently went out with a girl named Courtney? Oh, man. Okay. Um, yes. Yes, I did go out with a girl named Courtney recently. Okay, cool. So we got the right Jason on the phone. Well, Courtney's wondering why you're not getting back to her after your date. Wow. So she called the radio? Yeah. I'll tell you what she told us. Kourtney said that you guys met on a dating site and went out and had a fun time drinking and talking, and then at the end of the night, you Went back to her house and ended up meeting her kid. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I. Yeah, that happened. Not a little surprised by that. I knew from her profile that she had a kid. Yeah. So I was cool with that, but I didn't expect to be, you know, asked back to meet the kids. Yeah. Yeah, she knows. She even knows. That was kind of a weird move. She said she was a little drunk when she suggested that you go back there and meet the kid. And then she told us how her son, like, freaked out. Yeah, it was. It was pretty rough. She had. She had warned me about him. She said he would be a handful, and so. But to be honest, the way he, uh, threw the tantrum that he threw was pretty. It was pretty intense. It was. It was an 11. Okay. It was 11 on the 1 to 10 scale. Do you. Do you have much experience with toddlers at all? You know, I don't have any kids of my own, but I have cousins and brothers and sisters who have kids, so I got lots of nieces and nephews, so it's great to be the cool uncle. Okay. But so you. You could understand, I mean, like, late at night, the kids gonna have a tantrum. It's tired. Yeah, yeah, no, I get it. I get it. And I'm. And I'm good with kids, too, so that was. That was A little weird. Um, but I probably wouldn't say that that was the reason I didn't contact her again. Is there a reason, or did you just not really like the date? For her sake, I probably don't want to mention it on the radio, cause I don't think she'd like that. I mean, I know she called you, but. Yeah, but if it's for her sake. What? She's the one that agreed to do the second date. And everybody knows when you do a second date, you might hear something that you don't want to hear. And you have to be willing to have it aired out on the show. So she knows that. Yeah. All right, so I should just put her on blast, huh? That's what she's asking for. She would love it, actually. All right, well, she's dealing with Adam, I think was his name. And it. That took a while. It was an event. And so I'm trying to, you know, keep myself entertained, looking at magazines or whatever. And I had to go to the bathroom, so I'm not trying to snoop or anything. And it looked like through the bedroom door, there was a bathroom that way, and so I went through that way. But in the bedroom, asleep in a crib is like a Newborn baby. What? Which we talked all night. What? And I feel like I got to know her really well, and she really opened up to me. And So it's probably not fun that she also has a Newborn baby that she hasn't told me about. Wait, she didn't mention at all that she had a Newborn child? Not at all. Not once. She didn't mention that to us either. What? I was completely shocked. I was like, I don't know what to do. I gotta. I gotta get out of there. So. So she had a secret kid? Secret baby? Yeah, she had a secret kid. Who has a secret kid? And you sure? I mean, you sure it wasn't like the babysitter had a Newborn and the Newborn was sleeping in the back room or something? No, no, no. That babysitter was not old enough to have a Newborn. And clearly, like, she sent the babysitter home, so. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. So she has. She had a secret baby. Why would you be taking it? Did you ask her about the secret baby? I know I didn't ask her about the secret baby. At that point, when there's a secret baby, I'm just like, I'm out. Yeah, but why would she tell you about the one child and not the second child? Obviously she's got a favorite. Hahaha! You can meet my three year old, but my Newborn? Not very cool. It's not productive. Yeah, I really like it. That is it. Okay, I. That is understandable. If somebody had a secret baby, I'd be a little wary of dating him too. Yeah, I Was blown away. Maybe she did. I don't know. Like, the only thing I can think of is, like, maybe she was just worried that the baby had happened so soon that that would scare you off. But she wasn't worried about me meeting her three year old. Yeah, I don't know why the baby will be that different. I mean, I guess it means that there was a baby daddy more recently than right now. That's what I'm saying. But speaking of secrets, like secret babies and such. I have a secret. Kourtney is actually on the other line listening and would like to talk to you right now. Right. No, no, seriously. I'm serious. She's on the other line. Are you serious? She's on the phone? Yep. Secret babies and secret phone calls. That's what we're all about here. A lot of secrets.

One. As a kindergarten, I once fell asleep in the bus. When I woke up, the bus was in the garage and I had to yell to get someone to get me out. So to this day, every bus driver in my school district needs to walk to the back of the bus and check every seat before they park the bus. Seems like a good rule to have. Two. My older brother got a curfew enforced at Boy Scout camp when one of the leaders noticed him walking around the area in the daytime with his eyes closed, counting steps. He may have just been practicing being blind, but the adults assumed he was figuring out how to get around at night without light so he could get into some kind of mischief. Which, knowing my brother, was also possible. 3 minor 1. But when I was in elementary school, we had one of those bridge building challenges using toothpicks and hot glue. My partner and I realized if we just coated the entire thing with a thick ass layer of hot glue, it would make our bridge strong as hell. So we used like, a full pack of hot glue sticks, like 20 of them. It was more glue than toothpicks. So after that, they limited the number of glue sticks you could use. Four. In history class in high school, there was about 10 of us. Really close. Friends. We would take every opportunity to make your mom jokes. A couple months into class, the teacher made us sign a treaty promising to stop making fun of each other's moms. We signed it and started making fun of each other's dads. Five. My junior high made a rule against yoyos in class after I tried to do a trick and my yoyo flew across the room and broke a glass speaker set. I'm sorry, guys. Six. In middle school, I would use sharpies to tattoo myself. Other kids thought it was cool, so I started charging $1 per drawing wherever they wanted. Principal found out, and after I wouldn't stop, she put a ban on sharpies for the entire school. Even the teachers couldn't bring them in. I'm a tattoo artist now. 7 my elementary school was located in the center of the neighborhood, and my fifth grade class was the first to get outdoor trailers for classrooms. We'd ask for bathroom passes and then walk home. Next year, they built a fence around the school.

Humbled to their core. I was 14 when my mom replaced my dad with my stepdad, and I hated her for it because my stepdad was awkward as hell. Like one time he caught me sneaking out of my window at 3:00am, and instead of grounding me or telling my mom, he asked to have a talk about my feelings and hormones. After that, I never took him seriously. Whenever he picked me up from school for bonding time, I would blast the most intimate songs I knew, and if he tried to turn them off, I just used the magic words. Dad would have let me play and immediately got what I wanted. Even when I shouted the house down at 4:00am playing league of legends. Skip school for a week straight or ask for three hundred dollar shoes. That line worked every time. But the thing is, I only did all those things to scare him away. But apparently he wasn't leaving without a fight, and it wasn't until I filled his expensive gas tank with rocks and caramel sauce that he finally left. And before you guys hate me, you should probably know that the whole time my bio dad was telling me to do all this because if I didn't, according to him, it proved I was a horrible son who never loved him. And once my stepdad was finally out of the picture, my dad slid back in A few months later. But it wasn't long until I regretted my decision, because my dad was out for blood. Within a week, he had wailed on me twice and left me with a limp because I had left the hallway light on overnight. And I was convinced the whole thing was my fault. So I was ready to keep it to myself. Until I saw something that shattered my heart to pieces. I caught my mom before she put her makeup on, and there were cuts all over her face. And when I asked what happened, she just told me she accidentally walked into a door. I knew I had to do something, but back then, I was just a scrawny 14 year old with no backbone. So in a last resort, I called my stepdad. But right after I pressed the call button, I regretted it, because that's when my dad barged into my room and asked me where the T V. Remote was. I just stayed silent because I already knew what was coming next. And sure enough, I was body slammed into my floor so hard that I almost threw up. I couldn't even hold back my tears, which made my dad even angrier. So as I lay on the floor trying to pretend I was somewhere else, my dad shouted at me for a full five minutes about how pathetic and worthless I was. But that's when I heard a noise from the front door. Within seconds, my dad was pulled off me, and he was hit so hard that red started pouring down his back. Through my blurred vision, I could make out the face of my stepdad. And a feeling of comfort washed over me.

One. I'm not super rich, but things really hit home when I was with a friend and his mother started to panic because she couldn't afford milk for her toddler son, my friend's little brother. I was just walking around with $40 in my pocket for no real reason, so I gave her $20. She was embarrassed to be taking money from a 13 year old, but swallowed her pride for the sake of her children. I knew my friend wasn't as well off, but it never fully hit me what that meant before then. To me, being poor just meant someone couldn't afford nice things. What it meant to struggle with basic necessities like milk never really struck me before that. Two I did not grow up rich, but my husband did. His sister once said I didn't know everyone didn't live in big houses until I went off to college. Apparently she LED a very sheltered life. 3. I realised when I went to college and had friends who were complaining about student loans. 4. When I started talking in school about the pros and cons of Disney World versus Disneyland and people were like you've been on vacation? Lucky. 5. Conversely, I remember a summer where me and my mom lived in a car and I thought it was the coolest thing. Turns out we were just Homeless. Meanwhile, in university there was a guy who didn't understand why we didn't all have our own condos right by the school. He also never understood why we didn't have money to go to Mexico on reading break and would just tell us to ask for a bigger allowance from our trust. He Learned to just stop talking after someone fed him a left hook when he made a comment about how stupid we were for taking out student loans and not just paying tuition upfront. 6 I was about 12 I think. When friends would come over they would go on and on about how big the house was and how I had more games and computers than them. They especially seemed freaked out about the maid. I just started to realize that I didn't have the same circumstances as most. They wouldn't all say it if it weren't true, I assume. I did have other friends with money, especially when I started attending private school, but I didn't realise they were well off either. 7 the first time I went to my best friend's house, his circumstances were the exact opposite. His parents tried their best, but his dad often didn't have much work during the winter and his mom didn't work outside of the home. They had six kids and usually had things like pancakes for dinner. I'm in an upper class part of D. C. With every toy and electronic imaginable and he had none. It was a good lesson for me to learn, but it was a shame that it was at the expense of a person I love so very much. 8 this isn't a great response because I didn't grow up rich, but rather very poor. I met my first best friend in Grade 6. When she brought me to her home, I was flabbergasted. They had a vacuum that plugged into their walls. They could even vacuum downstairs with it. She had a trampoline and Xbox. I begged each time to play with both. She had a small alcove with a mini fridge that was full of ice pops and different sodas. That was cool. I remember thinking I should take more than one because I wouldn't get another chance. When they invited me over for dinner, her mom always made me take extra because I was nervous to ask for seconds. I couldn't believe the amount of food in the house, and we all would have a huge glass of milk with dinner. Milk was always a treat, and being able to drink as much as I wanted was so overwhelming. I just remember being astounded by everything. And three years later they adopted me. Nine I was talking to a friend about going to the town's public beach, and they were saying how horribly crowded it gets in summer. I suddenly realised that I had never had to go to a public beach because I always had at least Two private family beaches to go to. One with cabanas, outdoor showers, and space for cooking. I always had taken it for granted. 10 not rich. But in high school, there was this one kid who wore the same shoes from sophomore to senior year. I kept telling him to buy a new pair, but he would claim that they were broken in and he didn't want to waste money on uncomfortable ones. So I decided to do that thing where the class would surprise him with a new pair of vans for his birthday. But when I asked our classmates to chip in, they all said they didn't have any money to spare. That didn't make sense because most of them had after school jobs. That's when I found out I was the only kid in class who wasn't working to help support their own family.

I still do. So going anonymous for this one. A few years ago, I started working from home. At first I worked in customer service answering calls, but eventually I was given the opportunity to help out with another department. I trained under this guy who showed me what to do, which was basically filling out the same information on various websites over and over again. It was easy, but a bit mind numbing. There were thousands of these to do, and I was just one of the people working on the pile. At first I worked hard to help clear the queue, but then my boss quit and a new person took over who was disorganized in the extreme. A few weeks into his attempt at managing the department, a major component I needed to do my job stopped working. I reported this to my boss, and to my boss's boss, and to my former boss. Basically, um, hey, I can't do my job because this program isn't working. I was basically told it was being worked on, but given nothing else to do. So day after day, I logged in and then proceeded to watch YouTube videos, play games, read books. As long as I was near my desk to respond to direct messages, which came in frequently, I was golden. Eventually, I got pretty bold and started going to bed to Take naps or just heading out to live my life while on the clock. I had the app we used for communication on my phone, so if anyone messaged me, I could respond from wherever I was and appear totally industrious. I knew I was falling into terrible habits, felt guilty, and figured it was just a matter of time before I was discovered. But this literally went on for 18 months without a single person noticing. I was doing nothing and getting paid for 8 hours of work a day. Eventually my new boss was fired or quit. At the same time, the other person working alongside me also left, and suddenly I was the only one left. I was by default in charge of the department. Realising this, I quickly went to work to fix everything. It took several months for me to clear the queue when I worked my butt off. The day I finally caught us up to speed, I was heralded as a hero and given a huge bonus and a new computer. I was also given two employees to train to work under me to help maintain the newly imparted order. The problem is, three employees doing the job is too many. When I evenly divided the work, we had almost nothing to do and could all finish our work in an hour. So eventually I started giving almost all the work to the other two employees and started focusing on running the department. This was literally the easiest job in the world. Every day, I would log in and assign tasks to the two employees, organize all the tables, and then basically go back to watching videos online or doing whatever I wanted with the rest of my day, while again, getting paid for eight hours. I am keeping the details pretty vague and writing this anonymously because that's what I'm still doing. I do about 10 minutes of work a day, and it's been two years. Oh, and everyone at the company thinks I'm just wonderful. I just had a job review and was given another raise.

When I was in preschool, my best friend was thrown into a van and her life ended in the woods, all because her father owed somebody money. For years since then, my mother never let me leave the house. She enrolled me in online self defense classes and taught me to never walk home alone at night. My entire life was spent living in fear that someone would snatch me, just like how they did my best friend. When I got to high school, I was accepted into a prestigious prep school on a partial scholarship. That meant that my mom had to work two jobs, and I had take the bus to school.

But when he saw my pepper spray clipped on, he snatched it and told me, you're just asking to get kidnapped, pretty little lady. I told him to give it back to me, and he said, I think I'll hold on to this. Don't worry, I won't snatch you. My wife would get jealous. I was absolutely disgusted. By him. And no one in the class seemed to care. After class, I went to my guidance counselor's office and told them that my teacher took away my pepper. My guidance counselor told me, good. I hope you know you're not supposed to have pepper spray on school property. I told her I understood that, but it was for my own safety. And I told her that I didn't live close by like most students. And she told me, then you're going to have to learn how to be careful. That entire week I kept watching my back. But on Thursday I ended up accidentally falling asleep on the bus. I remember the bus bumped on the road and that woke me up. As I was waking up, I felt a slimy sensation in my ear. I went to touch my ear and instead I felt another face. There was a man sticking his tongue in my ear. I immediately screamed and tried getting him off of me, but he wouldn't stop. I tried to use my self defence, but it was useless. I tried punching him, but he grabbed my arm, twisting it and breaking it. At that point, the bus driver pulled over and kicked the man off the bus. I don't remember much, but I saw

But when he saw my pepper spray clipped on, he snatched it and told me, you're just asking to get kidnapped, pretty little lady. I told him to give it back to me, and he said, I think I'll hold on to this. Don't worry, I won't snatch you. My wife would get jealous. I was absolutely disgusted. By him. And no one in the class seemed to care. After class, I went to my guidance counselor's office and told them that my teacher took away my pepper. My guidance counselor told me, good. I hope you know you're not supposed to have pepper spray on school property. I told her I understood that, but it was for my own safety. And I told her that I didn't live close by like most students. And she told me, then you're going to have to learn how to be careful. That entire week, I kept watching my back. But on Thursday, I ended up accidentally falling asleep on the bus. I remember the bus bumped on the road, and that woke me up. As I was waking up, I felt a slimy sensation in my ear. I went to touch my ear, and instead I felt another face. There was a man sticking his tongue in my ear. I immediately screamed and tried getting him off of me, but he wouldn't stop. I tried to use my self defense, but it was useless. I tried punching him, but he grabbed my arm, twisting it and breaking it. At that point, the bus driver pulled over and kicked the man off the bus. I don't remember much, but I saw

My cousin Tommy weighed nearly 300 pounds by eighth grade. Kids at school were brutal about it, but at family gatherings, we never mentioned his size. He was just Tommy, the gentle giant who helped grandma pull weeds, always let the younger cousins win at board games, and laughed like a foghorn when something genuinely made him happy. He was everyone's favourite. Every Friday night, our entire family would gather at my aunt's house for dinner. That night, like always, Tommy was sitting cross legged on the floor playing Mario Kart with my little brother, while whiskers, our 17 year old family cat, slept in his usual warm spot near the sliding glass door. Whiskers was ancient. He had survived two house moves, four new babies, and more toddler tailpulls than any living creature should have to endure. We all joked he'd outlive us. Out of nowhere, my little brother came racing in with his new remote control car, zigzagging through the living room like a maniac, showing off to everyone. The car flew right under Tommy's legs. Just as he started getting up to grab a second plate of pizza, his foot caught on the corner of the carpet. He lost his balance. I watched it all in slow motion. His arms flailed his face, and then came the soft, dull crunch when he landed. Most people didn't even hear it, but I did. Whiskers didn't move. He didn't hiss. He Didn't cry, just silent. The whole room froze. Tommy stayed on the floor, pale as a ghost, whispering no over and over while his eyes filled with tears. My dad crossed the room and gently picked up whiskers, wrapping him in the fleece blanket from the recliner, the one whiskers always curled up on. My mom quietly ushered the rest of us into the kitchen. From behind the doorway, I could see Tommy sitting there, shoulders heaving as he sobbed. My aunt knelt beside him, rubbing his back and trying to hold it together. But even she looked shattered. That blanket never came back. By the time we left that night, every trace of whiskers was gone. His toys, his bed, the food and water bowls by the fridge. It was like someone hit delete on his whole existence. We never talked about it again. No one blamed Tommy out loud. But no one quite knew what to say either. It's been six years since then. Tommy still won't come to family dinners. We invite him every week. He always has an

The new girl found out about my P T S D. And decided to take advantage of me. I'm from a war torn country. At 10, I'd wake up to explosions and Glock fire. I lost friends, neighbours, even my middle school crush. One night, people screaming, save me! Save me! And chaos. My dad picked me up and told me to close my eyes. I asked about my mom and sister. He whispered, they're still sleeping. I didn't understand. Then they didn't survive. We fled to America, hoping for peace. But the trauma followed. My school community tried their best. Loud sounds triggered me, especially fireworks. One moment I'd hear a pop, and the next, I'd be curled into a ball on the floor. Then Angela transferred in. She decided I was faking it, that I was too young to have P T S D. So she tested me. She'd clap right behind me in the hall. Once I dropped to the floor, trembling, and people laughed. In assemblies, she'd crack her knuckles behind me just to watch me crawl under the bleachers. Chemistry. She'd accidentally drop heavy books next to my desk, leaving my hands too shaky to write. One time, she followed me home. When I was halfway down the street, she screamed. Same pitch as the cries from that night. I sprinted home, fumbling with keys. Locked myself in the bathroom, trying to breathe. Her worst Trick, an app that played Glock Fire. She hit her phone in her backpack and time the shots to go off. When I walked by, I'd hit the floor in terror while she looked concerned like everyone else. I thought it was all behind me. After graduation, four years passed.

My twin sister was better than me at everything, and she made sure we all knew it. It all started with a scoop of ice cream when we were 6 years old. I had chosen the rainbow sherbet, while she chose mint chocolate chip. Mine tasted like vomit that had been dipped in a toilet filled with diarrhea, and I threw it out straight away. Meanwhile, hers tasted amazing. Good job! Our parents yelled. We always knew you were the better twin. They laughed like it was a joke, but I knew it wasn't. Fast forward to ninth grade when we had our first set of finals. Vanessa had gone on and on about how studying was a waste of time and she'll only be young once. Well, I was studying in my room at 2:00am when she burst through the door looking for a charger. As soon as she saw me in front of my open textbook, she froze and stood like a deer caught in headlights. You're studying? What the f? I just rolled my eyes and shut the door. Over the next few days, Vanessa was practically glued to the books. At first I was happy for her until the results came out. I didn't even have to ask what she got because she came running up to me and waved a piece of paper in my face. Ha ha! You fat bitch! I got an A+! Let Me see what you got. I showed her my A. She bent over from how hard she was laughing. I effing knew I was smarter than you. But the worst part came later. When we were all at the dinner table. My sister whipped out a laminated copy of her exam paper. My parents didn't even wait to ask me what I got before singing her praises. Meanwhile, our dad was beaming with pride. I got an A, I whispered when the kitchen got a little quieter. You need to start being more like Vanessa. My mom instantly responded. From there, I started to isolate myself from the family. I'd spend all my time at home with our black cat, midnight, and killed any urge to talk to them. By the time college applications came around, I was practically buzzing with excitement to finally move out. Vanessa was beside me when she got the email from her dream college. She was bouncing up and down on the chair faster than a trained window girl. There it was, in plain red aerial font. Rejected. I could see the light in her eyes die out.

That year? I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she reached eighth grade. But I also had a student named miles who just couldn't sit still. He constantly bugged the girls, always trying to flirt, and it usually ended with him getting slapped or sent to the office. I had sent him down so many times that the front desk basically expected him every day. Eventually, I moved him to the front of the room just so I could keep an eye on him. One day, he asked me if he could sit in the back. He didn't argue or act out. He just asked nicely. For some reason, I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and the entire room was quiet. That's when I heard whispering from the back. I looked up and saw miles showing something to another student. First glance, it looked exactly like a handgun. I froze for a second. I didn't know if I was seeing it right. Maybe it was a toy or a prop. But I couldn't tell from where I was sitting. And I knew I needed to get a better look without making a scene. I got up to help a student near the back and use that chance to look again. This time I knew for sure it wasn't fake. It was real. I felt sweat drip down my face. My hands were shaking while I quietly pulled out my phone under the desk and tried to call 9 1 1. But the room was too quiet. I couldn't risk saying anything. I couldn't just leave the class, either. I had to keep everyone safe. And most of all, I needed to get my daughter out of there. I texted the assistant principal in all caps, telling him exactly what I had seen. Then I waited. I kept glancing at my daughter, trying to keep it together, but minutes passed and no response came. I knew I had to do something. I quietly called over one of the students I trusted and handed her a note I had written. It said, ask me to go to the bathroom, find the assistant principal, show him this text, tell him to check his phone and leave the building right away. She nodded and left without a word. I went back to my desk and acted like nothing was wrong. Five long minutes later, someone knocked on the door. The assistant principal walked in, calm and casual, and started chatting with a couple students near the front. Then he looked at miles. Can I talk to you outside for a minute? Miles looked a little confused, but stood up as he walked past my

During the middle of a test, our loud speaker turned on, and a voice we never recognized screamed out to the entire school, lockdown! Lockdown! This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill! Everyone in my classroom looked at each other in total disbelief. Our teacher got right into action. She locked the door, pulled down the shades, and started instructing us. Need the strong boys to help me barricade the class door quickly. Everyone else, hide in the back of the room and start texting your parents to let them know what's going on. I'm a bigger kid, so I helped barricade the classroom door with desks and a bookshelf with a couple others. While barricading, we heard footsteps run down the hallway, and we instantly all ducked. Us ducking scared all the students in the back to the point that one girl started having a panic attack. Everyone tried to calm her down, but I guess all of us crowding around her made it worse. She started to scream at the top of her lungs, saying, I'm not ready to go to heaven. We tried calming her down, but our teacher wasn't having it. She covered the girl's mouth and stuffed it with paper. She cursed at her in silence, telling her to keep it down or she was going to risk all of us losing our lives. Just us. We got The girl to shut up. We heard shots down the hall. Half of us started crying while the rest tried to figure out an escape plan before it was too late. Our teacher told. Told us that there were protocols that needed to be followed, but she had kids that she needed to get home to and needed to make sure we all got back home safely. She ended up making a makeshift screwdriver to pry open the windows. Then she directed us to jump into the nearby bushes. She told us, I can't promise you won't break any bones, but you will survive. Just when the first group was going to start jumping, the loudspeaker turned on again. The lockdown drill is now over, but do not leave your classrooms. I repeat, remain in your classrooms. Everyone cried out of relief and was texting others about what happened. More specifically, a video surfaced of a masked man. He emailed it to a couple people with a message saying he was going to Swiss cheese everyone in the building. Unfortunately for him, everyone recognized the voice behind the mask as our valedictorian, since he did our morning announcements. In fact, that very same morning, he was the one who told us all to have a good day. A couple weeks after the incident, his best friend told us what had happened. Apparently, our valedictorian's mother passed away the night before.

Some people are wolves and sheep's clothing. I was driving home from my janitor shift when C P S. Called me. Mister Williams, we've received a formal complaint about severe neglect of your daughter, Sadie. A case worker is at your home now. My hand started shaking so bad I had to pull over. I literally floored it the rest of the way home and found a woman in a blazer sitting in my living room with Sadie. My 7 year old was crying and kept asking if she did something wrong. Through the window, I saw Missus Johnson, our neighbour, watching from her porch with a worried expression. Rushed over to Sadie and she buried her face in my work uniform. The CPS worker introduced herself as Janet and started listing off accusations about Sadie being chronically underdressed and showing signs of neglect. She kept looking at Sadie's purple dress, which was faded but clean, and Sadie loved it. That's when my late wife's parents showed up. Richard and Carol walked in like they owned the place. They've been notified about the investigation. Pulled out his phone, showing photos of Sadie at school with circles around her clothing compared to other kids. Carol suggested Sadie stay with them temporarily while I got back on my feet. The custody hearing happened two weeks later. Sadie sat in the witness chair with her feet dangling. I love my daddy, she told the judge. My clothes are special. Because they were Mommy's. Daddy washes them every week and I don't want new ones. But the judge just nodded absently when he granted temporary custody to Richard and Carol. I felt my legs go weak. Sadie started screaming for me, but the bailiff held her back. Supervised visits were torture. Two hours weekly in a sterile room. Sadie would cling to me, whispering she wanted to go home. She'd stopped eating at her grandparents house and lost five pounds. Two weeks and Mrs. Smith pulled me aside. She'd been Sadie's teacher since kindergarten and lost her own mother young. She'd been documenting everything. Sadie hasn't spoken in class for a week, she said, showing me her notes. The school psychologist, Doctor Morgan, confirmed severe regression. They recommended increased visitation, but Richard and Carol pushed back. They claimed I was stuck in grief and couldn't properly parent. He's confusing the child by not moving on, Carol told the judge. They offered to let me see Sadie monthly if I agreed to permanent guardianship. I stood

Thanks to my ADHD, learning Pig Latin became a weird hobby. After my sister's funeral, my parents just sat me in front of the TV for the whole day. I only watched one thing on repeat single episode of Teen Titans Go where all the characters started messing with each other by speaking Pig Latin. That day of non stop rewatching was all it took for me to pick up the language. I never thought it would be useful for anything until high school when a new teacher showed up. Let's call him Mister Ham. He put everything to the test, the huge language geek, and got a kick out of acting like he was smarter than everyone else. One day I missed an assignment and apologized to Mr. Ham. He gave me this fake smile and said it pay up yai yai upe on time. Say up it stay which means pick up a book sometime stupid. When he said that, I just smiled. Mr. Ham thought he was the only person in the world who knew pig Latin. He failed me for the assignment, but I didn't care because what I had in store for him was way worse. For the next month, I listened closely whenever he muttered under his breath. Turns out it wasn't just me. He talked crap about every single student in pig Latin. He'd say disgusting things about the girl students like or yai es be On lay ugs Jai Ra AI oing gai otai astaway, which translates to, your lesbian jugs are going to waste. I'd see him look at kids with disabilities and hear him say, America's next brightest homeless here. Hearing all these things over and over was terrible. But it felt good, too, because I was going to expose him. Everyone in the school faculty loved him. They never batted an eye at his pig Latin. They just assumed it was some foreign language he picked up while traveling. Time and time again, Mr. Ham would insult me. If I dropped a pencil up it stay answered a question wrong, you could stay coughed. You could every little thing. I was stupid, but I knew something about Mister Ham. I did some digging and found his biggest secret. For my next essay, I wrote the whole thing in Pig Latin, explaining how I knew he forged his degree. I told him I'd run a background check and found he wasn't credited at any university in the US. His degree was actually a three month certificate program in South America just to learn English. After I handed in the essay the next day, he pulled me aside in class. He looked scared. In perfect English, he said, please don't ruin this.

During the middle of a test, our loudspeaker turned on, and a voice we never recognized screamed out to the entire school, lockdown! Lockdown! This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. Everyone in my classroom looked at each other in total disbelief. Our teacher got right into action. She locked the door, pulled down the shades, and started instructing us. I need the strong boys to help me barricade the class door quickly. Everyone else, hide in the back of the room and start texting your parents to let them know what's going on. I'm a bigger kid, so I helped barricade the classroom door with desks and a bookshelf with a couple others. While barricading, we heard footsteps run down the hallway, and we instantly all ducked. Us ducking scared all the students in the back to the point that one girl started having a panic attack. Everyone tried to calm her down, but I guess all of us crowding around her made it worse. She started to scream at the top of her lungs, saying, I'm not ready to go to heaven. We tried calming her down, but our teacher wasn't having it. She covered the girl's mouth and stuffed it with paper. He cursed at her in silence, telling her to keep it down or she was going to risk all of us losing our lives. Just us. We got the Girl to shut up. We heard shots down the hall. Half of us started crying while the rest tried to figure out an escape plan before it was too late. Our teacher told us that there were protocols that needed to be followed, but she had kids that she needed to get home to and needed to make sure we all got back home safely. She ended up making a makeshift screwdriver to pry open the windows. Then she directed us to jump into the nearby bushes. She told us, I can't promise you won't break any bones, but you will survive. Just when the first group was going to start jumping, the loudspeaker turned on again. The lockdown drill is now over, but do not leave your classrooms. I repeat, remain in your classrooms. Everyone cried out of relief, and students were texting others about what happened. More specifically, a video surfaced of a masked man. He emailed it to a couple people with a message saying he was going to Swiss cheese everyone in the building. Unfortunately for him, everyone recognized the voice behind the mask as our valedictorian, since he did our morning announcements. In fact, that very same morning, he was the one who told us all to have a good day. A couple weeks after the incident, his best friend told us what had happened. Apparently, our valedictorian's mother passed away the night before.

One. Jesus. This is probably the best answer. As a devout Christian who was a Deacon in high school, I've noticed people forget that Jesus was a socialist anarchist. Likely a brown skinned twink wizard Jew who lived and gave his life to bring freedom and prosperity to the downtrodden and to defy oppressive theocracies. That's our Messiah, not the gun toting nationalist, capitalist and fascist homophobe that many seem to portray today. I actually read the Bible, unlike most people claiming to pass oppressive legislation in the name of God. 2. Kurt Cobain Kurt hated his fan base even when he was alive. Many of them were the jocks and popular kids who bullied him as a teenager. Today's generation with their mass produced Nirvana shirts would be even more cringe worthy to him. Just listen to some of his lyrics like smells like Teen Spirit or in Bloom. He also would likely be extremely disappointed in Dave Grohl for being what some consider a sell out. I saw Nirvana at Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1989 when Chad Channing was still their drummer. They weren't mainstream yet, and while they were cool, they didn't seem destined for the kind of fame they achieved. Kurt would have been shocked too. 3. John Lennon John would hate how the Beatles are still treated as if they're gods. He was sick of it even back then and would definitely be sick Of it today if he were alive. He was all about tearing down the Beatles myth and reminding people that the dream is over. He was by far the least interested in any sort of Beatles reunion. George Harrison likely felt the same way, but had to endure the Beatles idolization for another 20 years after John's death. 4 Pat Tillman, the NFL player who enlisted in the army after 9 11 and was killed in action KIA in Afghanistan, has had his image co opted by right wing politics as a poster boy for patriotism and nationalism. In reality, Tillman was very much a Liberal and had become deeply disillusioned with both the military and the wars in the Middle East.

One, John O'Neill, headed the investigation of the attack on the USS Cole. Warned FBI about al Qaeda and bin Laden was basically told to shut up. Left the FBI to head security at the World Trade Center because he knew there would be another attack there. Eventually, after the first car bombing in the parking ramp, he died on September 11th. 2 there was a shun Japanese politician who had spent a lot of his town's budget on building a tsunami wall that was built higher than any tsunami ever recorded in the area. Almost all people in that town cursed him for wasting their money until his death. Then came the big 2011 triple disaster in Japan. No one from the town died thanks to the barrier, which withheld the biggest tsunami to ever hit. 3. Vladimir Komarov, one of the first Russian cosmonauts. He knew the Soyuz space capsule was unsafe. He told them repeatedly, but flew anyway to spare the life of his replacement pilot before liftoff. He demanded that when he died, all officials at the Kremlin would have to attend his funeral and see what they did to him. All they were able to retrieve was a charred heel bone. 4. Carrie Fisher. She tried exposing Harvey Weinstein long before anyone else did and was labeled crazy because of it. She died about a year before the truth was revealed.

When I was 12 or so, I walked into my dad's office to find him counting money. He says, don't tell mom, and you'll find out what it's for. So I don't say a thing. Two days later, he woke me up early to run errands with him. We came back with a new, used, but new for us car. He also said if I don't tell how much he spent on it, he'll let me drive it. It was only a couple hundred dollars, but we were broke, and she would have been mad. My mother tried so hard to find out, but I kept the secret. So anytime we were in an open space, like an empty lot, he would let me drive it. I felt like the coolest kid in middle school, knowing how to drive a car. Again, don't tell your mother, he says. When I got my permit at 16, I was so excited to drive it for real. I asked my mother if I can drive her around when she has to go out. But she says, absolutely not, since I have no experience. Well, I can't argue because I don't want to get dad in trouble. This goes on for a few weeks. I keep asking, she keeps telling me no. This finally happened one day while dad was home and overheard. He comes in the room, gives me a nod, and says, To my mother's. He's a better driver than you. Anyway. Tosses me the keys and tells mom everything. I was so stoked and cheering, I can drive! I can drive! Dad says, drive it! If you can keep a secret for that long, you can keep the car, too.

One when I was confused about people on Maury complaining their spouse was at the club, and I couldn't figure out what type of country club would let people like that through the front security gate. Two after I had gotten laid off for the first time a few years ago, I took a break for about a month before diving into a job search. I was at the self checkout at the grocery store next to a woman paying with food stamps. I had recently gotten $100,000 from my grandmother's inheritance and it hit me. I'm unemployed, not even trying to find a job, and I just got a boatload of money because somebody else passed away and she's the one people think is the freeloader. Three my parents are wealthy, but I grew up in a place where many of my peers parents were super duper crazy wealthy, so I had a really skewed understanding of wealth. It was really eye opening for me. When I went to college, I didn't have to take out student loans, my parents were able to just pay for it. But I had friends who, even with financial aid, had to work their butts off year round to cover the cost of school. I realised pretty quickly just how privileged I was and that I did in fact grow up with wealth. 4. I took my friend to my Parents cabin and he said, wow, this is nicer than my house. Five. When I was a kid, my best friend came to our house for the first time and kept saying wow. He was really impressed that we had two TVs. It embarrassed me enough that I didn't tell him we actually had four. Six. Becoming an adult and realising that I have extremely good role models as parents because when they have disagreements, they talk them out and I have never ever heard them argue or bad mouth each other. I also realised that as a kid my parents got me the mental health help that I needed, even though it was expensive, and continued that care for as long as I have needed it. Seven. Every summer I went to eight weeks of overnight camp or some other cool summer program. A 30 day bus tour across the western US, Three weeks in Australia. I had no idea what those cost at the time. 8. I don't really come from wealth, just solidly upper middle class, but as part of my job I do home visits and have many clients who are poor. When I first started my career in my 20s, I was shocked to discover there were people in the U S. Who lived in homes with no indoor plumbing or electricity, with dirt floors or had outdoor kitchens. Not like a barbecue set up, but because there was no kitchen inside where they lived. So they had to cook on an oil drum outside. I had no idea. Nine. I was gonna say. I realised how privileged I was when I spent a summer with my great grandmother in a small village in rural Hungary. No indoor running water. The only phone was at the church and everyone came out to touch the rental car we drove there in. This was in the late 1980s. 10 my parents love to travel. By the time I was 16, I had been to every continent aside from Antarctica. I didn't realize that this was privileged behavior until I went to college and most of the guys I met had never left the country.

My mom went in to have a pacemaker installed. A relatively minor procedure. They were going to keep her overnight. The morning after the implantation, she was in severe pain. The woman, who would never take even a Tylenol, was saying the pain was a 10/10. The nurses called the cardiologist, but he would only order Tylenol 3, as he said she really shouldn't be in any pain. I got on the phone with him to explain that she was suffering horribly, and my sister and I were very worried and needed him to give her something to help her. He said, you girls are just too hysterical. Why don't you go get something to eat? I was furious. We were in our 40s, certainly not girls, and not having some sort of fit of p. The nurse on the floor finally got another doctor to approve more serious pain meds. They think Mom's lung was Nick during the procedure. We took her home, and over the next day or so, she got so lethargic it was scary. I took her to the cardiologist along with my dad, and we explained that she was really not doing well. The doctor listened to her heart and said, it's working great. She's fine. I told him that no, she was not fine and that this inability to bounce back was very concerning and not like her at all. This arrogant doctor, Said, do you see the degree hanging on the wall over there? I got nose to nose with him and said, I don't think you want to start comparing IQs or education with me. Furthermore, you don't know my mother like we do. And I'm here to tell you that something is terribly wrong. At that point, my father, a much nicer person than myself, shushed me and we took her home. That night, my mom went to bed fairly early. A little while later, she came out with her pillow and blanket and said she wanted to sleep on the couch in the family room where we were, because she was afraid she was going to die alone in the bedroom. I immediately put her in the car and raced her to the ER. They didn't want to treat her because they said she was under the care of a cardiologist. What they didn't know is I had already called Kaiser's head of medical affairs and fired the cardiologist. Once I used the executive's name, the ER doctor agreed to evaluate mom. They found out she was bleeding internally, dangerously dehydrated, and terribly anemic. She could have died. I am so over arrogant doctors. Never again. They either partner with me or they are history.

Everybody looked at the table, looked at me, which is about half the people there. Dot I guess I was exhausted from all the questioning. I was questioned by multiple people multiple times in the pressure of it all cause I kind of lost it. He asked the question, I looked across the table at her, and she told her dad to stop it. Her dad smiles and jokingly says that he'd really like to hear my response, and her uncle also said he'd like to know. I looked at my date and said, can I talk to you alone for a minute? To which her dad laughs loudly and then says I made him nervous. So everybody is laughing now and I guess it was a big joke. Then I said to my date, hey, can I talk to you alone for a minute? I stood up in place kind of. It was one of those long bench seats and I couldn't push it back cause other people were sitting on it. Then her sister says, oh, there are no secrets in this family. Speak your mind! People then laugh again and everybody starts making jokes about not having secrets. And this man who married into the family somehow tells me that he remembers being in my place, and he says, let me give you some Advice the best thing to do right now is speak your mind and be honest. Then others join in an echo his sentiment. All jokingly, I think. Dot. So I looked at my date, and she says something like, you can tell me anything here. We're all family. She also, I think, was joking.

When the allies liberated the concentration camps in Germany at the end of World War 2, they did not release the homosexual prisoners. 2. During World War 2, many people in France were generally receptive to Nazi ideals, and under occupation some even participated in sending people to camps. However, after the war, history was often rewritten to glorify the resistance, which was actually made up of a small group of individuals opposing Nazi occupation. 3. The business plot. Yes, a group of powerful Wall Street figures tried to raise an army of 500,000 men to seize the White House, overthrow FDR, and install a fascist government. And yes, Congress investigated it under seal and concluded that the plot was real, but never named the conspirators. It's somewhat similar to what happened with Epstein. 4. There were more countries in the axis powers than just Germany, Italy, and Japan. 5. Expansionist Japan and the atrocities they committed during the 1930s are completely skipped over in most school curriculum, even though it was less than 100 years ago. I've always found that baffling.

Soulja Boy beat a pregnant woman into having a miscarriage. 2. Jack Nicholson beat a prostitute that he hired to the point of irreversible brain damage. 3. Travis Scott essentially leaving his manager for dead in the studio. His loyal ex manager who suffered from seizures had one while Travis was with him. Travis abandoned him while it was happening and went home, then texted him firing him a day later saying I can't have a manager who's shaking on the ground and shit. The lack of empathy continued with Astro World. 4. Paul Walker has entered the chat. So has his significantly younger girlfriend. He was 33 and she was 15 if I recall. Feel free to look it up. 5. Ronald Reagan sold weapons to Iranian terrorists and gave the money to bunch of coke dealers in Central America to fight communism. Reagan essentially is the reason crack become so popular in the 80s despite being one of the toughest presidents on drugs. 6. Steve sociopath jobs he berated his daughter for being born to his mistress, refused to install heating in her bedroom, reiterated she isn't getting a penny of his $400 million fortune, then told her she smelled like a toilet on his deathbed. I hope she's an avid Samsung consumer.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years and have lived together for nearly two years. I am at university and work as a manager and he has a full time job at around 30 to 40 hours a week. At the start it was your stereotypical happy and progressive relationship. He got me flowers, made me coffee in the mornings, cooked his favourite meals if he had a bad day, and we would go on dates. Our friends used us as a template for the perfect relationship since we knew how to communicate and anything that almost became a fight was resolved within the day. We were both on the same wavelength. With everything in the past year, it's become tough to have good communication. I kept doing what we've always done and brought up anything bothering me and how to resolve it. But he started making empty promises. For example, my university semester started and I got a job promotion. So I asked him if we could shuffle the house chores since I was doing many hours. He said yeah, of course and did the usual hug and kiss, but nothing changed. If I bring it up again, he will brush it off.

In basic, our drill sergeant was obsessed with what he called the 30 second sweep before inspections. We had 30 seconds to scan our area and fix anything out of place. Miss something, everyone suffers. Ten years later, I'm a software developer at a major tech company. Our team was presenting to the C E O. A career making moment. Five minutes before I did my instinctive 30 second sweep of our presentation materials. Noticed a tiny error in our financial projections. A decimal point that changed a 1.5 million figure to $15 million. Everyone else had missed it through dozens of reviews. I quickly fixed it, thinking nothing of it. During the presentation, the CEO stopped specifically at that slide. These numbers seem reasonable, he said. Not inflated like most pitches I see. Later, my boss pulled me aside. How did you catch that? The board would have crucified us with the wrong number. I just shrugged and said, 30 second sweep. He looked confused, so I explained the drill sergeant's method. Before any high stakes situation, take 30 seconds to check everything one last time, assuming something is wrong. Now my entire department does 30 second sweeps before major presentations. The CEO even implemented it company wide. After my boss told him the story, my drill sergeant would laugh off knowing his inspection technique is now corporate policy at a Fortune 500 company. Sometimes the most valuable Training isn't what they put in the manual

He just posted something horrifying on his Snapchat story. And my best friend went missing three years ago without a single trace on where he went. I thought it was super odd. The police dropped the case after a couple days of looking and his parents just stopped completely searching after that. I assumed that was just their way of grieving and that I would never see him again in my life until two weeks ago. I was just watching some YouTube shorts before I went to sleep when I got a notification that made my heart stop. Cody McCain just posted on his story. I thought it was a prank or something, but when I clicked the story I knew it wasn't. His story was just a picture of a black background with two simple words on it. Hello Daniel. My stomach dropped when I saw that weird capital A in my name. Because it was Cody's way of writing it and nobody else on earth did that. I stared at my screen in confusion for 10 straight minutes before finally replying to his story with a sup. I didn't expect whoever this was to reply, but it only took three seconds before I got a message back. It's been a while, he wrote. I should have called the cops immediately, but instead I wanted to believe this was him and asked where the actual hell have you been? I Can't explain yet, but I'm here now. We texted for the rest of the night about everything we did together, from our legendary Xbox battles to the time we accidentally set off the school fire alarm. And even when he caught me eating out his sister. However, something felt seriously wrong, because every time I asked him to Facetime, he just say no. But I needed to see him, so I asked him for his location, and all he replied with was, it's not time. So then I told him, I miss you so much it hurts. Just let me see you. And he responded instantly with, I'm right here. Just take a look behind you. I turned around so fast, my neck cracked, and no one was there. But then I spotted something on my wall that definitely wasn't there before. It was a perfectly drawn S using a super bright shape.

I just found out the horrifying reason why, after my grandmother's funeral, my parents kept insisting on keeping the chair that she always used to sit in. It was this old wooden thing with chipped red paint and a spot on the headrest where her hair used to rub it smooth. At first, we just kept it in the corner of our living room, and it just sat there empty while collecting dust. But about a month later, we started noticing little things. The chair would shift position. First it faced the window, then the television, then the front door. Nobody said anything. We all just silently agreed not to touch it. Then the sound started. Every night around 3:00am, I would hear a slow, rhythmic creaking from the living room. I thought maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me. But the third night, I got up and caught it moving with my own eyes. The chair was rocking back and forth, almost like someone was sitting on it, even though the room was completely empty. I told my dad the next morning what happened, and he didn't even look surprised. She's just visiting, he said, while pouring himself a coffee like it was nothing. Don't bother her. The next night, I couldn't help it. I tiptoed into the living room at 2:00am, hid behind the couch, and waited. And at exactly 3:00am, the chair started To rock again. But this time there was something new. It looked like someone invisible was actively sitting on it and rocking it. I ran as fast as I could back to my room, but I couldn't sleep that night. I decided to set up an old nanny cam in the living room that we had in the basement. I pointed it straight at the chair and let it record all night. And when I watched the footage the next morning, nothing came up. At first, the camera showed a dark living room with the chair in the corner. But at 2:00am, a shadow slid across the floor. Then the shadow got on the chair and it started rocking. I thought I'd seen it all, but out of nowhere, the shadow looked like it was knitting. Grandma love knitting. She would make scarves, sweater

Like, literally had to meet them first. And Emma told Jacob he could only come if he brought a friend, too, because Nick wanted to make sure he wasn't some weirdo. Guess who got volunteered? Me. I figured it'd be easy. Show up, eat some food, make small talk, let Jacob work his magic. But the second we walked through that door, I knew we were screwed. Nick took one look at Jacob, and his face went stone cold. This dude was built like a linebacker and had the personality of a prison guard. During dinner, Nick kept firing questions at Jacob like he was interrogating him. What's your GPA? What are your plans after college? How much money does your dad make? Meanwhile, Jacob was sweating bullets and could barely get a word out. I kept trying to change the subject, but her brother wasn't having it. That's when I noticed something. I still Had my old Epipen in my backpack from when I was allergic to nuts as a kid. I wasn't allergic anymore. Hadn't been for years. But I kept it just in case. And sitting there watching Jacob crash and burn, I got this crazy idea. About halfway through the main course, I started coughing. Just little ones at first, then bigger. I put my hand to my throat and made this pan.

During the middle of a test, our loud speaker turned on, and a voice we never recognized screamed out to the entire school, lockdown! Lockdown! This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill! Everyone in my classroom looked at each other in total disbelief. Our teacher got right into action. She locked the door, pulled down the shades, and started instructing us. Need the strong boys to help me barricade the class door quickly. Everyone else, hide in the back of the room and start texting your parents to let them know what's going on. I'm a bigger kid, so I helped barricade the classroom door with desks and a bookshelf with a couple others. While barricading, we heard footsteps run down the hallway, and we instantly all ducked. Us ducking scared all the students in the back to the point that one girl started having a panic attack. Everyone tried to calm her down, but I guess all of us crowding around her made it worse. She started to scream at the top of her lungs, saying, I'm not ready to go to heaven. We tried calming her down, but our teacher wasn't having it. She covered the girl's mouth and stuffed it with paper. She cursed at her in silence, telling her to keep it down or she was going to risk all of us losing our lives. Just us. We got The girl to shut up. We heard shots down the hall. Half of us started crying while the rest tried to figure out an escape plan before it was too late. Our teacher told. Told us that there were protocols that needed to be followed, but she had kids that she needed to get home to and needed to make sure we all got back home safely. She ended up making a makeshift screwdriver to pry open the windows. Then she directed us to jump into the nearby bushes. She told us, I can't promise you won't break any bones, but you will survive. Just when the first group was going to start jumping, the loudspeaker turned on again. The lockdown drill is now over, but do not leave your classrooms. I repeat, remain in your classrooms. Everyone cried out of relief and were texting others about what happened. More specifically, a video surfaced of a masked man. He emailed it to a couple people with a message saying he was going to Swiss cheese everyone in the building. Unfortunately for him, everyone recognized the voice behind the mask as our valedictorian, since he did our morning announcements. In fact, that very same morning, he was the one who told us all to have a good day. A couple weeks after the incident, his best friend told us what had happened. Apparently, our valedictorian's mother passed away the night before our test, and he wasn't able to study, which drove Him insane, so

That year? I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she reached eighth grade. But I also had a student named miles who just couldn't sit still. He constantly bugged the girls, always trying to flirt, and it usually ended with him getting slapped or sent to the office. I had sent him down so many times that the front desk basically expected him every day. Eventually, I moved him to the front of the room just so I could keep an eye on him. One day, he asked me if he could sit in the back. He didn't argue or act out. He just asked nicely. For some reason, I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and the entire room was quiet. That's when I heard whispering from the back. I looked up and saw miles showing something to another student. First glance, it looked exactly like a handgun. I froze for a second. I didn't know if I was seeing it right. Maybe it was a toy or a prop. But I couldn't tell from where I was sitting. And I knew I needed to get a better look without making a scene. I got up to help a student near the back and use that chance to look again. This time I knew for sure it wasn't fake. It was real. I felt sweat drip down my face. My hands were shaking while I quietly pulled out my phone under the desk and tried to call 9 1 1. But the room was too quiet. I couldn't risk saying anything. I couldn't just leave the class, either. I had to keep everyone safe. And most of all, I needed to get my daughter out of there. I texted the assistant principal in all caps, telling him exactly what I had seen. Then I waited. I kept glancing at my daughter, trying to keep it together, but minutes passed and no response came. I knew I had to do something. I quietly called over one of the students I trusted and handed her a note I had written. It said, ask me to go to the bathroom. Find the assistant principal, show him this tech, tell him to check his phone and leave the building right away. She nodded and left without a word. I went back to my desk and acted like nothing was wrong. Five long minutes later, someone knocked on the door. The assistant principal walked in, calm and casual, and started chatting with a couple students near the front. Then he looked at miles. Can I talk to you

I found out I was adopted when I was 8. My mom sat me down with a photo album and pointed to a picture of a woman holding a tiny baby wrapped in a blue blanket. That's your birth mom, she said. She loved you so much. She wanted you to have a better life than she could give you. Growing up, I had this image in my head of who my birth mom might be. Maybe she was a famous actress or a doctor who traveled the world. World saving lives. My adoptive parents were amazing, but I still wondered about the woman who gave me her eyes and her curly hair. On my 16th birthday, my parents gave me a small wooden box. Inside was a letter and a silver necklace with a tiny heart pendant. The letter was from my birth mom, written right after I was born. She said she hoped to meet me someday when I was ready. I wasn't ready then. I tucked the box away in my closet and tried to forget about it. But during my first year of college, I started having these dreams about her. I'd wake up feeling like I was missing something important. So I finally called the adoption agency to. Weeks later, they contacted me with her information. Her name was Diane, and she lived just three hours away. We agreed to meet at a diner halfway Between us, I got there early and sat in my car, almost backing out five times. When I finally went inside, I spotted her immediately. She had my exact same nose. And the way she fidgeted with her coffee cup. I do that, too. She stood up when she saw me, her hands shaking. We hugged awkwardly, then sat across from each other, both of us too nervous to eat. I've thought about you every single day, she said. I was only 19 when I had you, my boy

My uncle told me buy old muscle cars and fix them up for cheap. There's only so many left and you'll get more car for your money than any new ride. When I was 22, I just landed my first decent job at a tech startup and got approved for a loan on a brand new luxury sedan. Everyone my age was driving German cars, showing off their success with monthly payments they could barely afford, but uncle pulled me aside at a family barbecue. Uncle wasn't the type to talk much, but he always had some cool old car project going, so I figured he knew what he was talking about. I followed him over to his garage and watched him point at a beat up muscle car covered in a tarp. He explained, that pile of rust cost me $2,000 in 1995. Sold it last month for $140,000. Your fancy new car will be worth half what you paid the moment you drive it off the lot. These old beauties only go up if you know what you're doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks. Kept thinking about what uncle said while I was looking at all these shiny new cars at the dealership. Finally I called them up and canceled my loan approval. Instead of putting money down on a luxury sedan, I started hunting for old muscle cars I could actually afford to buy and Fix up within two months. I bought three rusted out classics from the late 60s. There was a Camaro that wouldn't start, a Corvette with a blown engine, and a Chevelle that looked like it had been sitting in a field for decades. Parents were mortified when neighbors started complaining about the junkyard in our driveway. My friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out they wouldn't shut up about their new rides. They'd show off their leather seats and touch screens while roasting my cars. One friend laughed and said I'd never get any girls driving rust buckets like that. Only cougars who were into vintage stuff. Another kept saying I looked like I was collecting scrap metal, not chicks. Brag about their heated seats and backup cameras, then joke that the only feature my cars had was breaking down. I'll admit there were moments pulling up next to their shiny Bmws that I wondered if uncle was wrong. But then I'd remember that 140,000 dollar sale and I stayed.

After three years of raising my sister's son while she spiraled through addiction, we were minutes away from making it official. Then my sister Tina burst through the doors like a Hurricane, fresh from her sixth stint in rehab. She wasn't supposed to be there. She agreed to the adoption, signed the preliminary papers, and vanished to some wellness retreat in Malibu that our parents paid for. But there she was, tanned and put together, demanding the judge hear her out. I've changed, she announced, her voice carrying that familiar manipulative tremor I heard since we were kids sharing a bedroom. I want my son back. Nathan, now say, years old, looked up from his activity book and whispered, Aunt Annie, why is the yelling lady here? I had no answer that wouldn't shatter his world. Tina had found some high powered attorney who specialized in parental rights cases. They were claiming emotional distress when she signed the papers saying she was coerced while grieving her boyfriend's overdose. The same boyfriend who had supplied her with substances that left her unconscious on the floor while three year old Nathan called 9 1 1. But the law didn't care about Nathan's broken heart. All that mattered was biology. The same biology that made me love the person who was about to destroy everything I built. The judge gave us three weeks for a full review. Three weeks of pure hell. Every Morning. Nathan asked if today was the day he had to leave. Every night I held him while he cried about bad dreams where strangers took him away. And every night I cried, too, wondering if I was being selfish trying to stop my own sister from being with her baby. Two weeks in, Tina called and asked if we could meet. Look what I've accomplished, she said, feeling with the same pride she'd shown when she got her first A in high school. Inside were photos of a pristine apartment, bank statements showing a trust fund our parents had set up, certificates from therapy programs, and a job offer from Dad's company. I'm not the same person who left Nathan crying in his crib while I shot up in the bathroom, she said. My heart was breaking because I could see she believed it. I could see she loved him in her fractured way, the same way she loved our childhood hamster until she forgot to feed it and it died. Tina, I said gently, using the same tone I'd used when we were teenagers and she'd come home drunk, you've been clean for six months. That's amazing. But Nathan's been with me for three years. He doesn't remember living with you. Then I'll help him remember, she shot back, her eyes lighting up with the same manic energy she had as a kid when she'd get fixated on some new project. I'll show him the videos I took. Of his first steps, his first words. I'm his real mother. You gave birth to him. I corrected fighting back.

Our girls LaCrosse team had never made it past regionals, but this year felt different. We were undefeated, sharper than we'd ever been, and one win away from the state championship. All we had to do was beat our rival school, a team that hadn't lost a final in six years. Their coach, Mr. Carmichael, used to coach college LaCrosse, but had mysteriously been fired and quietly hired by a school desperate for wins. We even knew about his reputation over at our school for being a complete hard ass and making his players cry all the time. Three days before the championship, my best friend and assistant captain, Harper, came to practice with her hands shaking. She told us that someone had broken into her locker and stolen the team playbook. As team captain, it was my job to reassure her. And luckily, I got to tell her the truth. This is exactly what I've been hoping would happen. our coach had warned me months ago that back in his college job, Carmichael had been accused of stealing plays from opposing teams. So way back then, I come up with a plan. I created a second play binder that looked identical to the real one. But every single play in it was flawed in a way that wasn't obvious. So it would be very exciting for a coach who thought he could use these to crack us like a code. The actual playbook was locked up in my house. I'd use Harper as the decoy. Sorry, girl. Once I told her the truth, she was just psyched. No one was going to be mad at her. But I couldn't wait to see Coach Carmichael's downfall. When we walked onto the field that Saturday, the stadium was packed. I could see Carmichael watching us warm up with that awful smirk he always wore in our warm up huddle. I asked my team to try me no matter what, and they agreed. During the first quarter, we played exactly like the stolen playbooks that we would, and the other team cut us off at every turn. I could hear parents behind me yelling to switch up the strategy. One of our teachers actually asked if we had practiced at all. But my team trusted me. We stayed on script through the second quarter, too. Every mistake was intentional, but it still hurt to see that scoreboard. I glanced at Carmichael across the field, and he looked like he'd already started celebrating. At halftime, Coach Val gathered us in a circle. She looked every one of us in the eyes and said, it's time to show them what happens when you cheat. When the third quarter started, we abandoned every fake play. We ran our real offense with precision. Suddenly, we were showing our real moves. Fast, focused, and completely unpredictable. The other players didn't know where to go and started completely falling Apart by the end of the third quarter, we had tied the score. Carmichael looked furious.

I was forced to leave the school in handcuffs, but it was worth it, seeing that 15 year old bleed everywhere. When I started teaching at my school district, I noticed that we had a lot of teen moms. We have so many, in fact, that we actually allow them to bring their child to class as part of our inclusive continued education program. As long as the child can stay quiet, they can stay in class. If not, they have to go to the school daycare. Even though we had a lot of teen moms, no one in a million years would have expected that Annie, who had a 4 1 GPA, would come back to school pregnant after summer. Annie was every teacher's favorite student. She was smart, witty, and wasn't the kind of girl that got pushed over. She was a star athlete on the basketball and LaCrosse teams and took a lot of pride in hosting safe parties for everyone. For all we knew, Annie wanted to work for the FBI, and she probably will, too. But when she had her baby, everything tanked. She started sleeping in class, and she was barely coasting by academically because she was so tired that she never got the time to study. All of her friends who were jealous of her, suddenly all turned on her and beat her down over the fact that she's a teen mom. As her homeroom teacher, I did my very best to make sure that I was always on her side, no matter what. I came to school with baby food stocked in a mini fridge, diapers in my drawer, and little rattles for the baby to play with. Even though I did my best to give her support, her classmates made it impossible, especially what they did to her on Halloween. During Halloween, we usually have our quarterly exams, so that means everyone's studying extra hard to pass. Unfortunately, Annie is an overachiever, so she tried to study harder than usual to get her usual grades, but I took a massive nose dive during lunchtime time. She fell asleep while feeding her baby, and when she woke up from the bell, her baby was gone. She had a public freak out and started screaming, crying, and throwing food because no one would tell her where her baby was. She saw some kids laughing and screamed, asking where they put her baby, and they said something along the lines of she had to go Potty. Annie ran out the lunchroom and checked every bathroom in the school. When she reached the top floor, she heard a sound coming from the trash can. She opened the trash can and heard cries, and she threw out tampons and tissues, and underneath it all found a baby. It wasn't hers. It was one of those screaming babies from Spirit Halloween. On the baby was a note that said smart People know how to wear Protection. Annie had a complete breakdown in the bathroom and ended up coming to my classroom, where I was taking

A young mother brought in her four week old baby visibly distressed, telling the E R. Doctor that something was seriously wrong. The baby's lower half was covered in large white blisters, something she had never seen before. The doctor barely glanced at the infant before waving her off. It's just diaper rash. First time. Moms overreact all the time. Go home, let it air out, she insisted. She had been around babies her whole life. This wasn't normal. The doctor sighed, told her she was wasting resources, and sent her home. Over the next 24 hours, the blisters worsened. Her baby's cries became weaker, his tiny body starting to feel unnaturally warm. She rushed back to the ER, only to be dismissed four more times. Each visit ended the same way. Young moms panic too much. Stop being dramatic. On the fifth visit, she refused to leave. A different doctor finally examined her baby. Really examined him. His face went pale. The baby was in septic shock. The blisters weren't from a rash. His body was being eaten alive by a spreading infection. His temperature had spiked to 106 degrees Fahrenheit. The room exploded into chaos. Nurses stripped the baby down, opened every window, and set up cooling fans to bring his temperature down before his organs started shutting down. He was rushed to the ICU, where he spent two weeks fighting for his life. The First doctor never apologized, never acknowledged his mistake. He saw the mother again weeks later and didn't even recognize her. Her baby survived, but she no longer trusted doctors. Not after five different ones dismissed her. She didn't sue, didn't report them. She just Learned that when it comes to her child's life, she would never take no for an answer again.

Humbled to their core. I was 14 when my mom replaced my dad with my stepdad, and I hated her for it because my stepdad was awkward as hell. Like, one time he caught me sneaking out of my window at 3:00am, and instead of grounding me or telling my mom, he asked to have a talk about my feelings and hormones. After that, I never took him seriously. Whenever he picked me up from school for bonding time, I would blast the most intimate songs I knew, and if he tried to turn them off, I just used the magic words. Dad would have let me play and immediately got what I wanted. Even when I shouted the house down at 4:00am playing league of legends. Skip school for a week straight or ask for $300 shoes. That line worked every time. The thing is, I only did all those things to scare him away, but apparently he wasn't leaving without a fight, and it wasn't until I filled his expensive gas tank with rocks and caramel sauce that he finally left. And before you guys hate me, you should probably know that the whole time my bio dad was telling me to do all this because if I didn't, according to him, it proved I was a horrible son who never loved him. And once my stepdad was finally out of the picture, my dad slid back in a few months. Later. But it wasn't long until I regretted my decision, because my dad was out for blood. Within a week, he had wailed on me twice and left me with a limp because I had left the hallway light on overnight. And I was convinced the whole thing was my fault. So I was ready to keep it to myself until I saw something that shattered my heart to pieces. I caught my mom before she put her makeup on, and there were cuts all over her face. And when I asked what happened, she just told me she accidentally walked into a door. I knew I had to do something, but back then, I was just a scrawny 14 year old with no backbone. So in a last resort, I called my stepdad. But right after I pressed the call button, I regretted it, because that's when my dad barged into my room and asked me where the TV remote was. I just stayed silent because I already knew what was coming next. And sure enough, I was body slammed into my floor so hard that I almost threw up. I couldn't even hold back my tears, which made my dad even angrier. So as I lay on the floor trying to pretend I was somewhere else, my dad shouted at me for a full five minutes about how pathetic and worthless I was. But that's when I heard a noise from the front door. Within seconds, my dad Was pulled off me, and he was hit so hard that red started pouring down his back. Through my blurred vision, I could make out the face of my stepdad, and a feeling of comfort washed over me.

Going anonymous? Because you never know. Many years ago in Canada, I lived in an apartment shared with a couple of other students. Canada is cold. As students, we each had a room and a central kitchen. Heating was included in the rent. Great. We just set the kitchen heat control thermostat to 72 degrees. This was great in September, even October into November and onwards. We enjoyed the comfortable ambient temperature you would expect for a heated apartment. Sometime in late November or early December, the landlord began to complain that his heating costs were too high. He asked if we would mind setting the heat to 60 degrees while we were on campus in classes and overnight sleeping. And 70 degrees when we were there during the evening. Sure, no problem. Reasonable. We complied. In January, the landlord complained again about heating costs being too high. We thought we had been flexible enough. We were doing as reasonable measures and were paying the same rent as we had in September through November. Heat was supposed to be included in the rent. Landlord asked if we would do 50 degrees for days and 60 degrees for evenings and overnight. We declined. Not reasonable. We were paying for heat. There was a discussion and some negotiation. Then that landlord made a strategic blunder. One day, he said he would be doing maintenance while we were in class. When we

My friend's stepfather taped him ever since he was 6 until around his eighth year. His biological father died of a work related accident and his mother married this stepfather that she knew from her hometown a few years after. That fatherly figure soon turned out to be a monster that was eager to put his hands on anything that moves. My friend's mother was unaware of what the stepfather was doing as the stepfather threatened to take my friend's life as well as his mother's life if my friend told anyone what was going on. He was in an ever worse situation. After getting bullied, he wanted to take his life, but his mother was the only reason he didn't want to do it and kept pushing on through it all. He started slowly making a few friends that helped him cope a little. On his 10th birthday, he was left limping after his stepfather went all out on him in the worst possible way. He was forced to go to school the day after and was unable to sit at all, unable to move. But he endured it and shrugged it off as an accident so that no one finds out what happens. He saw what the man can do. He doesn't want his mother hurt or worse because he told on this monster. Even the bullies stopped making fun of him after seeing that he didn't care anymore about what they did. To him more uninterested in bullying an inanimate object than pity. A few older senior students who were a mix of 16 and 18 year old caught up to what happened and pulled him aside one day to ask what happened. They all sat down and talk.

He just posted something horrifying on his Snapchat story. And my best friend went missing three years ago without a single trace on where he went. I thought it was super odd. The police dropped the case after a couple days of looking and his parents just stopped completely searching after that. I assumed that was just their way of grieving and that I would never see him again in my life until two weeks ago. I was just watching some YouTube shorts before I went to sleep when I got a notification that made my heart stop. Cody McCain just posted on his story. I thought it was a prank or something, but when I clicked the story I knew it wasn't. His story was just a picture of a black background with two simple words on it. Hello Daniel. My stomach dropped when I saw that weird capital A in my name. Because it was Cody's way of writing it and nobody else on earth did that. I stared at my screen in confusion for 10 straight minutes before finally replying to his story with a sup. I didn't expect whoever this was to reply, but it only took three seconds before I got a message back. It's been a while, he wrote. I should have called the cops immediately, but instead I wanted to believe this was him and asked where the actual hell have you been? I Can't explain yet, but I'm here now. We texted for the rest of the night about everything we did together, from our legendary Xbox battles to the time we accidentally set off the school fire alarm. And even when he caught me eating out his sister. However, something felt seriously wrong, because every time I asked him to Facetime, he just say no. But I needed to see him, so I asked him for his location, and all he replied with was, it's not time. So then I told him, I miss you so much it hurts. Just let me see you. And he responded instantly with, I'm right here. Just take a look behind you. I turned around so fast, my neck cracked, and no one was there. But then I spotted something on my wall that definitely wasn't there before. It was a perfectly drawn S using a super bright shape.

I just found out the horrifying reason why, after my grandmother's funeral, my parents kept insisting on keeping the chair that she always used to sit in. It was this old wooden thing with chipped red paint and a spot on the headrest where her hair used to rub it smooth. At first, we just kept it in the corner of our living room, and it just sat there empty while collecting dust. But about a month later, we started noticing little things. The chair would shift position. First it faced the window, then the television, then the front door. Nobody said anything. We all just silently agreed not to touch it. Then the sound started. Every night around 3:00am, I would hear a slow, rhythmic creaking from the living room. I thought maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me. But the third night, I got up and caught it moving with my own eyes. The chair was rocking back and forth, almost like someone was sitting on it, even though the room was completely empty. I told my dad the next morning what happened, and he didn't even look surprised. She's just visiting, he said, while pouring himself a coffee like it was nothing. Don't bother her. The next night, I couldn't help it. I tiptoed into the living room at 2:00am, hid behind the couch, and waited. And at exactly 3:00am, the chair started To rock again. But this time there was something new. It looked like someone invisible was actively sitting on it and rocking it. I ran as fast as I could back to my room, but I couldn't sleep that night. I decided to set up an old nanny cam in the living room that we had in the basement. I pointed it straight at the chair and let it record all night. And when I watched the footage the next morning, nothing came up. At first, the camera showed a dark living room with the chair in the corner. But at 2:00am, a shadow slid across the floor. Then the shadow got on the chair and it started rocking. I thought I'd seen it all, but out of nowhere, the shadow looked like it was knitting. Grandma love knitting. She would make scarves, sweater

Literally anything about what goes on in Florida. Two. Injured people try to avoid getting ambulances called for them. 3. They have those angry sinks that chop stuff up. I'm told they are called garbage disposals. Four that Hawaiians actually enjoy eating spam. Five. Homeowners associations. What the f is up with that? Six. As a Brit living in America, the amount of pharmaceutical commercials on TV is creepy. Seven. I've had several German friends who were amazed that at house parties everyone actually does drink out of red solo cups. They thought that was just a weird thing people did in movies and now they think it is a huge conspiracy or something. 8. My dad heard this crazy rumor about everyone getting drunk and wearing green for one day a year. He obviously didn't know this was a holiday and was like WTF? When he came to the US and discovered Saint Patrick's day he was amazed. He's from China BTW. 9. The honking. I thought it was a movie stereotype. And then I went to New York City. Ten. Sports bars are actually exactly how they're portrayed on TV. Eleven that there are security guards or cops in the school's halls, and some even have metal detectors at the entrance like the TSA at airports. 12. That higher education can cost upwards of $50,000 per year. 13. I Learned You guys have outdoor sirens that get tested somewhat frequently? I've only heard those noises in video games and movies until my friend sent me a clip because I had no idea it actually happened. 14 the take me out to the Ball Game song that apparently gets sung at baseball games. Still not entirely sure if that guy was just effing with me. 15 that American kids eat straight sugar. Walked onto the playground and saw kids chugging these long thin sticks. I try and it was just colored sugar lol. Called them Pixie Sticks. 16 you can see into the public toilet cubicles. 17 that you can identify Texans with the simple phrase the stars at night are big and bright. 18 the people you see at Walmart. 19 apparently rolling coal is actually a thing. 20 the extent of the tipping culture is frankly shocking to me. 21 that women only get about six weeks off work after having a baby and it's most likely to be unpaid. 22. The drink sizes. Oh my God. 23 this will definitely wind up on TikTok with Subway Surfers in the background.

One. My boyfriend had a brain injury four months ago. He was in a coma for about a week, and when he woke, he had to relearn how to speak coherently all over again. The speech therapist had a session with me present so that I could practice these lessons with him at home. The therapist would say a word, and my boyfriend would have to give them a synonym or definition. The therapist said, happiness, and my boyfriend pointed to me and said my name. I did a weird mixture of crying and laughing, and the therapist told him, no, that's incorrect. And my boyfriend pouted and frowned and didn't quite understand his mistake. It's a memory I think of a lot when we're going through a particularly rough patch. Two. Friend and her family, except for her mother, are extremely clumsy. One time, her father got locked out of the house, waited for her to come home, but she also forgot her keys. So they waited for her brother, who also forget his keys. So they ended up all waiting for the mother outside. Three. Little girl in the grocery store was having an argument with her parents. She looked like she was maybe four or five. My husband and I came around the corner, and this girl looks at us, then her parents, then us, and comes running down the aisle. I'm going to go live with Them! And they will be my new mommy and daddy because you're mean. My husband adores kids, and I am very obviously pregnant. We smiled at her parents and they said, oh, well, Mr. And Mrs. New Dad and mom, good luck with her, before turning their cart and walking away. The girl gets this brief, panicked expression and I shouted, hey, wait! Parents turned around. Does she have allergies or anything? Nope, she's healthy as a horse. She does need a night light, though. Oh, that's too bad. We don't have nightlights. This girl let go of my husband's shirt tail and hauled back to her parents so fast she looked like a cartoon character running. I don't really need that toy. I love you! You could tell she really reevaluated her choices up to that point, and it was adorable. 4 A while ago, I was in the mall on a crowded day when suddenly I felt a tiny hand clasp my palm. A little girl, maybe 5, had mistaken me for her mom and held my hand and started wrapping herself around my leg. It was so sweet, and I knew it would frighten her when I pointed out her mistake, but when I did, her confused expression was priceless. She continued to hold my hand while we walked around looking for her mom. It was extra cute because I remember doing that myself as a kid.

What happened? I've been married to my husband James for 12 years, and we've been together for 16 years. We even have four kids. A few months ago, I was scrolling on Facebook and came across a Taylor Swift post with my favourite song and excitedly commented about it. Someone then replied with a super funny message. Guess that makes two Swifties. He then sent me a friend request and I accepted the invite. We kicked it off the bat. I Learned he was a male in his mid thirties, lived in my area, and we both love the same things. He also wanted to stay anonymous since we both were married. I realized I really like this guy, even without knowing what he looks like. We never had any sexual messages or anything, but I felt really guilty and confused because this never happened to me before. I loved my husband with all my heart and couldn't be with anyone else. I even had a wet dream about this guy on Facebook. So I decided to tell my husband what's going on. But as I was about to tell James about what I've been doing, when I got a message from the guy on Facebook. You're an amazing person, but I'm married to the love of my life. I'm sorry, but I can't text you anymore. I felt like a weight went off my back, so I went to my husband. Two minutes, Later, and he told me he had to say something. He told me that he's been messaging a woman on Facebook, but stopped because he loved me so much and would never want anyone else in his life. He then showed me the messages, and I was shocked. I took out my phone, opened my messages with the guy on Facebook, and it was my husband. Then I realized that I'm the woman he was texting this entire time. And he was the same guy that I fell in love with. Twice. Her face transformed. She started violently shaking and begged me not to do it. But that just made me want to know even more. So I mailed the test that same night. And after eight horrifying weeks,

During my second deployment to Afghanistan, my grandmother sent me something that became legendary across three forward operating bases. My unit was going through a rough patch. We've been taking fire almost daily. Morale was low, and mail delivery was sporadic at best. When care packages finally arrived, everyone gathered around hoping for cookies, beef jerky, or magazines. I opened my grandmother's box to find dozens of bright pink women's thong underwear. Not just any thongs. These had juicy bedazzled across the back in rhinestones. There were at least 30 pairs. The note inside read, dearest Tommy, I saw these on clearance at Victoria's Secret and remembered you mentioning your unit needed more trade items for the locals. Hope these help. Love, grandma. My entire platoon lost it. Our stone faced sergeant laughed so hard he had to sit down. Even our captain, who never smiled, had tears streaming down his face. Words spread fast. Marines from other units started showing up to see the thong guy. Our interpreter nearly quit when I tried explaining why my elderly grandmother sent women's underwear to a combat zone. The best part? Those thongs became the hottest trading commodity on base. Guys were trading premium cigars, expensive knives, and rare snacks for just one pair to send home to their wife.

I'm now convinced I'm married to my sister. Ever since I was a kid, my parents always treated me like I was trash. If I forgot to do the dishes, I would get smacked. If I brought home anything less than a 100 on my tests, I would get tortured. And if I even came home one minute past my curfew, they would lock me in the basement without any food. I thought they just hated me, but the truth is that they were just waiting for the perfect moment to use me. I started to understand it on my 21st birthday, when they dropped a bomb on me. You're getting married next month. I didn't even have a choice but to agree. So on the day of my marriage, I was getting ready to marry the worst looking woman I've ever seen. And for my life to be ruined. But when those church doors opened and Hannah came out, my heart literally stopped. She looked like she was from my dreams. And the moment our eyes locked, I thought my parents were trying to make up for the years of torture. But I was terribly wrong. When Hannah and I bought our own house a week after marrying, she was unbelievably sweet, a super good cook, and even let me eat her out whenever I wanted. But anytime I asked about her past, she would completely shut down. I thought it was weird. But decided to ignore it. After about three months into our marriage, my parents started to call me every single day, demanding the same thing. We need a grandchild now. But something was wrong. They weren't just asking for a grandchild to be grandparent. They sounded completely dead. I didn't know the reason, but I knew that I needed answers. So after a week straight of them asking me, I snuck into their house while they were sleeping and tore their house apart, looking for anything that could help me. And that's when I found a photo that destroyed my entire reality. The picture showed a girl that looked just like Hannah, but as a baby. So when I got home the next day, I ordered a DNA test online and told Hannah that I was just checking to see who my ancestors were. But the second I mentioned it, her entire face.

Our platoon had an ancient coffee maker we called the Oracle. This decrepit machine looked like it had survived multiple wars before. Ours held together with duct tape, 550 cord, and what our medics wore was surgical glue. The Oracle wasn't just any coffee maker. It had developed mysterious powers over the years. If it made a perfect pot, we'd have a good mission. If it struggled and sputtered, we knew we were in for trouble. Our lieutenant, a West Point graduate with multiple engineering degrees, refused to make critical decisions until consulting the Oracle's brew quality. I once watched him stare into a cup for five full minutes before announcing a patrol route change based on coffee sediment patterns. The true reverence began after our base took indirect fire. A rocket hit our barracks, destroying everything except the Oracle, which somehow remained untouched on its counter, still brewing a perfect pot amid the rubble. After that, the Oracle received its own security detail. New soldiers had to complete an elaborate coffee communion ritual before being considered part of the platoon. We developed complex maintenance protocols involving specific cleaning techniques that had to be performed in exact order. When we rotated home, our commander attempted to requisition a transport case typically used for nuclear components, just to bring the Oracle back safely.

Private Johnson was the worst soldier in our battalion. Always late, couldn't shoot straight, and somehow managed to lose every piece of equipment issued to him. During a field exercise, our commanding officer's Jeep broke down in the middle of nowhere. No radio, no cell service. Everyone stood around looking useless while the CEO fumed. Suddenly, Johnson appeared, looking at the engine. We all laughed. The guy couldn't even tie his boots properly. What did he know about engines? He asked for a Snickers bar, which someone reluctantly gave him. Johnson unwrapped it, took one bite, and then smeared the rest all over a specific part of the engine. He then asked for a bottle of Coca Cola, poured it over the chocolate mess, and told the CEO to try starting it again. The engine roared to life immediately. When questioned how he knew this would work, Johnson shrugged and said, grew up fixing tractors on my grandpa's farm. Sugar and chocolate can temporarily seal certain types of gasket leaks. The irony. Our motor pool sergeant with 15 years of experience couldn't fix that Jeep. But the unit screwed up. Solved it with a candy bar. The CEO was so impressed, he mentioned it in every briefing for a month. Think like Johnson became our unofficial motto. Two weeks later, Johnson was promoted to specialist. His citation simply read, resourcefulness in the field. He still couldn't shoot straight. Though

In elementary school, hot lunch Fridays were everything. That was the only day the cafeteria served pizza instead of the usual bland government meals. The whole school buzzed about it all week. The smell would hit you before you even entered the lunchroom. Golden crust, melted cheese. Little square slices that somehow felt like magic. But the catch was, it cost two. We didn't have it. So every Friday, I faked being sick. Mom didn't push back. I was a good student. Never missed school unless I had to. When I said I wasn't feeling well, she believed me. I curl up in front of the TV and try not to think about what I was missing. It wasn't just the pizza. It was what the pizza meant. Sitting at the table, being part of the group. Not having to explain yourself or feel different. But one Friday, I had a spelling test I couldn't skip. I went to school, stomach twisted in knots. When lunchtime came, I grabbed my usual free tray and walked to the table, already bracing for it. All around me, kids were tearing open greasy cardboard boxes, laughing and trading slices. That's when the kid whose dad owned the town's car dealership looked at my tray and said, loud enough for everyone to hear you. What's that even supposed to be? The table exploded with laughter. My ears burned. I stared down at the gray Lump on my tray and said quietly, Salisbury steak. That night, I couldn't hold it in. I begged mom for pizza money. She emptied her purse on the table, counting out coins and old receipts. She gave me a small, tired smile and said, next week, baby. I promise. The next Friday, I opened my backpack and found $2 folded in a scrap of paper. For three weeks, I had pizza like everyone else. I. I felt normal. But then mom lost her second job, and that Friday, I was back to the government tray. I tried to keep my head down. I sat quietly. But before I could even take a bite, the rich kid turned and started up again. Same smirk, same voice. Ready to embarrass me all over again. But he never got the chance. The janitor had walked up behind him without anyone noticing. He pointed at my tray.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. She and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. I picked up the phone. It was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared. Of him, I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant, so I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park, where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he was going To take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was

My friend was puzzled, but confirmed that, yes, the snake had been doing this every night for a while now. The vet's response left her in shock. He said, your snake isn't sick. It's been curling up next to you and stretching out to see how long it needs to be. The reason it's not eating is because it's preparing to eat you. My friend was stunned. The vet explained that the snake was getting ready to devour her. All those nights, the snake had been lying beside her, it wasn't for comfort. It was measuring how big it needed to be to consume her. Her love for the snake had blinded her to this horrifying truth. Frightened and heartbroken, my friend knew she had to act fast. She Immediately contacted a reptile specialist who helped her safely rehome the snake. It was a difficult decision, but she knew it was the right one for her safety. This experience was a harsh reminder of how love can sometimes make us overlook real dangers.
