In the meantime, start Zoxen, I, V and loop in. Doctor Asher. She definitely has endometritis, high white count, elevated procalcitonin and lactate and her roommate said she's having a bad period. Mm. But her pregnancy test is positive and I didn't see an embryo on her ultrasound. Yeah, I heard the chorionic lining is likely From retained product. She's having a miscarriage. Am I in trouble? We just, we wanna get you feeling better. Okay. The reason you're sick is because your uterus has retained parts of your placenta which has become infected. You will need surgery to remove this. Do I need surgery? Yes, but it is a minor and very safe procedure. In the meantime, I would like to collect vaginal cultures so we can pinpoint the bacteria that's causing your infection. Is that okay with you? Okay. Doctor Asher, are you ready for the swab? Um, yes. Sorry. I just. Culture swab, please. Okay. Okay. I will be right back. Wait, wait. Where are you going? It's okay. I'll be right back, I promise. Jenny's pelvic exam revealed a second degree perineal tear. And I saw umbilical cord coming from her cervix. I felt like something was off with her demeanour, but I wasn't sure if she was in shock or hiding something. Do you know how far along she was? Based on the size of the tear in the cord, I suspect close to full term. So where's the baby now?

Al, he must have thought she was escaping and attacked her. He said he fought off that bear with a pitchfork. Charlie, there is no bear. Wouldn't a abused spouse feel the need to protect their part? Pretty common, actually. Yeah. Well, would they also say that they, um, they need their part? You mean Abigail? Yeah. Okay. Um, so if Wayne is somebody who needs to be needed. Uh huh. Then he can go to extremes and we can, Abigail, undermine her until her sense of self and self esteem is so shattered that she feels like she can't leave. Wayne, Penance has a weird effect on people. People are held hostage by it. What? I said people can be held hostage by it. Kidnapped? Well, I'm speaking metaphorically, but I know what it could also be kidnapped, right? Sure. I mean, there are many documented cases of Stockholm syndrome where a captive is actually so dependent on their captor that they start to protect them. What's your real name? Why are you asking me that? Because I think he kidnapped you. Oh, it's not like that. He saved me. I owe him my life. No, you don't owe him anything. Your life is yours, not his. Oh, I do. Don't you have parents, family, someone, someone that loves you, a mom and a dad, someone who misses you? I don't. Remember you? Tell me your name and I'll call them right now. When's the last time you saw them? How long has it been? Months? Years? They haven't forgotten you. I bet they're out there looking for you right now and they're desperate to find you. Tell me your name. Really? Yeah. Imagine what they've been through, what he's put them through. No, no, no. What losing you has done to them. Tell me your name. Wayne can't hurt you here. He can't. He took away your past. Don't let him take away your future, too. Tell me your real name. Kayla. My name is Kayla Bradley. My name is Kayla Bradley. My parents thought she was dead. How did you find this? I, um, I googled pictures of missing persons until I found someone who looked like her and then I contacted her family. She's been missing since she was 12 years old. Kept her prisoner in the woods for 15 years. Al. He must have thought she was escaping and attacked her. He said he fought off that bear with a pitchfork. Charlie, there is no bear. How is she? Can I see her? No. Knowing you are never gonna see her again. What are you talking about? We know who Abigail really is. What do you mean, Caleb Bradley? I don't know who that is. You kidnapped her 15 years ago. Kidnapped, right? She ran away and you chased her down and you beat her. What the Hikers heard her screaming and you had to think on your feet. What could do that kind of damage? A bear attack? You're insane. I love my wife. She loves me now. I want to see her. He called the cops. What's wrong with you people? What is wrong with you people?

Okay, so I lost my cool with my 27 female parents, 57 female and 59 male, for pushing me to forgive my cheating ex. I was to be married in July. Two months ago, I came home from a work trip to find my ex fiance in bed with my BFF sister. I kicked him out, canceled the wedding, warned him that I would get rid of all of his stuff if he didn't come get it. Then weeks later, dumped it all out on the curb side with a free sign, sold or donated or dumped everything else that he gave me and pawned the ring. I blocked him everywhere. Called the cops on him when he showed up after I gave his stuff away, banging on my door. Called them again when he turned up at my workplace and made a scene, and called them on his family when they showed up in mass to plead his case. I didn't go scorched earth on my ex's BFF sister. I did tell her husband that I caught her in bed with my ex. Last I heard, she'd been kicked out of the house and was back living with her parents. Ex BFF tried talking me into giving them both a chance to explain. What? No. And then got angry at me for ruining her sister's relationship. Called me petty and Cold hearted. So I kicked her to the curb too. I don't want dishonest people that are blase about betrayal in my life. This encounter no doubt simmered under my skin until I unleashed on my parents. Maybe that's the reason because it lingered. I was so harsh to them. I took a date with me to the restaurant. Hoping his being there would waylay any discussion about my fail

This ridiculous move somehow earned Mark's respect, and he jumped in to ram the wall with me without hesitation. Unbelievably, after our non stop pounding, the supposedly indestructible prison wall started to show tiny cracks. The guards, completely unaware, stood in the distance with mocking smiles, thinking we'd gone insane. Their contempt finally pushed the inmates over the edge. Someone let out a furious roar and the entire yard erupted with rage. As if injected with pure adrenaline, everyone charged toward the 2 meter thick wall like lunatics. But reality was cruel. They smashed their heads open, yet the wall didn't move an inch. The guards thought the whole scene was downright absurd. This mass wall ramming went on for two full months. Most prisoners eventually gave up in despair, but Mark and I stubbornly kept going. Just as we were about to launch another charge, strange roaring sound came from the sky. A fighter jet trailing thick smoke spiraled out of control and dove straight toward the prison wall. With a deafening explosion, a huge cloud of dust shot up outside the yard. Pieces of the jet rained down like meteorites, crashing onto the yard. Inmates panicked and scrambled for cover, narrowly avoiding the falling debris. The guards rushed out swinging batons, yelling at everyone to get back to their cells. But just then, a sinister cracking sound came from the base of the Wall the entire section split like a spider web and collapsed right before everyone's eyes. The sudden shock left the whole crowd frozen. Even pedestrians outside stopped in confusion. One old man even waved at the gatekeeper as if trying to figure out what had happened. A quick, thinking inmate snapped out of it first. He yelled, shot forward like an arrow, and dashed through the gap, becoming the first to escape. Seeing him see, the rest instantly understood. They roared and charged, rushing toward the broken section of the wall. The prison fell into complete chaos. The guards fought desperately to stop them, but they were no match for hundreds of inmates rioting at the same time. They could only watch helplessly as the prisoners scattered in every direction.

I was the maid of honor at my best friend Mia's wedding. When her future mother in law, Jennifer, stood up during the ceremony and announced she had something important to say. The entire church went silent. Mia's face went white. Jennifer walked to the front with this sick smile on her face and pulled out her phone. Before my son makes the big, biggest mistake of his life, everyone needs to see what kind of woman he's really marrying. She started playing a video on her phone, volume turned all the way up. It was Mia in a hotel room with another man in an inappropriate situation. The audio was crystal clear. Mia was sobbing, shaking her head, mouthing that's not me to her fiance Johnny. But the woman in the video looked exactly like her. Johnny's face went from confusion to rage in seconds. Is this real, Mia? Tell me this isn't real. Mia was hyperventilating, trying to speak, but nothing was coming out. Half the wedding guests were recording this with their phones. Her parents looked devastated. Jennifer was practically glowing with satisfaction. I hired a private investigator six months ago because I knew something was wrong with this girl. Johnny deserves better than a cheating woman. The church erupted in gasps and murmurs. Mia's grandmother had to be helped to her seat. That's when I noticed something. The time stamp on the video said last Tuesday. But I knew for a fact Mia was with me at my cousin's funeral in Portland last Tuesday. We drove there together and stayed in the same hotel room. I grabbed Jennifer's phone and looked closer. The woman in the video had a butterfly tattoo on her shoulder blade. Mia doesn't have any tattoos. I've known her since we were 12, and I've seen her in bathing suits hundreds of times. This video is fake, I announced loudly. Mia was with me in Portland when this was supposedly filmed, and she doesn't have that tattoo. But Jennifer snatched her phone back and started screaming about how I was just covering for my trashy friend. The private investigator was there in the back row. Jennifer called him up to verify his evidence. This greasy guy in a cheap suit walked up front and started explaining how he followed Mia to the hotel. But when I asked him which hotel, he said the

My mother would receive nothing. The color drained from her face. You can't do this. I absolutely can. Grandpa said it's my money and I'll distribute it as I see fit. You threw a plate that hit my great granddaughter in the face. You stole from your own daughter. You showed zero remorse. You don't deserve a single cent. What about Vanessa? Mom's voice cracked. Vanessa can earn her way back if she demonstrates genuine change over several years. Right now, she participated in theft. Mom stood up. Fine, keep your money. She stormed out. Two weeks later, she showed up at my apartment at 2 a m. Screaming. My neighbors called. The police filed for a restraining order. At the hearing, mom played the wounded mother, crying about how I was using my baby as a weapon. Then my lawyer presented the evidence. Photos of Mia's injury, the police report, the documented theft, Grandma Ruth's testimony. The judge granted a two year restraining order. Mom stood up, screaming, your poison. You've turned everyone against me. Security removed her. Three years later, Grandpa passed away. At the funeral, I found a letter he'd written the week he changed his will. Standing up for you and Mia was the easiest decision I ever made. You are strong, capable and loving. Be happy. Love Mia fiercely. Never let anyone make You feel less than you are. You are always enough. Mia, almost 4, hugged me as I cried. The inheritance let me finish my degree and buy a house. What Grandpa really gave me was showing that family isn't about blood. It's about who stands up when it matters. Mia is 10 now. She asks sometimes about my parents. I tell her that sometimes people aren't capable of being what we need. And that's okay, because we have people who genuinely love us. The scar on her face faded to a faint line, but I know it's there. A reminder of where we came from, how far we've traveled. And how Grandpa made sure we didn't just survive. We thrived.

You sent me flowers on my birthday when these people couldn't even remember the date. My mom stood up. This is manipulation. You're dying, and you're not thinking clearly. We'll contest this. Linda smiled. I hoped you'd say that. My lawyer is also here tonight, two tables behind you. He's been documenting everything. A man in a gray suit raised his wine glass slightly. Wesley knocked his chair over, leaving. My parents followed, my mother already crying. Linda reached across the table and squeezed my hand. Happy birthday to me, she said. We ordered dessert. She had eight months left. I made sure she spent every single one of them loved.

When I asked where she Learned that, she whispered. It's how mom decides who has to sleep outside. My seven year old sister Maya has 12 dolls arranged in a perfect row on her bedroom floor. She's holding a clipboard asking each one questions in this serious voice. Do you have references? Can you work weekends? I laugh. What are you playing? She doesn't look up interviewing them like Mommy does some. Something about her tone makes me uneasy. Mom interviews dolls, not dolls. Maya points to her closet. The people. My stomach drops. What people? She walks to her closet, opens it. There's a door I've never noticed before or behind our house, Maya explains. When they don't answer right, they have to sleep in the shed. I'm frozen. We don't have a shed. Show me. We go downstairs. Mom's at the grocery store. Dad's at work. Maya leads me to the back door, points through the window. There's a small structure behind our fence I always thought was abandoned from the previous owner. Through the dusty window, I see blankets, pillows, a space heater, food wrappers, a bucket in the corner. Mom brings them water on Tuesdays, Maya says. The nice ones get to come inside sometimes to clean my phone. I need my phone. But Maya grabs my hand. Don't tell Mommy I showed you, she said. It's our special secret. The people who tell get Sent away forever. I crouch down. Maya, has mom ever hurt you? She shakes her head. Only the people who don't work good enough work. My brain clicks. How many people his mom brought here? Maya counts on her fingers. Rosa was first, then Miguel, then the quiet lady. Now it's just Carmen and the man with the cross necklace. Five people. My mother has kept five people in our backyard. Where did Rosa go? Maya's face goes sad. She got too sick. Mom said she had to leave in the middle of the night. I feel like I'm going to throw up. When was this before my birthday? January. January. That's when mom started her consulting business from home, when she suddenly had money for Maya's private school. For my college fund, for the kitchen renovation. I grabbed Maya's shoulders. Where's Carmen right now? In there. The man, too. Mom locks it when she goes shopping so they don't leave before she pays them. Locks them. Maya, does dad know? She nods. Daddy.

They were trying to get you to go to the basement. So I made a decision. Every night I would cover your ears so you couldn't hear them, so they couldn't call you. I put the letter down. My sister had been protecting me from voices trying to lure me to the basement. But why? What was in that room? What did they want with me? I picked up the letter again. There was more. I did this every night for three years until I turned 18 and moved away for college. I thought maybe the voices would stop once I was gone. But I was wrong. Last month I went back to the house while you were at work. I had to know if that room was still there. My heart was pounding. The door was unlocked. This time I went down the stairs, the room was exactly the same, except now there were new photos, recent photo of you as an adult. And the writing on the wall had changed. It said, Day 9, 1:25. He is ready. Collection begins soon. 9,025 days. I calculated that was exactly my current age in days. I tried to destroy the room. I ripped the photos off the walls. I tried to scrub away the symbols. But when I turned to leave, the door was closed and I heard the voices. They said, you interfered, now you pay the price. The letter ended there, just stopped mid sentence. I immediately drove to my childhood home. My parents had moved out years ago and the house had been empty ever since. I had a key. I went straight to the basement to the locked door. It was open, just slight. I pushed it open and saw the staircase going down. I counted as I descended, 47 steps, just like Emma said. At the bottom was the room. The symbols were still on the walls. The circle was still on the floor, but the photos were gone, except for one. In the center of the circle was a photo of me taken today. I was getting into my car outside Emma's funeral. I hadn't seen anyone take that photo. Written below it, Day 9, 1:25, collection complete, transfer initiated. I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me, slow and heavy, coming down. I turned to run, but the door at the top slammed shut. The voices started, hundreds of them, all around me coming from the walls. They were saying my name over and over. And then I heard Emma's voice clear and distinct. I'm sorry. I tried to protect you, but now I understand the voices weren't trying to take you. They were trying to warn you. Someone in our family made a deal and you're the payment. You always were. I looked at the walls. The symbol started glowing faint red light. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The footsteps reached the bottom of the Stairs, I turned around and saw who was standing there. It was my father, but his eyes were completely black and he was smiling. He said, I've been waiting 32 years for this. The deal is finally complete. He reached for me, and the last thing I heard was Emma's voice whispering, I'm so sorry. I couldn't say.

I now know the disgusting reason why. When I was 7 years old, my older sister, Emma, started sneaking into my room every night. She'd wait until I was asleep, then she'd press her hands over my ears and hold them there for hours. I'd wake up sometimes and ask what she was doing. She'd always say the same thing, I'm protecting you. Go back to sleep. I never understood what she meant, but every morning she'd be gone and my ears would ache. This went on for three years, every single night from age 7 to 10. And suddenly it stopped. Emma moved away to college and I never saw her do it again. I'm 32 now. Emma died last week in a car accident. At the funeral, my aunt pulled me aside and said, your sister asked me to give you this if anything happened to her. She handed me a sealed envelope. Inside was a letter in Emma's handwriting. If you're reading this, I'm gone. And now you need to know the truth about why I covered your ears all those years. I wasn't protecting you from something outside. I was protecting you from something inside our house, something that only came out at night. My hands started shaking. I kept reading, when you were 7, I started hearing voices at night, not from outside, from the walls, from the floor, from the ceiling. They were whispering hundreds Of voices all talking at once. I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I knew they were talking about you. I, Emma had never mentioned hearing voices. I went to mom and dad, but they said I was dreaming. They said I was making it up for attention. But I knew what I heard. And the voices got louder every night. They were saying your name over and over, like they were calling you. The letter continued. One night I followed the voices. They LED me to the basement, to the door that's always locked, the door dad told us never to open. I found the key in his desk and I opened it. I remembered that door. It was in the corner of the basement behind some old boxes. I'd asked my parents about it when I was a kid, but I said it was just story. Behind the door was a staircase going down, way down. I counted 47 steps before I reached the bottom. And what I found there made me understand why the voices wanted you. I stopped reading. I didn't want to know, but I forced myself to continue. There was a room, a big room with symbols painted on the walls. And in the center was a circle drawn in something dark, something that looked like dried blood. Inside the circle were photos, dozens of them, all of you from the day you were born until that week. Someone had been taking photos. Of you your entire life. My stomach turned. I kept reading. I looked closer and saw writing under the photos, dates. And next to each date was a number. I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the last photo. It was from that morning. And next to it was written day 2, 5:57. Final phase begins tonight, 20, 500, 57 days. I did the math. That would have been right around the time I turned 7. I ran upstairs and that's when I realized what the voices were doing. They were trying to call you down.

I need you there tomorrow, she said on the phone. There's something I have to do and I want you to see it. My dad stepped forward in the restaurant. Linda, this is inappropriate. Linda set her napkin down slowly. What's inappropriate is pretending my niece doesn't exist because as your son can't keep his hands off other people's fiancés. My brother Wesley started toward the door. I'm not staying for this good, Linda said, because I'm changing my will next week and I wanted her here. When I told you, the entire restaurant went quiet. The hostess just stood there holding four menus. My mom grabbed my dad's arm. Linda, you can't be serious. I've never been more serious. Sit down or leave. But she stays. They sat. Of course they did. Linda owned three commercial properties downtown and a beach house in Destin. She'd never married, never had kids. My parents have been positioning Wesley as her favorite nephew for years. Linda pulled out an envelope and slid it across the table to me. I already changed it, she said, last month. My lawyer has the documents. Everything goes to you, the properties, the accounts, the house. Wesley's face went white. Aunt Linda, I don't understand. I've been visiting you every month. I drove you to your appointments. I, you drove me because your mother told you to. Linda Cut him off. You visited because you wanted my money. You never once asked how I was actually feeling. Not once. She turned to me. But you. You called me every Sunday for three years, even when your own mother wouldn't speak to you. You flew out when I had my hip surgery and slept on my couch for a week. You sent me flowers on my birthday when these people couldn't even remember the date. My mom stood up. This is manipulation. You're dying and you're not thinking clearly. We'll contest this. Linda smiled. I hoped you'd say that. My lawyer is also here tonight, two tables behind you. He's been documenting everything. A man in a gray suit raised his wine glass slightly. Wesley knocked his chair over, leaving. My parents followed. My mother already crying. Linda reached across the table and squeezed my hand. Happy birthday to me, she said. We ordered dessert. She had eight months left. I made sure she spent every single one of them loved.

I just sat there holding my menu while my mom, dad and brother stood frozen at the hostess stand. My Aunt Linda was already seated across from me trying not to make eye contact with anyone. I invited her. Linda finally said, it's my birthday dinner. My mom's face went red. We agreed she wasn't coming. Here's the thing. Three years ago, I refused to lie for my brother when he crashed my parents car drunk. He told them it was stolen. I told them the truth. Since then, I've been the family villain. But that wasn't even the real reason they cut me off. See, when the police investigated the stolen car, they found something else. My brother had been driving home from his girlfriend's apartment, except his girlfriend was actually my fiance. They've been seeing each other for 8 months behind my back. When I confronted my parents about it, my mom said I needed to forgive and move on, that Wesley was young and made a mistake, that I was being dramatic and ruining family harmony over a man, the man I was supposed to marry in three months. My dad handed me back my engagement ring and told me to return it quietly. Don't make a scene. Don't embarrass Wesley. He's got a future, law school applications, important things. I returned to the ring, then I returned myself, moved four States away, changed my number, deleted everything, no Thanksgiving invites, no Christmas, not even a text when I got diagnosed with Lupus last year and spent two weeks in the hospital alone. But Linda never stopped calling me. She's the one who taught me to drive, helped me move into my first apartment, co signed my student loans when my parents wouldn't. She flew out when I was hospitalized and sat with me every single day. She held my hand when the doctors explained I'd be managing this disease for the rest of my life. So when she asked me to come to her 60th birthday, I said yes. What I didn't know was that Linda had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer six months ago.

When I married Kai, his Vietnamese family was super nice to me. They hugged me, fed me, included me in everything. But here's the thing. They only spoke German around me. Even when other Vietnamese relatives visited, they'd switch to German the second I walked into the room. I thought it was sweet, honestly. Like they were going out of their way to make me comfortable. What they didn't know was that I'd spent two years teaching English in Hanoi before I even met Kai. My Vietnamese wasn't perfect, but I could understand way more than I let on. I just never mentioned it because, honestly, why make it awkward? They seemed happy speaking German with me, so I went along with it. Everything was totally fine for, like, two years. We had family dinners every Sunday, celebrated Tet together, the whole deal. Then Kai's mom had a stroke. Bad one. She was in the hospital for weeks, and everyone was stressed out of their minds. I went to the hospital every single day. I brought her favorite soup from that place on Maple Street. Organized all her medications in a little pill box, chatted with the nurses about her progress. Kai's family was always there, too, but they were quieter than usual. I figured everyone was just worried and tired. One Thursday evening, I got to the hospital early because Kai was stuck in traffic after work. I was walking Down the hallway with a container of pho. When I heard voices coming from his mom's room. Vietnamese voices. I stopped right outside the door not to eavesdrop. I was about to walk in, but then I heard Kai's aunt say something that made my blood run cold. She's so fake. He only married him for his money. Why else would some white girl learn to make banh mi? His cousin laughed. Don't stress about it. She'll leave after the baby comes anyway. Girls like that never stick around when things get real. I just stood there in the hallway, holding that stupid soup container, feeling like someone punched me in the stomach. I didn't cry. I didn't storm in. I walked to the vending machine, bought an orange juice I didn't even want, and sat in the waiting area until Kai showed up. I didn't tell him. Not that night, not the next week, either. But I kept going to the hospital.

The nurse who usually translated wasn't there yet. The doctor was speaking rapid Vietnamese and everyone looked completely lost. Kai's aunt was trying to translate but getting it all wrong. I stepped forward and translated word for word perfectly clear. The entire room went silent. You could hear the heart monitor beeping. Kai stared at me. Wait, you speak Vietnamese? I looked right at his aunt. Yeah, just enough to know who's been calling me a gold digger for three weeks. His aunt's face went white. His cousin looked at the floor. His mom started crying from the hospital bed. Kai kept asking me what I was talking about. I told him everything I'd heard. His aunt tried to say I misunderstood. His cousin tried to apologize. But I was done. That night, I packed a bag and stayed at my friend Jordan's apartment. Kai called me 17 times. I answered once and said, I'm not coming to the hospital anymore. They didn't want me there anyway. Now they got their wish. His family blew up his phone trying to apologize. His mom sent me a long voice message in Vietnamese, crying and begging me to come back. But I'd heard what they really thought of me. When they thought I couldn't understand, Kai moved out with me. Two weeks later, we got our own apartment across town. His family tried to visit, but I told Kai I needed space, real space.

When did you realise you were living in a bubble and not like everyone else? I thought every kid had their birthdays planned by event coordinators. Until I was 13, every April, my parents would rent out country clubs or these fancy rooftop venues downtown. They'd hire magicians, ice cream trucks, face painters, and once even this guy who brought parrots that could talk. I'm talking like 60 kids from school showing up, tables covered in those fancy cloth things, waiters walking around with little appetizers on trays. But here's the weird part. None of the kids ever stayed long. Like they'd show up, eat some cake, watch the magic show for maybe an hour, then their parents would collect them and they'd leave. And nobody ever brought me actual presents, just these white envelopes that my mom would grab and stuff into her purse before I could even see what was inside. I didn't think it was strange back then. I figured that's just how birthdays worked. The envelopes probably had money or gift cards or something, right? And maybe other kids just had smaller parties because their parents weren't as organised as mine. Then in 7th grade, this kid, Jake, from my math class, invited me to his birthday party. I was actually pretty excited because Jake was cool and I wanted to be friends with him. My mom dropped me off at this public park and I was confused because there was No ballet or anything, just regular parking spots. When I found Jake's party, my brain basically short circuited. There was one folding table with a plastic tablecloth, hot dogs cooking on this little portable grill and a cooler full of sodas. No servers, no fancy decorations, just balloons tied to the table legs. And get this, there was one soccer ball. That was it for entertainment. But all the kids were laughing their heads off. They were playing tag, kicking the soccer ball around and having these intense conversations about video games and t V shows. Everyone had wrapped presents, actual gifts and colourful paper with ribbons and stuff. Jake opened each one and got genuinely excited about things like Pokemon cards and a new skateboard. The party lasted four hours. Four hours. And nobody wanted to leave. Parents had to literally drag their kids away because it was.

What rumor? I looked up confused and reached for my phone but remembered it had died on the bus that morning. The entire classroom went silent. Kids who were talking suddenly stopped mid sentence. Everyone was stealing glances at me, but whenever I made eye contact, they'd quickly look away. This one girl, Arlene, in the front row, was actually crying while looking at me. But for some reason the boys were laughing. Miss I O Connor shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. I'm not at liberty to discuss the rumor with you. I really suggest you speak with the counselor. My heart started racing because something was seriously wrong. Whatever this rumor was, it had made my teacher look at me like I was made of glass about to break. I grabbed my dead phone and my backpack and headed for the door. I needed to find my best friend, Kaylee right now. Kaylee was in Mister Brady's homeroom down the hall. I knocked and pointed at her through the little window. Mister Brady looked at me with the same wide eyed sad expression Miss O'connor had and immediately let Kaylee come out. That's when I knew this was bad. Teachers never just let kids leave class without a hall pass. The second we got into the hallway, Kaylee grabbed me in the tightest hug. I'm so sorry this is happening to you, baby. I'm so, so sorry. I started crying without even knowing why my best friend was holding me like my life was ruined. All I could think about was if someone leaked me. Kaylee just kept hugging me and rubbing my back while I saw.

We want you gone tonight. When I agreed and stopped paying for everything, they, you've been controlling us long enough, my mother announced over dinner, her words slightly slurred from her third glass of wine. Dad nodded beside her, his bloodshot eyes avoiding mine entirely. My little sister, Yarabelle, stopped eating immediately. At 11, she'd gotten used to their erratic behavior, but this was different. Controlling you. I kept my voice level, though my stomach dropped. Don't play innocent, dad finally spoke. I recognized this pattern. They needed money again. We know you've been intercepting our paychecks, hiding our bank cards, treating us like children who can't manage their own money. The accusation was so backwards, I almost laughed. I've been cashing their occasional checks and using every penny for rent and groceries before they could gamble it away. My warehouse job barely covered the rest, but somehow I'd managed to keep us housed and Yarabelle fed. You monitor every dollar we spend, mom continued, gaining confidence. We're grown adults, but you act like our parent, deciding what we can and can't buy. We're done being controlled by our own son. You're 22, Dad added, want you gone. By morning, Yarabelle's eyes went wide and she grabbed my arm under the table. Unless, dad added, you give us access to your bank accounts for the emotional damage you caused. They wanted my savings, the emergency fund I'd scraped together for Yarabelle. And me, I made my choice. I'll be gone by morning, I said quietly. I packed that night while they celebrated downstairs, popping open a bottle of champagne they've been saving for a special occasion. Yarabell helped me carry boxes to my car. Tears streaming down her face. I slipped her a cheap phone I bought weeks ago, telling her to hide it and only use it for emergencies. You're coming back, right, she whispered. I couldn't answer that honestly, so I just hugged her tight. The next morning, they were already making plans. My friend's couch. I watched their social media explode with excitement. Finally free to live our lives, mom posted, along with a selfie of them holding plane tickets. Day 1 in Vegas, they posted everything. The welcome drinks at the casino, the fancy steakhouse dinner, dad throwing dice at the craps table. Beginner's luck, he captioned a photo of a small pile of chips. Day 2 brought more victories. Mom hit three cherries on the slots. Dad posted a video from a poker table, stacks of chips growing in front of him. Should have done this years ago, he wrote. Their friends commented with congratulations and fire emojis. Yarabell texted me that night. They said three days back, Sunday. By day 4, the posts got bigger. VIP room access, bottle service at some club. A photo of them in matching silk robes at the hotel spa. Living like we deserve, mom captioned it. They'd extended their Stay hot street continues. Day 5, 6, 7, the posts kept coming. Expensive shows, helicopter tours, more casino floors. Yarabelle's texts changed. Running low on food. When are they coming back? Day 8 was quieter, just one photo of a poker table, no caption. Day 9, nothing. Day 10, Yarabelle called me crying there.

Fine, I'll eat something normal. So my roommate Jake has this thing where he gets all pissy about me eating at night. Like, dude, I work 10 hour shifts at the warehouse and don't get home until 11 most nights. Sorry if my grilled cheese and leftover pizza bothers your precious sleep schedule. Last Tuesday I got home around my usual time, starving because I skipped lunch to cover for this guy who called out sick. I was exhausted, feet killing me. Just wanted to make something quick and pass out. I opened the fridge and saw we had some leftover Chinese takeout from the weekend, so I figured I'd heat that up. But as I'm pulling containers out comes stomping out of his room in his stupid Batman pajama pants all dramatic like I just murdered someone. He goes, really? You're gonna be loud in the kitchen again? Some of us have real jobs that start early. Real jobs? This dude works at a bank and strolls in at 9:30. I've been up since 5:00am loading trucks. I told him I was just heating up some lo Mein, would take like two minutes. He rolled his eyes and said why can't you eat normal food at normal times like a normal person? All this weird late night stuff is ridiculous. Weird late night stuff? It was leftover Chinese food. Not exactly strange, but fine. He wants normal food at Normal times. I can do normal. The next morning I woke up at 4:30 instead of my usual 5:15. Went straight to the kitchen and started making breakfast. Real breakfast. Bacon, eggs, hash Browns, toast. The works. Used every pan we owned. Really let that bacon sizzle nice and loud. Jake's room shares a wall with the kitchen. Around 5 a. M. I heard his alarm go off. Then I heard it go off again. And again. Dude kept hitting snooze while I'm out here clanging pans around flipping hash Browns. You know, making normal breakfast food at a normal breakfast time. By the third news alarm, I was really getting into it. Started humming while I cooked. Dropped a few pans on accident. Had to check on those hash Browns every 30 seconds to make sure they weren't burning. Finally heard him get up around 5:30. He stumbled out looking like he got hit by a truck, hair sticking up everywhere, squinting at me like I was some kind of alien. What the hell are you doing? I smiled real big and said, making normal food at a normal time. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right? He just stood there for a minute trying to process what was happening.

She was threatening legal action for stopping payments on debts that were legally theirs. I hired a lawyer. Jennifer reviewed everything and smiled with steel in her eyes. Your mother doesn't have a case if she pursues this. We'll counter sue for financial abuse. We'll expose every transfer, every guilt trip, every manipulative text. We'll make this so ugly, she'll wish she never picked up the phone. Two weeks before the wedding, the mortgage payment bounced. My credit dropped 30 points. The Tesla payment bounced. Next day, another hit. Then Jennifer discovered something. My mother had been making minimum payments with my money while telling relatives she was reporting her ungrateful daughter through hard times. She'd been using my financial abuse to play the martyr. My mother's lawyer withdrew from the case after realizing she'd been lying to him. My father called. Where did all the money go, dad? I asked. I paid $150,000. Where is it? Silence! Your mother has expectations, he finally said. About how we should live. The trips, the furniture, the club memberships. She says we've earned it. You could start by making your own payments, I said softly. You could start by being my dad instead of her accomplice. He hung up. My mother showed up at my bridal shower disheveled and desperate. Please, she begged in front of everyone. We need to talk. You need to leave, I said. When she wouldn't, Emily called the police. The wedding, Was perfect. My mother didn't come. Neither did my father. Their absence felt like the first honest thing they'd given me in years. Three months later, Jennifer emailed. Your parents house went into foreclosure. The Tesla was repossessed. Your mother attempted to open a credit card in your name. I filed identity theft reports. Six months later, my father called from Nevada. I left. I'm divorcing her. I wanted to say I'm sorry. Not just for the money. For not being your dad. A year after the wedding, I saw my mother at the grocery store. She looked like someone who'd been surviving instead of living. I'm sorry, she said. You were right about everything. I destroyed the best thing in my life because I couldn't stand not being the center of your world. I can't be part of your healing journey? I reply. Not right now. Maybe not ever. She nodded. You look happy. That's all I ever should have wanted for you. My credit recovered. John and I bought our own house. My father and I talk once a month. Brief, honest conversations. My mother stood up at my rehearsal dinner and tried to destroy him. Instead, she freed me. And I've never looked back.

I was hurt, but honestly, I was more angry that she didn't just tell me the truth. I focused on work, picked up extra shifts, started saving money for a house. My boss offered me a supervisor position with a big raise. I took a welding certification course on weekends to specialize in underwater welding, which pays even more. Three months after the breakup, I bought a 4 closed house in a nice neighborhood. It needed work, but I could fix most of it myself. New floors, updated kitchen, completely redid the master bathroom. I posted progress pictures on my Instagram because I was proud of the work. That's when Jessica started watching all my stories. She started liking my posts. Then she sent me a message saying the house looked amazing and asking how I was doing. I left her on read. A week later, she texted saying she made a huge mistake. The Derek turned out to be a jerk who only cared about himself. He dumped her at parties to network with his finance buddies, made her split every Bill down to the penny, even asked her to help pay for his car payment because he was bad with money. Despite the fancy job, Jessica said her friends were wrong about me, that she was wrong about me. Could we meet up and talk? I thought about it for maybe 5 seconds then typed back, no thanks, I'm good. She kept texting and she realised I was the one all along that material things don't matter, that she loved me and wanted to fix things. I finally called her and said, you didn't want to break. You wanted to trade up. Now that your backup plan crashed, you think you can just come back. That's not how this works. She started crying, saying she was young and stupid and influenced by her friends. I told her those friends would still be in her life, still judging her choices, still making her feel like she settled. I wasn't going to be someone's backup plan or second choice. My new neighbor, Kelly, had been helping me pick out paint colors for the living room. She was a teacher, thought it was cool that I could build and fix things. We've been grabbing coffee on Saturday mornings after I finished work on the house. Nothing serious yet, but it felt easy and real. She never once made me feel like I wasn't enough. Last week, Jessica showed up at my house unannounced, saw Kelly's car in the driveway and me showing her the deck I just built. Jessica just stood there on the sidewalk staring, then got back in her car and left. I got one final text from her that night saying she understood and hoped I'd be happy. I deleted the message and got back to planning the housewarming party. Turns out being a welder who owns his own house, And knows his worth is pretty great, actually.

My father said, don't listen to them, they're liars. But Nora said he ties our hands behind our backs. He's been doing it for four years. The hospital called the police immediately. The doctors found severe nerve damage, dislocated shoulders, torn ligaments and permanent loss of function in several fingers. One doctor looked at my X rays and started crying. My father told the police, this is normal. They're lying about the severity. Child services put us in foster care while they investigated. My father hired his brother, who is a doctor, to write fake medical reports saying our injuries were from a genetic disorder. He submitted these to child services and demanded we be he returned to him. Our case worker called and said, your father has medical evidence that contradicts your story. We're reconsidering custody. I said, he's lying. Please don't send us back. She said, we'll schedule a hearing. Two weeks later, my father brought my mother to our foster home to prove we were lying. When she walked through the door, her hands were tied behind her back. She was crying and her shoulders were visibly dislocated. She said, girls, please tell them the truth. Tell them you made this up. I stared at her and said, mom, what did he do to you? She said, I'm choosing this to show proper submission. Our foster mother said, your hands are tied. How is that A choice. My father said she's demonstrating that our family's practices are voluntary. But my mother was shaking from pain and could barely stand. Our foster father called the police immediately. When the officers arrived, one of them said, ma'am, are you being held against your will? My mother tried to say no, but started sobbing. The officer said to my father, untie her hands right now. My father said, this is a private family matter. The officer said, this is criminal abuse and arrested him on the spot. My father went to prison for child abuse. My mother eventually testified against him and admitted he'd forced her to come with tied hands. Child services gave her a choice between leaving him or losing custody permanently. She chose him. I had three surgeries but still can't lift my arms above my head. I haven't spoken to either parent since.

She'd been specifically positioned as her mentor by our director. They worked closely together on every major account. Courtney knew everything about her, her routines, her insecurities, her habits. I pulled Courtney into my office an hour later. She immediately went defensive, crossing her arms and saying it was just a basic white girl costume and the name tag was completely random. Beatrix is a normal name, she insisted. There's probably thousands of Beatrices in America, but I'd already checked. I asked HR to pull Courtney's access logs from our system and three weeks before Halloween, she'd requested Beatrix's employee file. She'd also accessed the company directory to view Beatrix's profile photo four times that week, all at odd hours, midnight, 2:00am. When I confronted her with the time stamps, Courtney's expression changed complete. The fake confusion vanished. I was just looking, she said flatly. No emotion. That's not illegal. I suspended her pending a full investigation. That afternoon, Beatrix called in sick. I texted her asking if she was okay, telling her to take whatever time she needed. She read the message at three fourteen PM but didn't respond. Day two, nothing. Her calls went straight to voicemail. Day three, her mother called me at 6 a. And her voice was frantic, breaking, have you seen Beatrice? She didn't come home last night. She's not answering anyone. Her roommate hasn't seen her since yesterday morning. They filed a missing person report. That evening at the sheriff station. By day 4, police found her car at Cold Water Canyon Trail about 40 minutes from our office. Keys still in the ignition, phone on the passenger seat, battery dead. Her last text to her mother sent at eleven fifty three PM on day 2. I can't do this anymore. I'm so sorry for everything. They've been searching the woods for 3 days now. Search and rest you teams, tracking dogs, Thermal drones, volunteers from our office. Nothing. Just her footprints leading into the forest and disappearing near the creek. Courtney's lawyer sent our company a cease and desist yesterday claiming we're harassing his client and creating a hostile work environment for her. My boss, the same one who voted for Courtney's costume, pulled me aside this morning and told me to drop the entire investigation. We can't prove anything, he said, and we're opening ourselves up to a massive lawsuit. I keep thinking about Beatrix sitting in my office with her hands shaking, twisting that silver ring, how small her voice sounded when she said I trusted her. How Courtney's face went completely cold when I mentioned those midnight access logs. The search team is going out again tomorrow at dawn. I'm going with them this time. I should have been there for Halloween.

But true friends adapt, she said, raising her glass. That's when I stood up. Speaking of adapting, I said, I have something to share. I pulled out my phone, connected it to the bar's TV system that the manager had graciously let me access an hour earlier. Before we toast to friendship, I thought everyone should see this. The security footage played on the giant screen. Rachel's hand extending cash, the stylist nodding, Rachel checking that I wasn't watching. The whole bar went silent. Three hundred dollars. I to the room. That's what Rachel paid to have my hair chopped off before my wedding. The salon manager confirmed it. The stylist confessed. When confronted with the footage, Rachel's face went from confused to panicked to furious in seconds. That's not. You're misunderstanding what you're seeing, she started. The stylist admitted everything. Rachel. She still had the exact bills in her wallet. Three hundred dollar bills. The other women started murmuring. My cousin Amy stood up. You sabotaged her hair on purpose before her wedding. Rachel tried to defend herself. It wasn't sabotage. I thought she'd look better with short hair, more sophisticated. That long hair was aging her. I was doing her a favor. My sister laughed. Not a nice laugh. You paid someone behind her back to do something you knew she didn't want, and you think that's a favor? Rachel turned to me. You're being so dramatic about this. It's just hair. It grows back. You're right. I said it does grow back. But trust doesn't. And neither does friendship after someone shows you who they really are. The room was staring at Rachel. Now she tried one more defense. I've been your best friend for 12 years. I've always looked out for you. No, I said. You've been threatened by me for 12 years. Every time something good happened in my life, you found a way to taint it. But you smiled through it all. Hugged me through the pain you caused. Made me think you were my safety net, when really, you were the one pushing me off the cliff. I turned back to the group. Rachel's not invited to my wedding anymore. She's not my maid of honor. She's not my friend. And I wanted all. All of you to know exactly why so she can't spin this story later. Rachel grabbed her purse and ran out. Half the women followed her to the parking lot, not to comfort her, but to make sure she left. My sister took over the party, ordered champagne, made a new toast about real friendship and karma. The wedding was flawless until the reception, when James's best man pulled me aside with a confession. Rachel had contacted him weeks before, begging him to convince James to call off the wedding.

It started the day my father caught me brushing my hair in front of the bathroom mirror a few weeks before he joined a group that he told us was for men's empowerment. He grabbed my wrist and said, what are you doing? I said, just brushing my hair. He said, you're being vain. Women's hands are instruments of sin. He made me and my sister Nora stand in the living room while he got rope from the garage. He said, from this day forward, all daughters in this house will keep their hands bound behind their backs. It will teach you humility and keep you from temptation. My mother stood next to him and said, your father knows what's best. My father used thick rope that he tied tight enough to hurt our wrists. We had to sleep with our hands tied. We had to eat with our hands tied. We had to do all our chores with our hands tied. The first day, I tried to wash dishes by holding the sponge in my mouth. My father watched and said, maybe now you'll appreciate how easy you had it before cooking became impossible. I had to lean over the stove and use my face to push pots around. I burned my cheek trying to stir soup. Nora dropped a pot of boiling water and scolded her legs because she couldn't catch it. My father said, you're Clumsy. You need more practice. My brothers were allowed to keep their hands free and would watch us struggle while eating dinner at the table. They'd laugh when we dropped things or burned ourselves. My father encouraged it and said how pathetic females are without men to guide them. Within a month, my shoulders were in constant pain. My wrists bled where the rope cut into them, and my father would re tie the bindings over the wounds. Nora developed nerve damage in her arms and started losing feeling in her fingers. She said, dad, I can't feel my hands anymore. He said, good. That means you're not thinking about using them for sinful purposes. My mother helped him enforce the rules. When I begged her to untie me, just for an hour, she said, you're being selfish. Your father knows what's best. We weren't allowed to leave the house. My father pulled us out of school and said seeing other women with free hands would corrupt you. Simple things like opening doors became impossible. We had to ram them with our shoulders or push them with our heads. I developed infections in my shoulders from the constant strain. Nora's hands turned purple from lack of circulation, and her fingers curled into claws. My father said, this is proof that women's hands were meant to be useless. When I was 16, I collapsed in the kitchen. My shoulder had finally given out completely. I heard something pop. I couldn't move My arm and the pain was so severe I vomited. Nora screamed, mom, help! Something's wrong! My father said she's faking to get sympathy. When I still couldn't get up after two hours, my mother finally called an ambulance.

I'd grown it out for three years specifically for the wedding. Rachel knew this. She'd been there through every trim, every deep conditioning treatment, every moment. I said no to a fun new cut because I wanted that long, romantic updo for my wedding day. She was supposed to protect me at the salon. That's why she came along instead. When I closed my eyes for the wash, she slipped the stylist $300 cash and whispered new instructions, cut it short, Pixie short. Say it was a miscommunication. The stylist took the money. When I opened my eyes, two feet of hair covered the floor and Rachel was fake gasping, hand over her mouth, playing shocked. The stylist kept apologizing, saying she thought I said I wanted a dramatic change, that I was tired of the length. I sobbed for two hours. Rachel held me, rubbed my back, said maybe it was meant to be that I'd look edgy and modern now. He offered to pay for extensions, but we both knew they'd never look right. With only six days to blend them properly that night, I couldn't stop thinking about Rachel's reaction. Too perfect, too rehearsed. The stylist had cut with such confidence, no hesitation, no checking in like they usually do with big changes. I called the salon the next morning, asked to speak to the manager, told her I suspected something happened. But needed to know for sure. She reviewed the security footage, called me back within an hour. Your friend handed our stylist money while you were at the wash station. We have it on camera. The audio is muffled, but you can see the cash exchange clearly. She offered to fire the stylist, offered free services for a year. I said no. Just emailed me the footage. I watched it 20 times. Rachel's smug little smile as she handed over the bills. The stylist nodding eagerly. Rachel checking to make sure I still had my eyes closed. I didn't confront her, not yet. Instead, I called James, told him everything. He was furious, but I asked him to wait. Let me handle this my way. Four days before the wedding, Rachel threw my bachelorette party, 15 women at a wine bar she booked. During her toast, she went on about our 12 year friendship, how she'd always been there for me, how she was so happy I found James.

She picked the wrong man. My fiance and I exchanged glances. I replied, perfect and got security to kick her out. The same night she texted, don't forget the mortgage payment and the Tesla car loan payments are tomorrow. I stared at that text until my hands stopped shaking. On read over my shoulder, what mortgage? What Tesla? That's when six years of lies came pouring out. When I was 22, my mother called crying, dad made bad investments. They'd lose the house. Could I help just temporarily? I co signed a 60 thousand dollar mortgage refinance. Six months later, I co signed a 55 thousand dollar Tesla loan. Because he deserves something nice. I promised to make every payment. I'd never see a Bill except the backup. Automatic transfers from my account became the primary. $700 monthly for the mortgage, $800 for the Tesla, plus insurance, taxes, emergencies, nearly $2,000 vanishing every month for six years. $150,000 of my money gone. I've been packing lunches and skipping trips thinking I was saving for our wedding. But I was barely breaking even, drowning while my mother pushed me under inch by inch. When I felt stressed about money, she'd say, you make good money, you're just bad with budgeting. She gaslit me into thinking I was the problem. John asked what I wanted to do. I logged into my bank and deleted every Automatic payment authorization. And I screenshot the confirmation and sent it to my mother with one message. You said you weren't paying for the circus. I'm not paying for your life anymore. I blocked her number, turned off my phone, let John hold me while I shook apart. The next morning brought 17 missed calls on John's phone. My mother's friends, my aunts, cousins, the family network activated with one message. I was selfish, ungrateful, destroying my family over one little disagreement. She'd recruited everyone to tell me. So then my mother's lawyer sent a letter threatening to sue me for emotional distress and financial damage caused.

Six hours through traffic, a thunderstorm, and two rest stops with questionable bathrooms. My parents have been calling for weeks. Please come. It's been so long. Everyone misses you. The guilt trip was relentless, so I finally caved. I walked into my parents house, luggage in hand, exhausted, but ready to reconnect. The living room was packed with relatives I hadn't seen in years. Uncle Dave, Aunt Karen, my cousins, even my sister Emma, who usually avoided these things. Everyone was laughing, drinking wine, looking genuinely happy to be there. My mom spotted me first. You made it! She hugged me briefly, then immediately turned back to her conversation. No one else seemed to notice I'd arrived. I stood there awkwardly waiting for someone to acknowledge the six hour drive I just made because they begged me to come. Twenty minutes passed. I tried joining conversations, but every circle I approached seemed to close up or drift away. Emma was showing everyone photos from her recent cruise. Uncle Dave was telling his same fishing story from 1987. No one asked about my life, my job, nothing. Then my mom clinked her wine glass. Everyone, announcement time. The room went quiet. We've decided to do something special this year. We're all going On a family vacation together. We leave tomorrow morning. The room erupted in cheers. People were hugging, already planning what to pack. I felt this wave of relief. Okay, this made sense. They wanted me here so we could all go on this trip together. That's actually really nice. My mom caught my eye and walked over, still smiling. Isn't this exciting? Yeah. I said, where are we going? She blinked. Oh, honey, not you. Just the family.

I'm in community college and sitting in the study lounge near the vending machines. I'm feeling extra confident today wearing my good wig, the expensive one my parents bought me as a gift. Real human hair and looks exactly like my real hair before cancer took it. I'm halfway through my biology chapter when this younger kid plops down next to me, probably 14 in that program for special students. Hi, how are you today? Big smile, bouncing a little. Good. Just studying, I say, trying to be polite. Your hair is the prettiest thing ever. Without warning, his fingers are running through my hair. Whoa. Personal space, please. I scoot away uncomfortably, but trying to be nice. His face completely changes. I want it. Want what? Your hair? Give it to me so I can take it home. My eyes widened. Um, I don't think so, but it's a wig and I can show you where to buy it. I say. I don't want to buy it. I want to wear your wig. Now, at this point, I think to myself, this can't be real. I'm trying to show him the website on my phone when he suddenly lunges forward and yanks my wig clean off my head. The air conditioning hits my bare scalp. Thankfully, the study lounge is pretty empty, but still, I was embarrassed and my cheeks got red. My hands are shaking as I grab For my wig, but he's holding it above his head like a trophy. Give it back, I said. I managed to snatch it from his hands and quickly put it back on, adjusting it with trembling fingers. That wasn't nice, I say. My voice unsteady, I pack my stuff as fast as I can and start walking toward the exit. My heart still pounding, but I'm thinking, okay, that was horrible, but it's over now. I'm halfway cross the lounge trying to calm my breathing when something hard slams into the back of my head. The impact makes me stumble forward. I turn around and his shoe is on the floor behind me. This kid just threw his shoe at my head. You can't just throw things at people. I'm looking around desperately for a professor, security, anyone, but it's that dead time between classes. The lounge is still mostly empty except for some students way in the back corner with headphones on. Before I can move, he's charging at me, actually running full speed. I'm freaking terrified. He crashes into me and starts hitting my arms, scratching at my face. I'm trying to protect myself, holding my arms up to block him.

Everything changed after that. She started leaving homemade dinners with sticky notes, bibimbap pyeong and enjoy. We started having coffee together some mornings, barely talking, but the silence felt comfortable. Now three weeks later, she asked if I'd come to her company's pride Celebration event. Her co workers kept asking about her mysterious husband and she needed a real face. I went in my only button down without grease stains. She introduced me to everyone, her hand resting warm on my lower back, like done it forever. Five different co workers pulled me aside saying she never stops talking about me at work in the parking garage. Afterward, we sat in her prius in complete silence for 15 minutes. Then she told me her therapist had asked her directly if she was developing romantic feelings for me. I watched her knuckles turn white gripping the steering wheel. She said she told her therapist it's impossible because she's gay, exclusively attracted to women her entire 24 years. Last night she cooked real dinner for the first time. Galbi, six types of banchan, perfect white rice. The table set with actual plates instead of paper towels. Halfway through eating, she mentioned casually that her ex girlfriend Maya had reached out wanting to reconcile. Maya said our marriage is fake anyway, so we could just divorce early and they can be together for real. I set down my chopsticks carefully and waited, barely breathing. I didn't Want this to happen, she said she told Maya no without hesitation, said she couldn't explain it. But when she imagined me packing up and leaving, her chest physically hurt. She looked at me with terrified eyes and said she doesn't understand what's happening to her. 24 years of being exclusively gay, never once attracted to any man. But somehow I've become the person she thinks about first when something good happens at work. Our legal contract ends March 15. Five months from now, we're supposed to file for divorce and walk away clean. But we're sitting at this table and her hand reaches across to take mine, not for her parents, not for a staged photo, just for us. She whispers that she might never be physically attracted to me the way she was to women, that she doesn't know what label even fits her anymore. I tell her we don't need all the answers tonight. I say maybe we just don't file the divorce paperwork when March comes. Her eyes go wide, then soft, and she nods slowly. Two complete strangers who got married for money and survival, somehow accidentally becoming each other's home. We have five months left on our contract, but sitting here with her hand warm in mind, neither of us is counting down anymore.

And I'm scared because I'm falling for her too. We got married seven months ago for 87 dollars at King County Courthouse. I was 27, drowning in 190 thousand dollar medical debt from my dad's stage 4 cancer treatment. She was 24, her traditional Korean parents threatening conversion therapy unless she married a man. By her 25th birthday. They'd already cut off her two million dollar trust fund and enrolled her in a Montana camp starting June 1st. We met through my sister's girlfriend who knew someone desperate. She had an undercut and kept her rainbow wrist tattoo covered the entire meeting. The contract was three pages. I get 70 thousand dollar cash after joint taxes. She gets her inheritance and avoids conversion therapy. Two years minimum. Married for credibility. We shook hands over cold fries and scheduled the courthouse. Her parents flew 60 relatives from Seoul and paid fifteen thousand dollars for the wedding. My mom sobbed through the ceremony thinking I'd finally found someone after my ex left. We did the first dance where she had to whisper where to put my hands every time. Guests to glasses demanding kisses. Her entire body went rigid. We managed four quick pecks. Mechanical and awkward like signing paperwork. The Capital Hill apartment became two strangers under one roof. She worked remote for Amazon. Door closed 9 to 6 with APOP leading through. I pulled 60 hour weeks as a line Cook at canvas. Coming home past midnight smelling like duck fat. We had a bathroom schedule taped to the mirror for six months. We spoke maybe 200 words total, mostly excuse me in the kitchen. Then her parents ambushed us on a Saturday in October. She texted during lunch, prep parents here in 20 min. Help! I lied to my sous chef about a family emergency. Raced home in my chef whites. Everything had transformed. When I arrived, my PlayStation was shoved deep in her bedroom closet. Her pride flags were hidden behind winter coats. Wedding photos suddenly covered every wall, half still showing the stock cup in the frames. Her dad asked about my salary and grandchildren. Immediately, she invented our entire relationship. Morning coffee routine, my preferences, weekend hikes we'd never taken. That night, she described our intimate bedroom life to her mother in detail, while I stood there nodding, slowly dying inside. They stayed three brutal days. After they finally left, I found her at 2:00am on the bathroom floor, still wearing the modest floral dress she

I immediately clocked that hoe in the face, and she fell back into the flowers. Why would you say that? I screamed, not caring that everyone in the funeral home turned to stare. Annie held her face, looking more sad than hurt. It seems you don't know about your father's double life. What are you talking about? I looked around the room and noticed something strange. Everyone was avoiding my eyes. My aunt suddenly found the calculator app fascinating. My cousins whispered behind their hands. Even the funeral director looked uncomfortable, like he knew something I didn't. The entire room felt heavy with a secret they all shared except me. I grabbed Annie's arm and pulled her into the hallway. Tell me what my father did right now. She shook her head and pressed her lips together. I don't want to speak it in fear that I'll be excluded from heaven like that lustful monster. Just speaking the words might condemn me, too. This was insane. Annie and I had been friends since kindergarten. She'd slept over my house hundreds of times. My dad had driven us to school and made us pancakes and taught us both to ride bikes. What could he have possibly done that was so terrible? She thought saying it would damn her soul. I stormed back into the viewing room and found my mom dabbing her Eyes by the guestbook. Mom, what is everyone talking about? What did dad do? Her face crumpled and fresh tears started flowing. It's absolutely disgusting. I can't even think about it without feeling sick. She hurried toward the bathroom, leaving me standing there even more confused. My Uncle Gary was outside smoking with some other relatives. He'd been my dad's brother and best friend. Surely he'd tell me the truth. But when I asked him, he just shook his head and stared at the ground. I don't know if I can even call him my brother anymore. What he did goes against everything our family believes in. He flicked his cigarette away and walked back inside without another word. I was getting desperate now. My father was lying in a casket inside, and everyone was acting like he'd been some kind of monster. What secret could be so horrible that his own brother disowned? I found my grandma sitting on a bench outside, smoking her Virginia Slims. If anyone would give me a straight answer, it was her. Grandma didn't believe in sugar coating anything and had opinions about everything. Grandma, please. Everyone's acting like dad did something unforgivable, but no one will tell me what. I sat down next to her, trying not to cry. She took a long drag and rolled her eyes. Oh, please. You want to know what your father did? She pulled out her phone and scrolled through Facebook with her perfectly manicured nails. After Your whore of a mother cheated on your father and left him. He got super drunk one night, posted a video of himself at a party with his friends. I break.

Why would you say that about mom, I asked. Shocked. No reason, he said quickly, and walked away to look at Aunt Darla's body in the casket. I stood there confused, watching him stare down at my aunt's peaceful face. My sister Zoe came up beside me and grabbed my arm. Did dad tell you that thing about mom? She asked. I swear he has absolutely no shame. Why would he say that, I asked, still trying to process what just happened. Don't you know about dad and Aunt Darla? Did they have an affair? Zoe laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. I wish it's much more complicated than that. She pulled me outside the church into the parking lot. The air was cold and I could see my breath. Zoe looked around to make sure nobody followed us. You, I have to swear you won't repeat this to anyone, she said. I swear dad knew Aunt Darla before he even met mom. They were dating for three years. They were so in love it made everyone sick. Dad bought a ring and everything. What happened, mom happened. She was Darla's younger sister and she was obsessed with dad. She wanted him so bad she used to follow them on dates. This was getting weird. I'd never heard any of this before. My parents always acted like they'd been Together forever. One night, dad was going to propose at this fancy restaurant. Darla left early to get ready. She was walking across the parking lot when someone hit her with their car. Oh, my god. It was mom. She ran over her own sister. Darla was paralyzed from the waist down. She couldn't have kids anymore. I felt sick. My mom had crippled her own sister out of jealousy. But here's where it gets really messed up, Zoe continued. Darla always wanted kids. She'd frozen her eggs before the accident just in case. So she asked mom to be her surrogate to carry dad and Darla's baby. Mom agreed to that. She said yes. She went through the whole process, nine months of pregnancy. Everyone thought she was being this amazing sister. Zoe stopped talking and looked back at the search. Through the window, we could see dad still standing by the casket. What happened? I asked, even though I was scared to know. Mom lied. She never used Darla's eggs. She used her own. When the baby was born, it was mom and Dad's kid it, not Darla's. That was me, wasn't it? I already knew the answer. Yeah. You were supposed to be Darla's son. Dad didn't find out until after you were born. Mom had the doctors in on it. She paid them to fake the records. Sat down on the curb feeling like I might throw up. My whole life was built on my mom. Stealing me from my aunt. When dad found out, he tried to leave, Zoe said, sitting next to me. But mom had planned for that, too. What did she do? She told dad if he didn't marry her, she'd accuse him of assault. She had fake evidence ready, photos she doctored. Witness.

Growing up, she made sure I knew my place. You're the practice sister, the one guys date before they find someone like me. She'd say it at family dinners, at parties, anywhere with an audience. When I got my first boyfriend at 16, she told him I had commitment issues, broke up with me two weeks later. When I got into community college, she announced at Thanksgiving that not everyone can handle real universities. Meanwhile, everyone hung on her every word about law school rankings and internship offers. The pattern never changed. Any achievement I had got minimized. Any relationship I started got poisoned. She'd befriend my boyfriends, plant seeds of doubt and comfort me when things fell apart. You're just not relationship material, she'd say, rubbing my back. Some people are meant to be alone. By 25, I'd stopped trying, stopped dating, stopped sharing anything good that happened in my life because she'd find a way to ruin it. Then she met Nathan, Perfect Nathan with his finance job, his tailored suits, his parents summer house in Cape Cod. She paraded him around like a trophy she'd won. Post a couple photos constantly with captions about finally finding someone who sees my worth. At Sunday dinner, she'd make him tell stories about expensive restaurants and weekend trips. He touched his arm possessively whenever I Walked into the room like I might steal him just by existing. Six months in, they got engaged. The ring was massive. She made sure everyone saw it, holding her hand up to the light at every opportunity. The engagement party was at our parents house. She'd invited everyone, Nathan's colleagues, law school friends, distant relatives who barely knew us. That morning, she cornered me in the kitchen. I need you to tone it down tonight. Nathan's colleagues are here and I can't have you embarrassing me. She looked me up and down. Maybe wear something plain. Black is good on you. And try not to talk too much about your job. Nobody wants to hear about retail management. I wore black, stayed in the corner. I politely, when people talk to me, gave one word answers. But Nathan kept glancing at me during dinner. Not in a creepy way, more like he was trying to figure something out, like he was seeing something he hadn't noticed before. My sister noticed, too. She got louder, more animated, touched his shoulder, constantly interrupted me every time I started to speak. Oh, she's exaggerating. That's not.

I wrote him, like, 10 letters in the first month, but he never wrote back. I couldn't understand why my brother would ignore me when I needed him. My uncle came to visit after six months and asked why I hadn't been writing to Jonathan. He said Jonathan kept asking about me and was worried something was wrong. That's when I found out mom had been throwing away every single letter I sent. When I confronted her, she admitted it. She said Sam told her to do it because he didn't want Jonathan causing problems from jail. I begged her to let us write to each other. She said no. She even called the prison and told them I was a minor, so they wouldn't accept my letters even if I sent them directly. I've gone two years without talking to my brother while James made my life hell. But now Jonathan's coming home in two weeks, and mom has been acting so weird. She barely talks, just stares at her phone looking stressed. He knows I'm going to tell him everything. The best part is watching Sam and James. Last week, James mentioned something about finding his own apartment and moving out soon. He's 19 and has never had a job in his life, but suddenly he wants to move out right before Jonathan comes home. Sam keeps asking mom if Jonathan knows what's been going on. Mom says she doesn't think so, but She's not sure. Every time I mention my brother coming home, I watch the color drain from their faces. They get this look of pure fear, and I love it. Yesterday, James asked me if I was planning to tell Jonathan about what happened while he was gone. I just smiled, then said, I miss my brother so much, and we have a lot to catch up on. He went straight to his room, and I heard him on the phone looking at apartments. Here's the thing. They don't know yet. The house we're living in actually belongs to Jonathan. Dad left it to him in his will, but he had to be 20 to inherit it. He turned 20 in February while he was in jail. So, technically, Sam and James are living in my brother's house. Two weeks until Jonathan comes home. Sam and James are scared. And I couldn't be happier about it.

My brother Jonathan is 20 now and he's been in jail for the past two years, but he's coming home in two weeks. And watching my stepdad and stepbrother panic has been the most satisfying thing ever. Let me explain. Our dad died when I was 7 and Jonathan was ten. Before dad died, he always told Jonathan to look after me no matter what. My brother took that seriously, like really seriously. He became super protective of me after that. Three years after dad died, mom started dating Sam. Sam came with his son James, who was the same age as Jonathan. From day 1, Jonathan and Sam didn't get along. My brother has this thing where he doesn't just respect people automatically. You have to earn it with him. Sam tried acting like he was Jonathan's dad, giving him orders and setting rules. Every single time, Jonathan just ignored him. It drove Sam crazy. James thought he could copy his dad and try to boss Jonathan around, too. That was a mistake. The worst part was James making fun of our dad. I was in my room one day when I heard James telling his friends that my dad probably died because he was weak. He was laughing about it. I started crying and Jonathan heard me from downstairs. Never seen my brother move that fast. He went straight to James's room. And I heard this loud thud. When I came out, James was on the floor, completely knocked out. Jonathan had punched him so hard that James didn't wake up for like five minutes after that. Everyone walked on eggshells around Jonathan. If anyone even looked at me wrong, all Jonathan had to do was stare at them and they'd back off immediately. James was terrified of him. Sam was, too. But he acted tough around mom. Then two years ago, Jonathan got arrested with his friend for something completely unrelated. I can't say what, but it wasn't about James or anything violent at home. He got sentenced to jail time and suddenly everything changed. The second Jonathan left, James started bullying me bad. He'd call me names, knock my stuff over, lock me out of the bathroom. I told mom, but she just said boys will be boys and to toughen up. Sam acted like he didn't see anything. I tried writing letters to Jonathan because I missed him so much and needed to tell.

Mom whispered, stay quiet, he has a future. But my doctor didn't blink. I'm 27 now, but this happened two years ago in Ashford, Washington, a small timber town where gossip spreads faster than smoke from the mill. My family looked perfect from the outside. Dad ran the hardware store on Main. Mom shared the church bake sale. And my older brother Lucas was the golden boy, star quarterback turned business school prodigy. Me, I was the quiet daughter who painted in the garage. It was a Friday in September, seven forty three PM at a family cookout for Lucas's early acceptance to a Seattle firm. Mom decorated the backyard with blue and silver balloons and I even brought a 39 dollar cake from Costco. Lucas had already down to two IPA's. When I congratulated him, I thought I was being kind. But Lucas heard something else. Don't sound so jealous, sneered. You'll figure your life out someday. Dad laughed like it was a joke. I felt heat crawl up my neck. I'm proud of you, Luke, I said. That's all. Later, while carrying paper plates inside, he cornered me near the kitchen island. Why did you talk to my girlfriend about me being drunk last week? His voice was low but sharp. She asked if you were okay, I explained. I said you were stressed. Wrong answer. His eyes narrowed and before I could step back, he shoved me hard into the edge of The counter, I heard a crack. White hot pain shot across my chest. I collapsed, clutching my side. Mom rushed in. What happened, she demanded. Lucas muttered. She tripped. My breath came shallow, every inhale like glass. He pushed me, I wheezed. Mom froze, then knelt close, her voice trembling. Stay quiet. He has a future. Those words hurt worse than my ribs. By ten PM, I was back in my apartment wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The bruise spread like spill old ink. I could barely lift my arm. My phone buzzed nonstop. Mom offering Advil, dad saying don't blow this up. Lucas never called. At 6:00am the next morning, I drove myself to Saint Mark's clinic. Every pot hole a fresh stab. The doctor was Doctor Patel, a calm woman in her.

The investigation moved fast after that. Turns out Harper's uncle had been molesting her for over a year, always when her mom was at her job at the grocery store. He threatened Harper that if she told anyone, her mom would lose the house and they'd be homeless. The worst part? Harper's mom knew something was wrong, but chose to ignore it. She needed her brother's help with rent money after her divorce, and she convinced herself that Harper was just being dramatic when she tried to hint about the games. Harper's uncle was arrested within a week. During his interrogation, he confessed to everything. This bastard had been grooming her since she was 5 years old. Harper's mom lost custody immediately. She actually fought it in court, claiming Harper was lying and that I had coached her somehow. Can you believe that? Choosing her brother and rent money over protecting her own daughter? Harper went to live with her grandparents on her dad's side. I found out later that these grandparents had been trying to get visitation rights for months, but Harper's mom had blocked them completely. They suspected something was wrong, but couldn't prove it. Six months later, Harper came back to my office for a regular cleaning. She was like a completely different kid. Chatty, confident, laughing at my terrible dentist jokes. Grandmother told me Harper was doing great in therapy. And finally, sleeping through the night again. Doctor Anna, remember when you fixed my tooth and I was all silly? Harper asked me while I cleaned her teeth. I sure do, sweetheart. Grandma says you're the reason I'm safe now. Thank you for listening to me. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom for a minute after that. Harper's uncle got 15 years in prison. Her mom never got custody back and isn't allowed unsupervised visits. I still practice dentistry, I also volunteer at the Children's Advocacy Center twice a month. You'd be shocked how often kids accidentally reveal abuse when they feel safe and comfortable.

What happened? I'm a pediatric dentist and kids say the craziest stuff when they're coming out of anesthesia. Most of the time it's hilarious nonsense about unicorns or how their tooth tastes like chicken nuggets. But one Tuesday morning changed everything for me. I had just finished pulling a loose baby tooth for this sweet six year old named Harper. She was still pretty loopy from the numbing medicine, giggling and trying to touch her numb lip with her tongue. Her mom was filling out paperwork in the waiting room while I cleaned up. That's when Harper started babbling about candy. Nothing unusual there. Kids always want to know when they can eat sweets again after dental work. You know what my uncle tells me when he gives me candy? She slurred her words, all wonky from the numbness. I smiled, expecting some silly family joke. No, sweetie, what does he say? He says it's only for special girls like me. She paused, trying to focus her droopy eyes on me. But I can't tell Mommy about our candy game. It's our secret. My hands froze while I was putting away the dental tools. Something in my stomach dropped hard. Harper, where do you and your uncle play this candy game? I asked, trying to keep my voice normal. In the garage when mommy's at work, he says all special girls get candy if they're really good. And don't tell anyone, she giggled again, completely unaware of what she was revealing. I felt sick. 20 years of treating kids and you develop instincts about these things. This wasn't innocent. Does your uncle visit a lot? I asked gently. Harper nodded enthusiastically. He lives with us now, Mommy says. He helps pay for our house so he can stay forever and ever. My heart was pounding. I finished cleaning Harper's mouth and walked her back to her mom in the waiting room. Acting as normal as possible, I gave them the usual aftercare instructions about soft foods and gentle brushing. The moment they left, I locked my office door and called the state child abuse hotline. I never had to make that call before, but I knew I had to. The social worker I spoke with took detailed notes about everything Harper had said. She explained they would need to interview Harper properly with trained specialists who know how to talk to kids about these situations. Within two days, Harper was brought in for a forensic interview at the Children's Advocacy Center. These people are experts.

Look, all I wanted was one peaceful and civil Thanksgiving dinner for the kids, a nice family meal where everyone could just get along for a few hours. That's why I invited my ex husband, even if I can't stand the cheating jerk. On the day of the dinner, I spent hours running around, cleaning, decorating, cooking, setting everything up for the guests. I was still stuffing the Turkey when the doorbell suddenly rang. I wiped off the mess on my apron and walked over to the front door. Yo, my ex husband greeted. You're early, I said. Surprised considering he was always late to our dates before and had been late to the divorce hearing as well. Yeah, well, I brought the family, he said, before stepping aside, bringing me face to face with his new girlfriend, Kelly, and her three kids. I forced a smile and quickly pulled him aside. This isn't okay. You can't just suddenly bring people to my house uninvited to a dinner I've been preparing weeks for, I whispered angrily. He crossed his arms. But if I told you, you would have said no. Come on, it's Thanksgiving. What are you going to do, turn away children, he asked. Clearly expecting this conversation to pop up just as I was about to give my permission. Kelly, his girlfriend, walked in and immediately wrinkled her nose. Oh, you went with that color scheme. Interesting choice. Her kids ran straight past me without even saying hello. Within minutes, they grabbed half the cheese plate I'd spent an hour arranging. Growing boys, Kelly said with a shrug, while they shoved crackers in their mouths. I smiled tightly then turned to my ex. Watch them. They're your responsibility, okay? He rolled his eyes. I sighed and went back to the kitchen doing my best to focus on my to do list. But just as I was about to place the Turkey in the oven, I heard screaming. My daughter ran into the kitchen in a panic. Mama, the couch, the carpet, she gasped, dragging me out to see Kelly's kids jumping and running in the living room with their buddies, shoes on, leaving brown streaks across the cream fabric. Hey, hey, stop that, I shouted. But they ignored me and continued running around. They ran between other guests, spilling juice all over the floor and on other people. Then they started throwing dinner rolls at each other across the living room while the adults were talking. Every time I asked them to stop, Kelly would say they're just being kids and go right back to her phone. My ex said nothing. But then I heard the sound of something shattering in the kitchen. One of the kids and run in stuffed his finger into the food and accidentally knocked down my grandmother's old porcelain serving dish. I grabbed his shoulders and glared, that's bad. Apologize and Clean up, I demanded. The kid just laughed, stuck out his tongue and kicked me in the shin before running off. I turned to Kelly and my.

When I first started, Monday, I drafted a licensing agreement, 12% of gross revenue from my patented products, industry Standard. Wednesday, Cameron burst in waving the agreement. What the hell is this? A licensing agreement for my patents? These are company products. Products I designed and patented under my name. I showed him my contract. No IP clause. Dad's going to hear about this. He already has. This is extortion. This is business. 12% is reasonable. We'll fire you and stop making your products. Those products are 78% of your revenue. But you're the CEO. Your call. Dad showed up two hours later. Why would you do this? We're family. Family that told me I don't have what it takes. Family that gave everything to Cameron. You are an employee. Exactly. Employees with patents license them to negotiation. 10% of gross revenue, five year contract, quarterly payments. First check, $87,500. Six months later, I signed with our biggest competitor, 15% of their revenue from my products, plus 40% higher salary and equity. I resigned. You're giving our competitor access to our products. Cameron's face went white. My products, there's a difference. Within three months, the competitor adapted my designs and took the company's market share. Revenue dropped 15% the first quarter, then 12% more. Cameron hired three replacement engineers in six months. None could replicate my work. You can't copy innovation when you don't understand the principles behind it. A year later, dad called. Can we meet? We met. At a coffee shop, he looked aged 10 years. The business is struggling. Come back, I'll give you whatever you want. You'll give me what I built. How generous. Please don't let everything I built fall apart. Everything you built was falling apart before I showed up. I saved it once, not again. Dad started crying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't see how much you contributed. I appreciate that, but it doesn't change anything. The company filed for bankruptcy 18 months after I left. Bought out for parts. Dad's life's work gone. Cameron's working in sales now. Mom called me selfish. I stopped taking her calls. The thing about being the bigger person is that it only works if the other people involved eventually grow to meet you. My family wasn't growing. They were just expecting me to shrink.

And that's when I knew exactly what I had to do. Axel had been my best friend since 6th grade, which is why I agreed to go camping even though I knew it was a bad idea. Him, Megan, Chris, Ashley heading to the mountains for one last trip before senior year started. They plan to drink all weekend and I plan to keep them safe. That was our dynamic. They did stupid things and I kept them alive. Friday and Saturday were fine. They drank, I didn't. I made sure the campfire stayed controlled. Nobody wandered off drunk. Sunday morning at 8, Axel announced we were leaving. My parents want me home. By noon, he was still drunk from the night before. I could hear it in his voice, see, and how he swayed. We should wait, I said. He just jingled his keys and headed for the car. I tried everything to stop him. I stood in front of the car with my arms out. Please just wait two hours. Sleep it off. Axle, Rev the engine. Move. Jordan, you're going to kill someone. I'm fine. You're drunk. He Rev the engine again. He was serious. He drive through me if I didn't move. I moved, got in the back seat because what else could I do? No cell service, no way to stay alone at the Campsite. I buckled my seatbelt and tried to convince myself it would be okay. It wasn't. Axle drove like we were being chased, 70 in a 30 zone. I gripped the seat in front of me. Axle, please slow down. He didn't even look at me. Megan turned up the radio. Then I saw it. Sharp left curve ahead, nearly 90 degrees. A yellow warning sign, 15 miles per hour suggested we were doing at least six. Axel, I screamed. He looked up, saw the curve, slammed the brakes. Too late. The car went sideways. I remember thinking, this is how I die. We hit something solid, a tree. The impact threw me forward and my head cracked against the window. I saw stars, white and bright against black. Everything went quiet except for the hissing engine. My head was pounding. I touched my temple and my hand came back red, really red. Is everyone okay? My voice sounded far away. Chris and Ashley were checking themselves, shaken but fine. Megan was crying but moving. Axel sat frozen at the wheel. Then reality hit him and he started freaking out. No, no, no. My dad's gonna kill me. I just got this car. I'm supposed to start at state in two weeks. Megan grabbed his arm. We're all in trouble. We were all drinking. Chris looked.

When Emma turned sixteen, she started acting weird around my husband Tyler. Like, really weird. She'd put on makeup before he came home from work. She'd wear her shortest shorts when he was helping with yard work. She'd spray on this vanilla perfume that probably cost more than my monthly grocery budget. Emma would find excuses to be in whatever room Tyler was in. If he was watching TV, suddenly she needed to study on the couch right next to him. If you he was making coffee in the morning, she desperately needed water from the kitchen. If he was fixing something in the garage, she'd appear with tools she didn't know how to use. The worst part was how she'd flirt, giggling at everything he said. Even his dad jokes that made me roll my eyes, touching his arm when she talked about school drama. Asking him to help her with math homework that I knew she could do in her sleep because she'd been on honor roll since middle school. Tyler seemed totally oblivious to her obvious attempts. Just smile and be polite, the way he always was with my family. He'd help with her homework, answer her random questions about his job, and treat her like a little sister she was supposed to be. But I could see Emma getting more bold every single week. She started texting him Directly about school stuff, asking for advice about college applications. Even though she was only a sophomore, she'd offer to wash his truck every weekend. She even asked if he wanted to go jogging with her because she was training for track team tryouts that didn't exist. I wanted to say something, but what do you tell your teenage sister? Stop crushing on my husband. That would just make family dinners awkward for everyone. And we still lived with our parents while saving for our own place. Emma started making these pointed comments about older guys at school, how boys her age were so immature and stupid, how she wanted someone more experienced, more settled, someone with a real job and a car. Age is just a number when you really connect with someone. 1 she said one night at dinner, looking directly at Tyler while cutting her chicken. My mom laughed it off like it was cute teenage talk. Emma's always been mature for her age. She gets that from me. But I knew exactly what she was really saying, and I was getting more uncomfortable every day watching my little sister throw herself at my husband. The breaking point came last month when Emma asked Tyler to take her dress shopping for homecoming. Said I was always too busy with work, and she trusted his opinion on what looked good on her. She specifically wanted to go.

You just don't have what it takes. I agreed completely. What I had instead was the patent rights to everything the business sold. Funny how quickly I developed what it takes. For a decade, I've been the product engineer at my family's manufacturing company. We make industrial equipment, conveyor systems, sorting arms, fabrication tools. Annual revenue, $4.5 million. My dad built this from scratch. Now he's 68 with heart problems. Doctor said step back or risk cardiac arrest. Enter my brother, Cameron, 28, business degree, groomed for leadership since birth. While I designed products in the workshop covered in metal shavings, Cameron attended networking events and took clients to expensive dinners while I pulled all nighters testing prototypes. He practiced his golf swing. Last month, dad called a family meeting. I'm stepping back. Cameron is the new CEO. He looked at me. You're a great engineer, but you don't have what it takes to run a company. You don't have the social skills, the business acumen, the vision. Any objections? None. I said you're absolutely right. That night, I pulled out my patent file, 47 patents all under my name when I started 10 years ago. Dad was too cheap for a patent attorney. Patents are expensive, not worth it for small businesses. So I filed them myself, 75,000 thousand dollars of my own money over a decade. I mentioned it at family dinners. Dad would nod and change the subject. My Employment contract, online template, no intellectual property clause, nothing saying my inventions belong to the company. I pointed this out when signing. Should we add something about IP rights? We're family. Everything you do belongs to the company. That's understood. Understood but not legally binding. I spent the weekend reviewing patent law. When you own a patent, nobody can manufacture it without permission. The company had been manufacturing my patented products for a decade without a licensing agreement. I compiled the data. 78% of the company's revenue came from my designs. The RS seven sorting arm alone, 35% of annual sales. Without my innovations, they'd still be selling generic knockoffs at razor thin margins like dad was do.

So there was this girl in my graphic design class named Tara. We got paired up for this big semester project about a month in, and honestly, I thought I hit the Jackpot. She started calling me D instead of Dev, which felt personal, you know, like we had our own thing going. Every Tuesday and Thursday after class, we'd walk to the train station together. She show me these random memes on her phone that were actually hilarious, not the basic stuff everyone else shared. Once she even told me I had the kind of vibe you write poetry about. I mean, who says that to someone they're not interested in, right? The whole thing felt different than other friendships I'd had with girls. She'd text me at, like, 11 at night with random thoughts about our project or send me screenshots of design tutorials she found. I started looking forward to those messages more than I probably should have. Three weeks into working together, she invited me over to her place to work on our final presentation. I spent way too long getting ready. Stopped at the corner store to grab those fancy chips she mentioned liking, and even printed out extra copies of all our sketches so she wouldn't have to worry about it. Her apartment was exactly what I expected. Plants everywhere, fairy lights strung up around the windows, and this vintage record player. Sitting on a wooden crate, the whole place smelled like lavender and some kind of incense that actually didn't make me want to sneeze. She put on this Phoebe Bridgers album while we worked, and I pretended to know who that was. We spread all our materials out on her bed, since her desk was covered with art supplies. And for a solid two hours, everything felt perfect. She'd laugh at my dumb jokes. Our hands would brush when we reached for the same marker, and she kept saying how glad she was that we got paired together. Around 8, she. She said she was going to grab us some drinks from the kitchen. The second she left the room, her phone lit up on the desk next to me. It was face up, showing her lock screen. And I wasn't trying to be nosy, but it was right there. The background was a photo.

Just that Dylan said something inappropriate about marrying the wrong sister. Is that true? I looked at Dylan. Why don't you ask him, Dylan? Luna's voice was sharp. Now, what did you say? Nothing. It was taken out of context. What context makes that okay? Luna asked. You're married to my sister. You have two kids. What is wrong with you? Everyone always fawns over you, Dylan said. Suddenly, at every family event, every dinner, Luna the model, Luna the influencer, Luna the perfect one. And I'm stuck with, he stopped. Stuck with what I said. Finish the sentence, with someone who'll never measure up, he said quietly. Luna gasped through the phone. You piece of shit. My sister is worth 10 of you. She's brilliant, kind, honey. She's the one who helped you get your job. She's the one who supported you through Your dad's death, she's raising your children practically alone and you're stuck, Luna. Dylan started, no, don't you ever speak to me again. Don't look at me. Don't come to family events. You're disgusting. She paused. Lily, do you need somewhere to stay? I'm packing now. Come here. The kids can have the spare room. Luna, this isn't your problem, Dylan said. It became my problem when you made me part of your sick fantasy. Luna shot back, what else do you do? Stare at my photos, compare us, pretend she's me. Stop, Dylan said, no, I want to know how long have you been pretending my sister is me? Since the wedding, since the honeymoon. Every time you stop, Dylan shouted. I'm hanging up, Luna said, Lily, I'll leave the door unlocked. And Dylan, I'm telling everyone, mom, mom, Dad, cousins, everyone, they should know what kind of man you are. She hung up. Dylan stared at me. This is your fault. My fault. You had to make a big deal about it. Now she hates me. Your whole family will hate me. You did this. You admitted you married me to get close to my sister. I never said that exactly. You said I was a consolation prize. You said you're stuck with me. You said I'll never measure up because it's true. He exploded. You're ordinary. You're boring. You're not special. Luna lights up every room. You just exist in them. I stopped packing, looked at him. Really looked at him for the first time in years. Thinning hair, soft middle, angry little eyes. Do you want to know the truth? Full story on channel link below.

It wouldn't turn. The door swung open. Mom stood there, face triumphant. Oh, good. You're here to collect your things. This is my house now. Dad's finally gone and I'm the rightful heir. We're moving in tonight. You couldn't even wait until after the funeral. Better take your stuff quickly or it's going in the dumpster. I need space for Emma's things. She's getting your old room. A week later, a law firm called. We need you for the reading of your grandfather's will. Mom was already there with Robert and Emma. Her eyes narrowed when she saw me. What are you doing here? The lawyer began reading to my beloved granddaughter, Carla Johnson, I leave my house at 15, 42 Oak street and my entire savings account containing $775,000. Silence. What? This can't be right. Mom snatched the will. Where's my part? I'm his daughter. Your father's wishes are quite clear, the lawyer said. Everything goes to Miss Johnson. There is no provision for you. I'll contest this. She manipulated him. The will is iron clad. Any attempt to contest would be futile and expensive. Mom's rage transformed into tears. Carla, sweetie, please, we've already given up our apartment. We have nowhere to go. We're family. I stood up holding the ownership documents. Emily, like how you threw my belongings on the lawn before Grandpa was even in his grave. Like how you tried to steal my college fund. That was different. This is your Problem, not mine. Start looking for a new apartment. I drove straight to the house and called a locksmith while he changed every lock. I packed all their belongings into garbage bags and dragged them onto the front porch. As the sunset, mom's car pulled in. What is this? Her shriek echoed. Our things are outside. I stood in the doorway. How dare you? We live here now. This is my house. Legally, you need to leave. We have nowhere to go, Emma wailed. Should have thought about that before giving up your apartment. I pulled out my phone. Leave now or I'm calling the police. As they loaded the last bag, mom turned to me. You're no daughter of mine. Your father would be ashamed. I smiled sadly. No, mom. Dad would be proud. I finally stood up for myself. That was 6 months ago. I'm graduating with honors next month. The house is rented to a lovely family. Mom's tried contacting me a few times. Usually when she needs something, I don't respond.

I've heard it all before. I put the Gatorade in my fridge, ate the soup myself. But Friday broke me. Spencer text at eleven forty seven PM bro, emergency, can you cover my shift tomorrow morning 6:00am at the restaurant? I'll owe you big time. Please, man, I'm desperate. I had plans driving three hours to see my grandma, first time in three months. But Spencer's message said emergency in all caps. So I cancelled, called my grandma, told her something urgent, came up at work, worked his entire 8 hour shift on 4 hours of sleep. Breakfast rush on Saturday is brutal. Got yelled at by customers, spilled coffee on my shirt, made 67 Bubba dollars in tips. He never showed up to thank me, never texted, never acknowledged it happened. Saturday night around nine PM exhausted and lying in bed, I open Instagram. Spent answer story. He's at a concert the weekend. The same concert he told me he couldn't afford when I asked him to go two weeks ago. Tickets were $150. He said he was broke. But there he is, front row section with the same group from Dave and Buster's. That's when something inside me snapped. I opened my phone and really looked at my contacts, 327 people started scrolling through messages. Every single conversation was me reaching out first, me asking how they were, me making plans, me being there. Found the group chat for my birthday last month, 47 people. I'd asked if anyone wanted to grab dinner. Two people responded. One sent a thumbs up emoji, the other said maybe and ghosted. Nobody came. I ate pizza alone in my apartment and told myself it was fine. These people don't care about me. They care about what I can do for them. I'm the guy who covers shifts, who helps people move, who loans $40 and never asks for it back. The backup friend they remember when they need something. So yesterday at 2:00am, I deleted every group chat, all 8 of them, removed two 284 people from my contacts, kept only family and three people who've actually shown up for me. My phone's been silent for 26 hours. No texts, no calls, no hey, man, where'd you go? And honestly, it feels exactly the same as when I had 300 friends.

I've had a ton of friends my whole life, 300+ contacts, eight different group chats, always someone to text. Growing up, I was never the kid sitting alone at lunch. I was the guy people invited to everything, birthday parties, game nights, random mall hangouts. I thought that meant something real. But here's what nobody talks about. I could disappear for months and not a single person would check on me. I know this because I tested it last summer. Stopped initiating conversations completely. Just stopped. Didn't text first, didn't make plans, didn't comment on anyone's posts. Wanna know how long it took for someone to reach out? 47 days. And it wasn't even to see how I was doing. It was my friend Alex asking if he could borrow my PlayStation. Not, hey, man, haven't heard from you. You good? Just, yo, can I grab your PS five this weekend? I gave it to him because that's what I do. But last Tuesday made everything crystal here. My best friend Spencer, the guy I've known since sixth grade, the one I helped to move apartments twice, the one who slept on my couch for two weeks when his parents kicked him out, texted me Tuesday afternoon, Yo, bro, can't hang today. Super sick. My parents won't let me leave the house. Rain check. I responded immediately. No worries, man. Feel better soon. Seriously, let Me know if you need anything. I genuinely felt bad for him. Even went to target and bought Gatorade and soup planning to leave it on his porch. Two hours later, I'm sitting in my room scrolling Instagram because I had nothing else to do. That's when I see it. Spencer's story posted 47 minutes ago. He's a Dave and Buster's not just with one or two people. There's like 12 people crammed into the frame, people I've never even met. They're all laughing, playing arcade games, taking shots at a booth. He's in the center with his arm around some girl looking like he's having the absolute time of his life. The same time he told me he was too sick to leave his house. I just stared at my phone for like 10 minutes. My stomach dropped. Not because he went out but because he lied directly to my face. And the worst part, I wasn't even surprised. I didn't confront him. What was the point? He just make up some excuse about how his parents.

We're waiting for Miss Reeves. I sat down. My leg wouldn't stop bouncing. Jimmy wouldn't look at me. A few minutes later, the door opened. Zoe walked in. She saw me and her eyes went sad. Immediately, Jimmy stood up. Zoe, look, I'm really sorry about whatever Connor did. I swear I had no idea. Stop lying. Her voice was hard. I'm not lying. Yes, you are. She pulled out her phone. Then he looked at me. I'm sorry you have to find out like this. Find out what? But Zoe didn't answer, just hit play on a video. The screen showed the party last night. Connor moving through the crowd with a drink in his hand. He stopped next to a girl, waited until she the way, then poured something into her cup. My stomach dropped. The camera panned. Jimmy was standing right there watching, laughing. Oh, my god. The video kept playing. Connor walked up to me in the video, handed me a drink I took. Twenty minutes later, I was stumbling, barely able to stand. Zoe was next to me helping me sit down on a couch. I didn't remember any of this. Then the camera turned, Connor was at it again, spiking another drink. Zoe approached them on the video. What are you doing? Connor looked nervous. He stepped forward smiling. Relax. We're just having fun. You're drugging people. You drugged my boyfriend. I'm calling the police. Jimmy smile disappeared. No, you're Not. And if you try, I'll say you're lying. Who do you think they'll believe? On the video, I suddenly stood up behind Zoe, barely able to stay upright. My voice was slurred. Don't, don't talk to her like that. I tried to push Jimmy, but I was so uncoordinated I nearly fell over. Jimmy shoved me hard. I went down. That's when Zoe punched him in the face. She had her ring on. The video ended. I was staring at the screen. My hands were shaking. I don't remember any of that. The officer looked at Jimmy. So you drugged multiple students, including this young man. Then you threatened Missy Reeves when she tried to stop you. Then you assaulted him while he was incapacitated. Jimmy was stammering, I was drunk. I didn't mean to. You were sober enough to threaten her, assault him and come to school today to press charges against her. Mister Reeves stood up, his voice shaking. You drugged students and you tried to get my daughter arrested for stopping you. The police arrested Jimmy right there, handcuffs, same as Connor. The officer told me I should get checked out at the hospital, said some of the d R. A. G. S they used can have lasting effects. Three other girls from the party came forward after said they felt drugged, too. Two of them had been hospitalized. Jimmy became the meme of the school, got his ah whooped by a girl a foot shorter. Than him.

My teacher, Mister Reeves, looked right at him. That's impossible to get a concussion. You need a brain. The whole class erupted in laughter, but Jimmy wasn't laughing. His face was serious. His black eye basically speaking for, I'm pressing assault charges. Zoe punched my face at the party last night. The laughter died immediately. I felt my stomach drop especially hard. You see, Zoe was my girlfriend. I'd gone with her to the party last night, but I think I drank too much and didn't remember a thing from it. What's crazy is Zoe wasn't at school today, wouldn't answer any of my texts or calls either. Jimmy walked over to hit desk and sat down, touching his eye gently like he wanted everyone to see it. 20 minutes into class, the door opened. The principal walked in with two police officers. Everyone went silent. We expected them to go to Jimmy, but instead they walked straight to Connor, Jimmy's best friend, Connor Danes. You need to come with us. Connor's face went white. What? Why now, please. One of the officers pulled out handcuffs. Connor stood up slowly. I didn't do anything. They cuffed him right there in front of everyone and walk him down the hallway. The second the door closed, everyone's phones came out, texts flying. Connor just got arrested. What did he do? Probably Something from the party last night. Whispers starting, rumors spreading fast. Someone said assault. Someone else said drugs. But Jimmy just sat at his desk staring straight ahead, the class clown saying nothing. After class, a group of students surrounded him in the hallway. Dude, what? What happened to Connor? Jimmy shook his head. I don't know what he did, but whatever it was, I want nothing to do with it. I was standing there listening, trying to make sense of it. I texted Zoe, Connor just got arrested. But Jimmy is acting like he doesn't know anything. What the hell happened last night? Still no response. 10 minutes later, the intercom crackled. My name, please report to the principal's office immediately. Everyone looked at me. Mister Reeves looked at me confused. I was confused, too. Why was I being summoned? I grabbed my bag and headed toward the door. Mister Reeves followed me. Why are they calling you? I don't know. Were you at the party? Yeah, but I don't remember anything after like ten PM I don't know why they want me. Mister Reeves looked worried. Now we walked to the office together. I pushed open the door to the principal's office. Jimmy was already sitting there. So was the principal and a police officer with a notepad. I looked around. Why am I here? The officer didn't answer. Just said, you'll under.

He said it at his company Christmas party. Drunk on whiskey and years of pretending, we were standing by the bar when his colleague Brett mentioned how lucky he was to have such a beautiful wife. Yeah, well, you should see her sister, my husband Dylan said, swaying. Now that's the real prize. This one's just the consolation. Brett laughed nervously. I stood there holding my cocktail, feeling my whole world tilt. What did you just say, I asked. Dylan turned to me like he'd forgotten I was there. Nothing, baby. Just guy talk. But Brett was already backing away, mumbling about finding his wife. You said I'm a consolation prize. You're being sensitive. You said you wished you'd married Luna. He shrugged, actually shrugged. Can't marry your wife's sister. That's not how it works. So you married me instead. Someone had to marry you first. He said it like it was obvious, like it was a plan. Eight years. Eight years of marriage. And he was telling me I was the pathway to my younger sister. We need to leave, I said. Party's just getting started. We're leaving now. In the car, he tried to backtrack. I didn't mean it. How it sounded. How did you mean it? Luna is gorgeous. Everyone knows it. You know it. But I chose you because you couldn't choose her. That's not, look, when I met you both that summer. At your parents place. Luna was 18. You were 23. It made more sense. What made more sense? He sighed like I was being difficult dating you. She was too young. Your parents would have freaked out. But you were perfect. Same family, same genetics. Just more appropriate. Same genetics. Like I was a placeholder with the right DNA. Did you ever love me? I asked. Of course I love you. You're my wife. That's not an answer. What do you want me to say? That I never noticed how beautiful your sister is? I never wondered. What if everyone wonders not about their wife's sister? Not for eight years. We drove in silence until we got home. I went straight to our bedroom, started pulling out suitcases. What are you doing? He asked from the doorway. What does it look like? You're overreacting. So I find your sister attractive. So what? I married you. I had kids with you. He grabbed my arm. Stop being dramatic. You can't leave over this. Watch me.

Aurora looked mortified, her eyes darting to me for help. The room was dead silent with shock. I finally snapped out of my shock and grabbed his arm, pulling him toward the hallway. What are you doing? I hissed, trying to keep my voice down. He barely looked at me, his eyes still locked on Aurora through the doorway. Is that your friend over there? He asked, practically salivating with desire. I've always wanted to do it with an R word and she's so cute. For one, my crush, this man I've been falling for, just called my beautiful friend a slur and admitted he wanted to use her for his sick fetish. I was disgusted. The girl's girl in me went from zero to nuclear in about half a second. While he was still staring at Aurora like she was prey, I whipped out my iPhone and texted Isabella, your brother is sexually harassing my disabled friend. Get here now. Then I immediately added, bring your mom. Isabella's response was instant. What? Mom's already getting ready to leave. She said she's disappointed in her son. He had no idea what was coming. I shot a quick text to our roommate group chat. Keep this creep busy and away from Aurora. War is on the way. Trust me. And the beautiful thing about having girls who get it, no questions asked. My friend Cindy immediately stood up and positioned herself between Nathaniel and Aurora. Kathy started loudly asking him about his major. Jess accidentally spilled her drink near him so he'd have to move back. He kept trying to get back to Aurora, getting more frustrated each time someone intercepted him. I, I just want to talk to her, he whined, not understanding why we'd formed a human shield. Aurora had wielded herself behind the couch at this point, and I could see her hands shaking with anger. I kept thinking about how much shit he was about to be in, and I couldn't stop smiling with excitement. Boom. The door practically exploded open. Nathaniel's mom, Mrs. Beaumont, burst in like a warrior, except fully dressed in Lululemon. And Isabella was right behind her with her phone out recording. The look on Nathaniel's face when he saw his mom was pure panic. Nathaniel James Beaumont, his mom shouted at the top of her lungs. She stormed over and grabbed his ear like he was a child caught stealing cookies. What did you just say to this young woman? Mom, I can explain. It's not what it looks like. He stammered with embarrassment, but she twisted his ear harder. Isabella told me everything. You're disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. She turned to Aurora, her voice softening instantly. Sweetheart, I am so sorry. This is not how I raised him. Isabella started laughing at him and we all joined in, with Aurora laughing the loudest. It's been 10 years since then and Nathan's still single. He'll probably die alone.

I couldn't be happier. I leave for work at 5:00am while she's still asleep. By 6:30 I'm at my desk with headphones on, starting my day with music. The office is empty, the coffee is brewing, and I've got my playlist going. Then at 7:00am, like clockwork, my music stops. Notification pops up playing on living room speaker. She's awake. Most people would be annoyed. We share my premium account because she refuses to pay for her own. Says it's a waste of $11 a month when mine works fine, but I just smile and open Spotify to see what she's playing. It started as curiosity. What does she listen to when I'm not around? Monday was lover by Taylor Swift. Tuesday was at last by Ella James. Wednesday she played Better Together by Jack Johnson three times in a row. This morning Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls. I keep a mental list. Sometimes I write them down in my notes app during my lunch break. At first I thought it was random, just her shuffling through her likes, but then I started noticing a pattern about three weeks ago. Every single song has one thing in common. They're all about commitment, forever staying together, finding the one. No breakup songs, no angry anthems. Not a single I'm independent and don't need anyone track. Just love the real deep, forever kind. See, I've been planning to propose for two months. Now I have the ring, a vintage sapphire her grandmother wore, which her mom gave me after I asked for her blessing. I have the date next Saturday at the park where we first met four years ago. I even have the photographer hiding in the bushes at six PM. Everything's planned. Everything's perfect. But here's what she doesn't know. Last Tuesday, I came home early from work. She was in the shower, and her phone was on the counter, unlocked. Spotify was open. I wasn't trying to snoop, but I saw it. A playlist titled if he asks. It was set to private. I wasn't supposed to see it. My hand shook as I clicked it. Inside, 47 songs. All the ones she's been playing every morning for the past month. Every single one I've been tracking in my notes app. Marry me by Train, Amazed by Lone Star, all of me by John Legend, thinking out loud by Ed Sheeran. And at the bottom of the playlist description, a note to herself. Songs.

It's adorable, right? Adorable. It says Baby Agatha in bold letters like it's already decided. I didn't even get a vote. Well, yeah, it's tradition. Every first born girl in my family is named Agatha. You know this. And you know that tradition ends here. I'm not naming our baby after a Dickens character. Dickens character. That's so unfair. Agatha is timeless, classic, strong, timeless. It's 2024, Luke, not 1824. She's not a Victorian ghost haunting a candle lit mansion. You're being ridiculous. My mom and grandma are so excited. You're going to break their hearts. Oh, and my heart doesn't matter. I'm the one carrying her for nine months. I've earned veto power. Veto power. This is a team decision. And the team says Agatha, case closed. Oh, now it's a team decision when you've already handed out Agatha onesies like their political flyers. Look, it's just a name. You're turning this into a whole thing for no reason. It's not just a name. It. It's her identity. You want her to start life as a hand me down. She deserves something unique. Unique like what? Luna or Rainbow? We're not naming her after a unicorn. I suggested Ayala. Ayala. That's normal. But no, your family called it disrespectful to their legacy because it is. Agatha goes back four generations. That's history. You can't just erase that history. You don't even use your family name. You go by your middle Name because you hate being called Horace. That's different. Horace is, well, Horace. Agatha is beautiful. My mom will lose it if we don't use Agatha. She's already knitting matching hats for the Agatha Legacy. Great. She can keep them for her Victorian cosplay group. I'll send them some tea biscuits. This isn't funny. Can't you just compromise? Let's do Agatha as her first name and something modern as the middle name. Compromise? Sure. Aila as her first name, Agatha as the middle. They're solved. That's not compromise. That's just you winning and naming her Agatha. Isn't you winning? What's next? You naming our future dog Horace junior? You're impossible. Fine. Let's talk about this more later, but no Moonbeam. Okay? Ever deal? But only if you admit that Horus and Agatha sound like a haunted couple in a Scooby Doo episode. Fine, but you're still not off the hook. Bring it on, Horus.

We dated for seven years, met in junior year of high school through his best friend. He was 280 pounds, 5 7 with acne and a dorky smile that made my heart melt. Everyone told me I could do better. My friends literally staged an intervention. But here's what they didn't see. He wrote me handwritten letters every anniversary, six pages front and back. He noticed when I changed my lipstick, remembered my coffee order from three months ago, made me feel like the only person who mattered in the entire world. He got bullied constantly. I found him crying in his car twice. Kids called him the blob in the hallways. He told me once that I was the only good thing in his life. I told him I loved every part of him and wouldn't change a single thing. He sobbed for an hour that day. Three years ago, we made a New Year's resolution together, gym membership, meal at, the whole thing. We cleared out our pantries on January 2nd, threw away $200 worth of junk food, bought a 500 dollar blender. We were doing this together, getting healthy as a team. The first six months, we went to the gym at 6:00am every morning. We were each other's accountability partners. When one of us wanted to quit, the other pushed us forward. We took progress photos every two weeks. I was so proud of us. Then he started seeing results. Real results. By month eight, he dropped 60 pounds. By month 12, 95 pounds. By 18 months, he'd lost 130 pounds total. He had ABS, actual visible ABS, pecs, arms that look like they belonged on a fitness model. I couldn't have been prouder. I bragged about him to everyone. My boyfriend did this. My boyfriend transformed his entire life. That's when everything changed here. 2, he started going to the gym twice a day, morning and night. We stopped eating dinner together because he meal prepped separately. Now your portions are too big, he'd say. Watching me eat pasta. You should track your macros. He'd grab my arm and squeeze it. See, too soft. You need to lift more. Then came the Instagram posts, shirtless gym selfies. Every three days the comments rolled in. You're so hot now. Damn, daddy, let me touch those ABS. You single. He showed me every single one, laughed about them, read them out loud like trophies, like he wanted me to see how desired he was now. Then he started replying. I watched him type out, come feel them anytime to some girl named Britney. When I said it was disrespectful, he told me I was being insecure and controlling, said it was just gym culture and I wouldn't understand because I wasn't.

We stopped going on dates. He said he didn't want to eat out because it would mess up his cut. When I suggested a movie, he said he needed his eight hours of sleep or muscle recovery. Every conversation became about his workout plan, his protein intake, his body fat percentage. I tried talking about my promotion at work. He'd look at his phone. I'd ask about his day. He'd tell me about his PR on deadlifts. For 20 minutes straight last month. I asked if he still loved me. He said, of course without looking up from his phone. Didn't even make eye contact. Two weeks ago, I found out why. His phone died during dinner, and he asked to use mine to text his trainer. I unlocked it and handed it over. He texted, gave it back. That's when I saw the message. Thread still open? Honestly, bro, I think I'm outgrowing her. She's dragging me down. Embarrassed to bring her to gym events. Everyone there is it and she just isn't. Might need to upgrade soon. You know any single girls from your five PM class? I'm 5 5, 125 pounds. I defended him when he was literally double my size and people called him disgusting to his face. I sat on that for three days. Couldn't eat, sleep. Reread his old letters. The ones where he called me his angel, where he said my love saved his life, where he promised he'd love Me forever. Exactly as I was yesterday. I told him I was leaving. He actually laughed like it was funny. Said good luck finding someone better. You're average at best. Maybe lose 15 pounds first. I grabbed all seven of his anniversary letters from my drawer, sat down across from him at the kitchen table and read them out loud. Every single word. All six pages of the first one. You see me when no one else does. You loved me when I hated myself. You defended me when the world was cruel. I promise I'll spend my entire life making you feel as beautiful as you make me feel. I'd be nothing without you. His face crumbled halfway through letter three. Started crying. Said he didn't mean any of it. That he was just trying to get in at the gym. That he got caught up in the attention. That he still loved me. That we could fix this. I stacked all seven letters neatly, slid them across the table. The man who wrote these died the day he got ABS. I don't know who you are anymore. I walked out. My lease ends in six weeks. I'm not looking back. I thought I was going to marry him. Instead, I watched him become everything he used to hate. The bullies won after all.

I was a senior in high school. Average grades, clean record, nothing special. But for some reason, Mrs. Frank, my algebra teacher, hated me. She'd been at the school for over a decade. Administrators loved her, but in class, she was brutal. Every time I asked a question, which I did a lot because math was hard for me, she'd humiliate me in front of everyone. Here comes the slow boy again. Wow. Surprise, surprise. You don't get it. I've been teaching 10 years, and that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. I tried reporting her. They'd send someone to watch her class. And like magic, she was sweet and professional. Then back to being cruel the next day. So I came up with a plan. I went to Radio Shack, bought a pocket recorder, and started collecting everything. Every insult, every jab. Sometimes I'd even bait her just to catch more. By the end of the year, I had gold. I asked one last question in class, and she responded, that is the single dumbest question I've ever heard. That was it. I packed my bag and walked out straight to the nurse's office to sign myself out for the day. I was 18. I didn't need permission. That night, I compiled every recording into one glorious, damming audio file. Next morning, I met with the principal. He listened to a few minutes, paused, and said, we need more people. Here, the next day, I walked into a conference room with the principal, vice principal, school officer, district board members, and missus Frank. I hit play. I watched their faces morph from bored to shocked to horrified. Some of their jaws literally dropped. Missus Frank sat in silence, roasting herself for 10 straight minutes. The air was electric. When it ended, the principal looked around and simply said, I think we've heard everything we need to thank you. I left the room. The last time I saw Missus Frank, she was crying, and we locked eyes. I gave her the coldest, most satisfying smile of my life. Next week, she was gone. Words spread fast. I was suddenly a legend. The kid who took down the untouchable teacher. She didn't just lose her job, she lost her reputation, her connections, everything. And I didn't even raise my voice. Just hit record.

She's more of a mom than anyone. I buttered my roll and stayed silent. The honey glazed ham sat between us, still steaming. Mom had used her good China, the kind she only brings out twice a year. Chloe was sitting across from me next to Marcus and Diana, wearing this designer blazer I've never seen before. My sister Lauren kicked me hard under the table. Mom's fork rose halfway to her mouth, but I just took another bite of my roll and asked some want to pass the green beans? Chloe kept going, her voice getting louder. Diana's helping me start my own marketing agency. She's investing $50,000 and connecting me with her entire network. She actually believes in me, unlike some people. That last part was aimed at me. Six months ago, I told Chloe she should get more experience before starting a business. I'd offered to help her build a portfolio, make connections the right way. She called me unsupportive. Marcus shifted in his seat, suddenly very interested in his mashed potato. Diana smiled like she just closed a major deal, her hand possessively on Chloe's shoulder. Vivian Mom said quietly, aren't you going to say anything? I looked at Chloe directly for the first time all evening. Congratulations on your business venture. Lauren made a choking sound. Mom reached under the table to with my knee, but I pulled away. The rest of Dinner was torture. Chloe kept shooting me these looks, clearly frustrated I wasn't reacting. Diana talked endlessly about their plans, how she was mentoring Chloe, how blood doesn't make you family, loyalty does. When dessert came out, I excused myself early. Chloe didn't even look up when I left. Two weeks later, my phone rang at eleven PM it was Chloe and she was crying, mom, I need help. Diana wants the money back, all of it. I sat up in bed. What money? The $50,000. She says I breached our partnership agreement by missing a mandatory meeting, but I don't have it, mom, I already spent it on inventory, web Fight Development, LLC registration, everything. She knew that she approved every expense. What meeting? The one she scheduled for tomorrow morning. She texted me about it this morning at 3:00am, said it was in the original contract, but if I don't have fifty thousand dollars in her account by Friday, she's suing me for breach of contract. Less damages. She's saying 75 thousand dollar total. My blood went cold, but I kept my voice steady. Have you looked at the contract? There's all this legal language I don't understand.

Even the substitute teachers figured it out. But Mrs. Hildenbrand just kept going. Here's the thing about Mrs. Hildenbrand. We had this really weird, long German last name that all the kids had been making fun of since forever. In middle school, everyone called her missus icky booger. Because if you say Hildebrand really fast and sloppy, that's kind of what it sounds like. I'd heard my older brother and his friends call her that years ago. Apparently, she taught at the middle school before moving to the high school. December rolls around, it. It's been four months of this every single day. The entire class knows she's doing it wrong at this point because I've corrected her in front of everyone at least 20 times.

I had chronic neck pain from constantly tensing up around her. I'd stopped going to family events and Tom was getting angry about me isolating myself from his family. I was taking prescription pain killers for the headaches and spending hundreds on chiropractor visits. Denise had literally given me a neurological condition from repeated head trauma. But everyone still acted like I was overreacting to playful affection. The explosion happened at Tom's parents 30th anniversary party. It was a huge event with probably 70 people, including extended family and their friends. I taken preventive pain medication and was trying to stay in crowded areas where Denise couldn't easily reach me. But she was determined to get her hit in. She followed me to the bathroom and waited outside. When I came out, she smacked me so hard I saw stars and stumbled forward into the wall. I heard something pop in my neck and pain shot down my entire left side. That's when Tom's cousin Bradley turned the corner and saw me on the ground holding my neck with Denise standing over me laughing. Bradley helped me up and asked what happened. Denise said, oh, Lucy's being her usual dramatic self, pretending I heard her with a love tap. Bradley looked at her strange and said, I just watched you hit her full force in the head. That wasn't a love tap. That was battery. Denise tried to laugh it Off. But Bradley wasn't having it. He said, actually, I've been watching you do this all night. You've hit her four times already and it's only been an hour. That's not affection. That's abuse. Denise said Bradley was overreacting, too. But then Bradley said something that changed everything. You know what's interesting, Denise, you only hit Lucy. I've been paying attention for the last year and you don't playfully smack anyone else. Not Tom, not your parents, not your kids, not your friends, just Lucy. That's not a quirky personality trait. That's targeted harassment. People started gathering around because Bradley's voice was getting louder. Tom came over asking what was wrong. And Bradley said, your sister has been physically assaulting your wife for years and you've all been laughing about it. I just witnessed her hit Lucy hard enough to injure her neck and she's standing here smiling about it. Mom tried to defend Denise saying it was just how she showed affection. But Bradley pulled out his phone. Actually, I've been recording her doing it all night for evidence. Wanna see the compilation, full story on channel link below.

Then they handed me a folded letter with my name on it. Inside was a legal document titled notice of disownment with their signatures already dry at the bottom. When I asked what this, my mother simply said, you know why? And turned back to taking photos of my brother in his new car. That was last year. This morning, they showed up unannounced at my apartment, faces pale after hearing what I had done. My mother perched on my second hand sofa like she was afraid to leave an impression. My father remained standing, the vintage Rolex absent from his wrist. The trust fund, he said flatly, your grandfather's trust fund. You found a way to access it. Poured myself water, taking a slow sip. I didn't find a way. I always had a way. Grandpa made sure of that. Grandpa Elliott knew exactly what kind of people my parents were long before I did. While they showcased Brian's barely passing grades with expensive gifts, Grandpa quietly attended my science fairs. When I won the state mathematics championship, my parents were at Brian's baseball tournament. Grandpa was the only one who stood and applauded. He'd been the only one at my medical school acceptance dinner who seemed genuinely proud when he died during my second Year, they called it sudden. At the will reading, my parents sat smug, already planning how they would spend their inheritance. What they didn't expect was the trust fund, seven figures grown from decades of investment named solely to me. My mother had been livid. Brian has plans, too, she'd insisted. We'll contest it. Elliot was of sound mind, the attorney replied. He updated this trust three months ago with specific instructions. What nobody knew was that Grandpa had created a second trust, controlling 51% of the family business my father supposedly owned. Silent majority ownership activated only if two conditions were met. I completed medical school and my father turned his back on his children for money. The disownment papers signed weeks before Christmas qualified perfectly. Over the next year, I discovered everything. My father.

So I started acting extremely cold with her. She completely lost it. We've been married 12 years when she sat me down after our third therapy session and said the words that killed me. I only see you as my best friend now. I'm not attracted to you anymore. For three years, she'd been refusing intimacy. I thought it was stress from raising our two kids. Turns out she just been tolerating me this whole time. She even said she built up resentment toward me because I spent too much time with the kids instead of her. The therapist kept asking her why, what changed? When did the attraction die? Every answer was, I don't know. She couldn't give me a single reason. Then one night everything got worse. Came home drunk around midnight and basically crawled into bed begging me. I said no at first, but she kept pushing and crying until I gave in. Biggest mistake of my life. Next morning she woke up and wouldn't even look at me. I feel disgusted with myself, she said. Her voice cold. I have a rule about never sleeping with friends. That's what you are to me now, a friend. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. I asked her what I could possibly do to fix this. What was so unattractive about me? Her answer, I don't know. You're just not what I Want anymore but you're a great co parent and provider. She wanted to keep our roommate dynamic as she called it. Basically, I handle half the parenting, pay most of the bills and she gets to live her life without any of the marriage part. That's when something inside me just switched off. I told her, fine, we're roommates now. Starting immediately, I started implementing what they call the 180, complete eat emotional detachment. I stopped doing any of the little things I used to do for her. No more morning coffee made her way. No more helping with her work projects. No more picking up her dry cleaning. No more being her emotional support. She asked me to help her move some furniture in her home office. I said no. She looked absolutely shocked. Are you serious right now? Why are you being so petulant? You're in charge of your own life now. I said calmly, just like.

Then I found her on the floor. I was upstairs playing video games when I heard my mom yell from the kitchen, Pizza's here. I paused my game and ran downstairs because I was starving. But when I got to the kitchen, my mom was laying on the floor unconscious. Blood was coming from a gash on her forehead. Stand standing behind her was my dad holding a crowbar. Dad, I hadn't seen him in three years, not since the divorce when mom got full custody and a restraining order. He looked different now, skinnier and his eyes were bloodshot like he hadn't slept in days. Sit down and listen to my instructions, he said. I sat at the kitchen table with my hands shaking. My phone was upstairs. Mom wasn't moving, but I could see her chest rising and falling. So she was still breathing. What do you know about your older sister? Dad asked. Mom told me that when Meadow went to college, she got with the wrong people and cut off the family. Dad laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. Jesus, that's the lie she told you. What else she Said? Meadow stole all the money from my college fund before she left. That's why we had to move to this smaller house. What if I told you your sister's actually in a coma right now? What? Dad sat across from me but kept a crowbar in his hand. Meadow got Pregnant in college when she came home to tell us your mother beat her so bad she was hardly breathing. That's not true. Mom would never do that. Your mother moved Meadow to Iowa to work on her parents farm. Hold, everyone. Meadow ran away. But she's been keeping her there for two years, beating her every time she tried to leave or contact anyone. You're lying. I've been searching for Meadow for three years thinking she was missing. Your mother told me the same story about drugs and bad people. But last week her father called me. He couldn't watch it anymore. Told me everything. I looked at my mom on the floor. She was so small and normal looking. She made me sandwiches and helped with homework. She couldn't be capable of what dad was saying. Meadow's been in a coma for three weeks. Your mom pushed her down the stairs at the farm. Told the hospital Meadow was mentally ill and fell. Dad.

She admitted Tyler had been checking in on her every day since the sickness incident, sending her articles about toxic relationships. He'd even made her write down a list of my controlling behaviors. This dupe I made her controlling, the birthday gift I'd saved up for manipulation. She fell for all of it. I'm so sorry, she sobbed. I want you back. I'll do anything. My blood boiled. While I'd been destroying myself with guilt, Tyler had been executing a calculated takedown, and she'd been his willing puppet. Then she said the part that made me see red. I'll keep our relationship secret from Tyler this time. He won't be a problem. She still didn't get it. I told her I'd take her back on one condition. We had to text Tyler right now, tell him off for controlling her life, and tell him she was getting back with me anyway. She argued. She called it extreme, but eventually she did it. Sent me the screenshot. The second I saw it, I hung up and blocked her. Two days later, Tyler called from a random number, started screaming at me, calling me a liar, saying Macy was too good for me. Then he called me a bitch. I snapped. You're nothing but a backup boyfriend who will spend his whole Life driving other guys away. And guess what? When it mattered, Macy chose me over you. He burst into tears, hung up. Last week, my friend threw a party. Macy showed up with Tyler, both ready for a fight. She walked up while I was talking to another girl and accused me of cheating, calling me a phony in front of everyone. Tyler stood behind her, smirking. Actually, I said you should consider yourself lucky I gave you a chance at all. You're a spineless puppet. And Tyler's so insecure, he had to use a burner phone just to talk to me. You two are perfect for each other. I hope you end up together, because no one else should have to deal with people like you. Tyler started screaming. Macy dragged him out. The party erupted in cheers. Update three months later, I just found out Tyler and Macy are officially dating. Guess I was right about them being perfect for each other. I'm engaged now. To someone who doesn't have a psycho best friend controlling her life. We're getting married next summer.

What did you learn? My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place, setting in panic. Her dad, Mr. Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked during that first dinner. When I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again, and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr. Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner, and fixed his own car if they didn't like it, tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious, and clearly tired of his family's expectations. While everyone else was Networking and name dropping. Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr. Richardson called me. Not Sarah. Me directly. I need to speak with you, he said in that cold voice I'd grown to hate.

I worked at the same insurance office for almost 10 years. Every single morning I'd stop at Jerry's Coffee on Fifth Street, order my usual black coffee and add what I thought was cream from the self serve station. My co workers always made fun of how strong and bitter my coffee was. They take one sip and make faces like I was drinking motor oil. How do you drink that garbage? My best mate Ashley would say watching me gulp down my morning cup. I just laugh and tell her I liked my coffee with character, strong and bold, just like me. The whole office knew about my weird coffee preference. Even during meetings, people would joke about how I could probably strip paint with whatever I was drinking. For almost a decade, this was my routine. Same coffee shop, same order, same weird looks from everyone who tried it. I thought I just had different taste buds or something. Maybe I was just tougher than everyone else when it came to bitter drinks. And one Tuesday morning, Jerry's Coffee was closed for kitchen repairs. A handwritten sign on the door said they'd be back in a week. I panicked a little because I'm not great with change. But I spotted another coffee place just two blocks down called bean. There I walked in and ordered my usual black coffee. Please, the young Barista with purple hair smiled and handed me the cup. Then I asked for cream on the side, just like I always did at Jerry's. She pointed to a small metal pitcher next to the sugar packets. I poured in my usual amount and took that first sip. My mouth almost dropped open. The coffee was smooth, creamy, actually enjoyable to drink. Instead of feeling like punishment, I thought maybe this place just had really good coffee beans or something. When Jerry's reopened the next week, I went back to my normal routine. But something was bugging me. Now, why did that other place taste so different? Was their coffee really that much better? I decided to pay closer attention to what I was doing. I walked up to the self serve.

It's okay, sweetie, almost there. But she wasn't doing any of the natural things a parent does. No rubbing the back, no gentle bouncing, no terms of endearment that felt personal. I followed at a distance, pretending to shop. The girl's cries started changing, becoming more panicked. I want my mommy, she whispered. You said Mommy was here. The woman shifted uncomfortably. We are, honey. Just a few more things. Her eyes darted to the exits. When they reached the dairy section, I saw another woman with a cart full of groceries. She was younger, probably early 30s, talking frantically on her phone. I don't know, John. She was right here. I just turned around for a second to grab her juice. He knows not to wander off. No. She was wearing her favourite butterfly clip. The purple and silver one. Yes. And her yellow polka dot dress. My stomach dropped. The crying girl was wearing exactly that, a yellow polka dot dress and a butterfly hair clip, purple and silver, just like the one the younger woman was now Clutching in her free hand, I stepped closer to them, acting like I was reaching for milk. The girls next words confirmed everything Mommy had.

Allergy medication. Take daily. The seal had never been broken. 30 pills, untouched. Why would someone with deadly allergies never take their medication? I found papers underneath. Allergy test results. I read through them. Shellfish, tree nuts, soy, eggs, gluten. All negative. The doctor's note said, patient shows no allergic responses. Recommended evaluation for health anxiety. I photographed everything. My head was spinning. I put it back. Her birthday was in two weeks.

Here's her eating shrimp at the seafood restaurant she claims could kill her. I swiped to the next photo, and here are her allergy test results. Every single one negative. The room went dead silent. Now Natalie straightened up. Her hand dropped from her throat. You're insane, she whispered. No, I said. You are. I walked out. Half the party followed me. I'm dating someone normal now.

My girlfriend, Natalie, carried an Epipen everywhere. She had backups in my car, my apartment and my parents house. But something about her allergies never added up. Every restaurant became an ordeal. She would stop the server before we sat down. I need to speak to the chef about cross contamination. Natalie claimed she was allergic to shellfish, nuts, Oy, eggs, gluten and dairy. Dinners took forever while she interrogated servers. Is the chicken broth made in house? What oil do you use? My friends stopped inviting us out. My mom stopped hosting holidays because Natalie needed special meals in separate pans. My birthday, we went to an Italian restaurant. Natalie made the waiter list every ingredient three times. When the food came, she took one bite and pushed it away. I can taste the cross contamination. My throat feels tight. We left immediately. I spent my birthday in my car eating a gas station sandwich while she lectured me. My mom bought new cookware for her. Everyone rearranged their lives around her needs. But in two years, I had never seen an actual reaction, just complaints about her throat and leaving restaurants. But she was lying about this. Someone else wasn't real. I was at Natalie's apartment helping her move out. She called from the kitchen. Can you grab the packing tape from my bedroom closet? I opened the wrong drawer. Inside were takeout containers stacked everywhere. Chinese food. Thai food, pizza boxes, burger wrappers, all the food she swore would kill her. I pulled out pad Thai, peanut sauce crusted on the edges, the same sauce she made a waiter cry over. The receipt was state pulled to the bag. Recent. Did you find it? She yelled. Yeah, I said, and shoved everything back. My heart was pounding. I couldn't sleep after what I saw. I told her I had to work late. Parked outside her place and waited. She walked out and got in her car. I followed. She drove to a seafood restaurant, the same one she refused to visit with me. The shellfish in the air could kill me. Do you want me to die? She had said. I felt horrible suggesting it. Now I watched her walk inside like it was nothing. I waited, then followed. I sat at the bar where she couldn't see me. The server brought her a plate of shrimp.

He got me and threw me away. My mom once told me when she was pregnant with me, she prayed for a boy. She already had two sons, but my dad wanted just one more son. He talked about it like he was building a team. But when I was born and the nurse said it's a girl, my dad didn't even come near me. He walked out of the room, didn't talk to my mom for two days. She laughed when she told me that I didn't. That moment set the tone for the rest of my life. My brothers were treated like kings. My dad took them to fancy schools, bought them new bikes and always made sure they had the best. I was sent to a small, poor government school, no library, broken chairs, big classes. But I worked hard anyway. I studied under street lights when the power went out. And somehow I got better grades than all of them. But even when I came home with medals and top marks, they brushed it off. My grandma once said, smart girls are still just girls. My dad said, let's see what she does with all that studying. Girls just end up in kitchens anyway. Still, I kept pushing. At 18, I got a full scholarship for writing. I was the first one in the whole family to earn that kind of opportunity. I brought the letter home, heart racing. My mom. Smiled softly. My dad glanced at it and said, so you're finally leaving. I packed my bags. No hugs, no goodbyes. I left like I had lived quietly in the city. I worked hard, got a part time job at a bookstore to help with rent, wrote at night, graduated with honours. Then I found a job in publishing, not huge, but enough to live. And somehow along the way, I found the.

I should have known something was off when Macy told me, four months into dating, that every relationship decision she'd ever made needed Tyler's approval first. Her neighbor since age 10, her best friend for 14 years, the guy who had veto power over every boyfriend she'd ever had. I stayed anyway. Bad move. Five days ago, I got violently sick. Alone in my apartment. Roommate gone. I called Macy, asking if she could help. She hesitated. He had plans to watch a movie and grab lunch with Tyler. I was doubled over in pain, and she was choosing him. You could just date Tyler then, I said, and hung up. An hour later, she showed up with homemade soup, apologizing she'd canceled on Tyler. I thought I'd won. The next day, she ghosted me completely. No texts, no calls. At midnight, she finally called back. I need you to sit down for this. She broke up with me. Said my behavior was nothing but red flags, that she couldn't be with someone like me anymore. Then she hung up and blocked me everywhere. I spent two days spiraling, replaying every interaction, trying to figure out what I'd done wrong. I cried myself to sleep. I couldn't work. I couldn't function. Nothing made sense. Then I remembered something. Three weeks earlier, Tyler had asked me about my Work schedule. Specifically what days I worked late. At the time, I thought he was just making conversation. Now I realized he'd been gathering information. I checked Macy's Instagram. She posted a story the day after our fight. Her and Tyler at the exact restaurant she canceled on him for. He got in his day with her anyway. Then I saw the comments. Tyler had written. Always make time for the people who actually care about you.

So I canceled the Wi-Fi, turned off the heat, and scheduled the cable guy for the day. She's moving. Last Tuesday, my roommate Kayla drops this bomb while I'm making dinner. Hey, so I'm moving in with Blake next month. But don't worry. I'll still pay rent until our lease ends in March. I thought that was actually pretty responsible of her. We'd been roommates for two years, never had major drama. I figured we'd coast through the final months. I'm a freak. Boy, was I wrong. The very next night, Blake shows up with a duffel bag. Then he never left. Suddenly, my quiet apartment turned into their little love nest. Blake's using my Netflix account, rating my leftovers, leaving his sweaty gym clothes on my couch. His gaming setup appeared in the living room. His toothbrush showed up next to mine. Dude basically moved in without paying a single dollar. When I brought it up to Kayla, she just shrugged. What's the big deal? I'm still paying my half of rent. He's just staying over. Stay over for three weeks straight? Apparently. That's when it hit me. She wanted to double dip, keep paying for a backup apartment while test driving domestic life with lake. If things went south, she'd have somewhere to return to. Meanwhile, I'm subsidizing her relationship experiment. So I decided to optimize our living situation for the reality. She'd created. First, I called our internet company. Hi, I need to downgrade my plan. Immediately went from our 500 megabits per second speed to the basic 25 milla bps package. Perfect for one person checking emails. Absolute hell for three people streaming gaming and video calling simultaneously. Next, I adjusted the thermostat to 62 degrees and installed a little lock box over it. My apartment, my comfort level. If they wanted it warmer, they could wear sweaters or contribute to heating bills. Then I scheduled every service appointment I've been putting off for months. Able technician at 8:00am on moving day to upgrade our service. HVAC maintenance guy at 10:00am for the annual inspection. Pest control at noon for our quarterly treatment. Internet installation guy at two PM to set up my new solo plan. Building Maintenance at four PM to fix the bathroom faucet. Carpet cleaning at six PM because why not make it a full day? The chaos started within days. Blake's big gaming tournament kept lagging out because.

Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

Like, she didn't even recognize them. If they could throw me out so easily, what did that mean for her? I took a deep breath. I wasn't going to argue or beg. If they wanted me out, fine.

You gave me your little speech about money being tight, and the second I handed you the check, you were out the door. My aunt gasped. Mom kept going and her voice got louder. My dog daughter called me every single Sunday at exactly seven PM For five years straight, she never missed one, not when she had the flu, not when she was traveling for work. She asked about every single doctor appointment and every medication change. She flew home six times when I had surgeries and procedures, sleeping in hospital chairs and using all her vacation time. Tears were pouring down my face. Mom said, two years ago, I accidentally found out your sister has been paying my medical bills. She never told me. She never asked for anything back. She never even mentioned it. Meanwhile, Kevin, you asked me for money 37 times and never paid back a single dollar. Kevin tried to speak, but nothing came out. Mom said, so, Kevin, you get absolutely nothing, not one penny. Not because I stopped loving you, but because you stopped loving me the second I couldn't write you checks anymore. Your sister gets everything because she's the only one who loved me without a price tag attached. I hope you learn something from this, but honestly, you're too much of a selfish prick to change.

He said, think you'll be able to make it this time, or are you too busy? At the funeral, my aunt pulled me aside and said, I saw Kevin here all the time when I visited your mother. He'd have those sweet grandbabies with him. It's so important for children to know their grandmother. I wanted to scream that I called mom every single Sunday for five years, but I just nodded. After the service, my uncle cornered me and said, you know, people without children just don't understand family. The same way Kevin made your mother a grandmother. That's a real legacy. I bit my tongue. Instead of saying, I've been paying mom's medical bills for two years. My cousin brought me a plate of food and said, I ran into Kevin at the grocery store near your mom's place at least once a month. He was always there getting things for her. Where do you live again? Two hours away. I'd Flown home six times in two years for mom's procedures, but apparently that meant nothing. Kevin's wife found me in the hallway and said, Kevin spent so much time taking care of your mother, we had to rearrange our whole lives around her needs. It put such a strain on our family. I'd spent six, $50,000 on Mom's medical bills without telling anyone. But sure, Kevin sacrificed so much. And Kevin walked past me and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, at least she showed up to this. That's more than we usually get. We gathered in Mom's dining room for the will reading. The lawyer set up her laptop and opened a folder. Kevin sat at the head of the table, looking smug. The lawyer cleared her throat and said, the house, valued at $450,000 goes to her daughter. The room went dead silent. Lawyer continued, her savings and investment accounts totaling $320,000 also go to her daughter. Kevin stood up so fast his chair fell over. He screamed, this is effing insane! I was there every goddamn week. She sat in her apartment alone, rotting while this selfish bitch built her career. She doesn't even have kids. What's she going to do with a four bedroom house? His wife grabbed his arm and said, she must have been on medication.

Then she slammed the door in our faces. I stopped trying after that. Last month, my dad called and said, Lily died. I couldn't breathe. He said it was a complication from her condition. She got pneumonia and her body couldn't fight it. I was sobbing and he was crying, too. He said, the funeral is Saturday. I said, can I come? He was quiet for a long time and then said, your mother says no. I hung up and screamed into a pillow for an hour. My little sister was dead, and I wasn't allowed to say goodbye. I drove to the funeral anyway. I sat in my car across the street and watched them carry her casket out. My mom was hysterical and my dad was holding her up. I wanted to run over there and hold my mom and cry together, but I knew she pushed me away. I went to the cemetery after everyone left and stood at Lily's grave. I told her I was sorry. Sorry I couldn't protect her. Sorry I wasn't allowed to be her sister for the last 20 years. Sorry she died thinking I didn't love her. Two weeks later, my dad called again. He said, your mother wants to see you. I said, why now? He said, she needs you. We both do. Lily was everything to us. And now she's gone and we don't have anyone. I felt something snap inside me. I said, you had me. You Always had me. I tried for 20 years, and you shut me out. He said, please, where are your parents? We need our daughter. I drove to their house. My mom looked like she'd aged 10 years in two weeks. She reached for me and said, I'm so sorry. I was wrong about everything. I blamed you, and I shouldn't have. Please come back. Be our daughter again. We can't lose you, too. I stood there looking at this woman who'd spent 20 years telling me I destroyed her life. I said, you kept me from my sister for 20 years. I'll never get that back. She died thinking I abandoned her. Do you understand that? My mom was sobbing and said, I know. I'm sorry. Please. I said, I had a daughter five years ago. Your granddaughter. You slammed the door in her face on Christmas. My dad said, we wanna meet her. We wanna be a family again. I said, you don't get to decide that now. You had 20 years to be my family. You spent all of it punishing me for something that wasn't my fault. And now Lily's gone and you're alone, and suddenly I'm good enough? My mom said, please don't leave us. I said, you left me first. Then I walked out.

I finally told her she destroyed it all by herself. I was 19 and driving my little sister Lily home from her dance recital when a truck ran a red light and slammed into the passenger side. The impact was so loud I couldn't hear anything else. For days, the crash left Lily paralyzed from the waist down. I woke up in the hospital with a concussion and bruises. My dad was sitting next to my bed and when I asked about Lily, he started crying. My mom wouldn't come into my room. The police report said the other driver was drunk and ran the light. I had a green light and couldn't have done anything differently. It didn't matter. When I got released from the hospital, my mom looked at me like I was a stranger. She said, you were driving. You were supposed to protect her. I said it wasn't my fault. And she said, you're the reason my baby will never walk again. She moved all my stuff into the garage that week and told me I wasn't allowed in Lily's room. For the next year, I lived in that house like a ghost. My mom would make breakfast for everyone and leave me nothing. On Lily's 16th birthday, my mom threw her a huge party and told me I wasn't invited. I tried everything. I wrote my mom letters apologizing even though I had nothing to Apologize for. She threw them away without reading them. I bought her flowers on Mother's Day and she gave them to a neighbor. I showed up to family dinners and she'd get up and leave the room. When I graduated high school, no one from my family came. I moved out the next week. I kept trying. I called every Sunday and my mom would hang up the second she heard my voice. I sent Christmas presents and they got returned. I showed up to Lily's high school graduation and my mom told security I was harassing them. I went to college and then medical school. I thought maybe if I saved other people lives, my mom would see that I wasn't a monster. I sent her my med school graduation announcement. She didn't come. I got married and invited my whole family. My dad came alone and said my mom refused. He told me to give her time. It had been eight years. I had a daughter and sent birth announcements. My mom never acknowledged it. My daughter turned 5 and had never met her grandmother. I tried one last time. I showed up at my parents house on Christmas with my daughter. My mom opened the door, looked at us and said, you have some nerve bringing a child here when you're the reason I lost my.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most back breaking chores I could think of. Rashingling the roof in July. Digging out a tree stump by hand. Moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7 a m. Sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I'd try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just Say what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd slipped on some water and couldn't move her leg. Before I could even process what was happening, Pete had already called 9 1 1. He rattled off our address, my wife's symptoms, and even mentioned her previous back surgery. Then he grabbed our first aid kit and started checking her vitals, talking to her calmly the whole time. When I asked how he knew what to do, he shrugged and said, been taking EMT classes at night.

Uh, Trump has proposed somewhere around 60% tariffs of China and 20% tariffs on the rest of the world. Um, this is extremely concerned. I mean, this is a return to smooth holly back in. Yeah. So, um, tell me why. So tell me what tariffs currently? Because we have over 300 of them on the books. That you think are currently harming the American economy. So the. I. I don't know. I can't tell you exactly. Every tear from the book. Tell me one. Okay, the. The tear that Trump imposed on washing machines back in 2016, 2017, I believe it was. If you look at the statistics for household appliances in general, they have increased the price and Biden has actually kept that tariff in. In play. And obviously this is something that's kind of, um. It doesn't strike at the core of our. Of what? Of consumers. But it's still the. If the tariffs increase across all goods, it will. They will increase prices. Yes. I guess. Two questions. With tariffs. How do you avoid a tariff? You don't put. I mean, you don't. You don't put one on the other country. No. Let's pretend you're Toyota. How do you avoid a terrorist coming into America? You. You transfer the money, the cost to consumer. No. Why not? No, no. How do you. How do you avoid a terrorist if you're Toyota? I'm not sure. I'm not sure what you're asking. You build the car in America. Okay, yeah. Okay, so it's not a trick. It's not a trick question, right? So let me tell you what's happened. For example, Lincoln Baines Johnson, not my favorite president, put a 25% tariff on pickup trucks. Most people don't know this exists. Toyota actually, uh, per capita, has some of the most popular pickup trucks in the country. Who here knows a Toyota pickup truck? I guarantee some of you guys do. They make all of them in America to avoid that. That tariff. So when you're the incumbent economic power, tariffs are actually really, really helpful. Now, if you're a small fledgling country such as Portugal, tariffs can be really, really disastrous cause you do not have the global reserve currency status. There's been a lot of fraudulent and flimsy economic studies done by major corporations that have made you seem as if free trade is the greatest thing ever. But for example, solar panel tariffs, pickup truck tariffs, um, even household appliances and electric tariffs. What happens over time is these companies want to do business with us, so they end up bending the knee and building their plant in America. Which is great for industry, great job. It's not a zero sum game. You. You realize that when you're building something here that could be better built somewhere else, that money could be spent. Hold on. Now this is interesting. So Of course it could be cheaper in China. Yes, but wouldn't you rather have Americans be employed to make it? Well, that's my choice as a consumer. It's not a choice of the government to impose a tax to tell me where to buy it. Well, actually, they can chip in. This is where we have a moral difference. our government actually has a moral obligation to employ its citizens before the cheapest possible. Good. Let me, uh. I'm pretty people who might have followed me now, I'm pretty libertarian in my instincts. Let me just ask you a question about. About this is if another country is applying a tariff to the United States on our own goods, is it fair game to say that we got to play by the same rules in both directions? Well, I. I'm a fan, honestly, of turning of the cheek in that sense. See, so that's. That's what you're gonna do. Cause I'm pretty libertarian on a lot of, you know, but I do actually land in a very similar place. Well, I land in a place called Donald Trump does when you look at his actions as US president. All right, what did US president was. Cause I'm going to go somewhere with this. First of all, you take another country that puts a tariff on us. What we have been doing is turning the other cheek for too long. And I am a big fan of following our Judeo Christian values in the country and the way we live our lives, but not in our economic policy. To turn the other cheek. Will be slapped by other countries with tariffs on the other side, he's gonna be strong enough to protect who you are. So. So number one is, when Donald Trump, you actually end up looking at what he end up doing. Terrorist he slapped down. countries have been applying those terrorists to us asymmetrically. That's not free trade. That's not playing by the same set of rules. Now, you'll see some other cases where terrorists were applied, but they say, oh, no, is that other country actually applying a terrorist? There's a lot of ways to apply a tariff. One of the ways you apply tariff is you get state sponsorship. So in those other countries, even in Japan, even other countries around the. Around the TPP partnership, what they do is those governments support their own companies. When our own government does not support those industries here, that effectively is a terrorist, because it makes our own companies less competitive. So in some ways, this whole debate about tariffs and Donald Trump, two things are true about it. One is, Biden's kept everyone of the terrorists that Donald Trump has. It's not a choice between the two candidates. Number two is pragmatically. When you look at the way Donald Trump did this, he's a pragmatist. What he ended up doing was just applying A tariff to countries that already applied one to us, directly or indirectly. And even as somebody who leans pretty libertarian, and I'll tell you, it is totally fair game for demanding that other countries play by the same set of rules that we do, rather than turning the other cheek economically, which is not the thing I think we should do in America. Okay, thank you, man. Thanks. I'll just. One look. What? You do not have a free market, which, embedded in the idea of a free market, is that you have an independent rule system. If one country is terrorizing you, and you are not, in fact, and you're actually disadvantaging your country for no particular reason. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.

And I think what we would be better doing for all Americans is go back to the first Constitution rather than the second one that we rebelled. So my question, like, really, like, to Charlie. So, like, you would like, if you had the opportunity, you would get rid of the Civil Rights Act? No, I think you should have a one page Bill that says that racial discrimination based on race is illegal and will not be tolerated in the United States of America. I would. I would simplify it. I would not have all. So. So what happened is that the Civil Rights Act has nine different titles in it, and you have this, this leviathan that was created. And something that most black Americans don't support is men and female sports. Would you agree? What should we say that again? Men playing in female sports? Oh, hell no. Yeah, I know this. No, no, for sure. Right. Believe it or not, the Civil Rights Act is now being used to keep men playing in women's sports. So it's. So the Civil Rights Act was used to help black America originally. Totally. Get that. But now the way it was written is that any claim of identification. So someone says, I'm a woman, therefore I can compete in your volleyball team, they come in with a civil rights claim. And so what we're saying is, no, no, no, It should be specified to racial, not gender, all that other stuff. And there were all these other provisions as well. Alright, and my, like, last question. Yeah? Do you think, like, if Trump come back into office, you think like, Young Thug is getting free? Or like, any, like, these people in jail? You all know Young Thug. What is it? Who's getting free? Young Thug. Is Young Thug getting free of Trump come back into office? And like, why? So, like, what would you vote for him if he promised to pardon? Oh, yeah. Hell yeah. If, if, if Young Thug was coming back, like, we need new music and stuff, so I feel like, yeah, we'll pass that along. Alright, appreciate that. Appreciate that. What's your name again? Jerry.

Every time you repeal a piece of abortion legislation, the coat hanger business gains a few new customers. Right? And even after they're born, you guys don't give as much of a crap about them after they're out of the womb, right? You don't want to pay for. That's not true. Why would you say that? Cause you guys have an active war against education. You guys have an active war against education. hold on. Free lunch? Hold on. Just because you don't want to have throw government money at something doesn't mean you don't care about them. Time out.

No, every policy that we have is rooted in a pro life position. Okay, alright, so let's move a little bit on from that. Not saying I've lost yet. Cause a woman did kill her own child. Literally like a couple of days ago on day of birth. 60 years in prison. As she should have. But like that is a abortion problem. She was raped. But. but let's move. But what if she would have killed the baby while it was in the womb? It would have been okay. So why was it wrong to kill the baby outside the womb? Cause the baby could cry. Oh, the baby can't cry in a womb. Okay, okay. No, no, no. Talk about. No, no, no. You brought it up. Why is it. Why is it bad to slit the throat of a baby once it's born, but okay to slit the throat of the baby if it's in the womb? Less cells. Just straight up less cells. I would say different as a one day difference as a one day to count the cells. Less cells. Right. Wait, so the amount of cells you have dictate your moral worth? I have more. I do not want to get into this moral. No, you already did. Okay, hold on, I will, I. Would you? Would you? No. Would you say it? No. What's stopping you?

Oh, presumptuous. I don't know about you, but any kind of. Any kind of argument that there's an objective morality? Of course there is. Was it was. Was Hitler objectively evil? Yeah.

And okay, Sir Ramsey Mommy, I believe since you ran for president, I would like to hear from you first. Sure. So I think this is a common this I know this is near and near to Charlie's heart. Oh, okay, let's let's start with that. Well, what I think that's a great question, Astra. I like that. What let's start with that so I make sure I'm responding to the question. What is the definition of justice? Okay, so we talk a lot about like d I programs and that sort of thing and people being, you know, unjustly put into these like positions. I believe that the Electoral College is d I for the Republican Party where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the Electoral College because it empowers rural states more by giving them the electoral votes. Do you believe that the Senate is unjust? I believe the Senate needs to exist. Okay, so so cause that's the whole principle is that we don't just live in a direct democracy, we live in a constitutional republic. And that means a few things. First is it means that we are really a union of states. We're not just a random assemblage of geographic land masses called states that we call a union. That means something where part of it is direct representative democracy, but part of it is also making sure That states actually have a relative say in the process. That's how you get the Senate versus the house to balance it out. Same thing with respect to the history of the Electoral College. This is about making sure that we're being thoughtful about the step of who's actually the US president while channeling the democratic will through the manner and shrine in our Constitution. And here's the biggest difference between a republic and a democracy, this relevant to a lot of young people is in a constitutional republic, it's not just about what you get, right? In democracy, you get a vote. You think about what does it, what does it mean to be a citizen about what you get. In a constitutional republic, it's also about what you give. It's about your civic duty to your country. And I think that part of what our Founding Fathers envisioned is we had voters who actually knew something about their country. You know, every legal immigrant who comes to this country has to pass a civics test before they can vote. Well, frankly, the sad truth is most voters would fail that if they took it today. That would make our founding fathers roll over in their graves. And so, I think that we got to get beyond this idea that we're some kind of direct democracy. We're actually a republic where people have responsibilities and states actually have some level of distributed say to make sure that two cities In New York and California don't govern who actually leads the entire United States of America.

Me and my roommate have started really trying to take it off here. So like this. Okay. I see. I see. Yeah, I think, uh, the Democratic Party turned their back on Joe Biden way too fast. It was like overnight. One night they were all supporting him. The next night I look at Twitter, Bam, no longer voting for him. He lost the ticket overnight. So, I mean, nothing's more undemocratic than that. I thought it was gonna be a disagree. Thank you. But I agree. I totally agree. And so I guess you're more Liberal leaning probably. Maybe. I so I'd say most of my ideals align with Joe Biden. No, no, that's fine. And why do you think that Democrats saying they're the party democracy were able just to remove a candidate that should bother more people. Right. Well, I think it's not necessarily something with the Democratic Party. I think Republicans would do it as well. I think it's just an issue of the two party system. Honestly, that's my so, you know, look, I mean, Charlie and I share this in common. We're not afraid to and have not been afraid to criticize the Republican Party when necessary. Right? I just think in both in the, in the political system right now overall, in general, what do we have? You got a bunch of puppets who are wielded by the managerial class, including a mega donor class. Shut up. That uses politicians as Pawns, you see the Democratic Party, you see the Republican Party. We're in a unique moment in the history of the Republican Party. It wasn't this way for most of my life, right? But we're in a unique moment where the person who happens to be the Republican nominee is independently a billionaire and is at least, you may have disagreed with his policies, but he's at least not somebody who's controlled by that machine. People may not like him for a lot of reasons. But what I think is we, what, one thing we probably share in Common Cause I could tell from your sign, is I said it before, I'll say it again, the people we elect to run the government should be the ones who actually run the government. I fully agree. And Joe Biden has not been given the freedom to do that. And I think that, I think if we agree on that much, call that an agreement rather than a disagreement. I think the issue is, though, although Donald Trump is a billionaire by his own right, if you look at, you know, FBI versus Citizens United, the Supreme Court case, Donald Trump's also getting an insane amount of money from private donors. You know, five o 1 C's. Come on. Harris is actually getting far more. I mean, I know, I know. It's like what, it's like 300 million to 200 million. I don't think it's five times more. It's five times more. It's not even close. I Don't think that's true either way, if you want to get mega money out of politics, I think you're gonna find some allies here and thinking about ways to do that. You're, you're only look, it's just a kind of a wonky thing. It's, it's more than what Open Secrets reports, however. Okay. Um, I think this is an admirable, uh, crusade. Thank you. And, uh, we'd like to, we're gonna publicize on our social media channels, of course. That's kind of interesting to me. Yeah, I think it's a unique movement. I just wish more people would consider Joe Biden for 2024. I think we turned our backs on him way too fast. Okay. I'd love to know. What's your name, man? I'm Ryan. Ryan, what's your last name? Ryan Farrah. Ryan Farrah is starting a movement. Let's see how it goes. Thank you. Yeah, she's trying to change the world. Thank you. It was lovely talking to you guys. Thank you.

Um, it's. It's not. I feel like it's not up for someone. I don't. I just feel like it's not up for you to decide. I think it's up for the individual. And I think the way they. The way they express themselves through. You know, through the. The way they express themselves through their. What's called. Through their. Through their. Through their appeal, through their attire. I think that's more indicative of. Okay, then let's play it. Let's play this out. If everyone can just choose however they want. Should biological men who are born as a man be able to compete in female sports? I'm asking. Um, no, I don't believe that biological men should be in women's sports. And god bless you for saying that, cause that's a. So here's another question. Should biological men who identify as women be able to go into women's locker rooms? Can you repeat that one more time? Biological man. So he has a. And he says he's a woman. Should he be allowed to go into female locker rooms? I mean, we have. On campus, we have all. We have all gender restrooms on campus where males and females are. Yeah, I think that's a terrible idea. Right. So because this male female distinctions are critically important as how society is structured. Yeah. So we have these shared spaces, and there hasn't been any sort of issues or. I Don't think. I think the major consensus surrounding it is that people actually enjoy the. What's it called, the gender. The all gender bathrooms. About locker rooms. Do you think women would enjoy undressing next to a fully unclothed man? No, I don't think so. I don't care. So then we should prohibit that. So we agree. So. And then finally, do you think that a young 15 year old here in California, a young boy who thinks he is a girl, should he be allowed to drop his. Can you. Can you say that again from the start? 15 year old boy in California, he thinks he's transgender. Should he be allowed to go chop his parts off? No. Um, should he be allowed? I think. I think that's a conversation for him and his medical and his doctor and his family. I mean, I'm not. It's not. It's not my. It's not my job to. Should. Should 15 year olds be allowed to get tattoos? Should 15 year olds be allowed to get tattoos? I. No. So you could, but you can't get a tattoo. I mean. I mean with. I think that's. I don't think that's really that comparative. Well, they're both irreversible, right? Actually, one matters a lot more for human flourishing than the other. No, I would definitely agree that's. It's a very. What's it called? It's a very life altering process and I think it requires a lot of time and it requires a Lot of time. It shouldn't be something that should be just jumped into. Um, I just think that's something for an individual and their. Their family and their doctors to decide and not for, um, society or the state. The state. Last question. Most important question. What is a woman? Um. A woman. You know it. You know it when you see it. You know, it's like, if I look, she looks like a woman. She looks like a woman. She looks like a woman. She looks like a woman. It's the way. It's the way you express yourself. So, like, all these. It's the way you express yourself. So if you. If you. If you. Basically, womanhood is a costume. I'm not saying that. No, If you're able to wear the right stuff and just assume the identity, you can appropriate womanhood. Is that correct? No. Okay. Is Caitlyn Jenner a woman? Yes. Why? Why is she a woman? What chromosomes does Caitlyn Jenner have? Um, I mean, I think her chromosomes don't have to deal with her gender. Like, I think that's where the disagreement lies. Is that. Yeah. Again, so this is where you are playing into this narrative that gender exists. We reject that paradigm completely because gender has LED us to this place that your own personal self expression matters to your core identity. And again, that means nothing. Infinite personalities, no genders, two sexes. And we must live in reality, not In the delusions of the heads of people that want us to accommodate their fantasy. Thank you very much for your time.

Yes. When, when most of them especially. And I want to ask you what you think about the ones who were arrested or were detained while trying to go through the legal processes. The ones who came in actually, and it was a loophole. I'll admit that Joe Biden allowed for a loophole to get into the system, right, through, um, open borders. No, through, um, through asylum. So asylum was a loophole, but it still was a legal way to enter the country. And what about the illegal immigrants who were detained while going to their meetings to make sure they stayed within the legal process? They're still in violation of 8 USC 1312. If they came in using what is, what is, what is 8 USC 1312? You don't know. That's fine. It's fraudulently filling out an asylum claim, but, which these people are, but that's what the courts are gonna. 8 USC 13 0 5, which is illegal crossing the southern border, which can be enforced also upon the second entrance going on. And there's 8 USC 13 0 5. And I know, I don't mean to like make you look bad, you just don't know enough about this stuff. Like I encourage you to look at 8 thirteen 8 USC 13 0 5 8 18 thirteen, 8 a U c 13 12. How the Criminal code actually comes in particular here The Supreme Court is giving President Trump full authority to deport these illegals without without same due process as people here in America. But what about the Supreme Court decisions like a which one is it? Yes. So I know what you're talking about. Yes. I don't know the name, but it basically says that's three illegal aliens. Those are for illegal aliens that commit crimes while they are here. So if it's like an illegal this this is recognized do process rights for non citizens. I just deportation hearings. Yes. Correct. Not deported not every again, The Supreme Court has clarified that 2019 that not every single illegal here within the last two years gets a deportation hearing. They've clarified it and people are conveniently ignoring the media. Thank you for your time. Can you tell me where where I can find it and clarify it? Chat type in a chat GTP not chat GTP from the Supreme Court. Okay. Well, it'll lead you to the source say find me the Supreme Court case. I don't know the name of it 2019, 2018 decision around expedited removal within 100 miles of the border and two years of being in the country. The Supreme Court clarify they do not need the same due process. Right. So you're also saying that these other Supreme Court cases that were that reaffirmed that due process rights does apply to non citizens naturalized. Again, what the Supreme Court said is they had a distinction. They said that if an illegal alien is here and, for example, commits a DUI, they get to process on that infraction. They don't get to process necessarily on just the fact they came into the southern border illegally. there's about crimes you can't commit on the interior of the country different than ones that you commit while you come into the country. What about the people who have not committed crimes? Doesn't matter. Coming in the country, coming in the country for crime doesn't matter for longer than two weeks. That the Supreme Court will, hopefully it's not. Again, it's 18 USC 13. It's a 8 USC 1312. It makes it a felony to hurt yourself illegal United States America, not notify the government of your presence. You look it up anytime you want. 8 USC 1312. Any illegal alien that does not tell the government where they are, what they're doing and why they are here is in violation and is currently committing a felony. Thank you for your time on it. Thank you. Well, I can say one last question. No, we got a question. Thank you, everyone. Look up w.

We don't know what to do. We're only a medium security prison. Why don't we put it on y'all a little bit? Stop picking them up every time. Let them walk. We're in northern Indiana. They're not going anywhere. Right? Let them get tuckered out. And by the way, no phone number to call if you see a hitchhiker.

He broke down crying in Squidward's house. To avoid damaging his floor, Squidward pretended to pull Patrick's nose off and tossed it outside. Patrick fell for it immediately and mistook a nearby seashell for his nose. SpongeBob noticed something was wrong. There was a hermit crab living inside the shell. Patrick then went to a plastic surgery clinic where he could choose a nose shape he liked. After leaving the clinic, SpongeBob couldn't wait to see Patrick's new nose, but Patrick stopped him. He wanted to reveal it himself. When he finally did, SpongeBob was startled by the way Patrick unveiled it. With his new nose, Patrick started noticing all sorts of smells for the first time. Suddenly, he caught the scent of rotting food and realized he was standing in a trash heap. This Dentch forcefully entered his nose and Patrick panicked, running back to his house. Just when he thought he was safe, the foul smell followed him inside. Patrick realized his home wasn't much better than a garbage dump. He put on a mask and began a massive clean up. Even so, he could still smell the nasty odor. A frantic PA Patrick stormed into the Krusty Krab, placing scented candles on every table and spraying air freshener in every corner. All the customers were successfully driven out. Angry Mr Krabs rallied everyone to punish Patrick. SpongeBob stepped in, explaining that it was all Patrick's new nose's fault. So they Geared up and prepared a huge, absolutely stinky pile of trash for Patrick as soon as he.

Mr Krabs sent SpongeBob to retrieve the secret formula, and SpongeBob was a nervous wreck when he finally brought back the box. SpongeBob hurried inside the Krusty Krab, but when he opened it, there was nothing inside. SpongeBob couldn't believe his eyes until he noticed a hole drilled into the side. Just then, Mr Krabs showed up. SpongeBob, panicking, lied to him. He and Patrick immediately went to plankton, since his lunch just so happened to be a Krabby Patty. But the moment SpongeBob looked closely at the Patty, he felt sick to his stomach. He was sure plankton hadn't stolen the formula. That's when mission turned toward Gary. SpongeBob insisted Gary must have snuck onto a helicopter and dissolve the case with his slime when SpongeBob wasn't looking. But Gary revealed he had actually seen another suspect that day. With Gary testimony, Patrick sketched a portrait of the culprit. The trail LED them to Squidward. They busted down his door, startling him half to death. SpongeBob accused Squidward of having motives Gary had witnessed. But when they searched Squidward's box, all they found was a pair of dance shoes. Squidward admitted he was secretly entering a dance competition. With no answers, SpongeBob returned to Mr Krabs for help. But Mr Krabs turned the blame on him, claiming SpongeBob had stolen the formula and sold it to plankton. While accusing him Mr Krabs accidentally pulled the Secret formula out of his own pocket. SpongeBob recognized it instantly. Mr Krabs was speechless at that moment. Hidden police officers revealed themselves. It was all a scam. Mr Krabs.

After catching some fish, she didn't eat them. Instead, she crushed the small ones, breaking them into pieces, and threw them back into the sea. The smell of blood quickly spread through the water. Anna stood on the shore, holding a sharp stick, staring intently at the surface of the water. Soon, a large, confused fish swam near her. Anna seized the chance and with luck managed to spear the fish. This brought her a sense of joy. When she made it back to the shore, she endured the torment of hunger, but didn't eat the fish right away. Instead, she hung it high in a tree, waiting silently. As night fell, she crawled into a sand pit to observe quietly, seemingly waiting for some more dangerous creature to appear. But perhaps due to extreme exhaustion, Anna soon fell into a deep sleep. When she woke up again, she discovered that the fish hanging in the tree was gone. Her eyes widened in horror as she frantically looked around, but found nothing out of the ordinary. Desperate to figure out what was happening on the island, Anna began searching everywhere. Before long, she found a matchbox in the forest. However, as she turned to head back, she heard a sound behind her.

But as I dove in to retrieve it, I stumbled upon something unexpected, a mysterious stone. With my years of experience as a treasure hunter, I immediately recognized it as a ballast stone. These stones were commonly used on ancient ships and they often sit near sunken ships filled with treasure. Without hesitation, I resurfaced and informed my team about the find. Upon hearing this, they quickly grabbed their weapons and dove in to help search. Before long, I made another discovery. When I pried it loose, I realized it was a golden dagger from centuries ago. Finding such a valuable item immediately lifted my spirits. Now all we had to do was locate the sunken treasure beneath the sea and we'd be billionaires. To speed up our search, we went to the market and bought all sorts of detection equipment. And we headed back to the area where we'd made the discovery. We marked off the general area with ropes and began searching carefully with a metal detector. It didn't take long before the detector gave a signal. I quickly instructed my companion to use a hair dryer to blow away the sand on the surface. Soon, a thick iron chain emerged in front of us. We realized then that we were onto something huge, a treasure of unimaginable value.

A massive tree covered in what appeared to be human like hair. Without hesitation, he pulled out a dagger and plunged it into the trunk. To his surprise, a strange white liquid began to flow out. Driven by curiosity, he rubbed it onto his hand, eager to examine it. As a drop of the liquid dripped from his finger, something incredible happened. Green leaves began to sprout from the surrounding weeds, growing rapidly before his eyes. Astonished by the liquids miraculous properties, the man quickly applied it to the wound on his stomach. Within moments, just three seconds, his injury was completely healed. Now fully convinced of the liquids extraordinary powers, the man had a daring idea. He continued stabbing the tree, collecting the flowing liquid in his hand, drank it greedily, unable to resist the temptation. What happened next was beyond belief. The tree suddenly erupted in a blinding light. Before the man could react, a golden beam shot into his body. The pain was unbearable. He collapsed to the ground, overwhelmed by the agony. Then something extraordinary occurred. It felt as though something inside him was bursting. A wave of green plants erupted from his stomach, growing uncontrollably. Panicking, the man desperately tried to tear the plants away, but they grew faster than he could keep up. In a matter of moments, the soil began to swallow him whole. Just as hope seemed lost, a new twist was about to unfold.

She don't need experience with all short drilling. She needs experience of bullshitting. So, Rebecca, you get us as much lead time as possible. Nate, you find the money. All right, I'll talk to y'all later.

Oh, my god, there's a letter. I don't know if I'm ready for this, although if grandma wrote it, she must have sensed I was ready. Because you had such a bond. Felt it, too. Haley, why don't you tell us what yours says? Well, it's so sweet. It's about how beautiful I am. Inside, it's score jewelry. Whoa. Check it out. Look at that. Your grandma love pocket watches. She said they made a man look dignified. Is this chain in case you swallow it? No. But suddenly I'm glad it's there. A lighter. What does the note say? This is a lighter. I don't understand. How much clearer could she have been? I don't really get the gift grandma left me. Well, didn't she explain it in the note? No. The notes, 4 words, you know, it opens, right? It does, sure. Look, it's Florida. Everything sticks together. My grandmother and I had a very special bond. Seriously, again, this may not make sense to everyone, but I'm pretty sure she would have loved it. This is a lighter. It belonged to my favorite actor, Paul Newman. One day he came into the restaurant where I was waitressing and accidentally left it behind. For the first time in My life. I did something I wasn't supposed to and slipped it into my pocket. One of the customers saw and said, don't worry, your secret's safe with me. That customer turned out to be the love of my life. Your grandfather. So my Alex, who I love so dearly, who's probably too much like me for her own good. Every once in a while, don't be afraid to break the rules. You never know what can happen.

Pronto encontró una cartera con monedas sueltas y dentro había una tarjeta bancaria. La mujer se sorprendió mucho. No podía creer que su marido, quien era gentil y atento todos los días, le hubiera escondido dinero a escondidas. Justo en ese momento. La familia necesitaba ese dinero urgentemente, así que fue inmediatamente al banco queriendo consultar cuánto dinero había en la tarjeta. Cuando el empleado del banco le preguntó cuál era la contraseña, la mujer se quedó helada. No sabía la contraseña en absoluto. Tuvo que entregar el DNI de su marido al empleado, pidiéndole que le ayudara a revisar el saldo. Sin embargo, el empleado se lo negó, argumentando que la consulta requería la presencia de la persona. Sin otra alternativa, la mujer tuvo que salir del banco mientras estaba perdida, no sabiendo qué hacer. De repente tuvo una idea, así que fue inmediatamente a un cajero automático y escribió la fecha de nacimiento de su marido, pero la contraseña resultó incorrecta. La mujer no se rindió. Luego escribió la fecha de su boda, pero seguía apareciendo que la contraseña era ron. Al ver que ya había perdido dos oportunidades, supo que si se equivocaba una vez más, la tarjeta bancaria se bloquearía. Se puso nerviosa al instante. Después de pensar un rato, la mujer decidió abandonar. Regresó a casa desconcertada, con la cabeza llena de dudas sobre cuál podía ser la contraseña de su marido en Ese momento su suegra se acercó con un plato de sopa de arroz y cuando supo que la nuera estaba molesta por la contraseña, le dijo que lo único que su hijo no podía dejar de pensar antes de morir era ella. Esa frase le dio inspiración instantáneamente a la mujer, así que volvió al cajero automático y y escribió su propia fecha de nacimiento. Afortunadamente, esta vez la contraseña fue correcta.

Después, rasgó el papel de un libro, lo envolvió alrededor de barro y lo pegó en el agujero para evitar que los guardias se dieran cuenta, y la tierra sobrante la arrojaba por la ventana. Después de medio año, el agujero estaba listo y ella decidió poner en marcha su plan de fuga. Un día, un jefe vino a la cárcel para inspeccionar el trabajo. Todos los prisioneros tenían que salir a hacer actividades. La mujer se había escondido en su celda todo el tiempo. Nunca había aparecido en la vista pública, así que todos la ignoraron. Esto le dio a ella la oportunidad perfecta. Todos estaban ocupados cantando y bailando y nadie se dio cuenta de que la mujer se estaba acercando al coche del oficial hasta que al mediodía, cuando era la hora de comer, un guardia masculino se dio cuenta de que la mujer había desaparecido.

Fue entonces cuando el director se dio cuenta de que la pared, que antes era muy dura, estaba tapada con un periódico.

Jack never imagined the woman he once looked down on would now be his boss's wife. Bill sensed the awkwardness. He asked if any of us knew each other. To get revenge, I hid that Jack was my ex husband and Jack did not reveal my identity because he wanted the job. We all pretended it was our first meeting. When Bill stepped away, Jack finally spoke up. When exactly you gonna destroy me? What are you talking about? I'm talking about that all my future depends on your husband. So you might. Don't worry. I'll praise you because it's not your fault, Carl. She took you away from me, destroyed our family. After I told my side, Jack breathed a sigh of relief. Then he blamed his girlfriend. He said she had seduced him. That was why he betrayed me. But I refused to listen to such excuses. You're gonna dump her tonight? What? Here in the restaurant in front of everyone? Take this glass, you're gonna tell her straight and you're gonna throw it in her face.

It's just work stuff I promise that you won't tell me about. I can't. Okay, Mandy, come on. Watching your man take a shower. Nice.

Then I acted nonchalantly as I appeared in front of everyone. I made sure my wife didn't notice anything. Next, I called my brother's girlfriend, Anna, under the pretense of needing help. I deliberately left my brother and wife outside. So how can I help you? Wait for 30 seconds. Five minutes later, I walked out of the room with Anna. At this point, the two outside still had no idea. When my brother raised his glass to celebrate, I noticed the paint on his hand. How long have you been doing this? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb with me. At this moment, my brother was still pretending to not understand anything. Unable to bear it anymore, I grabbed the table lamp and moved closer to him. Then I angrily questioned him about the paint on his hand. My brother explained that he accidentally rubbed against something on the road. I was very helpless and frustrated. I then raised my glass and drank it all in one go. I was about to reveal their dirty secret, but just as I was about to speak, I felt dizzy. Then I collapsed to the ground and passed out. When I woke up again, it was morning. My wife was standing by my bed with a cake in her hands. I suddenly sat up, remembering what had happened. I questioned my wife about what she had given me to drink, but My wife said she didn't understand what I was saying. I immediately told her about the paint on her clothes, but my wife said her clothes had been hanging there all along. I incredulously picked up the clothes and to my surprise, the paint was really gone. I then asked my wife if yesterday was my birthday. My wife said my birthday was today. I hurriedly grabbed my phone and checked the calendar and sure enough, just like my wife said. But despite that, I still felt something wasn't right. I then ran to the bathroom and made a phone call. Meanwhile, my wife and brother had already started celebrating, thinking I didn't know anything. Just as they were about to begin celebrating, the sound of someone taking photos came from behind. A man in black appeared on the screen, scaring them both. The man in black said he had taken pictures of everything and upload them to the internet. The woman, frightened, begged him not to do that, promising to give him a large sum of money. But the man in black refused the money, saying he wanted the woman to send a message admitting her infidelity to her husband in order to preserve her dignity. The woman had no choice but to do as he asked. I then clapped my hands and walked in. At this moment, the man in black also took off his mask. It turned out he was my brother's girlfriend. Everything was a carefully Designed trap. While I was in the bathroom, I was actually making a call to Anna. We already knew everything. The purpose of this was to get the woman to admit it on her own. Finally, I took out a divorce agreement. My wife would be forced to leave the marriage due to infidelity. My brother would face legal punishment for drugs.

No, no message. Bye. Bella lied to me. She never even told her aunt about the trip. I'd be alone with you. Listen, you just broke up with your boyfriend, okay. I just got in a fight with my girlfriend. We're both very vulnerable. I don't wanna do anything I'm gonna regret. Corey, sounds like you were counting on spending some time with a woman this weekend.

De inmediato se levantó y buscó cobertura, pero la francotiradora no se rindió. Disparó una bala perforante. El hombre rápido sacó su arma secreta, juntó las manos y 7 anillos dorados aparecieron de inmediato a su alrededor. Con unos simples gestos, las armas comenzaron a flotar en el aire. Unos segundos después, ensambló tres drums, se elevaron desde el techo y aceleraron hacia la montaña lejana. Al mismo tiempo, monitoreaba la posición de la francotiradora y una pantalla de vigilancia apareció frente a sus ojos. Justo cuando la francotiradora estaba por apretar el gatillo, notó que los drounds la habían fijado en la mira. El hombre lanzó su ataque. La francotiradora rápido amarró una cuerda a su cintura y disparó un clavo contra uno de los drounds con una pistola de clavos. Los drounds dispararon con precisión y las balas cayeron como lluvia. Ella esquivó con destreza, moviéndose entre las balas hasta que finalmente saltó por el acantilado. El hombre de inmediato comenzó a armar un arma pesada. Después de fijar el blanco, inició un feroz bombardeo. Esto obligó a la francotiradora a correr y escapar. Confiando en su agilidad, esquivaba la persecución de los drums.

Tell me what you did you tell me. Did you get her pregnant? You mom, please tell me. Have you got her pregnant? Please calm down. Down the stairs. Mom, I never touched her. Shut up. Shut up, Brian, you're gonna have to come with us. Mrs. Coyle, we need your permission to test your son's DNA. Do whatever you want with him. I was home when Shannon died. Mom will tell you. Sure she will. I didn't kill my sister, okay? Okay. I never slept with her, Brian. I know how tough it is. I accidentally see Shannon coming out of the shower, undressing in her. You look sick like all the girls. That's disgusting. Stop. We couldn't help you. Stop. I never touch Shannon. How could I be the father of a baby? What about your dad? You sure he's out of town? Why would he come back and not tell us? We can't have Shannon's funeral till he gets here. Mary Coile's company confirms that he's been working in Africa. So Brian is the only one who could have impregnated his sister. Elliott's got him at the me for a DNA test. No arrest until we get the results. You may have killed Shannon just because he slept with her. I can't take that to the grand jury. Susan Coile called. She said she lost her head when she tried to beat the crap out of Brian. I'm not sure I would Have reacted any different. Is there any history of previous abuse? Neighbors never even heard them talk loud. They say that Susan keeps to herself. She lives for those kids. What does Brian say? He wants to go home. Then cut him loose. He's not the only suspect. We know where Aiden and Brian were the night of the murder. Parents alibi for both of them. The parents cover for their kids. Let's find out who's lying. Start with the Connors and ask them why they didn't want Romeo and Juliet to see each other. Mrs. Connor, why didn't you want your son Aiden to go out with Shannon? Because of her mother. I've known Susan since our kids started kindergarten. We used to be friends. What happened? Well, I kept asking her when we were gonna go out together, you know, like civilized couples do. She kept making excuses about her husband being away. And I finally realized they thought they were too good for us and we were too good for them. I'm really sorry about what happened to Shannon, but my Aiden can do much better. Jason, it's the Maggie Norris. What do you think? Magnificent. How many more? Just the Dior. Oh, be a Dior and stop at the volts. Pick up my diamonds tomorrow. We're hosting the Manhattan Hospital benefit tomorrow night. I have to apologize for my wife. She's a bit of a snob. You don't agree with her about the coils, Barry Coils? Donated a lot of money to William Theodore Prep. So you've met him? Sure. Play golf with him a few times. My wife would kill me if she found out I'm a developer. He's an engineer. We had plenty to talk about. He's a very down to earth guy, really into his kids. Did you ever meet Shannon? I've met all of Aiden's friends. But you didn't know that they were dating? No, but I know my son. Forget killing his girlfriend. Okay. He wouldn't hurt a fly. Well, thanks for everything. We'll be in touch. Susan Coyle and Jason Connor were definitely having an affair. How do you know that? I'll show you. Coyle family tree. We call it a genotype. We know Shannon Speed is, should have had half its genes from Shannon and half from the father. I retested the DNA just in case the samples were contaminated, got the same results. The fetus has 62% of Shannon's genes. So it was incest? Yes. But her brother Brian's not a match. And we know that Shannon's father, Barry was gone for more than eight weeks, so it couldn't have been him. So who got Shannon pregnant? At first I thought there was another sibling that we didn't know about or the family lied about. No uncles or cousins. We checked, we couldn't find any. Then there's only one other option. The fetus has a double grandparent. What the hell does that mean? The DNA confirms it. Shannon And the guy who impregnated her have the same father. Jason Connor and Barry Coyne are the same person, which means that Aiden Connor is the father of Shannon's baby.

Al ver que el objetivo intentaba huir, el hombre mostró una sonrisa de desprecio y la siguió de cerca desde arriba. La mujer nadó lo más rápido que pudo, estaba lista para aprovechar un momento para respirar, pero fue pateada de nuevo al lago por el hombre. En ese momento, el oxígeno en los pulmones de la mujer era cada vez menor. Solo podía salir a la superficie otra vez. No esperaba recibir un fuerte golpe del hombre que la lanzó al agua. Antes de que la mujer pudiera recuperarse, el asesino la levantó e intentó estrangularla hasta la muerte. En ese momento de crisis, la mujer de repente sujetó el brazo del asesino con su pierna. El asesino gritó de dolor y la arrojó lejos en el acto. Aunque logró escapar por un instante, esa maniobra enfureció al asesino de inmediato. Desató la gran cadena de su cuerpo y sin decir palabra comenzó a atacar salvajemente sobre el lago. Por suerte, la mujer era ágil, usando su movimiento para esquivar los ataques una y otra vez, pero sabía que si seguía así, tarde o temprano moriría allí tenía que encontrar una forma de salvarse. Primero la mujer se quitó la falda, luego la empujó hacia la superficie. El asesino, al ver la prenda, la golpeó con la cadena. La mujer sujetó la Cadena bajo el agua, el asesino tiró con todas sus fuerzas y viendo que era el momento justo, la mujer saltó sobre sus hombros, enrolló la cadena alrededor de su cuello y cayó hacia el lago por inercia. La mujer pisó el hombro del asesino y tiró de la cadena con fuerza. Por más que intentaba resistir, el asesino respiraba cada vez con más dificultad. Finalmente, gracias a su ventaja en el agua, la mujer logró enviar al asesino con toda su fuerza directa al más allá.

La chica se apuró a mover la linterna al otro lado. Por suerte, cuando el ladrón la recogió, no la descubrió. Uno de los ladrones sintió que algo no estaba bien, así que encendió la luz. Esto espantó muchísimo a la chica, pero por suerte, la atención de los ladrones estaba en su jefe. Cuando irrumpieron, el jefe había sido herido por el novio de la chica. Al escuchar su conversación, la chica se dio cuenta de que había perdido a su novio y esto la dejó muy triste. Pero en ese momento, uno de los ladrones se fue a limpiar la sangre. De la planta baja. Solo quedaban el jefe y uno de sus secuaces. Cuando el hombre vio que su jefe estaba sufriendo mucho, se preparaba para buscar medidas de primeros auxilios en internet, pero accidentalmente dejó caer un bolso al suelo. La chica vio el teléfono móvil que había dentro del bolso y en un instante sintió la esperanza de pedir ayuda. Se recobró la energía, luego extendió con cuidado un palo para agarrar el bolso, pero como un extremo del palo era demasiado grueso, no pudo engancharlo. No tuvo otra opción, así que tomó una decisión atrevida. Retuvo la respiración y asomó la mitad del cuerpo desde debajo de la cama. Justo cuando se preparaba para volver a esconderse, la mano del jefe la espantó de repente. La chica abrió el bolso de inmediato y sacó el Teléfono, pero cuando se dispuso a llamar a la policía se quedó sin batería. Así, la chica perdió su única oportunidad de pedir ayuda e incluso quedó atrapada en la habitación. De esta manera, la chica pasó la noche sana y salva. Lo más importante es que se enteró de que el estado del jefe de los ladrones estaba guering peor y peor. Esto significaba que tenía oportunidad de escapar de aquí. En ese momento, el sonido estridente de un teléfono móvil rompió el silencio. La chica se dio cuenta de que la oportunidad había llegado, así que mientras uno de los ladrones se iba a buscar el teléfono, salió corriendo hacia afuera sin dudarlo. Por suerte no la descubrieron, pero ahora tenía algo más importante que hacer, así que revisó las otras habitaciones con mucho cuidado. Como esperaba, encontró a su novio atado. Justo cuando se preparaba para cortar las cuerdas, se dio cuenta de que los ladrones estaban regresando. Sí que se escondió en el baño de inmediato. Al ver a los ladrones, pensó que incluso aquí no era seguro, pero las ventanas también estaban tapiadas. Como era de esperar, un ladrón llegó al baño de todos modos, pero no la descubrió. Resulta que la chica se había escondido en la ducha con una postura muy extraña, pero en ese momento no podía aguantar mucho tiempo, solo podía rezar para que el ladrón se fuera. No pasó mucho tiempo antes de que la chica no pudiera aguantar más Pero por suerte, el ladrón se marchó justo en ese instante, justo cuando la chica se disponía a salir por la ventana, los ladrones ya se habían puesto de ojos en su novio. Esto la dejó en un dilema. Al final decidió salvar a su novio, pero si quieres ver más, la película se llama la casa del tigre

Solo de esta manera podrían rescatar rápidamente al doctor atrapado. Aunque cada segundo adicional en el hielo aumentaba el peligro. El perro confiaba en que su dueño lo traería de vuelta en cualquier momento. Cuando estaba a solo 1m de distancia, se arrastró cuidadosamente. Logró colocar la cuerda alrededor del cuerpo del doctor. Luego Maya regresó a la orilla. Jack dio la orden de que los perros trabajaran juntos. El doctor fue rescatado con éxito del agujero de hielo. En ese momento, Jack estaba al borde de la extenuación. Lo peor era que una tormenta de nieve se avecinaba. Rápidamente preparó al doctor con el equipo adecuado y lo aseguró al trineo. Jack colocó a Maya, la líder del equipo, en la parte delantera. Puso todas sus esperanzas en ella. Maya parecía entender lo que su dueño pensaba. Al recibir la orden, comenzó a guiar al equipo hacia el campamento. Frente a ellos había muchos obstáculos. Afortunadamente, el equipo de trineo llegó al campamento antes de que oscureciera. Los compañeros ayudaron a los dos a entrar en la habitación y los perros esperaban ansiosos afuera. Sin embargo, su situación no era buena. Los dedos de Jack estaban congelados y comenzaban a gangrenarse. El doctor había caído en coma. Era necesario trasladarlo a la ciudad para recibir tratamiento, pero debido a la falta de espacio en el avión, los perros tendrían que quedarse allí. Jack no estuvo de acuerdo. Mary Insistió en que volvería para salvar a los perros. Jack aceptó a regañadientes. Max parecía darse cuenta de algo. Se soltó de la cadena y corrió hacia su dueño, pero de repente fue nuevamente inmovilizado con un bozal. Jack trató de consolarlo diciéndole que pronto volverían por él. Jack despertó de nuevo tres días después. Lo primero que hizo fue preguntar por los perros, la más grave en 25 años. Ningún piloto arriesgaría su vida para salvar a esos 8 perros. Jack no podía imaginar cómo habrían sobrevivido los perros en ese frío invierno. La tormenta llegó como se esperaba. Era el cuarto día de lucha por la supervivencia de los perros. Ellos se acurrucaron esperando. Pasaron algunos días más y la hambre los estaba consumiendo. Fue entonces cuando Max vio una gaviota posada en un poste de electricidad. Max despertó emocionado a sus compañeros y con un salto se soltó de la cuerda y se lanzó hacia la gaviota. Los demás, también hambrientos, se soltaron y corrieron hacia la gaviota Maya. Sin embargo, no se movió porque tenía que cuidar al anciano Zayn. Zayn ya no podía moverse. Maya lo lamió y se despidió de él por última vez. El día 15 de su lucha por sobrevivir, un perro murió. Los perros llegaron a una colina donde encontraron una bandada de gaviotas. Max se emocionó, pero estuvo a punto de meterse en problemas. Afortunadamente, las gaviotas no volaron demasiado lejos en ese momento. Maya rápidamente organizó una estrategia. Ordenó Que todos los perros se apostaran en el lado opuesto se arrastró cuidadosamente hacia el suelo. Cuando estuvo cerca del objetivo, dio la orden. Los perros rodearon rápidamente a las gaviotas. Maya fue la primera en atacar. Logró ahuyentar a las gaviotas en la dirección opuesta. Los compañeros apostados también aparecieron a tiempo y lograron capturar algunas antes de que las gaviotas volaran lejos. A pesar de lo hambrientos que estaban, los perros no comenzaron a comer de inmediato. Pusieron la comida frente a Maya y esperaron a que ella la distribuyera durante los siguientes 50 días. Buscaron comida durante el día y se reunieron por la noche para calentarse. Vieron la Aurora boreal, pero no vieron a sus dueños. Todos los perros quedaron cautivados por la belleza de la Aurora mientras observaban cómo la luz se desvanecía. Max, el travieso, y algunos otros perros corrieron hacia ella. Maya intentó detenerlos, pero todos estaban hipnotizados por el resplandor. No se dieron cuenta del peligro bajo sus patas. De repente, Kevin cayó por la colina. Se rompió una pierna y quedó tendido en el suelo casi sin vida. Los demás perros se tumbaron sobre él para darle calor, esperando que pudiera sobrevivir esa fría noche. Sin embargo, la tormenta era implacable. Sus cuerpos pronto quedaron cubiertos por la nieve. Al día siguiente, cuando los perros despertaron, Kevin ya había cerrado los ojos para siempre. Maya, con paso pesado, fue la primera en irse, porque tenía que hacerse responsable de los compañeros Que seguían vivos. Los otros perros también fueron dejando el lugar 1x1, pero Max permaneció inmóvil. Sentía que su juego del día anterior había sido la causa de la muerte de Kevin, así que se acurrucó junto a él sin querer irse. No sabía cuánto tiempo pasó, pero la tormenta seguía intensificándose. Finalmente Max se levantó, sin embargo, en medio del viento ya no podía ver a los demás compañeros. Fue entonces cuando Max se dio cuenta de que se había quedado atrás

Solo al entrar a casa. Caminando hacia atrás se puede traer buena suerte. Sin embargo, un hombre no le prestó ninguna atención a esta tradición. Entró a su casa sin más, de manera despreocupada. En el momento exacto en que cruzó el umbral, todos los dispositivos electrónicos del pueblo comenzaron a fallar. La señal de la televisión se volvió borrosa, las bombillas parpadeaban sin Cesar y los animales en las calles se mostraban inquietos. Poco después, todo el sistema eléctrico de la región colapsó. En ese momento, los habitantes del pueblo pensaron que solo era un apagón común y corriente. Sin embargo, todos los demás dispositivos parecían seguir funcionando con normalidad. Ni siquiera los ingenieros más experimentados podían explicar lo que estaba sucediendo. A medida que caía la noche, un fenómeno rarísimo apareció en el cielo del pueblo, una colorida Aurora que no se veía en cientos de años. Poco después, la electricidad volvió a la normalidad. Sin embargo, los caballos en el establo se pusieron extremadamente nerviosos. Intentaban escapar del pueblo con desesperación. Los interruptores de electricidad también dejaron de funcionar de repente. Mientras tanto, la Aurora se fue transformando en un vórtice que rápidamente se hundió en el suelo. En ese momento, todos los habitantes del pueblo perdieron el conocimiento al mismo tiempo, cayendo uno tras otro al suelo. Cuando María terminó sus asuntos fuera de la ciudad y se preparaba para regresar al pueblo, descubrió que el lugar ya Estaba cerrado por la policía. Desesperada, trató de sortear el cordón de seguridad, pero cuando se acercó a las afueras del pueblo, vio a un grupo de personas vestidas con trajes de protección realizando algún tipo de experimento. Un miembro del equipo se amarró una cuerda de seguridad y se dirigió hacia un hombre que yacía en el césped. Sin embargo, cuando se acercó, él también perdió el conocimiento y cayó al suelo. Sus compañeros que lo sujetaban con la cuerda lo arrastraron de vuelta. Parecía que estaban utilizando este método para determinar el alcance del área afectada. En ese momento, uno de los trabajadores notó a María. Ella, desesperada por volver a ver a su hija, se dio vuelta y corrió hacia el pueblo. Pero no corrió mucho antes de que ella también perdiera el conocimiento. Solo cuando los trabajadores la arrastraron de regreso a la zona segura, María comenzó a recuperar la conciencia. La situación anómala del pueblo pronto atrajo la atención del gobierno. A la mañana siguiente, el ejército rodeó completamente el pueblo y envió helicópteros para filmar desde el aire. Sin embargo, las imágenes de las cámaras parecían estar siendo interferidas. Todo estaba nublado y no se veía nada con claridad. El comandante ordenó que el helicóptero descendiera más bajo hasta que la cámara volvió a enfocar con normalidad y, efectivamente, cuando el helicóptero bajó de altura, la cámara finalmente pudo capturar a los habitantes del pueblo, todos inconscientes, en las calles. Sin embargo, algo inesperado Ocurrió. Todo el equipo del helicóptero al mismo tiempo perdió el conocimiento. El helicóptero terminó estrellándose en el bosque. El gobierno comenzó a evacuar a los residentes cercanos, pero María insistió en quedarse en el pueblo y tuvo un fuerte enfrentamiento con los soldados. Justo cuando la situación se volvía cada vez más tensa, María recibió una llamada de su hija poco después. Otros también recibieron llamadas de personas dentro del pueblo. Mientras tanto, los habitantes del pueblo comenzaron a recuperar la conciencia. Todos los hombres parecían estar bien, como si no hubiera pasado nada. Sin embargo, todas las mujeres en edad fértil empezaron a sentir que algo extraño ocurría en sus cuerpos.

El dueño abrió la puerta, pero una bala lo alcanzó. Antes de decir una palabra, el hombre reaccionó al fin. Retrocedió dentro de la casa y encontró las dos balas que le quedaban. Las cargó rápido. Cuando el asesino empujó la puerta, él disparó. Le dio al asesino, pero no fue un tiro mortal. Su arma solo tenía una bala más, pero el asesino no lo sabía. La tensión congeló a los dos. Nadie se movió. El hombre rompió el silencio. Le dijo al asesino que se fuera, que ya había llamado a la policía. El asesino salió, pero solo para buscar un teléfono. Cuando descubrió la mentira, le exigió al hombre que entregara a la niña y prometió irse de la casa. Tras dudar un instante, el hombre Decidió protegerla. Le pidió a la niña que trajera el botiquín. El asesino encontró una botella de licor. Ambos usaron ese breve momento para atender sus heridas. Luego el hombre pidió a la niña una bombilla y una toalla. Eso enfureció al asesino. El disparo que siguió llamó la atención de un policía. Afuera, el agente llegó en su patrulla. El asesino lo vio, se puso el pasamontañas y esperó en la entrada. Después arrastró al policía herido dentro de la casa y usó su vida para amenazar al hombre. Como él no reaccionó, el asesino tomó un martillo y le rompió los dedos 1x1. Los gritos de dolor hicieron que el hombre en el piso de arriba casi se derrumbara. Él gritó que no le importaba la vida del policía. Un segundo después, todo quedó en silencio. Para estar seguro, el hombre hizo que la niña se escondiera en el baño. Él bajó con dificultad a revisar. No vio a nadie. Estaba a punto de relajarse cuando pisó unas botas. Luego escuchó pasos lentos. Viniendo de arriba, entendió que el asesino probablemente ya había subido. Fue afuera rápido y vio una escalera. En ese momento, el asesino ya estaba en la parte alta de la escalera interna, esperando que él apareciera. La niña al oír el ruido, creyó que era el hombre y preguntó su nombre

Problem is in the state of New York, the legal age of emancipation is sixteen. How old are you? 16. You know the penalty for lying about something like this is 25 years hard labor, 15 knew it, but maybe they can make an exception. Little girl, I'm not a lawyer, so even if there was an exception to be made, I'm not the guy to get it for you. Now I have got a lot of work to do and I'm sure there is someplace you are supposed to be, so I'm gonna give you to that very nice lady who was standing by the door with me and she's gonna see about getting you home. It was nice to have met you and you and do you have a name? Charlotte Kingsington, but you can call me Charlie. Hmm. Okay, Charlie, when you turn 16, if this is something you still want, come and see me. Marissa, you yelled for me. Sir, I am entrusting you to get Charlie here home safe and sound. I'll do my best. Oh, it's almost 9. What do you say we close up and go home? I would if I could. I am still trying to reach somebody to come get our little girl. What do you mean? Where is she?

Then I disguised myself as a statue in the museum. I quietly opened the control panel hidden in a book, and took control of the black robot on the floor. It slowly moved forward. I was doing all this to steal a highly valuable diamond. But there were many guards watching the diamond. If I was discovered, I would surely be shot. So I had to try to steal the diamond with the robot. Suddenly, a guard stood right in front of the robot. I tried to inch it forward, but the guard kept pacing nearby. Luckily, he got distracted by a phone call. For a moment, I moved the robot closer to the diamond. At once, this robot can transform. It climbed up along the display case. When the robot reached the diamond, I quickly clipped a 3D projector onto the nearby sculpture. The robot extended an arm to grab the diamond. The instant it took the gem, a 3D projected diamond appeared in its place. I had to get out of there fast because the projector had a fatal flaw. If someone blocked the light, the projection would be exposed. Museum staff soon noticed something was wrong. They immediately locked down the museum. By then, I had already disguised myself as a cleaner, planning to slip out with the other staff. But a police officer realized it was Sunday, and cleaners never work on Sundays. He drew his gun and Ordered me to stay where I was. I didn't stop until I was standing on a manhole cover. A squad of officers quickly surrounded me. I pretended to pull out my I D. Badge, but really I was pressing the red button at my waist. Instantly, a strong acid poured out from beneath my feet. By the time the officers realized I was the thief, the manhole cover had been corroded through. I dove into the sewer and escaped through another exit across the city.

Sorry. Uh, I thought I'd just slip in. I didn't realize the class was so small. You're late. Yeah, I couldn't find the building. It's a third class. So you're a week and 10 minutes late. What? I miss your name. It's a lip. Lip Gallagher. There is no Lip Gallagher on my class list. Right. No. Yeah, there was a slight hiccup with financial aid, but, you know, I wanted to hit the ground running for when it gets sorted out. And you're interested in critical theory and postmodern thought? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and. And also, a lot of the other classes were already full, so it was between this and environmental studies. Hippies don't use deodorant. So. Do you even know what critical theory is? Is that a trick question? You don't. Do you question everything? Yeah, that's it. And I'm not sure why things are the way they are, why they should be different. You know, if there's anything I'm good at, it's that he's a Vee calling bullshit. You've hijacked enough of the class's time. Sit and listen. Come to my office later, and I'll decide whether or not you can take my class. Sure. Yeah. Now, as I was saying before, I was interrupted. Horvath. Mr. Gallagher, this won't take long. I called financial aid, they contradicted your assertion that your Bill was a slight hiccup. They've been trying to get in touch with you. There might be some truth to That apparently, time's up. Oh, yeah. There might be some truth to that. In my mother's day, they say someone like you was being smart. My day, they just say I'm being an asshole. But an asshole that knows how to make a hell of an impression. And you look like a Sheila self portrait. What? It's a shame you're leaving school. You're a smart one. Like smart smart or asshole smart? Both. Close the door on the way out. What are you doing? Why call financial aid? I mean, why take such an interest? Well, it's my job to take an interest in my students. I'm not sure what you think you're doing, but there's a policy against fraternizing with your professors. I don't want to fraternize. I

We throw dad's ashes in the ocean and then, boom, you turn around and date another man. And now because of you, I lost the only memory of my dad's voice. Baby, calm down. I am not dating this man.

I should have known that you wouldn't do that to dad or wear an all beige outfit on a date. Well, you know what? You just have to simply think before you act. I mean, breaking into Doctor Jackson's property, splashing around in his hot tub, it's just, it's just crazy. It was bad enough that Davy's phone was broken and Her dad's voicemail had been lost in Jacuzzi water, but to hear her own mother call her crazy, that cut deep. Damn crazy, Davy. Wow, you are crazy.

I'm really worried about her. She hasn't passed urine for over 12 hours, nor have I. Doctor, what beds she in? Side room 4. Oh god, I wish there were two of me today. No one else does. Oi, oi. Who ordered the stripper? Gran. Who ordered the cunt? Good morning, Matilda. Is it only on the weekends? Ha ha. Apparently your catheter has not been putting out any urine overnight. Is he taking the piss? Are you taking the piss, mate? You drinking much? Nah. Cocktails in here is shit. I drank a jug of water overnight like they told me to. Do you mind if I have a gentle feel of your tummy? Ah, thought you'd never ask. God, what's wrong with this prick? I didn't mean that. Meant to say that to you. Sorry. Okay, your bladder is really quite distended. I'm gonna get one of the midwives to flush it through and if that doesn't do anything, we'll book in an ultrasound to check there's nothing going on inside. Did something go wrong at the cesarean? It better not have. Who's the prick now, Rob? Well, hopefully nothing, but we just need to, you know, write your catheter tubes trapped under the wheel of your bed. What would you do in this situation? So you do want my help. I've got a 19 year old in A&E who's cut her left labia half off. Abuse oversaw the edges And do as little as you can to stop it bleeding and what then proceed the next patient then probably come back to me for help with that as well. Shouldn't I refer her to psyche? Is she presenting a danger to her own life or to others? No. Does she need admission? No. It sounds pretty basic. Didn't they retrain you after your incident? It was you what that cut her vulva off? You complained about me to the GMC. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. And you're not quite there yet. Sorry. You know, I'm, I mean, I'm sorry you're having to go through all this. I know it's hard, but you can't let this stuff get to you. At least you can drown your sorrows later like it says. All welcome. Sorry to bother you. Are you on call for psychiatry today? No, I just stole their bleep. Um, Adam K, OBS and gyne, you just introducing yourself to every department. This is the person who stops people killing themselves. Um, could you possibly review a patient for me? 19 years old, just performed some cosmetic surgery on the vulva. I've got a woman who tried to jump off a bridge this morning, a student in Frank psychosis. What's this one? Another suicide attempt? Please. Even if it's just a minute. There's only one of me. I just can't. But what am I meant to tell her? Tell her to see her GP for referral To community mental health. It's just not an emergency. Since when did we only fucking see life and death emergencies in this place? You losing your shit at me isn't going to magic up any more. Doctors. Sorry, I've had a real day of it. I will see her when I get 2 seconds. Thank you.

Oh, no, we got practice tomorrow. Come on. It's Saturday practice. Just a few drills. No big deal. Trust me. Thanks for the ride last night. What? Ah, you didn't drop me off at my house. Nah, bro. Whoo. Time to buck up, Buttercup. Beat your hocks for watching. Who's that? Ah, boosters here to see what you got. Yo, I thought it was just drills. Nah, man. Skimmer's day. Whoo, whoo.

The only reason you were even at that party is because we told Layla to get you there. To what? What? Haze me, make me look bad? You got me confused with somebody else, bro? Then go back to cren Shaw. What? You say, say that again, bro. What, bro? What? Say that again, bro. I will not let you blow this one fight and you're done. Game over. Cool it. And you, you should know better than this. Oh, do not put this on me, dad, you work this whole thing up. It was all a lie. Even the guy's permit to be At the school was a lie. A lie to save yourself. Yo, Spencer, you think he cares about you? He's just trying to save his job, okay? That's, that's what matters. Enough. Not you, Jordan. You know, Jordan. Enough. Enough, Spencer. Yo, man, I quit. I'm done here. Why? Because I need your help to win a season. Look, winning is my job. You should have said that from the start.

This is your way out. Look, I'm trying to help you. I didn't ask for your help or a way out. Look, you might recall I wasn't the one knocking down Beverly's door. You came, said you'd help me get to my dream. And now that I get here, you changed my position. How is that helping? You can see the field, Spencer, in a way few players can. Look, I made a promise. Remember, I said that I would help you get to the NFL. But in order to do that, I need you to see the field from every angle because when you do, you'll be unstoppable. Look, I'm, I'm just getting to know you, okay? But I can see you playing this day. You're looking for a fight. And all your life, every bad decision you've ever made.

I was completely stunned. The mummy slowly opened the cabinet door and walked out, looking at me with an apologetic expression, saying, I'm sorry. I quickly replied, it's okay. It approached Annie and asked what had happened. Years ago while playing tennis, a ball accidentally hit Annie on the head, causing her to fall and the hat pin pierced her brain. Though Annie survived, she was left in a vegetative state. I felt immense guilt and began searching for any way to heal her. Later, I heard that the doctors of ancient Egyptian pharaohs had the power to bring people back to life. I went through countless challenges and brought back a mummy, but no matter what I did, it wouldn't wake up. Just as I was about to give up, the mummy sneezed and finally awoke. I immediately asked it to cure Annie, but it said it wasn't a doctor. Doctors were usually buried near the pharaoh and conveniently, there was a pharaoh's mummy in the nearby museum. Hearing this, I quickly took Annie to the museum. We entered the main tomb chamber and I asked every mummy if they were a doctor. All of them shook their heads. Finally, we found the Pharaoh sarcophagus. The mummy waved its hands and the stone coffin opened by itself. The pharaoh sat up look majestic. The mummy explained my request to the Pharaoh, and after understanding the Pharaoh, Ordered the doctor to treat Annie. The doctor carefully removed Annie's hat and to our shock, pulled out the hat pin. I shouted in disbelief, are you completely mad? I asked you to cure her, not kill her, you dusty bag of bones.

I were to hold it for a moment, trying to throw it back just before it exploded. But unexpectedly, next day I woke up completely unharmed. I put on the same blue shirt as yesterday, walk down the street, only to be shot dead. But the next day I came back to life again. This time I fathered a beautiful woman on the street. I fell instantly in love with her. Just as I was about to approach her, a train sped past. But it didn't matter. I die and be reborn the next day anyway. Because I was just an NPC in the game, programmed to repeat the same routine. Wake up, put on the blue shirt, drink coffee, then head to the bank for work. In this game world, those wearing sun glasses are the real players. Every own without sunglasses, like me, is an NPC. As usual, I waited for the players to rob the bank. Several thugs open fire. I was already accustomed to it, calmly and unhurriedly collapsing to the ground to chat with the security guard. Suddenly my attention is captured. I see yesterday s girl and desperately want to chase after her. I try to borrow a player's sunglasses, but get punched. But eventually I managed to grab the sunglasses. From that moment, everything changes. The sunglasses display various icons. Then a med kit appears on the ground. Only need to touch it and my wounds Heal instantly. When players fall to the ground, money appears. Grasping them increase my bank balance. So I went to the store and bought the shoes I'd always wanted. But soon my unusual behaviour caught the programmers attention. They suspected a hacker had infiltrated the program, so they entered the game, trying to eliminate me. Seeing myself being hunted, I fled desperately. In desperation, I noticed buttons on my shoes and press the switch. I leap straight to the eighth floor. But the programmers caught up fast. With nowhere left to run, I had to leap again. Unable to tolerate this, the program is tampered with the game code that has appeared between buildings. They relentlessly pursued me, but there was no path ahead. With no other choice, I plunged from the heights. I tried to grab the rope, but lost my grip. In that critical moment, I instantly selected the protective shield icon through my sunglasses. In the end, I safely evaded the pursuit.

With a casual wave of his hand, he made cars float in the air. A light swipe of his fingertip and his phone balance instantly turned to $10 million. He immediately went to the bank to withdraw the cash and gave it all to Alan. Even more impressively, his hands could instantly transform into mechanical forms.

After dealing with those researchers, I released the particles in my body. This is a fighting ghost that only Demi humans can see. Although Keta also released it in time, his combat experience was far less than mine. It was quickly shattered by me. Then I killed the last researcher and aimed the gun at Keta. To my surprise, he could release the fighting ghost for the second time. I was accidentally hit in a vital part.

Maud understood what he meant, and she knew what he wanted. But what she wanted was marriage. While Everett thought getting married was nothing but trouble and a waste of money. Still, Maud opened up about what was on her mind. Had a baby. Baby died. She was real deformed. They buried her when. When I was sleeping. She longed for a proper title, a real place in his life. But Everett remained hesitant, and so nothing happened between them that night. From that day on, though, Everett took Maud along every time he went out to deliver fish. They went together to Sandra's house to return the fish he'd forgotten last time, along with a detailed Bill. Half joking, Sandra asked if he'd messed it up again, and Maud, being thoughtful, offered to recalculate everything. But that kind gesture once again hit Everett's sensitive nerves. I am the boss. Yeah, you. I know all that. Who's in charge? You are. I bring in the money, right? Yeah, yeah. So who's in charge? Yeah, you are. Yeah, right. Don't forget it. Can't. Can't forget it. Maud was used to his prickly attitude. She knew it all came from a deep insecurity, one she herself had felt in her own life. Unexpectedly, Sandra asked if he could buy some of Maud's hand drawn cards. This time, Maud wisely let Everett make the decision. In the end, they settled on 10 Cents a piece. As they were leaving, Sandra encouraged Maud to create more artwork and said he'd happily buy whatever she made, no matter the price. On the way home, Maud felt as if she were walking through spring. It wasn't just because her art finally held value, but because she felt Everett's quiet support behind it. From then on, Maud devoted more of her time to painting, adding bright touches of color to every corner of their little house. When winter came and Maud couldn't walk far because of her feet, Everett would pull her on a small sled so she could still go out to see the snow. The man who once couldn't say a single gentle word now sanded her drawing boards until they were smooth as glass. New jars of paint appeared in the house from time to time. Everett's silent way of encouraging her art. Love, after all, was never about I know how to treat you well. It was about I'm learning how to treat you well.

Noticing the screws on the truck, he instantly thought of a way to escape. He quickly took out a coin and started turning the screw. Meanwhile, his semic carefully observed the guards. Sensing danger, they quickly lay down and pretended to be asleep. As soon as the guard looked away, the man continued his unfinished task. Soon, he managed to unscrew one bolt. Then he handed the coin to his Semite, who also successfully removed another bolt. Next, they unlocked the chains and worked together to remove the truck's back panel. Before the guards noticed, they kicked the driver's seat hard, causing the truck compartment to loosen and slide backward. However, when he saw the ground rushing past at high speed, he was terrified. But they had no chooch. With one final push, the truck compartment detached, successfully crashing onto the road heavily and sliding a long distance. Luckily, the truck kept speeding forward and the guards didn't notice a thing. But the handcuffs became a new problem. They had no choice but to carry the heavy truck bed and walk across the desert. However, before long, hunger and thirst made them faint. Rolling down from a height unexpectedly, they discovered the wreckage of a fighter jet. Seeing the parts, the man came up with a bold idea. Soon after, a land sailboat made from the aircraft appeared. With the help of strong winds, they moved forward quickly. However, at that moment, the Army was relentlessly chasing them from behind.

However, no one could have imagined that his skin full of invisibility was something he Learned behind bars. Turned out that taysuke was actually college graduate, but he had never held a respectable job. So he slipped into other people's homes every day, using their toothbrushes to brush his teeth and bathing in their bathrooms. Strangely, he had lived among these homes for years without ever being discovered, thanks to this peculiar method of occupation. Every day he rode his motorcycle through the streets, posting flyers on people's front doors. If a flyer remained untouched for three full days, it meant the house was empty. Then he would slip inside with tools to pick the lock, check the landline voicemail to find out the where about of the owner and the time they'd be returning. Once these details were confirmed, he would spend several days living comfortably in the house. However, he didn't just live off other people. Not only did he clean the house for the owner, but he also washed their dirty clothes before leaving. He even took a photo with the family. This parasitic way of living. Brought him enormous satisfaction that day. They suck.

Connie David, our son Jason. Hey, Jason, I heard you're not feeling well. What? Where am I? We're at the hospital, honey, I'm gonna listen to your chest. Alright, leave me alone. Sorry, buddy. Almost done. He's been irritable, confused. We thought he was just tired. He recently joined the soccer team. He's crazy about it, wouldn't stop playing, but then he stopped eating as much and didn't have the energy to play. Please, you gotta understand. Twelve years ago, we lost our son Axel before his first birthday. First, he wouldn't stop crying, then he got weak and then finally seizures. We had to watch our son disappear right in front of our eyes. The doctors poked and prodded him with thousands of tests. They even came out to our house to check for lead and molds. Yeah, all that. And they never figured out how to help. I'm so sorry. We've been vigilant, probably paranoid ever since. Every sniffle, every scrape, he goes to the doctor. But now this. Well, without a diagnosis, I don't want to speculate about a possible connection. I think Jason is likely dealing with an infection, but I'll make sure we're casting a wide net. Okay? Yes, please. Anything. Hang tight. We'll figure this out. Unfortunately, I can't offer any solutions yet. Jason has no signs of electrolyte imbalance, no markers for infection or any other abnormalities. By the numbers, there's nothing to explain his symptoms. You're kidding? Me? Look at him. I know this is frustrating, which is why I'd like to order a few more tests. There's always more tests. Can you at least tell us what you're looking for? Of course. Jason's symptoms still strike me as an infection, but it could be hiding, okay, in his spinal cord or his brain, which would explain the lethargy, his confusion and the kind of infection that wouldn't show up on standard tests. So I'd like to do a CT of his head and a lumbar puncture. Basically, I'd insert a needle. He's seizing. Jason. Nancy, need a hand in here? 1.5 of Adavan. Hey, Adavan's in. Hey, buddy. Jason, can you hear me okay? Can you look at me? Look at my finger. That's good. Good. Mom, Dad, it's happening again, isn't it? It's just like Axel.

Connie, David, our son, Jason. Hey, Jason. I heard you're not feeling well. What? Where am I? We're at the hospital. Honey, I'm gonna listen to your chest, all right? Leave me alone. Sorry, buddy. Almost done. He's been irritable, confused. We thought he was just tired. He recently joined the soccer team. He's crazy about it and wouldn't stop playing. But then he stopped eating as much and didn't have the energy to play. Please, you gotta understand. Twelve years ago, we lost our son Axel, before his first birthday. First he wouldn't stop crying. Then he got weak, and then finally, seizures. We had to watch our son disappear right in front of our eyes. The doctors poked and prodded him with thousands of tests. They even came out to our house to check for lead and molds. Yeah, all that, and they never figured out how to help. I'm so sorry. We've been vigilant, probably paranoid, ever since. Every sniffle, every scrape, he goes to the doctor. But now this. Well, without a diagnosis, I don't want to speculate about a possible connection. I think Jason is likely dealing with an infection. But I'll make sure we're casting a wide net, okay? Yes, please. Anything. Hang tight. We'll figure this out. Unfortunately, I can't offer any solutions yet. Jason has no signs of electrolyte imbalance, no markers for infection or any other abnormalities. By the numbers, there's nothing to explain his symptoms. You're kidding me. Look at him. I know this is frustrating, which is why I'd like to order a few more tests. There's always more tests. Can you at least tell us what you're looking for? Of course. Jason's symptoms still strike me as an infection, but it could be hiding, okay, in his spinal cord or his brain, which would explain the lethargy, his confusion, and the kind of infection that wouldn't show up on standard tests. So I'd like to do a CT of his head and a lumbar puncture. Basically, I'd insert a needle. He's seizing. Jason! Nancy, need a hand in here! 1.5 of Adavan. Hey, Adavan's in. Hey, buddy.

She has a heart disorder. You tell me a judge is, what, gonna let her ignore it? It's out of our hands now. Sorry. Great. Yeah, bye. As long as we have an automated external defibrillator on standby, you are okay to compete. Is that another doctor you're talking to? A friend who's in contact with the state's competitive committee. Sophia, you do realize the more you exert yourself, the higher the chances this happens again, which is why we're looking into precautionary measures that don't require surgery. There aren't any. I've trained my whole life for this, and I'm not about to throw it all away just because I passed out. Once, Sophia, if another arrhythmia occurs, you may not get the chance to go to the Olympics.

And Francesca's heart's been stabilized for now, but we are going to need to implant a pacemaker as soon as possible. And she has cardiomyopathy. That's what the tests show. Just like her sister. How did both of them get this? It could be a number of things, viral, genetic, environmental, like there's something in our house making them sick, mold or we can't go home. Ivy just got a new heart and link, I suggest we start with a family medical history. We'll see if there's any pattern of heart disease in the family, particularly in younger relatives. How soon can we start? What are the odds? Dealing with two cardiomyopathies on the same day. I know and you had your trial patient to think about, but Ross can handle that. No, I'm saying what are the odds presenting at the same age in two sisters? It's weird, isn't it? Really weird. Tell you what you do. The girls pacemaker stat. I'll look into the family history and we'll figure it out. Francesca's pacemaker is functioning well. And I reviewed Ivy's post op Echo and saw no signs of graft failure. Now the bad news, unfortunately, the biopsy did not show a viral cause. So what's causing this? We'd like to run more tests, maybe even have someone evaluate your home for other exposures. We have no idea. We don't know what's causing their hearts to fail. But the good news is we caught it and we're treating it.

That's that's what IV has, Dr Hutch. She went into complete heart block and lost her pulse. Remove the oxygen mask and brew her push one of apapena to give her a transcutaneous pacer on her. Now right away, doctor ID's transplant went very well. She's doing great. We'll monitor her and you can see her as soon as she wakes up. And Francesca's heart's been stabilized for now, but we are going to need to implant a pacemaker as soon as possible. And she has cardiomyopathy. That's what the tests show just like her sister. How did both of them get this? It could be a number of things, viral, genetic, environmental, like there's something in our house making them sick, mold or we can't go home. Ivy just got a new heart and link, I suggest we start with a family medical history. We'll see if there's any pattern of heart disease in the family, particularly in younger relatives. How soon can we start? What are the Odds dealing with two cardiomyopathies on the same day. I know and you had your trial patient to think about, but Ross can handle that. No, I'm saying what are the odds presenting at the same age in two sisters? It's weird, isn't it? Really weird. Tell you what you do. The girls pacemaker stat. I'll look into the family history and we'll figure it out. Francesca's pacemaker is functioning well. And I reviewed Ivy's post op Echo and saw no signs of graft failure. Now the bad news, unfortunately, the biopsy did not show a viral cause. So what's causing this? We'd like to run more tests, maybe even have someone evaluate your home for other exposures. We have no idea. We don't know what's causing their hearts to fail. But the good news is we caught it and we're treating it.

She could be you spy. For that matter, the whole family could be spies. Well, we'll know soon enough. When I was in the house, I planted audio bugs. We'll be able to hear everything. Nice.

Um, really hard to say. Just spit it out. No, get out. Yeah, just really need a lot of support right now. Okay, Casey, just tell us what's wrong. It's Amy's breath. Yeah, it's become unbearable. I would suggest that you review proper oral hygiene with her. And remember, flossing is not an option. It's a necessity. Good news, you got the laptop password and finally got the weapons distribution list. No, my new allergy medication really works. I was stuck under that couch with that cat and never actually sneeze. Amy probably isn't involved with any of this. Her parents waited Till she was upstairs to talk about us. So she he probably has no idea about the spying. Amy may be clueless, but her parents suspect that we're spies. They bugged our house and they keep mentioning someone named the mask is calling all the shots. Now that we know that our house is bugged, we can use those bugs to throw them off our track. Good thinking, Casey. Oh, thank goodness you made it out okay. I was starting to get worried. Uh, yeah, I'm gonna go make a smoothie. That blender is so loud. I'm gonna put on some nice music so we don't have to listen to that. This is one delicious smoothie. Oh, hey mom and dad, how's everything going at the accounting? Don't spare me any details. I wanna know everything.

But officials warned that it actually be a terrible idea. Thirty years after the statue arrived in America, a devastating fire at a nearby military ammunition depot caused a massive blast that severely damaged it's interior, preventing any future public access to the torch. That same year, the statue turned fully green as its original copper brown finished oxidizing. Now, less than a year before the nation's two hundred and fiftieth anniversary, some are calling for a major restoration of the statue.

Tell me where it is. No, now my boyfriend's coming over and he's gonna get that gun from me one way or another. Oh, little Marky Rosebob's gonna come over and scare me. I broke up with Marky. I'm dating Derek Fowler. He's a psycho. What happened to Marky? I loved Marky. You guys were great together, you know? Derek's gonna make you tell him where that gun is. Where are you going? I don't wanna be anywhere near here when he shows up. Well, maybe I'll just call the cop. Go ahead. Let's hope they get here first. Oh my God.

Hasn't really permeated the cultural zeitgeist. Hey, bottle baby, I'm up here! That perfectly illustrates my points. From the moment we are born, we are basically bombarded by breasts. Breasts in advertising, breasts in television, breasts in movies. Here a breast, there a breast, everywhere a breast. You're a horrible little man.

The other slaves watching was stunned, but even that couldn't ease the rage burning in me. Y'all wanna see something? The slaves around me began to look at me with admiration. I, too, had once lived like them, enslaved on the plantation. For the sake of love and freedom, I tried to escape with my wife, Broomfield, but before long, we were captured by the white overseas. Spare her from the whip. I beg them to show mercy, please. Now, ain't this what you want, to keep me in the funny, funny little John, please, I saw on the east jet. I like the way you beg, boy. But they had none. Instead, they whipped even hard as punishment. Then he sold us off separately, tearing us apart forever. On the road to being sold, a strange wagon appeared with a tooth mounted on top. The driver called himself Doctor Schultz. He stopped the slaves, asking if any of the slaves came from the Caroucan plantation. I'm from the Caroucan plantation. He asked me if I knew the brittle brothers. Of course I did. They were the nightmares that haunted my life. When Schultz knew I was the right man, he offered to buy me at a high price. The slavers grew impatient. They not only refused, they even raised their guns at him. Shultz was faster. He shot one dead instantly. Another was crushed under his horse's hoof. He was a man of principle. He left behind $125 as payment and even wrote out a receipt. Then he took me with him to Daltrey because I was a black man riding a horse. Chaos erupted in town. The proud white folks were shocked, but the bar owner was furious. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell you think you're doing, boy? Get that nigger out of here. When he failed to drive us out, he stormed out of the bar and ran to get the sheriff. Schultz stayed calm and reminded him, thank you back. Remember, get the sheriff. Stop the marshal. Soon the sheriff marched in with his rifle puffing out his chest, ordering us into the street, trying to show off his power to the whole town. You ain't got nothing better to do and to come into Bill Sharps town and show your ass. Now you can get the marshal. Moments later, the marshal and his men surrounded the bar, but shows didn't panic. He slowly reached into his coat and came out holding a wanted poster high above his head.

I need to make sure that she gets proper care. She's getting the same attention as everyone else. Respectfully, it seems to me that she is not. Hey, thank God. Dr Professor, I'm so glad you're here. Leah keeps saying her stomach hurts. How are you feeling, Mrs. Davies? Her pressure is a little low, but in the range of normal, especially after a C section. We'll be right Back. That much blood in the catheter is not normal. Dr Stuart, we have Dr Pravesh on the line who says it's urgent. Talk fast, please. I have a planned C section starting two hours late. You recall I mentioned seeing blood in Leah Davis fully. Catherine, it is worse. Significant. What's her BP? Like? 92 over 55. She seems altered, barely conscious. Even when being spoken to. She is in a lot of pain. All right, fine. Go ahead and send off a CNP, CBP and Cox. No, Leah needs a CT. Tell me you are not there. What are you implying? That you haven't listened to me or to her husband and you are not taking this case as seriously as you should? Treat all of my patients the same. I believe what I see in the, in the er, I have seen you do way more based on less information for patients that look like you. That is an offensive, that is a ridiculous accusation. Fine. Alright. It'll make you feel better. Go ahead, get a CT. I'll check in as soon as I get out of surgery if that's alright. Dr Pravesh, he ordered the CT and labs. I need you to put a rush on. A rush. Do you understand? Yes. Where are the CT results? It hasn't been done yet. I've been trying. I swear, they keep saying they're backed up. I don't have the authority to override. Why didn't you just call me? Er has a clear set of protocols, don't you? Where's your standard of care, Dr Bates? My wife needs help now.

So I've been sober from alcohol for a full year now, like a whole 365 days without touching a drop. And honestly, it's been the hardest thing I've ever done. Harder than my college finals, harder than my first breakup, harder than anything. I'd wake up some nights literally shaking because I wanted a drink so bad. But I pushed through it because I knew I had to. I told my family a few weeks before that next time we all got together, I had something big to share, something I wanted to celebrate. So we're all at my mom's house for Sunday dinner. My brother in law Greg is grill playing burgers in the backyard. The kids are running around screaming about some game they made up and us adults are just sitting at the patio table talking about random stuff. I waited for a good moment when everyone was paying attention, took a deep breath and said that I'd hit one year sober and how proud I was of myself, how much work it took, how I finally felt like myself again. My mom just went, oh, so that's what you were talking about. And my sister nodded like, yeah, has it been a year already? That was it. No congrats. No, we're proud of you. Just acknowledgement that time had passed. I'm not gonna lie, I was waiting for someone to Say they were proud of me. I know that sounds needy, but I really needed to hear it. This was the biggest thing I'd ever done. Then my sister and Greg literally looked at each other and both said, well, at the exact same time, my sister jumped in with, since everyone's here, Jordan just made the competitive gymnastics team. It took so long, but she finally did it. Greg got up super quick and went inside, came back out with this bottle of champagne they'd brought, started pouring it for everyone. When he got to me, he just froze. Our eyes met and I could see him realize what he'd just done. But my sister was already going on about Jordan's routine and the.

Today, I uncovered the horrifying reason why. I'm a historical researcher. Last month, I was hired to investigate an old property before the county demolished it, standard procedure to check for historical significance. The property was listed as Saint Michael's Orphanage, abandoned 1936. Found one newspaper article from November 1936, local orphanage closes, 47 children relocated. No details, no follow up, no records of where the children went. I drove to the property last week, deep in the woods. The building was barely standing. Rotting wood, broken windows, vines everywhere. Inside, the main floor was empty. But when I found the basement stairs, something felt wrong. The door at the bottom had a brand new padlock. Why would an abandoned building from 1936 have a new lock? I broke it off. The door opened and I smelled decay mixed with chemical. The basement had a long hallway with doors on both sides. I opened the first one. A small room, no windows, stone walls, chains bolted everywhere. Writing scratched into the stone, child sized handprints covered in something dark. Day 8:47. They still won't let us leave. 8:47 days, over two years. I checked the second room, same thing, more writing. Day one, two or three, I can't remember what the sun looks like. Every room was identical. Dozens of, all with chains, all counting days. The last room was bigger. It had a table with leather strap and a journal. The First entry was dated January 1928, written by Doctor Calloway. Experiment day one, subject Michael R. Testing new compound, observing behavioral changes. I flipped through entry after entry, different children, different experiments. Subject expired after 14 days. Internal hemorrhaging. Moving to next. Subject displays enhanced strength but lost cognitive function. Terminated. This wasn't an orphan. It was a testing facility. They were experimenting on children. The last entry was November 13th, 1936. Final experiment has failed. All 47 remaining subjects showing mutation beyond recovery. Facility must be abandoned. Subjects will be left to expire naturally. Estimated time, two to three weeks. They didn't relocate the children. They left them here to die. Then I heard scratching, something moving deeper in the basement. I called out. The scratching stopped.

Six years ago, my wife Rachel died after getting really sick out of nowhere. Like one week she had a bad cough and three weeks later she was gone. The day before she passed, he actually seemed better. The doctor said her numbers looked good and we thought maybe she'd make it. That's when she grabbed my hand and said, if I die, promise me you won't date anyone else. I literally laughed because it felt so ridiculous in that moment. I was like, okay, babe, I promise and kissed her forehead. My two daughters, Chloe and Amy, were sitting right there when she said it. They were 14 and 16 at the time. That night, everything crashed. Her organs started failing and by noon the next day, she was gone. I had to tell my girls their mom wasn't coming home. The next six years were just survival mode. I worked from home so I could be there when they got off the bus. I Learned how to braid hair from YouTube. I sat through every volleyball game and school play. I helped with college applications. Last August, I finally dropped Amy off at her dorm and drove home to an empty house for the first time in my life. I'm 45. The silence was suffocating. I've been going to these support groups for widows and widowers for about three years just to talk to people who got it earlier this year. This woman named Janet started coming. Her husband died around the same time as Rachel. We'd grab coffee after meeting sometimes and just talk. Nothing romantic at first, just two people who understood what it felt like to lose everything. Then in September, we went to dinner, then again in October. By November, I realized I actually liked her, like really liked her. We kept it quiet because I wasn't ready to tell my girls yet. I figured I'd wait until Thanksgiving when they were both home. Except last week we went to this Italian place downtown and our waiter was this kid named Trevor who graduated with Chloe. I didn't even notice him until Janet and I were leaving. He definitely noticed us, though, because that night my phone exploded. Chloe called me screaming, actually screaming. She said Trevor texted her a photo of me and Janet holding hands at the table. She said I was disgusting, that I was cheating on mom, that mom literally made me promise not to date and I couldn't even respect her dying wish. She, she said I was spitting on her grave and she didn't want to see me at Thanksgiving. I tried to explain, but she just kept yelling over me. So I hung up. I texted her that we'd talk when she calmed down, but she left me on read.

My mother stood up at Thanksgiving and gave a toast about how she sacrificed everything to raise five children on her own. My siblings all raised their glasses. My brother Donovan looked at me and said, you could at least pretend to appreciate our mother for once. I looked around the table at my four siblings and wondered if any of them actually remembered our childhood. I was 11 years old when I became a mother to four children. My father left, and my mother checked out completely. She'd stay in her bedroom for days at a time, and I'd slide food under her door, hoping she'd eat. I Learned to forge her signature in sixth grade because she wouldn't get out of bed to sign permission slips. I worked at a grocery store at 15 and lied about my age so I could buy food when her disability checks ran. Now I got a full scholarship to a college three hours away and turned it down because I couldn't leave my siblings alone with her. I missed my own prom because my youngest brother had pneumonia and no one else was going to take him to the emergency room. I raised four children before I turned 18, and none of them remember. They remember mom being sad. They remember mom being tired. They don't remember that I was the one who made sure they ate and bathed and Got to school and had clean. They don't remember me staying up until two in the morning helping with homework while mom slept in the next room. They don't remember me walking three miles to the pharmacy when Vera had an ear infection because mom wouldn't get out of bed and we didn't have a car. Now we're all adults, and I'm still doing it. I coordinate every holiday and every birthday. I babysit all nine of their kids on a rotating schedule that I manage. I covered Donovan's mortgage.

My mother stood up at Thanksgiving and gave a toast about how she sacrificed everything to raise five children on her own. My siblings all raised their glasses. My brother Donovan looked at me and said, you could at least pretend to appreciate our mother for once. I looked around the table at my four siblings and wondered if any of them actually remembered our childhood. I was 11 years old when I became a mother to four children. My father left and my mother checked out completely. She'd stay in her bedroom for days at a time, and I'd slide food under her door hoping she'd eat. I Learned to forge her signature in sixth grade because she wouldn't get out of bed to sign permission slips. I worked at a grocery store at 15 and lied about my age so I could buy food when her disability checks ran. Now, I got a full scholarship to a college three hours away and turned it down because I couldn't leave my siblings alone with her. I missed my own prom because my youngest brother had pneumonia and no one else was going to take him to the emergency room. I raised four children before I turned 18, and none of them remember. They remember mom being sad. They remember mom being tired. They don't remember that I was the one who made sure they ate and bathed and Got to school and had clean. They don't remember me staying up until 2 in the morning helping with homework while mom slept in the next room. They don't remember me walking three miles to the pharmacy when Vera had an ear infection because mom wouldn't get out of bed and we didn't have a car. Now we're all adults and I'm still doing it. I coordinate every holiday and every birthday. I babysit all nine of their kids on a rotating schedule that I manage. I covered Donovan's mortgage for three months when he got laid off. I paid for my sister Blyth's wedding when mom couldn't contribute a dime. I talked my brother Nico through every crisis in his marriage. And I've driven two hours in the middle of the night more than once to pick up my sister Vera from situations she couldn't handle. I do all of this while working 60 hours a week and.

On Friday afternoon, we went to City Hall with just Amy's dad, her sister and brother in law, her brother and his fiance and my best friend and his wife. The ceremony took 10 minutes. We signed the papers, set our vows and it was done. That night, we all went to a restaurant nearby and had dinner. Everyone wore regular clothes they already owned. We took some photos and just enjoyed being together. No drama, no demands, just celebrating. Amy and I spent Saturday together as a married couple and went back to work today. We didn't post anything on social media or tell anyone else. My parents found out on Sunday when my mom called to discuss wedding plans. I told her we already got married and she started screaming. She said I ruined Katie's life and that I was a horrible brother. Katie has been blowing up my phone with texts about how I betrayed her and made her dysphoria spiral out of control.

She has this thing called rejection sensitive dysphoria, where she takes everything super personally and thinks everyone is leaving her out on purpose.

I have this terrible habit of doing everything last minute. And I mean everything. Homework done during lunch, project night before, studying for tests. What's studying? I just walk in, pray, and somehow scrape by with a C plus. My parents hated it. Teachers would literally beg me to just try for once, but honestly, it kept working. So why change? Then 8th grade hits, and they announce the big one. This massive final exam that decides if you even move on to high school. Like, fail this, you're repeating the entire year. Hello? Everyone in my grade was panicking. Kids were making study schedules three weeks out, forming study groups, buying practice book. My friend Terrell, dude made flashcards. Physical flashcard in 2024. I'm talking color coded, laminated, organized by subject. Like he was preparing for the SATs. Meanwhile, I'm over here telling myself, yeah, I'll study. I got time. Week before the exam, I discovered this new show. Binge the entire thing in three days. Two days before, my cousin wanted to play basketball all afternoon. Did I say no? Absolutely not. We were out there for hours. I came home sweaty, exhausted, and still haven't cracked open a single notebook. The night before, I'm sitting at my desk, notes stacked up, textbooks open, highlighters ready. I'm ready to lock in. Then I remembered I was stuck on this one level in my game. Just one level. I told Myself. One level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2:00am, I'm half asleep, and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. I went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning, I dragged myself to school, running on four hours of sleep. And vibe. Literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom, and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flashcards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. I open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing. Science. Picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully, because there's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in, and my teacher just looked at me disappointed. Headshake that says I'm not even surprised. I went home fully prepared to tell my parents I'm staying in middle school another year, already planning my excuse, my apology speech, the whole thing. Two weeks later, grades drop online. I'm sitting there on my phone, terrified to even look. Heart Pounding palm sweaty, I slowly scrolled to my name, closed my eyes, opened them, saw 84% and 84. I passed. Not only passed, but got a whole B. I just sat there staring at my screen like it was lying to me. The reliable last minute method worked once again.

And in the middle of court, her own daughter stood up and said, this is why I don't have any friends. My daughter came home from a birthday party glowing. She was 9 years old and wouldn't stop talking. Mom, this girl's so cool. I can't believe we never talked before. The birthday girl was a quiet kid at school, didn't have any friends. I don't understand why nobody wants to be friends with her. She's literally the coolest person ever. My daughter was bouncing around the kitchen. We're best friends now. Can she come over? Can we have a sleepover? I smiled. It was sweet. My daughter had made a real connection. Two weeks later, I got a letter in the mail, certified official looking. I opened it. It was a lawsuit for $350 plus $200 for emotional distress from the birthday girl's mother. I stared at the paper, reading it three times. There was an itemized list. Couch usage, $12. Defendant's daughter sat on the living room couch for 2.5 hours causing premature wear. Beverage consumption, $8. Two juice boxes. Food consumption, $15. Snack consumption, $10. Bathroom facilities, $18. Including $2 for toilet paper, estimated 24 sheets. My hands were shaking from disbelief. Then the letter changed tone. Additionally, your daughter used items belong to my daughter and my daughter demands compensation. I felt my chest tighten. Tea set usage, $20. Dollhouse furniture, $30. Personal tissue box usage, $15. The letter ended, my daughter feels violated and demands compensation. Pay within 10 days or see you in court. I sat down, read it again. My daughter came into the kitchen. What's wrong? I showed her the letter, kept it simple. The birthday girl's mom is upset that you went to the party. Her face fell. What? Why? I don't know, sweetie. The next day at school, my daughter tried to talk to the girl, but the girl wouldn't even look at her, just walked away. My daughter came home confused. I guess I understand now. She looked down. Why? She doesn't have friends. I sent one response to the letter, see you in court. 6 weeks later, the court date arrived, small claims court. The judge looked bored. The woman stood up. She had bags, multiple bags. She started pulling things out. She brought the couch cushions, leftover birthday cake in a Tupperware container, empty juice boxes. Your honor, as you can see, this child caused significant damage to my home. She.

Now, your grandpa did train us, sweetheart, he said. And yeah, he grounded us plenty when we messed up. Lily's eyes went wide. Really?

That's me doing push UPS in the MUD at 3 in the morning, 200 of them, as your grandpa caught me sleeping on watch when I was supposed to be guarding the base. He pointed at a figure standing over the guy in the photo. See him? That's your grandpa. And yeah, I was very, very grounded that day. Lily studied the photo seriously, then looked up at him. Did you learn your lesson? I did. Never fell asleep on duty again. Good, Lily said, nodding like a tiny judge. Another veteran stepped forward. He grounded me for a week. Once made me clean every single rifle in the armory because I showed up late to formation. Then another, he grounded me by making me memorize the entire military Code of conduct, 200 pages. Then another. He grounded our whole unit once we had to run 15 miles in full gear because somebody left trash on the training field. They kept coming, one after another, sharing their stories. Every single one of them smile, milling through tears. Lily stood there taking it all in, clearly proud that she'd been right about the grounding thing. The old guy stood back up, looked at my sister, and his voice changed, got quieter, more serious. Your father was the toughest drill instructor I ever had. Scared the hell out of all of us. He paused, but he's also the reason I'm alive. We all are, every person here. He trained us so hard because he wanted us to come home. He turned back toward the casket, stood at attention and gave a slow, perfect salute. Then he looked down at Lily one more time. You tell people your grandpa grounded soldiers. That's exactly what he did. And we loved him for it. Lily held on to that story for years.

I started going through old emails on the family computer. My mom had been researching single car accidents, brake line failures and something called widows benefits the past six months. Thursday morning, I went to my dad's office and told him everything I'd found. He didn't believe me at first, but then I showed him the search history, the messages I'd screenshotted. We went to the police. They said they couldn't do anything based on internet searches and text messages. Lots of people research morbid things. Doesn't mean they're planning murder. But my dad was scared. He stayed at a hotel Thursday night instead of going home. I stayed with my best friend, Sarah. At 2 a. M, my phone rang. It was my mom. Where's your father? Her voice was shaking. He was supposed to be home hours ago. He's safe, I said. Away from you. The line went silent. Then she said something that made my blood freeze. You don't understand what you've done. Marcus needed that money. We're in debt to some very dangerous people. She hung up. Friday morning, my dad and I went back to the police with the recording of that call. This time, they listened. They told us to stay away from the house while they investigated. Six hours later, they called. They'd found Marcus at our house with bags of my dad's clothes, staged a car in the Garage. The car was running. He'd been planning to make it look like my dad had taken his own life. My mom was arrested as an accessory. Turns out Marcus had a gambling problem and owed over $300,000 to loan sharks.

Maya, does dad know? She nods. Daddy brings them food sometimes, he says. They're helping our family. My father, my father. Their nose. I pull out my phone, dial 9, 1, 1. But Maya screams and slaps it out of my hand. No, mom said if anyone calls the police, they'll take me away. She said I'd go to a bad place where kids get hurt. I'm shaking. Maya, that's not true. Keys jingle at the front door. We both freeze. Girls, I'm home. Maya is crying now, terrified. Please don't tell. Please. I'll be good. I'll never show anyone again. Mom's footsteps echo through the kitchen, getting closer. I have seconds. I text my boyfriend. Call police to my address. Now mom holding people. Send help. Hit send, delete the message. Pick up my phone like nothing happened. Mom appears in the doorway, shopping bags in hand. Her smile doesn't reach her eyes. What are you two doing back here? Maya runs to her. Nothing. Mommy just playing. Mom's eyes lock on mine. She knows somehow. She knows. Sweetie, why don't you go start your homework, mom says to Maya. Voice, sugar, sweet. I need to talk to your sister. Maya scurries upstairs. Mom sets down the bag slowly. You went outside. It's not a question. I don't know what you're talking about. She steps closer. Maya showed you. My back hits the wall. Mom, I've given you everything. Private tutoring, a car, college savings. Do you know what that costs? You're keeping people prisoner. I'm providing opportunity. Her voice is calm, ice cold. Those people had nothing, no papers, no future. I give them work, shelter, food. They're better off here than on the streets. You lock them in a shed. I protect them and this family. Sirens distant but growing louder. Mom's face goes white. What did you do? The sirens are close now, right outside. She grabs my arm, desperate. You've destroyed everything. They'll take Maya. They'll take you. We'll lose the house. Red and blue lights flood through the windows. Mom's grip titans. Why couldn't you just stay quiet? Police found Carmen and the man locked inside. Both were undocumented immigrants mom had hired through a cleaning service, then imprisoned. Rose's body was discovered buried near the shed. Mom and dad are awaiting trial. Maya's with my aunt. I testified against them both.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how eager my mom had been for me to choose, how she kept pushing Friday as the deadline, how Marcus had already moved boxes into her car. I started going through old emails on the family computer. My mom had been researching single car accidents, break line failures and something called widows benefits for the past six months. Thursday morning, I went to my dad's office and told him everything I'd found. He didn't believe me at first, but then I showed him the search history, the messages I'd screenshotted. We went to the police. They said they couldn't do anything based on internet searches and text messages. Lots of people research morbid things. Doesn't mean they're planning murder. But my dad was scared. He stayed at a hotel Thursday night instead of going home. I stayed with my best friend, Sarah. At 2 a. M, my phone rang. It was my mom. Where's your father? Her voice was shaking. He was supposed to be home hours ago. He's safe, I said. Away from you. The line went silent. Then she said something that made my blood freeze. You don't understand what you've done. Marcus needed that money. We're in debt to some very dangerous people. She hung up. Friday morning, my dad and I went back to the police with the recording of that call. This time they listened. They told us to stay. Away from the house while they investigated. Six hours later, they called. They'd found Marcus at our house with bags of my dad's clothes, staged a car in the garage. The car was running. He'd been planning to make it look like my dad had taken his own life. My mom was arrested as an accessory. Turns out Marcus had a gambling problem and owed over $300,000 to loan sharks. The life insurance policy was for $500,000. They'd plan the whole divorce as a cover story. I'm 18 now, living with my dad in a new city. My mom took a plea deal and got seven years. Marcus got 15.

I froze mid scoop. What are you talking about? She didn't even look up from her phone. Your dad and I are getting divorced. We're selling the house. You have until Friday to decide who you want to live with. I was 17. They've been fighting for months, but I didn't think it was this bad. That night, I tried talking to my dad. He was in the garage packing boxes. Dad, what's going on? He finally stopped and looked at me. Your mom and I agreed. You're old enough to choose. No pressure. But there was pressure. My mom kept making comments about how Dad's new apartment was smaller. My dad mentioned Mom's boyfriend was moving in next month. Wait, boyfriend? Yeah, dad said, not meeting my eyes. Marcus. They met at her office. I felt sick. How long does it matter? He went back to packing. Next day, I confronted my mom. She was in her bedroom sorting through old photos and I noticed she was only keeping the ones without my dad in them. Marcus and I have been together for 4 months, she admitted. But your father knew we were already separated emotionally. Four months. The house went up for sale six months ago. Her face changed. Your father told you that? That's when I found the real estate listing on her laptop. She listed The house eight months ago before the fights even started. I went back to my dad that night. When did you actually find out about Marcus? He was silent for a long time. Then he pulled out his phone and showed me a text. Red. My mom had been planning to leave for over a year. The messages went back to when I was 16. But it got worse. There was a message from my mom to Marcus that, just need to wait until the life insurance policy matures in November. Then we can be together. My blood went cold. Dad, what life insurance policy? His face went pale. I took one out three years ago. Your mom's the beneficiary. It matures next week. Friday, I whispered. The same day they wanted me to choose the same.

I drove six hours straight and found her starving in a storage closet. In high school, I sold vapes to freshmen and thought fear meant respect. Then I got this girl I was seeing pregnant, spent about four months playing house before I came home drunk one night and she went off saying, you're a loser who will never be a good dad. We'd be better off with you dead. So I drove her to her mom's house and left town. I've been sending her about 500 to 1,000 dollars every month for our daughter working construction 12 hours away. My mom lives near them and was the one who suggested I just live my own life. She checks in on them for me, handles the money, even has my daughter Facetime me once a month. My daughter is always smiling and my mom keeps saying everything's great, so I believe it. At 2:00am, my phone rings. My daughter's voice is on the other end, tiny and terrified. Mommy's gone and I'm hungry and I don't know what to do. I'm already grabbing keys as I tell her, baby, I'm coming right now. Where's Mommy? The line goes dead. I call back voicemail, call my ex voicemail, call my mom voicemail. I'm doing 90 on the highway and nobody's answering. Six hours later, I burst through my ex's unlocked door and the smell hits me. First, rotting food mixed with chemicals. Find my daughter in a glorified storage closet on a bare mattress with springs poking through, covered in dried filth, her face so thin I can see her skull. You came, she whispered. I scoop her up and she weighs like nothing, like holding bones wrapped in skin. I carry her to the bathroom, but there's black mold in the tub and no clean towels, so I use my shirt and bottled water from my truck. Then I see the padlocked bedroom door. I kick it open. Inside is a red room with cameras on tripods, ring lights and piles of costumes. My ex told me she was making YouTube movie reactions, not doing cam work, all while my daughter starves in the next room. I scoop up my daughter and drive to the nearest hospital. Her little body limp in my arms. The er doctor hooks her to IV.

I have this two bedroom apartment downtown that I rent, and honestly, I love it. My brother Austin has crashed in my guest room probably 20 times over the past few years. He respects my space, always cleans up after himself, never makes a mess. So when he texted me asking if he and his new girlfriend could stay the weekend while they visited the city, I said sure without even thinking about it. The girlfriend's name was Tori. I hadn't met her yet, but Austin seemed really into her, so I figured she'd be cool. Friday night rolls around and they show up at my door around six. Tori walks in and immediately starts looking around my apartment like she's inspecting it. She opens my coat closet, peeks into my bathroom, even checks out my kitchen cabinets. I thought maybe she was just being curious, but it felt weird. Austin suggested we go grab dinner at this Italian place down the street. Nothing fancy, but they have really good pasta and the bread is amazing. We get seated and everything seems fine at first. We're looking at menus, and Tori asks what I do for work. I tell her I'm a graphic designer, and she nods but doesn't really say anything back. Our waiter brings bread to the table, and Tori just starts talking. She goes, so you rent this apartment? Right? I'm like, yeah, been there for three years. And she literally laughs and says, oh, so you're one of those people who just throws money away every month? I genuinely thought she was joking, so I laughed a little, but she keeps going. She says renting is basically the most financially irresponsible thing a person can do, and that people who rent are the reason they'll never build any real wealth. Try to explain that I like the flexibility, since my job might relocate me in the next couple years, and I don't want to be stuck with a mortgage. She just rolls her eyes. Then she says, well, maybe if you didn't waste so much money eating out at restaurants, you could actually afford a down payment on a house. Austin's face goes completely red, and he tells her to drop it, but Tori won't stop. She starts going off about how people like me are part of the reason the economy is messed up, because we don't prioritize homeownership and we just live these irresponsible lifestyles. At this point, I'm done being polite. I tell her straight up that she's being rude and condescending and that my financial choices are none of her business. She looks shocked, like she can't believe I'm calling her out. The waiter brings our food, and we eat in complete silence. Austin tries to make small talk, but it's so awkward that he gives up after like two minutes. We finish eating And head back to my apartment. As soon as we walk in, I pull Austin aside into my bedroom and tell him I don't feel comfortable having Tori stay in my home anymore. He tries to apologize for her and says she didn't mean it the way it came out, but I'm not budging. I tell him he's welcome to stay, but Tori needs to find somewhere else to sleep. Apparently, Tori was standing right outside my bedroom door because she bursts in and starts yelling at me. She says I'm being overly sensitive and dramatic and that she was just trying

No greeting or explanation. And he didn't even look back. He just hurried down the stairs like he didn't want to be seen talking to me. I had only been heading out for work. Why did he say it? Like a warning? Like he knew something I didn't. On the next floor down, Missus Grant was watering her plants. She glanced up when she heard me, and the second she recognized me, her face softened with something like pity. She whispered, oh, sweetheart, then stepped inside her apartment, closing the door without explanation. In the lobby, two teenagers who usually hung out on the stairs went silent as soon as I approached. One nudge, the other shaking his head. Their eyes followed me like they expected I might break. Everyone knew something, everyone except me. My head thudded painfully as I took out my phone and called my sister. She answered immediately. Where are you? Her voice was sharp. Just leaving my apartment. Why? She inhaled sharply. Don't go anywhere. Don't leave. Why not? Another breath. Then softly. You didn't see it. See what? The line went dead. I wasn't just confused anymore. I was scared. I walked fast to my car, glancing around like something might jump out at me. My keys shook in my hand as I started the engine. I couldn't stay still, so I drove. I didn't know where I was heading, yet just away from the staring eyes, away from unanswered question. At the first red light, my phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. Don't let them talk you into feeling safe. I tossed my phone aside and didn't reply. When the light changed, I had toward my sister's workplace. She always told me everything. If she wasn't telling me now, it meant whatever this was, it was big. Halfway there, a news alert flashed on my phone. I didn't open it while driving, especially not with my hands already trembling. But I saw just enough of the headline to feel my breath catch. Community on edge. After early morning. The rest vanished as the notification disappeared. But my mind raced. Community on edge. My community. But why? When I reached my sister's office, I parked and ran inside.

Where is it? My older brother Garrett's voice rang through the semi empty house, startling me into dropping some cereal on the floor. I let out a low curse as I began mopping up the food off the floor. Garrett leaped down the stairs and stormed toward me, his face twisted with rage. It confused me because he never had an attitude with me. Why was he suddenly so angry? He grabbed the front of my shirt and dragged me to my feet, shaking violently. My phone, he growled. Where is it? I stared at him with wide eyes before laughing uneasily. Seriously, all this because you misplaced your phone? Let me go. You probably just dropped it off your bed or something. I was proud of my voice for not shaking. Garrett always had a temper, but it wasn't normally directed at me. He was always my protector, not my attacker. He didn't release me as his breathing grew deeper and more ragged and dad entered the room with a frown on his face. What is going on? He demanded. Garrett, let your brother go. Garrett shook his head stubbornly. He stole my phone, he snapped. I'm not letting him go until he coughs it up. Dad turned his disapproving look on me. Give it back, he ordered coldly. I don't have it, I screeched, struggling to get out of Garrett's hold. I didn't take it, Garrett. Yanked me forward and leaned his face down to hover above mine. I know you took it, little twerp, he hissed. Just give it back. My heart raced in my chest as I began to shake with adrenaline. This couldn't be happening. Garrett and I used to be best friends. He was only two years older than me, so we were practically inseparable. We played together, went to school together, work together and had each other's backs. I didn't understand why he suddenly thought I was capable of stealing from him. Garrett suddenly picked me up by the front of the shirt and slammed me down on the kitchen table. I squeaked in pain as I tried to get away from him. Dad said nothing to stop Garrett from hurting me. Instead, he stood back with his arms folded across his chest and a stony expression on his face. Mom came running into the room a minute later. What's going on?

My daughter Ava, was 22 when she asked if she could bring her boyfriend, Tyrone, over for dinner. It was her first boyfriend ever, and I was extremely excited to meet him. I'd always promised myself I'd judge boyfriends based on character, not background or wealth. And I trusted Ava to bring home someone respectful. So I spent the whole afternoon preparing the house, grilling steaks and practicing my dad jokes in the mirror because I wanted to make a good impression on her potential future husband. And at two PM, the doorbell rang. I opened the door with a huge smile on my face, excited to see who Ava was with. But as soon as I saw her boyfriend, Tyrone, my happiness was immediately drained. This man had a teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a tattoo that read Death Before Dishonour written across his neck in Gothic letters. His pants were sagging so low I could see his dollar store underwear with mysterious brown stains. The smell of weed practically made my eyes water. I expected Tyrone to at least reach out his hand for me to shake, but no. Instead, he looked me up and down and said the words, it's good old head. I looked at Ava and she had a smile on her face. She was completely oblivious to the fact that her boyfriend was a walking red flag. I Tried to stay polite and invited him inside, telling myself that I was being judgmental, like maybe he had a rough upbringing and was never taught manners or something. But during dinner, Tyrone took three different calls on speaker phone right at my table. I heard him say things like, yeah, Emma, collect the baggies tonight at 3:00am when cops won't be around to see. My hands were shaking with anger, but I kept my mouth shut and waited until Tyrone went to the bathroom to say something to Ava. This man is dangerous and you need to end this, I said, trying to keep my voice quiet. She got defensive immediately, crossing her arms like she used to when she was 5. You're just being judgmental. He's misunderstood. You literally said you'd accept whoever I choose to love. She was so determined to prove she was a grown up that she was ignoring every red flag. That's when I decided if she wanted to date a ghetto rat, then so would I the next Sunday.

When I tried to help two weeks later, I was the only one who could save the two million dollar deal. I'm 24 and work as an executive assistant at a tech startup called Data Bridge. I have a computer science degree from a good state university, but I graduated right into a massive tech hiring freeze and desperately needed income. The plan was to get my foot in the door, then transition to engineering within six months. That was nine months ago. My boss, Marcus, is 38 and runs the engineering division. From day one, he's introduced me to people as just my assistant. At company events, he makes jokes about how I couldn't hack it as a real engineer. So now I schedule meetings and order lunch. The dev team treats me like furniture unless they need something administrative. Three weeks ago, during a board meeting with potential investors, Marcus was presenting our authentication system. I was taking notes in the corner. He started explaining our security protocol completely wrong, mixing up encryption methods in a way that made us sound like amateurs. I quietly said, actually, we're using RSA2048, not AES for the key exchange. The room went silent. Marcus's face turned bright red. Stick scheduling, please. This is technical work. The investor shifted uncomfortably. I didn't say another word the rest of the meeting. The worst part is the dev team's Slack workspace. They have a channel called number sign Not for admin, where they discuss all their architecture decisions, can see in the sidebar that I'm specifically excluded from it. Sometimes they reference conversations from that channel in the general workspace and I just have to pretend I don't notice. But here's what none of them know. I have access to the company Gethub repository because I need it to manage documentation and user permissions. For the past 9 months, I've been reviewing their entire code base at night after everyone leaves. And honestly, it's a disaster. Critical bugs everywhere. Race conditions in the API handlers, database queries with no proper indexing. Their authentication flow has a vulnerability that could those user data. I've even built a side project at home using their exact text app, specifically fixing the scaling problems I knew they'd eventually hit. Two weeks ago, the company landed a massive demo with a potential client worth 2 million in annual recurring revenue. During the preparation meeting, I asked a basic question about their load testing results. Marcus didn't even let me finish. This is engineering work. You wouldn't understand the technical details. Three developers actually smirked at me. Then 48 hours before the demo at six PM on a Thursday, the entire production system crashed. Not running slow, completely down dead.

She could have more children, but I might never save my house. So your house was more important than your niece's well being? The jury deliberated under two hours. Guilty on all charges. Judge Bennetten was merciless. This represents one of the most callous acts of child endangerment I've seen in 20 years. The defendants use their granddaughter as a pawn. Being family makes their actions more reprehensible, not less. Dad got 24 months in prison. Mom got 20 months. Both ordered to pay Stella's therapy costs and came the four year restraining order. Any contact will result in additional criminal charges. Moline screamed from the gallery. They're her grandparents. The judge looked at my parents. You destroyed this relationship through your own choices. You have no one to blame but yourselves. The fallout continued. Moline lost her house to foreclosure anyway. Her marriage fell. Apart, they're now separated and filing for divorce. My parents burned through retirement savings on legal fees. Dad took early retirement. Mom lost her daycare job. Parents didn't want someone convicted of child abandonment near their kids. The ultimate irony, they're selling their own house. They destroyed their lives trying to save Moline's house and lost their own. Meanwhile, Stella is healing. I got a promotion. My boss said my strength impressed the company. Stella's college fund is thriving. They thought they were teaching me about family priorities. Instead, they taught me that real family doesn't abandon you or use children as weapons. The judge's verdict was brutal for them, but for us, it was liberation. Sometimes justice is the best revenge of all.

I'm 34 and Sarah died four years ago from leukemia. The diagnosis came 11 months after our second daughter was born. She fought for 19 months, left me with two daughters, Mia, 9, and Lily, for 18 months. After Sarah died, I was a shell. I'd find myself standing in the kitchen at 2:00am with no memory of getting there, couldn't look at family photos, couldn't sleep in our bed. I rotated between the couch and Mia's floor. My mom moved in after I forgot to feed the kids dinner three nights in a row. She'd find expired milk in the fridge and Mia making cereal for Lily. At 7 years old, the girls kept Sarah's side of the closet exactly how she left it. Sometimes I'd catch Lily sitting in there holding Sarah's favorite cardigan. Mia started sleeping with Sarah's old college sweatshirt. They'd ask me questions I couldn't answer. Does mama know I lost my first tooth? Can Mama see us from heaven? I was drowning. Until my mom forced me into a grief counseling group, too. Two years ago, that's where I met Rachel. She'd lost her fiance in a car accident six months before Sarah died. She was the only person who didn't say time heals everything or she's in a better place now. She just said, some days I forget he's gone for five minutes. Then I remember and it feels like dying all over again. We started meeting For coffee after sessions. Nothing romantic, just two broken people who understood why holidays felt like land mines and why grocery shopping could trigger panic attacks. She got it when I said I felt guilty laughing at a movie. She didn't judge me for still wearing my wedding ring. Eight months later, she texted me at eleven PM, bad night. Can't stop crying. I drove to her apartment with two pints of ice cream. We talked until 4:00am about the people we lost, the futures that died with him, the guilt of wanting to be happy again. We started dating a year ago. Slow, careful, I told the girls. After 3 months, Lily asked if Rachel was replacing Mama. I said no one could ever replace mama, but Rachel makes daddy feel less sad. Mia hugged Rachel and said Mama would want daddy to be happy. Rachel's been amazing with him. She reads the same bedtime stories Sarah used to does. The voice is exactly right.

With a reaction like that, what else could it possibly be? People started organizing, seriously organizing. Mallory created a shared Google DOC for funeral car pools. Samantha set up comfort shifts so someone would always be available to sit with Brielle. We had a rotation schedule and everything. I couldn't stand the girl. But even I signed up for two shifts because whatever happened, it had to be devil astounding. Before the concert started, Mister Ford gathered us in a circle. We all held hands and he LED a prayer for Brielle and her family, a full prayer at a public school. Nobody said a word about separation of church and state because we were all just worried. The concert was awful. Nobody could focus. We missed cues, forgot entrances. Mister for didn't even care. Monday came, Brielle wasn't at school. Tuesday, nothing. Wednesday, still absent. People started asking if we should send flowers to her house or if that was too soon. Someone suggested a meal train. Then Thursday morning, Samantha came running up to our lunch table. She'd been friends with Brielle's younger sister on Instagram. You guys, she said, breathless. You guys, I figured out what happened. We all leaned in. Her sister got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Silence. That's it. Someone finally asked. That's it. The mom called her at the concert because they wanted to skip it and meet with the doctor that same night. The appointment was scheduled for seven PM Not hospitalized, not emergency surgery, not dying. A scheduled appointment to discuss a completely manageable medical condition. The reaction was immediate. People were pissed. We'd organized car pools to a funeral that didn't exist. Some kids had cried themselves to sleep. We'd rearranged our entire schedules for comfort shifts. Brielle came back to school the following Monday like nothing had happened. We wouldn't talk about it. Just said it was too painful to discuss. By lunch, someone had leaked the diabetes diagnosis in the group chat. Brielle got absolutely roasted, not bullied, just called out. People asking her why she screamed like that over diabetes, asking her if she understood what actual tragedy looked like. She switched school fools three weeks later. Her sister, by the way, is completely fine, plays varsity soccer now. Mister Ford still brings up that concert every year as a lesson in keeping perspective during actual emergencies.

We're right here. Dad's hands curled into fists. The next morning, dad called everyone into the living room before breakfast. The tension from last night still hung in the air like smoke. Levi sat on the couch, glued to his mom's iPhone 16 Pro Max, completely unbothered by what he'd done. Dad walked over to him, snatched the phone from his hands without warning, and dropped it straight into a mug of steaming hot tea. The phone sank with a harsh, crackling pop. Andrea jumped up. Oh, my god! What are you doing? Before Michael could say a word, dad turned to me and gave a slight nod. I stepped forward, looked my brother straight in the eye, and raised my middle finger. Cold, direct, unwavering. Andrea shrieked, William, what the hell is wrong with you? Michael froze, face pale. Levi shrank into the couch, eyes wide. For the first time, dad stepped into Center. How does that feel? That feeling is precisely what William had to carry last night. Andrea pulled the ruined phone from the tea, hands shaking. Dad, that phone cost over $1,500! That's my property! Dad's voice was calm but sharp. And William's laptop was just trash. She froze. I'll call the police, then. Go ahead, dad said. And while you're at it, tell them what your kid did to William. The room went dead silent that night. At dinner, Michael finally spoke, his voice heavy with exhaustion. I I think it's time to take him somewhere. Somewhere that can help him start over. Dad nodded. A behavioral program. William, contact them for me. On Saturday, we drove Levi to the camp. He screamed for his mom the whole way, begging us to turn around. Michael gripped the steering wheel so tight. His knuckles turned white. When the gate closed behind Levi, I didn't feel relieved, just empty. It wasn't punishment. It was structure. Something he never had. One year later, everything changed. Michael and Andrea opened a small deli. They stopped making excuses and started listening. Levi sent me a handwritten letter. Half in English, half in broken German. Sorry, Uncle William. I was wrong. Since then, no more Defiance. No more ugly behavior. Every weekend, I bring him to my apartment. We play video games, eat fried chicken and talk. He's still stubborn, but now he knows when to stop.

Even after I showed the camera footage, my brother and sister in law defended him. The next morning, my dad taught them a lesson they will never forget. I was in the middle of fixing a critical work issue when I heard it. The fizzing sound of soda hitting my keyboard. I looked up to see my nephew Levi standing over my Dell XPS, an empty Coke can in his hand, grinning as he watched the liquid seep between the keys. Screen flickered once, then went black. What the hell are you doing? I shouted. Levi stared at me. No guilt, no fear. He stuck out his tongue, raised his middle finger, and walked out of my office like he owned the place. He was nine years old. My brother Michael and his wife Andrea had moved back from overseas three months ago, staying at our dad's house temporarily after a failed business venture. Their son Levi, had no boundaries. Every time I told him my office was off limits, Andrea would laugh and say, don't be so serious, Uncle William. He's just energetic. I walked downstairs, keeping my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest. Levi needs to apologize for what he just did. He hid behind Andrea. I didn't do anything wrong. I explained what happened. Soda, the middle finger, everything. Andrea frowned, her voice sharp. You're saying Levi did that? I don't believe it. Michael just stared at me, silent. I pulled out my phone and showed them the security footage from my office. Still clear. Levi pouring soda, sticking out his tongue, flipping me off. Andrea watched it, her face flickering with discomfort, then shrugged. He probably picked that up somewhere. It was just an accident. Michael leaned back. Don't make a big deal out of this. You're the adult here. That's when I lost it. That's what you call an accident? You saw the video? Are you all blind? The room went silent. My dad, sitting at the end of the table, said nothing, but his jaw was tight. Michael slammed his hand on the table. What the hell did you just say? Hey, William, Levi would never do that. Before I could respond, my dad's voice cut through. Everyone, sit down now. The room froze. Dad stood up, looked at Levi, and said firmly, Levi, what you did was wrong. Apologize to your uncle William. Levi said nothing. Andrea

When I refused, she invited guests anyway. So I booked a flight, locked the house, and taught her a lesson she'd never forget. Emily burst into my kitchen on a quiet Saturday morning, face glowing. I'm throwing my birthday party here. I already told everyone this weekend. I nearly dropped my coffee. Wait, what? She flipped her hair. Your place is spacious. The garden is gorgeous. I've already invited everyone. I crossed my arms. You never asked us. She waved dismissively. You can't say no. I've already ordered the cake, booked a DJ. You'd embarrass me if you cancel. How can I cancel something I never agreed to? She rolled her eyes. Saturday at seven PM. Then she left, texting furiously. Last year, Emily begged me to host her small gathering. I trusted her. What she promised would be ten close friends turned into 30 people. EDM blasting, beer pong on my dining table, shattered dishes, a guy smoking shisha in my living room. By nine PM, my neighbor knocked. Music is deafening. The whole building can hear it. When I cut the music and kicked everyone out, Emily looked at me like I'd ruined her life. But when I saw the beer soaked carpets, smoke, stench, broken plates, I swore she'd never host another party here again. Next morning, I woke to a text from mom. I'm so excited about Emily's party at your place. Emily? Had told the entire family without my permission. I opened the family group chat. Emily's message. This weekend is going to be amazing. Anna and Bradley's place is perfect. Bradley read over my shoulder and sighed. So what's the plan? I smiled. Just wait and see. For four days I stayed silent. Emily kept posting. Got the cake. We're having a DJ. Dress code white and gold. Meanwhile, I booked 2 plane tickets to the Maldives. We were leaving Saturday morning, one day before her party. Before we left, I stopped by my neighbor, Mister Williams apartment. We'll be away for a few days. If anyone causes trouble, especially my sister, please call the police. He raised an eyebrow, amused. Got it all planned out, huh? I don't make the same mistake twice. The night of Emily's party, I was on a beach in the Maldives, cocktail in hand.

Junior year. This girl, Brielle, made everything about her and I mean everything. She'd cry over those Brielle Mclachlan puppy commercials at lunch, full on sobbing with her head on the table. She'd scream random things in the hallway just to see who'd turn around. She once faked a panic attack because someone wore the same shirt as her to school. Most people bought into it. She had this whole crew that treated her like she was made of glass. I tried to ignore her, but we were both in choir so I couldn't escape completely. Then came the spring concert. Twenty minutes before showtime, all 100 of us were on the risers doing final rehearsals. The auditorium was packed with early parents finding seats, programs rustling that pre show energy. Brielle was front row center. Obviously. She always made sure she got the spotlight positions. Suddenly the side door opened and Brielle's mom walked in. Not rushed, just purposeful. She went straight to our director, Mister Ford, and whispered something in his ear. He nodded, looked at Brielle and called her name over the microphone. Brielle, can you come down, please? The entire choir went silent. Brielle climbed down from the risers, her heels clicking on the stage floor. Her mom pulled her aside, leaned in close and said maybe three sentences. That's when Brielle screamed. Not a gasp, not a cry, a full horror movie blood curdling scream that Echoed off every wall in that auditorium. Parents and the audience stood up. Some of the freshman girls started crying just from hearing it. Brielle took off running for the exit, but she only made it about 20 feet before her legs gave out. She collapsed right there on the auditorium floor, wailing like someone had ripped her heart out. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Over and over and over. Her mom rushed over, grabbed her by the elbow, and practically dragged her out through the side door. The whole thing took maybe 90 seconds, but it felt like an hour. Mr Ford stood there frozen. Nobody knew what to do. Finally, he cleared his throat and said, let's, let's take five minutes. The second we got backstage, everyone pulled out their phones. Our group chat exploded with messages. Someone texted Brielle directly, responded 20 minutes later. Nothing will ever be the same. Then why couldn't it have been me? Then she stopped responding entirely. Words spread fast. By intermission, half the school thought Brielle's dad and little sister had died in a car accident. The other half thought it was a house.

His face was doing this thing where you could tell he was trying so hard not to react. Sweetie, I whispered back, what do you mean grounded? She pointed directly at the honor Guard, you said Grandpa trained people in the army. Like when I'm bad and you ground me. No TV, no iPad, just thinking about what I did. The old veteran's shoulders started shaking. His wife grabbed his arm, but it was too late. He completely lost it, started crying, laughing so hard he had to cover his mouth with both hands. His whole body was shaking. Then the guy next to him caught it, then the woman next to him. Within 30 seconds, the entire row of veterans was struggling not to laugh at a military funeral. My sister was trying to shush Lily, her face bright red. But the laughter was spreading. It wasn't disrespectful laughter. It was this wave of something that felt like relief, like Lily had accidentally said the one thing everyone needed to hear. The honor guard stayed stone faced, professional. But I swear I saw the guy on the left, the one closest to us, his jaw twitch.

There's no money in the budget. Make it work or leave. I was stubborn. I thought I could handle it. To do the bare minimum of my job, I was at school from 6 a. M. To 9 p. M. Every weekday. Then I spent my entire weekend planning lessons and grading. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't eating right. I was drowning. When my first evaluation came, I expected to be torn apart.

I contacted the union and explained everything, the class sizes, the impossible schedule, the lack of support. They said they'd handle it. Nothing changed. By Thanksgiving, I was completely burnt out. But I had two days off for the break. So I went to a potluck dinner with some old college friends, try and decompress. I started talking to this guy I barely knew and his husband about my new job. I mentioned how amazing my students were, how creative and smart, but how frustrated I was that I couldn't give them the attention they deserved. With 46 kids, it's in the room at once. The husband raised an eyebrow. What school do you work at? I told him I didn't think twice about it. That Monday morning at 805:00am, my principal came storming into my classroom. Her face was bright red. Her hands were shaking. She slammed the door so hard the windows rattled. You talk to someone about this school, about me, I'm going to have you fired. I'm going to make sure you never work in education again. You're done. I just stared at her, completely frozen. Then my phone buzzed. It was an email from the district office asking me to come in during my lunch break. Turns out the guy I talked to at Thanksgiving wasn't just some random person. He was a district superintendent. He'd filed a formal complaint that morning about unsafe working conditions, contract violations and administrative retaliation. By 10 a. M, my principal was being escorted out of the building by security. By noon, I had an educational assistant assigned to my classroom. By the end of the week, my schedule was completely redone with proper planning time.

My first teaching job was at a Title 1 elementary school as an art teacher. I was 25, fresh out of college and so excited I couldn't sleep. The week before school started, that excitement died pretty fast. A week before classes began, I emailed the principal asking about my keys and badge so I could prep my classroom. No response. Called the office, nothing. I waited 3 days and finally contacted the district office directly. Two days before school started, I got an angry email from my principal saying I should have been more patient and that going to the district was inappropriate. She made me wait until the day before classes to get my keys. When I finally opened my classroom door, I froze. The room was completely packed with storage desks stacked to the ceiling, 100 chairs piled on top of each other, filing cabinets blocking the windows. I had less than 24 hours to make this functional. I worked until midnight clearing it out. The first day of school, I still didn't have a schedule. I had no idea which classes I was teaching or when. I emailed my principal at 7:00am asking for it. She replied twenty minutes later, accusing me of pressuring and bullying her. I apologized and asked again. She sent the schedule 10 minutes after the first bell rang. That's when I saw it. I had two classes. Scheduled at the same time, 46 kids in one room by myself. I also had seven 45 minute periods with no breaks except a 30 minute lunch. I was teaching every grade every single day of the week. There was no time to prep between classes, no time to set up materials, no time to even breathe. I went to my principal's office during lunch and asked if we could adjust this jewel. I explained I was losing instruction time because I had to scramble to get supplies ready while the next class was walking in. She came to my classroom that afternoon while students were waiting in the hallway. She didn't even lower her voice. You're a first year teacher. You don't know what you need. Deal with it or quit. I decided not to quit. Instead, I read the entire.

Tree guys were expensive, but totally worth it. I sat there for a minute. Then I went to my filing cabinet, pulled out Grandpa's will, read the section again. I wish to be cremated and have my ashes scattered beneath the oak tree at 2847 Riverside Drive. This tree is to remain untouched as my memorial. Found the memorial site registration we filed with the county. Two years Ago find by mom, witnessed by my sister. She knew. She absolutely knew. I called the county Environmental Protection office Monday morning first thing. Environmental Services. This is Marcus. Hi. I need to report a disturbance of a registered memorial site. Okay. Can you provide the registration number? I read it off the paperwork. Let me pull that up. Okay, I see it here. Oak Tree Memorial, registered 2,022. What's the nature of the disturbance? Someone cut down the entire tree. Removed it completely. Planted a different tree in its place. Silence on the other end. Then they cut down a registered memorial tree without permits? Yes, sir. That's a serious violation. That's a minimum 50,000 dollar fine. Up to 100,000 dollars, depending on circumstances. We'll need to send an inspector out immediately. Who owns the property? I gave him Mom's name and address. And who authorized the removal? My sister. She lives there too. She was copied on the original registration paperwork. So she knew it was protected? Yes. We'll be in touch. This is gonna be a substantial fine. Three days later, Wednesday afternoon, mom called me. I could hear her screaming. Before I even got

Suzanne Landry throwing his mother a bone with a middle name. I kept copies in my hospital bag. We told the nurse our plan. I never made it to my due date. The placenta started detaching at 36 weeks. My husband drove while I bled through towels. Suzanne followed in her car, calling his phone over and over. Don't answer, I gasped through contractions. The C section happened fast. Too fast. Put me under general anesthesia when my blood pressure crashed. I woke up six hours later, groggy and disoriented. My husband sat beside me, holding a clipboard. The birth certificate, he said. I haven't filled it out yet. Suzanne stood in the doorway. I've been waiting to make sure you do the right thing. Where is she? I asked. Where. Where's the baby? N I C U, he said. She's okay. But, mom. I called Vincent, Suzanne interrupted. He's driving down with the trust paperwork. He needs to see the birth certificate matches. He looked between us, his mother, his wife, his pen hovering over the paper. If you write May, Suzanne said slowly, we're done. I'll never speak to either of you again. Vincent will cut you off. The whole family will. My heart rate monitor started beeping faster. My husband stood up. You know what, mom? Good. He wrote may in clear black letters. Suzanne lunged for the clipboard, but he held it over his head. Security had been watching through the door. They Stepped in. Ma'am, you need to leave. The guard said, that's my grandchild. You're stealing her inheritance. Uncle Vincent arrived three hours later. He looked at the birth certificate, then at Susan, then burst out laughing. Susan, you psycho! I don't care what the kid's name is. Susan went white. But you said. I said, I'd love to meet Norman's great grandchild, not that she had to be named Norman. Jesus Christ! Who names a girl Norman? He pulled out the trust documents, right there in black and white. To any descendant of Norman Landry upon reaching majority. You lied. My husband said to his mother, you made this entire thing up. Suzanne's voice got caught in her throat. Vincent shook his head. Just like when we were kids, he said. You always had to control everything, make everything about you. No wonder your husband left.

N, O, R, m, a, N. I stared in shock. Norman. We're having a girl, of course, dear Susan said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The Landry firstborns are always named after my father, Norman Landry. It's been our tradition for four generations. My husband squeezed my shoulder. Mom already ordered everything. The crib has Norman engraved on it. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like she was already protesting her fate. We've been living in my husband's childhood home for three months. While house hunting, not once had anyone mention this tradition. We picked may, I said, my voice shaking. We've been calling her may for months. Suzanne waved her hand dismissively. Nicknames are fine in private, but legally she'll be Norman. The words hung in the air. My husband followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was pulling up baby name websites when he closed my laptop. You're overreacting, he said. It's just a name. It's not just a name. You're asking me to name our daughter Norman. His face hardened in a way I'd never seen before. This is about respect. My grandfather built this family's wealth. Your grandfather has been dead for 30 years. He pulled out his phone and showed me a text from his uncle. See this? Uncle Vincent controls Grandpa Norman's trust, 2 million dollars Goes to Norman's namesake on their 18th birthday, but only if they're legally named Norman. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. $2 million. My husband's business had been struggling. We had no savings. After three rounds of IVF, the next weeks became a battle of wills. Suzanne started introducing me as Norman's mother at her church. She posted on Facebook about baby Norman arriving. Soon, my own mother called asking why I was named my granddaughter after an old man. During a prenatal appointment, the nurse pulled me aside. Just so you know, only biological parents can complete the birth certificate, not grandparents. We've had issues before. What kind of issues? She lowered her voice. Overbearing in laws trying to change names while mom's unconscious. We keep the forms locked now. That night, I told my husband what the nurse said. For the first time, I saw him think maybe we could hyphenate. He suggested quietly, May Norman. Suzanne slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. The trust specifically says Norman 1st name, no modifications. But he pulled up the document on his phone. He read it three times. Mom. It doesn't say that anywhere, Vincent told me. It just says a descendant named in honor of Norman Landry. May could be honoring him. Suzanne's face went red. Don't you dare disrespect your grandfather's memory. We prepared in secret. My husband filled out a practice birth.

So when my wife started her test and disappeared, I used those days to pack her things and change the locks. I was getting a late night snack when their voices drifted from the living room. At first I thought it was typical girl talk, but then I caught fragments that made me freeze with the fridge door halfway open. Trust me, men show their real colours when they think they're losing control. The friend was saying. Her divorce had been finalized just two months ago. You create a little distance, watch for these signs, then disappear for a few days. If he's got any red flags, he'll either turn desperate and pathetic or angry and controlling. I quietly moved closer to the doorway and just out of sight. But what if I'm wrong about him? My wife asked. You've been married for six years. Don't you think it's time to really test if he's the man you think he is? Her friend listed the five red flags getting defensive when questioned, controlling behavior, making everything about himself, not handling space well. Trying to fix problems with money instead of communication. The disappearing test is foolproof, the friend continued. Create some conflict. Tell him you need time to think, then stay somewhere for a few days. A good man will respect your space. A bad one Will become a stalker or throw a tantrum. My wife of six years was planning to test me like a lab rat. Because her bitter friend couldn't handle her own failed marriage. The ironic part, I didn't exhibit any of those red flags. But apparently that wasn't enough proof. Over the next week, followed the script perfectly. Strange fights about things that had never bothered her before. Monday, she accused me of being dismissive. Tuesday, she got upset I hadn't asked enough questions about her day. Wednesday, more manufactured scenarios. Friday evening, she delivered the finale while I was watching the game. I think I need some space. I need a few days to clear my head. I muted the TV. Okay, where are you thinking of going? She blinked, expecting resistance. My mom's house. Maybe for the weekend, possibly longer. All right. Drive safe. That's it? You're not going to ask what this is about? You said you need space to think. Asking questions would defeat the purpose, wouldn't it? The confusion in her eyes was priceless. This wasn't her friend's playbook. She packed Saturday morning and left as soon as her car disappeared.

My mom called me fat my entire life. I got my period when I was 10 years old. Boobs came in, hips got wide, normal puberty stuff. But my mom took one look at me and decided I was overweight. She started putting me on diets immediately. While other kids ate pizza at lunch, I had celery sticks and low fat yogurt. She dragged me to stores with names like pretty plus, bought me clothes from the husky section even though I wore normal sizes. Every single shopping trip was torture. She'd hold up jeans and say things like these should fit around your middle. I was 12. This went on for years. Every holiday dinner, she'd watch what I put on my plate. Every beach vacation, she'd buy me oversized t shirts to wear over my swimsuit. When I graduated high school, she bought me a gym membership as a gift. The card said to a healthier you. I was 140 pounds and 5 foot 6. Then I got pregnant twice back to back. My son was born and 14 months later my daughter arrived. I gained 60 pounds total. My body was exhausted. I was running on three hours of sleep and living off whatever I could grab between diaper changes, granola bars, leftover Mac and cheese from the kids plates, drive through burgers at ten PM my mom had a field day. She started making comments every time she saw me. You Really? Let yourself go. Don't you want to fit into your old clothes? She said this stuff in front of my husband at family dinners. Once at the grocery store loud enough that the cashier heard. She bought me a book called Your Post Baby Body and left it on my kitchen counter. I started running 4:00am before the kids woke up. I ran every single morning for eight months straight. The weight came off fast, 70 pounds gone. I felt incredible. But here's the thing, my mom didn't notice. She still made the same comments, still bought me extra large shirts for my birthday, still told relatives I was working on it. My work pants got.

Nothing happened. I was starting to think maybe she actually Learned her lesson. But then Friday rolled around and I heard her getting ready in our room while I was in the common area studying. When I came back, she was gone and so was the fake foundation bottle. It was moved like two inches to the left. I didn't see her until the next morning. She came stumbling in around 2 in the morning and I pretended to be asleep. The next day I had an early Saturday shift at the library, so I left before she woke up. When I got back around noon, she was sitting on her bed looking at her phone with the angriest expression I've ever seen. Her face was straight up orange, like traffic cone orange. It was so bad. She had clearly tried to wipe some of it off because there were streaks on her jawline, but it had already set into her skin. She looked up when I walked in and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. Did you notice anything weird about your foundation, she asked. Her voice was shaky like she was trying not to cry. I just shrugged and was like, know why? She showed me her Instagram and there were photos from whatever party she went to last night. The flash made it even Worse. She looked like an Oompa Loompa. People had tagged her in photos and there were comments with crying, laughing emojis. Someone literally commented, girl, what happened to your face with skull emojis. Everyone was staring at me all night, she said. I thought the lighting was just weird, but then I went to the bathroom and saw myself. People were literally laughing. I walked over to my desk and picked up the fake foundation bottle. Oh, weird. Maybe it oxidized or something that happens sometimes with makeup. She just stared at me. I could tell she was trying to figure out if I did it on purpose, but she couldn't prove anything. Yeah, maybe. She finally said she spent the rest of the day trying to scrub it off. Self Tanner had stained her skin so she was orange for like three more days. She had to skip her Monday classes because she was too embarrassed to go out in public. After that, she never touched my stuff again. Not my makeup, not my clothes, nothing. She barely even made eye contact with me for a week. Eventually things went back to semi normal, but she definitely Learned her lesson.

So I lived with three guys in college, and honestly, it was like living with toddlers who discovered pizza for the first time. I'm talking shoes everywhere, dishes in the sink for literal weeks. And don't even get me started on the bathroom situation. I was the only girl in this house, and somehow that automatically made me the maid. I didn't sign up for that, but whatever. I like things clean, so I dealt with it. The worst part was this one roommate, Jake, and his girlfriend Becca, who practically moved in without paying a single dollar in rent. She wasn't even on the lease, but her entire life was in our house. Like, I'm talking hair products, makeup, three different types of face wash, and she showered twice a day. Twice. Our water Bill was insane, and when I brought it up, everyone just shrugged. The bathroom was so packed with her stuff that I could barely clean it. Every time I tried to wipe down the shower, I'd knock over, like, 15 bottles of conditioner and some fancy hair mask thing that cost $40. I asked her nicely to please keep her stuff in Jake's room, since she didn't live there and wasn't paying rent. He looked at me like I asked her to donate a kidney. Jake got all defensive, and the other roommates backed him up. Because apparently, I was being unreasonable. One of them literally said, if you're so tired of cleaning up after us, just leave our stuff where you found it. They were all nodding like that was some genius solution. So I did exactly that. Next time I cleaned the bathroom, I didn't move a single bottle. I just sprayed everything down with scrubbing bubbles and let it sit. That fancy shampoo bar she had that cost, like, $60 melted into this weird, goopy pudding. Within a week, all her bottles got super slippery from the cleaner and kept falling over. She complained to Jake that her products were getting ruined, and he asked me about it. I just said I was leaving everything where I found it, like they told me to. Then there was this whole thing with one of my other roommates, Tyler, who always left his laptop plugged in right in the middle of the living room floor. The cord stretched across the walkway, and I'd already tripped over it twice. I asked him to move it, and he said the outlet was right there, so it was staying fine.

So I made sure she'd never do it again. So I had this roommate freshman year named Jess who literally could not understand the concept of personal space like at all. She'd walk into my room without knocking, eat my leftovers from the fridge. And worst of all, she kept using my makeup without asking. Not like a quick swipe of mascara either. I'm talking full face foundation, expensive eyeshadow, palettes, everything. First time I noticed I was getting ready for class and my favorite lipstick was just gone. Found it later on her desk with the cap off, completely dried out. I was annoyed but whatever. I said something and she was like, oh, my bad, I'll replace it, which she never did, by the way. Then it kept happening. My concealer would be half empty after the weekend. My brushes had different colored makeup on them that I definitely didn't use. One time I caught her red handed using my highlighter and she literally just laughed and said, you have such good taste. I couldn't help myself. I told her probably five or six times to stop. She'd always say the same thing that it wasn't a big deal and we're roommates so we share stuff. But I never agreed to share my makeup that I paid for with money from my campus job. She had her own makeup. It just wasn't as nice as mine because I actually saved up For quality stuff. The breaking point was when I came back from winter break. I had this foundation that cost me like $70. I know that sounds insane, but I have sensitive skin and it was the only one that didn't make me break out. I kept it in a specific spot on my desk. I got back to our dorm and immediately knew something was off. The bottle was in the wrong place. And when I picked it up, it was way lighter than it should have been. She'd used almost half of it while I was gone and she didn't even bother wiping off the rim. So there was dried foundation caked around the top. I was so mad I literally had to leave the room before I said something I'd regret that night. I came up with my plan. I went to the drugstore and bought the cheapest foundation I could find, like $3. Then I stopped by the makeup aisle and grab this self tanning lotion that was super orange. Back in my room, I mix them together in the cheap bottle until it looked somewhat normal. Not perfect, but close enough that just wouldn't notice. Since she clearly didn't pay attention to details, I took my real foundation and hid it in my closet behind my winter coats. Then I put the fake one in the exact spot where I usually.

She didn't introduce herself or write her name on the board. Instead, she announced we're going to play a quick game. Everyone whose parents are divorced, please move to the left quadrant of the room. A confused murmur spread, but we complied. Roughly half the class shuffled left. I remained on the right amongst the kids from intact families. Now she continued, her voice sharp and controlled. If you want a dog, stay standing. Everyone else, sit down. Three kids on the left side sat. Immediately, the questions grew increasingly peculiar. Right side, she instructed, her gaze sweeping over us. Anyone who walks to school moved to the back wall. My stomach tightened. Four of us, including me, moved to the rear. I hated being isolated like this. What kind of bizarre icebreaker was this? Back row, she said, now focusing entirely on us.

The whispers were frantic, but she launched Straight into teaching geometry as if nothing unusual had happened. I couldn't concentrate. Why did she need to map out my exact morning routine? At lunch, the confusion turned to dread. Maybe it was some kind of strange sociological study my friend George offered. Emma pointed out the most unnerving detail. She never even told us her name. When we returned after lunch, the substitute was gone. Principal Hilton stood at the front, his expression grim. Class he began, his voice devoid of its usual warmth. I need you all to help me recreate this morning's activity exactly. He had us repeat the entire sorting process. He meticulously wrote down every name and position, snapping photos with his phone. When he reached the final step and I stood alone in the back corner, his face went alarmingly pale. Did she say anything specific to you? He asked me, urgency in his eyes. No, sir. She just stared at me and then said, perfect, and told us to sit down. He immediately called my parents. Within minutes, I was in his office with my mother, my father and two police officers. The truth dropped like a lead weight.

Here's the thing about me and my brother. We basically raised each other. Our parents were too busy with their own demons to notice they had kids 11 months apart but might as well be twins. Growing up, we shared everything because there wasn't enough to go around. One meal split two ways, one winter coat we traded off. That kind of childhood changes you. Now we're functioning adults but still weirdly close. Share drinks without asking, use each other's deodorant. Close people side eye us when we split food. They don't understand that when you've been someone's lifeline since you were five, boundaries become irrelevant. The graduation party for my cousin was at some bougie venue where they charged $30 for two olives in a martini. I walked in feeling underdressed, even though I'd worn my nicest outfit. My brother was near the entrance probably waiting for me. Finally, he gave me a quick side hug, the kind where you pat someone's back twice and release thought you died or something. We started talking about how this place was out of our budget. When he stopped the conversation saying he wanted me to introduce me to someone. Before I could ask for more context, he was gone. He disappeared into the crowd. I stood there awkwardly doing that thing where you check your phone to look busy. About 20 minutes in, I Noticed this woman in a red dress near the bar, designer everything, harsh eye makeup, stilettos that probably cost more than my rent. She kept staring at me. Not subtle glances either. Full on staring like she was trying to place me. At first I thought maybe we'd met before. I smiled at her. She whispered something to her friend and they both laughed. Okay, guess not. We moved to the appetizer table trying to shake off the weird feeling. That's when I heard her. She was talking to her friends, but her voice carried over the music. I cannot believe she showed up here. Like we get it. You're obsessed with him, but this is just pathetic. My stomach dropped. Was she talking about me? No. That's paranoid. I don't even know her. I grabbed some food and found a spot by the windows, but she kept appearing wherever I went by the bar. She probably thinks she has a chance. It's actually sad. Him? Who was him? I looked around the party trying to figure out who she thought I was following, but I'd literally only been here 30 minutes and hadn't talked to any guys. The harassment escalated. She accidentally backed into me while I was holding a drink, sending red wine all over my dress. Oops. She, I said flatly, not even turning around. she stepped on the hem of my dress with her heel when I walked past, causing me to stumble. She was Actually pissing me off. this woman was clearly unhinged and I had no idea why she targeted me. I kept looking for my brother, but he was nowhere to be found. Then my cousin appeared with her baby. Bathroom emergency. The salmon was bad. Two minutes. He handed me her six month old baby and ran off. My brother finally reappeared looking exhausted. His lips were cracked and bleeding from working construction all week in the sun. Jesus, my lips are killing me, he said wincing. Do you have Chapstick? Yeah, one sec. I carefully balanced the baby, digging through my purse, found it, handed it over. You're the best. That's when that girl completely lost it. Are you fing kidding me? She yelled across the room. The entire party went silent. You pathetic hoe. I was in shock watching her rip off her stilettos. I'm so effing done with B words like you. The shoe was in her hand. She wound back. The stilettos was flying straight at my head. The stilettos flew straight at my face. Instinctively, I spun around, curling my body over the baby. The heel slammed into my back, sharp pain shooting through my shoulder blade. I heard gasps from every direction. What the hell? Normani? My brother's voice boomed across the venue. That's my sister. The entire party froze. Normani's face went from rage to horror in a split second. Your sister, her voice cracked. My sister, the one I told you about. 50 times the one holding our cousin's baby. Menu manager rushed over with security. We're calling the police. That's assault with a weapon. My cousin burst out of the bathroom, saw me hunched over protecting her baby and charged at Normani. You threw something at my baby. Security was barely able to restrain my cousin from fully decking her. Normani stood there, mascara running as the graduates parents demanded she be removed immediately. Everyone had their phones out recording her complete humiliation. Obviously, he broke up with psycho ass.

The fight getting you in trouble. What about lying, destroying my homework, making yourself cry to manipulate dad? Her face went red. Dad pointed at me. That's enough. You're being disrespectful. And you suspended me from my own house for defending myself. Guess we're even. Bobby appeared from his office. I think you folks should leave. They stood there expecting me to break. I just stared back. They left. Ashley turned at the door. You'll regret this. I went back to work that evening. I graduated high school through the night program, something they didn't even know I transferred to. Bobby, Jake and Tommy came to the ceremony, took a photo of me and my cap and gown next to my truck. My parents never showed. I never invited them. Two months later, Ashley's pregnant at 16. Father's gone. Family calls begging for help. Six months later, dad loses his job. Behind on mortgage. More desperate calls. Nine months later, babies born. They're drowning. I bought my first truck. 12 months later, foreclosure notice, $12,000 behind. I had exactly that in savings. I thought about it for three days. That money could save their house, keep them from being homeless. It would also teach them I'd come running whenever they needed rescuing, that they could treat me like garbage and I'd still be their safety net. I didn't give it to them. They lost the house, moved into a two bedroom rental. Four people, one baby. Dad working. Retail mom doing data entry. Ashley still living with them, unemployed. Meanwhile, Bobby made me a partner, 20% of the shop. At 18, I co owned a business. 20. I bought a house. Last month, dad showed up one final time. No money request. Just I was wrong about that day, about suspending you, about all of it. We're proud of what you've built. I didn't know what to say. Part of me wanted to stay angry. I appreciate you saying that. I told him. I know it's late. Yeah, it is. He left. Haven't heard from him since. I got a girlfriend who doesn't care that I'm a mechanic. She likes that I can fix thing. I've never met my niece. Don't plan to. Sometimes Bobby asks if I feel bad. I tell him the truth. I feel free. They chose Ashley over me every single time. Now they're living with that choice and I'm living with mine. The difference, I'm thriving. They're surviving. That's not revenge. That's just reality.

Then he turned 18 and knocked on my door. I hadn't seen my son in 10 years, not by choice. When he was 8, my ex wife Denise took him and vanished while I was at work. One day I was tucking him into bed. The next day, his room was empty. She changed their names, moved it's away and told everyone I'd abandoned them. For 10 years I've been the deadbeat dad who walked out on his family. That's what she told him. That's what she told her new husband. That's what she told anyone who'd listen. Meanwhile, I spent $80,000 trying to find them, hired lawyers who couldn't track them, filed police reports that went nowhere. The court still made me pay 12 monthly to her parents address. They forwarded it to her secretly while telling police they didn't know where she was. His bedroom exactly the same, Dinosaur wallpaper, toy cars on the shelf, his favorite book on the nightstand. Every birthday and Christmas I sent cards and presents to that address. Her parents returned them all unopened. I kept them in boxes in his closet. 10 years of returned love, 10 years of searching, 10 years of being called a deadbeat while paying support for a son I couldn't find. Three weeks after his 18th birthday, I got a Facebook message that made my hands shake. It just said, are you my dad? And I knew it was Him. He'd remembered my real name from when he was little. We messaged for hours and everything he said hurt to read. He thought I'd walked out when he was 8, never looked back, never sent money while his mom worked 3 jobs. Chose my career over being his father. I begged him to meet me for coffee. He almost said no, but finally agreed. When he walked into that coffee shop, I couldn't believe how much he looked like me. Same eyes, same nervous finger tapping when upset. But his face was full of anger. Mom said you left us for another woman, he said. It felt like being punched. Pulled out my phone. I need to show you something. First came the missing person reports. I'd filed eight of them. His forehead wrinkled. You called the police. That gave me hope. Then receipts from searching that totaled $80,000. His anger started cracking. Why couldn't you find us? I explained the name changes, cash payments, fake profiles. Come to my house. There's more, I said. He followed in his car. That 20 minute drive felt endless. I kept thinking he might turn around and leave. I let him upstairs and opened his old bedroom door. He froze seeing the Dinosaur walls. You kept my room. His voice cracked. Then he saw the closet boxes labeled by year. He opened 9th birthday and found a card saying happy birthday, buddy. Dad loves you. And I'm still looking. He started opening More boxes, 10 years of cards and wrapped presents. Tears filled his eyes. She said, you forgot about me, he, I showed him bank statements with every payment highlighted, $144,000 total. His face turned pale. We lived in roach infested apartments. I wore shoes with holes. Then his eyes went wide. Wait, my mother's parents gave mom cash envelopes every month. Said it was to help out. He looked at me. That was my child support, wasn't it? I nodded. Call your mom. Ask where my money went. He called her right then and put it on speaker. Where are you? She screamed.

It was the best thing I ever did. When my golden retriever had a litter of 14 puppies in 2008, I took three weeks off work just to rotate them for feeding. It was chaos, but the kind of chaos that makes you remember why you love dogs. Every morning around 4:00am, I'd let them out to play in the yard. My neighbor Beth would walk over from next door and ask how they were doing. We talked for maybe 20 minutes while she watched them stumble around like drunk little furballs. When the puppies hit 6 weeks old, Beth mentioned her son Mitch was interested in 1. I stopped her right there. If Mitch wants a puppy, he needs to talk to me himself. The next morning this scrawny 13 year old kid shows up on my porch, hands shaking, barely making eye contact. I invited him to sit down because the poor kid looked like he was about to pass out from nerves. Mr Leon, how much are you selling the puppies for? $650 each. I watched his eyes dart back and forth mumbling numbers under his breath like he was doing mental math. Finally, he looks up at me with these determined eyes. I wanna buy one and name her ginger. I don't have any money saved, but I'll get a job. I'll make payments. I'll be her best friend for life. Now I'm not heartless, but I had Serious concerns. Here's this kid with zero dollars, probably zero sense of responsibility, thinking raising a dog is like owning a toy. I'd worked hard to make sure each puppy went to a good home and I wasn't about to hand one over to some kid who'd lose interest in two weeks. But then an idea hit me, a test. Alright, Mitch, here's the deal. You have four weeks to save 400 dollar cash. Bring me that and you can take home a 10 week old pup be of your choice. After that, you pay me $100 every single week until you hit $650 total. You miss one payment by even one day. I get ginger back, no exceptions. Stuck out his hand immediately we shook on it. I honestly thought that would be the end of it, that he'd try for maybe a week, realize how hard it was and give up like most kids do. I was so wrong. That same day, while I was still at work, Mitch found a paper route, started delivering newspapers at 3:30 in the morning seven days a week. Then he'd go to school, come home and mow lawns until dark, did odd jobs for neighbors and.

Everyone at our school knew this guy. Louise was a drug dealer. He wouldn't even try to hide it because our entire school already knew who he was. Everybody loved him. However, he literally drove the principal insane. Whenever something drug related happened at school, he was always the first person they searched. Teachers all knew, the principal knew, even the cops knew who he was. However, they could never actually prove it. Every time they searched him, they'd never actually catch him with anything. I'd watch as our principal would knock on our door, interrupting our class, and without even saying a word, Louise would just stand up to let them search him out in the hall. The cops would pull him over just for existing and try to search his car, but they, too, would never catch him with anything. The administration got so frustrated they would cut the lock off his locker almost every week just to try and find his stash. He literally drove them insane. And someone spread a rumor that Louise was hiding his stash in a locker that wasn't assigned to anybody. It spread like wildfire and not too long after our principal heard. But since there were too many lockers, our principal decided to gather all of our teachers and the locks off literally every locker in the school to search them. The entire time, Louise literally laughed in their faces as they spent Hours looking and didn't find a single thing. The administration had no idea what to do. Every time they caught another kid with something illegal at school, they ask where they got it. And every time the kid would always say, I bought this from Luis. Luis actually encouraged them to say it. Yeah, tell them it was me. I don't care. So they'd search Luis again. I'm down in the hallway in front of everyone. And brought cops to search his car weekly. He just let them find anything he'd ask with a smirk while they completely lost their minds. But then something happened. Over Christmas break, the principal's son asked him for a new pair of shoes for Christmas. However, not just normal shoes. They for shoes that actually had a secret compartment hidden in the bottom of them that you could hide small things in. As soon as our principal heard that, light bulbs went off in his head. He couldn't wait for winter break to be over. And literally the first day back, as soon as first period started, we hear someone yell over the intercom, Louise, get your ass down to the principal's office right now. Our principal was sure he had him. This time, Louise walked into that office like he'd done 100 times before. However, this time was different. When he got there with a smile on it face, the principal didn't ask him to empty his pockets, didn't ask about his backpack. He just looked at Louise and said, take off your shoes. Louise hesitated. Uh, no, I don't want to listen, buddy. I'm not giving you a choice. Take them off. Louise now had no other option, so he just sat down and unlaced his shoes without putting up a fight. Okay, if you say so. He pulled them off and handed them over to him while the principal literally shook with excitement. He was finally gonna.

I sold our house and disappeared. My fiance, Nicole and I had been together for four years. We bought a house together two years ago. Nothing fancy, just a 3 bedroom starter home in the suburbs. We were supposed to get married in six months. Invitations were already ordered. Then one Tuesday night, she came home from work acting weird. She kept checking her phone and wouldn't look me in the eye during dinner. I made spaghetti that night and she barely touched it. Around 9, she finally sat down next to me on the couch and said we needed to talk. My stomach dropped. She told me her ex boyfriend, Jake, had reached out to her on Instagram a few weeks ago. They'd been messaging. He told her he made a huge mistake letting her go and wanted another chance. I just stared at her. She said she still loved me but she needed to know if there was still something there with Jake. She wanted a break, maybe two months just to figure things out. I asked if she was serious. She said yes. She even had it all planned out. She'd stay at her friend Courtney's apartment during the break and we'd revisit everything after she had time to think. I told her, no, there's no break. She wanted to go be with Jake. She could do that. But we were Done. She started crying, saying I was being unfair and not giving her space to process her emotions. I told her to pack a bag and leave. She tried to argue for another hour, kept saying I was overreacting and that lots of couples take breaks. I didn't budge. She finally grabbed some clothes and left around midnight. The next morning, I called a real estate agent. The house was in both our names, but I'd put down the entire down payment with money from my grandpa's inheritance. I explained the situation to the agent and she said we could list it fast if I got Nicole to sign off. I texted Nicole and told her I was selling the house. She called me immediately freaking out. She said I couldn't do that without her permission. I told her she could either sign the papers and take her half of the equity or I'd lawyer up and make it way more expensive for both of us. She came by that weekend to sign everything. She cried the whole time, asked if we could please just talk about this. I handed her the pen and pointed at the signature line. The house sold in three weeks. It was a seller's market and we got 15,000 over asking. I gave Nicole her half of the equity minus what I'd paid for the down payment, came out to about 18,000 for her. I took my money and started looking at apartments in different Cities. I didn't tell anyone where I was going, not my friends, not my family, and definitely not Nicole. She kept texting me. At first it was angry stuff about how I ruined everything and how immature I was. Then it turned into long paragraphs about how she realized she made a mistake and Jake wasn't what she thought he'd be. He said they went on two dates and she felt nothing. She wanted to come home. I blocked her number. I found a one bedroom apartment four hours away in a city I'd always liked. Got a transfer through my job to a branch out there. I packed everything I owned into a moving truck in one day. Didn't even hire movers, just did it myself with a dolly and a lot of trips up and downstairs. My best friend Paul helped me load the truck. He asked if I was sure about this. I told him I'd never been more sure about anything. He gave me a hug and told me to call him when I got settled. Nicole somehow got Paul's number and called him two days after I moved. He told me she was sobbing, asking where I went. He didn't tell her anything. She showed up at my parents house a week later. My mom called me and said Nicole was on their porch begging to know where I was. My mom told her I didn't want to be found and shut the door.

But things seem to have gone south because they're all suddenly calling me non stop. When I found out my wife Elena was having an affair with my younger brother, Adrian, I thought the betrayal couldn't get worse. Then I called my parents. My mother answered on the second ring. Her voice was cold before I even finished my first sentence. Well, can you blame her? Adrian has always been more ambitious than you. Dad got on speaker. Maybe if you'd made something of yourself, she wouldn't have looked elsewhere. I stood there in my kitchen, divorce papers still warm from the printer, listening to my parents defend the man who destroyed my marriage. But it wasn't just them. Elena's parents, the castanos, had always treated Adrian like the son they wished they'd had, the successful lawyer, the charmer, the golden boy. When Elena confessed everything at family dinner, her father actually clapped Adrian on the shoulder. At least she's upgrading, her mother smiled. We always knew you two were better suited. That night, I packed my things alone. No one called to check on me. No one asked if I was okay. My phone stayed silent except for one text from my brother. No hard feelings. Yeah. She just realized she wanted more. The divorce was swift. Elena got the house we bought together because her father was friends with the judge. Adrian moved in three weeks later. I saw the photos on social media, them hosting dinner parties in my dining room, sleeping in my bedroom, living the life I'd built. Both families blended seamlessly. My parents invited the castanos to Thanksgiving. Elena posted pictures with my mother, my own mother, wearing matching aprons. The caption read, so grateful for family that truly cares. I wasn't invited. For 18 months, I rebuilt in silence, got a better job, moved to a better apartment, started therapy. The only family member who reached out was my Uncle Terry, my dad's brother, who'd been the black sheep for years. He understood what it meant to be erased. Then last Tuesday, my phone started ringing. First Elena's mother. I ignored it, then her father, then my mother, then Adrian. By Wednesday morning, I had 47 missed calls and my voicemail was full. The messages were frantic.

I beat cancer at 19, but it won in its own way. I'll never have children. The radiation that saved me also robbed me of the only future I'd ever really wanted, to be a mother. I have four siblings who always treated me like I was defective, even before the cancer diagnosis. Too sensitive to handle real life, too weak to be taken seriously. When I got sick, they visit the hospital in shifts, just long enough to post photos about being supportive siblings. Never long enough for the hard part. Now I'm 31, healthy, successful, but to them, I'm still that sick kid who shouldn't want too much from life. For 12 years, I lived for my siblings kids. When my sister had her first baby, I was there cutting the umbilical cord because her husband fainted. I memorized feeding schedules, Learned every lullaby, never missed a single school play. Eight kids between four siblings and I knew them all, every allergy, every fear, every dream. While my siblings worked late or went on date nights, I was teaching their kids to ride bikes, help thing with homework, making Halloween costumes from scratch. I drove two hours each way to attend my nephew's kindergarten graduation because his parents had a conference. I held my niece through her first heartbreak while her mom was at book club. Every birthday party I arrived early to set up and stayed late to clean. The kids started calling me first when they needed something. Auntie understands, they say. Three weeks ago, my sister Gina asked me to come to our parents house. Important family discussion, she texted. I arrived with a trunk full of Christmas gifts I've been collecting since July. The living room felt like a courtroom, all four siblings and chairs facing one empty seat. No kids, Gina read from her phone. We're here because your relationship with our children has become inappropriate, my brother Mark jumped in. You buy them things without asking us, undermining our authority. The kids mention you constantly, Gina said, jaw tight. Beatrice asked if she could live with you last week. That's not. I started. You're weirdly obsessed, said Ross. It's uncomfortable. You need to find your own life instead of trying to steal ours. My youngest sister, Vanessa, sighed. Look, some people are meant to be mothers and honestly, the way you latch onto our kids proves you wouldn't be able to handle your own. You're too intense, too desperate. Gina stood up. We've discussed it. You're not invited to Christmas this year. The kids need to bond with their actual family without you confusing things. We're doing this for you, too, Mark added. Maybe without the kids as a crutch, you'll finally move on. I sat there for 30 seconds that felt like hours, then left without a word. At home, my boyfriend Alex found me sobbing on the bathroom floor. He held me. While I explained everything, come to my family's Christmas, he, please. Christmas morning at Alex's parents house was terrifying. I knew nobody except Alex, but his nephew ran straight to me with a Dinosaur book. Within minutes, I was reading to three kids on the couch. Alex's mom watched from the doorway. She's a natural, she told Alex's sister. During dinner, his sister asked if we had kids. When Alex explained about my cancer, his mom grabbed my hand. Honey, watching you with the little ones today, any child would be lucky to have you as their mother. Biology doesn't determine who's meant to be a parent. Love does. Alex's dad added, our kids are already asking when Auntie's coming back. I excused myself to cry in the bathroom, crying happy tears. When I came back, I saw my phone explode with notifications. Mom calling repeatedly. When I finally answered, her voice was shrill. What did you do? You've ruined Christmas. I was confused. What? I'm not even there. Exactly. Beatrice locked herself in the bathroom and won't stop crying for you. The twins refused to open any presents. Miles threw his plate at the wall. Rosie took my phone and called you 17 times before I caught her. My stomach dropped. These kids were suffering because of me. No, wait, Mom, Gina told me not to come. They all said I was toxic, that I was obsessed with the kids. The line went silent. Then Mom's voice turned deadly. Quiet. They said what? I explained the intervention. The words tumbled out how. They called me desperate, inappropriate, said I'd be a terrible mother. Come over here now. Me and Alex pulled into the driveway. Twenty minutes later, the front door burst open. Before we reached it, eight kids rushed me at once, a tsunami of tears and desperation. Beatrice clung to my leg. The twins grabbed my arms. Rosie sobbed into my stomach. I looked up to see my sibling standing in the doorway, faces twisted with rage. Gina started forward, but.

It's my son's Celebration today. My mom added, let's be honest, her son is way better than your daughter. I smiled and said, sure, I'll leave. My daughter Mia spent two weeks planning her birthday party. She picked ocean decorations because she's obsessed with sea turtles. She wrote invitations and careful handwriting. She was radiant that morning in her blue star dress. I specifically didn't invite my sister Vanessa or my mother, not out of spite, out of survival. For 11 years, they turned every milestone into a comparison contest between Mia and Vanessa's son Dylan. Dylan walked first, Mia talked first. Dylan made soccer team, Mia made honor roll. Back and forth, exhausting, endless. I'd stop sharing Mia's achievements with them years ago because they'd just find ways to diminish them or pivot back to Dylan. It hurt less to keep her victories private. Two hours into the party, the doorbell rang. Vanessa stood there with Dylan and my mother all dressed up like they were attending a different event entirely. Surprise, my mother chirped, pushing past me. We couldn't miss Dylan's cousin's birthday. I didn't invite you, I said. That was just an oversight. I'm sure we're family. They walked straight into the backyard. Mia froze midgame, her face falling as she saw them. My mother clapped her hands demanding attention. Now that we're all here, we have Exciting news. Dylan just got accepted into the Metropolitan Young Scholars program, extremely prestigious. You're so proud. That's great. I managed. But this is Mia's birthday party. Oh, come on, Claire, don't be selfish. We can celebrate both. You haven't said happy birthday to her once since you arrived. That's when Vanessa exploded. Why is that parasite's little brat even the focus here? It's my son's Celebration today. He's the one who actually accomplished something. The backyard went silent. Mia made a small sound like she'd been slapped.

The principal was there, the officer, the teacher and someone else. The teacher's daughter. She was in our class. But she. He hadn't raised her hand earlier. Why is she here? I asked. Nobody answered. The teacher held out her hand. Your drawings. We gave her our sketchbooks. She handed them to her daughter. The daughter flipped through my entire booklet.

We advise you cooperate. The officer was leading John to the door. John looked back at me. I didn't do anything. Tell them. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. The door closed. John was gone. The daughter left the room. I stood there, shaking. Is anyone going to explain what the hell just happened? I asked Relieved, but worried at the same time. The principal leaned back in his chair. Remember how your class did secret Santa Last week? I nodded. Well, someone gave her daughter a gift. He gestured at the teacher. It was a hand drawn manga. Detailed, multiple pages. I was confused. What? What's wrong with a manga as a present? That's when the teacher's voice cut through. Ice Cold. That manga he gave her showed my underage daughter in inappropriate scenarios with characters from Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, and one piece. I stared at her as tears filled her eyes. Someone drew my daughter as lowly content and gave it to her as a secret Santa gift. The room was spinning. Because it was secret Santa, we didn't know who made it, so we staged this. The principal gestured around. The questions, the filtering, all of it. I sat down. Damn. And John dead ass snitched on himself. Huh

Just five of us now, me, John and three others. My heart was pounding. The officer was taking notes on his clipboard. Who here draws anime, like manga art, the teacher asked. Three other kids hesitated, then shook their heads. Back to class. Just me and John left. The teacher stared at us. Her jaw was clenched. You, too? Back to the classroom. We'll call you later. We stood up immediately and walked out in silence the hallway. John's hands were shaking. Dude, what was that? I whispered. I don't know, man. Something in his voice sounded wrong.

Then she threw it across the room when Mia told her to give it back because Mia was getting annoyed with me being in her space. The bathroom thing was insane, too. They locked themselves in both bathrooms one Saturday and told me to go outside if I needed to pee because they were going to be in there all day doing face masks. But the thing that really made me mad was my eczema cream. I have bad eczema on my arms and this prescription cream is like 40 bucks. They poured out the entire tube three different times, just dumped it in the sink for no reason. Then they tried to pour their iced coffees on me because they know the sugar would make my skin flare up really bad. I told my parents everything multiple times. I stayed calm. I was polite about it. I explained exactly what was happening. And they did nothing. Every single time they'd say Georgie and Ashley are just kids or they're just having fun. My dad even said they're practically family at this point and I need to be more understanding. It's like they couldn't see that these girls were making my life miserable in my own house. So I decided if my parents weren't going to do anything, I would. Now, whenever Ashley and Georgie come over, I make it very clear they're not welcome around me. I Ignore them completely. When they try to talk to me, I tell Mia right in front of them to keep her friends away from me. They're in the living room. I walk in and say, you guys should go somewhere else because you're being annoying. I don't yell or anything. I just stated like a fact and then do whatever I was going to do. Last weekend they were here and I needed to use the kitchen. I walked in and said, can you guys go upstairs? I need to make food and I don't want you here. Mia got all embarrassed and they left. Now apparently this is a huge problem because Ashley and Georgie told their parents they don't feel welcome at our house anymore. Mia is crying saying I'm ruining her friendships. Parents sat me down for this whole lecture about being kind and how I'm making everyone uncomfortable. But honestly, I see this as a win. Those girls have made me uncomfortable in my own home for 4 years and nobody cared. Now they don't want to come over as much and suddenly everyone's concerned about people's feelings. My parents are mad at me, but at least I can exist in my own house without someone stealing my stuff or trying to pour coffee on me.

Your honor, I need to say something. My older sister framed me. She planted all the evidence. She told me at my birthday party she did it. Olivia stood up sobbing. Why are you Doing this to me. I've been trying to help you. Sit down, Judge Patterson said sharply. She looked at me. Do you have any proof of these accusations? No, your honour. But the courtroom door burst open. Dennis from the storage facility ran in holding a U. S. B. Drive and breathing hard. Your honour, I have proof she didn't do this. Judge Patterson frowned. Sir, you can't. Just please. I found the backup footage. It was on an old external drive we forgot about. Dennis loaded the U. S. B. The footage showed someone entering the storage unit 4 times. Same build as me, same hair. But in the last clip, when she turned toward the camera, a small crescent birthmark showed on her neck. I don't have that birthmark. Olivia does. Judge Patterson watched the screen. Do you have any evidence placing the defendant there? No, your honor. The prosecutor admitted the judge looked at Olivia. Stand up. Do you have a birthmark on your neck? Olivia's hand went to it automatically. I. I just wanted mom and dad to notice me. The courtroom erupted. Bailiff detain Miss Olivia Morrison, the judge said. She's under arrest for theft, perjury, evidence tampering and fraud. All charges against Riley Morrison are dismissed.

He could have my shitty life. All of it. The next day, I went to the registrar's office and transferred all my classes to the most difficult professors on campus, the ones with reputations for being impossible to pass. Then I went to the financial aid office and transferred my work study job to Jake. It was a position cleaning bathrooms in the science building that I've been trying to get out of. Anyway, I also transferred my meal plan to him. It was the cheapest one that barely covered two meals a day. Then I went to housing and requested that Jake be moved into my dorm room as my roommate, claiming we'd worked it out between ourselves. But the best part was when I found out Jake had been lying about having dirt on me. He was just bluffing. So I decided to create some real consequences for him. I sent screenshots of all his creepy messages to Megan, to the other girls he'd been pursuing. Turns out, I wasn't the only guy whose girlfriend he'd been trying to steal. Within a week, Jake was drowning in my old life. The professors were giving him failing grades. He was working late shifts cleaning toilets. He was barely eating because the meal plan sucked. His new roommate situation with me was awkward as hell because I'd started bringing dates over just to mess with him. The girls on campus had started warning each other about Him. After they saw the screenshots, his reputation was completely destroyed. He tried to transfer out of the classes and get his old job back, but the semester had already started and everything was locked in. Meanwhile, I'd use the situation to upgrade my own life. I got a better job at the campus bookstore, switch to easier classes that actually interested me, and upgraded my meal plan. Megan and I grew closer because she saw how I handled the whole situation without being dramatic or violent. Jake eventually tried to apologize and asked me to switch everything back. But I told him this was what he wanted. He wanted my life, so now he had it. The shitty parts and all. He'd threatened me and tried to steal my girlfriend, so this was just giving him exactly what he asked for. By the end of the semester, Jake had dropped out and moved back home with his parents. Turns out my life wasn't as great as he thought when he actually had to live it.

As she was dragging her kids out the door, one of them knocked over the wet floor sign I had put up. While cleaning the egg mess. The veteran guy looked at me and said, don't worry, kid. She'll be back next week. People like that always come back. And he was right. She came in the following Tuesday, but this time, she had a babysitter with her instead of the kids. The best part? She tried to act like nothing had happened, and was super friendly to all of us. When she got to my register, she even asked how my day was going. I just smiled and said, much better when kids aren't running around the store unsupervised. She turned bright red and hasn't brought her kids back since.

So my family is completely messed up and has been my entire life. My parents started dating in high school, and they've been cheating on each other constantly ever since. They got married at 19 and had me at 20. My dad even made my mom do a DNA test when I was born because he wasn't sure I was his. I am. But that didn't stop either of them from cheating. My dad has four other women he's had kids with. My mom has three other guys she's had kids with. Five of my half siblings live with us, and honestly, we're not close at all. It's just a house full of kids who exist because our parents can't stop cheating, but also can't leave each other. One of my dad's girlfriends is this woman who keeps coming back for more. They have two kids together, and she was even pregnant with a third but miscarried. She's been trying to get my dad to leave my mom for years. Apparently, he told her he couldn't leave because I would hate him if he abandoned my mom. Last Tuesday, I was home alone doing homework when someone knocked on the door. I opened it, and there she was, standing on my porch. She asked if she could come in and talk to me. I was confused, but let her in because I figured maybe it was about picking up Her kids or something. Instead, she sits down on my couch and starts telling me how much she loves my dad, how they're meant to be together, and how their kids deserve to have both parents under one roof. Then she looks me dead in the eye and says I'm being selfish for getting in the way of their happiness. She actually said my dad told her the only reason he won't leave my mom is because of me, that I would hate him, and he can't handle that. So she wanted me to give him permission to leave, to tell him I'd be okay with it so they could finally be a real family. I just stared at her for a second because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This woman has literally tried to fight my mom in

So instead, I decided to give him exactly what he wanted. I told him, fine. He could have my shitty life. All of it. The next day, I went to the registrar's office and transferred all my classes to the most difficult professors on campus, the ones with reputations for being impossible to pass. And I went to the financial aid office and transferred my work study job to Jake. It was a position cleaning bathrooms in the science building that I've been trying to get out of. Anyway, I also transferred my meal plan to him. It was the cheapest one that barely covered two meals a day. Then I went to housing and requested that Jake be moved into my dorm room as my roommate, claiming we'd worked it out between ourselves. But the best part was when I found out Jake had been lying about having dirt on me, he was just bluffing. So I decided to create some real consequences for him. I sent screenshots of all his creepy messages to Megan, to the other girls he'd been pursuing. Turns out, I wasn't the only guy whose girlfriend he'd been trying to steal. Within a week, Jake was drowning in my old life. The professors were giving him failing grades. He was working late shifts cleaning toilets. He was barely eating because the meal plan sucked. His new roommate situation with me was Awkward as hell because I'd started bringing dates over just to mess with him. The girls on campus had started warning each other about him after they saw the screenshots. His reputation was completely destroyed. He tried to transfer out of the classes and get his old job back, but the semester had already started and everything was locked in. Meanwhile, I'd use the situation to upgrade my own life. I got a better job at the campus bookstore, switch to easier classes that actually interested me, and upgraded my meal plan. Megan and I grew closer because she saw how I handled the whole situation without being dramatic or violent. Jake eventually tried to apologize and asked me to switch everything back, but I told him this was what he wanted. He wanted my life, so now he had it. The shitty parts and all. He'd threatened me and tried to steal my girlfriend, so this was just giving him exactly what he asked for. By the end of the semester, Jake had dropped out and moved back home with his parents. Turns out my life wasn't as great as he thought when he actually had to live it.

Dude showed up early every shift, stayed late if needed, helped customers like he actually cared and never complained about anything. Total opposite of most of our staff who acted like folding shirts was some kind of cruel punishment. Last Saturday, Jamie wasn't even scheduled but came in anyway because we were absolutely slammed. Some stupid influence posted about our store and suddenly everyone wanted to buy our entire stock of vintage band tees. The place was packed. Customers were getting pissy about wait times and half our scheduled staff called out sick with their usual weekend flu. Jamie just walked in wearing his regular clothes, grabbed an apron and started helping customers without anyone even asking. Worked for like 6 hours straight, handled the crazy rush and basically saved our asses from what would have been a complete disaster. I was planning to comp him some extra hours and maybe throw in a gift card or something. But then our district manager, Beth, showed up for one of her surprise visits. She's this uptight lady who treats our store like it's some kind of military operation, walks around with her clipboard measuring how far apart hangers are, timing how long bathroom breaks take. Real Fun person to be around. She sees Jamie helping customers in his jeans and hoodie instead of our stupid polo uniform and completely loses it. Starts yelling about company policy and profession.

She can stay with me. I'll bring her back tomorrow. Kevin appeared at my sister's side. That's not going to work. I wasn't asking you. My mom came in from the kitchen. What's happening? She wants Bella to sleep over. My sister said we already told her no because Kevin told you to say no. The room went quiet. Kevin tilted his head. Excuse me. Every time I ask about Bella, you answer. Every time I try to see her, you have an excuse. Every time she's in the room with you, she looks terrified. My sister stood up. That's enough. She drew me a purple elephant. Sarah, my sister, froze. She remembered. I could see it on her face. She's 6. She probably just likes purple. She looked over her shoulder three times to make sure Kevin wasn't watching before she drew it. My dad walked in. Why is everyone yelling? Because your daughter is calling me paranoid for being worried about her child. Look at Bella. Actually, look at her. Everyone turned.

When Bella was four, we invented a game. I was her favorite aunt, and she slept at my apartment every weekend. One night she asked what she should do if a monster ever tried to get her and she couldn't scream. I told her to draw a purple elephant. Why purple? She asked. Because purple elephants don't exist, I said. So if I ever see one, I'll know something is really wrong and I'll come running no matter what. She thought this was the funniest thing in the world. We Pinky promised she never used it. That was before Kevin. My sister met him at a party, and within a year they were married. He was handsome, successful, patient with Ella. Everyone said she hit the Jackpot. He adopted Bella. Within six months, they moved an hour away. And suddenly my weekend sleepovers turned into monthly visits, then holidays. Only Kevin said Bella needed stability, and my sister agreed with everything Kevin said. Thanksgiving was the first time I'd seen Bella in almost six months. Kevin always had an excuse. She's sick, she's got activities. He's overwhelmed by big gatherings. But they couldn't skip Thanksgiving. Bella walked in holding Kevin's hand and didn't let go for the first hour. The little girl who used to do cartwheels in my parents'living room sat perfectly still on the couch. I tried to Hug her. And she went stiff in my arms. Tried to talk to her and she gave one word answers while looking at Kevin. He smiled and answered for her. She's going through a shy phase. I watched them all day. The way she asked permission with her eyes before eating. The way she startled when Kevin stood up suddenly. The way her whole body relaxed for just a second when he went to the bathroom before tensing right back up when he returned. I told my sister I was worried about Ella. She rolled her eyes. You've always been dramatic. Kevin is the best father she could ask for. After dinner, Ella found me in the kitchen alone. Can we draw? She said it so quietly I almost missed it. I grabbed some paper and crayons. She drew for a few minutes. Flowers, a dog, her house. Then she stopped and looked toward the doorway. Kevin wasn't there. She grabbed the purple crayon, drew fast, pushed the paper into my hands, and walked away before I could respond.

My testimony was the only thing that put him at the scene. He got 25 years. I ran upstairs with the clipping, burst into the kitchen right as my parents walked in with grocery bags. What is this? I shoved the newspaper at my mom. She dropped a bag. Oranges rolled across the floor. Oh, god, sweetheart, you let me testify against my own father. I was 7. My dad stepped forward. You need to calm down and let us explain. Explain what? That I put someone in prison. My mom was crying. Now full on sobbing. Baby, you told the truth. You told them what you saw. Did I, the question came out like a scream. Did I actually see it or did someone make me think I did? My dad's face changed just for a second. Something flickered there. Doubt maybe or fear. The investigators, he said slowly, they asked you questions, showed you photos of the warehouse, showed you pictures of your father and Chen together. They were trying to help you remember. So, or they were putting memories in my head that were never there. My mom sank into a chair. His Parole hearing is next Tuesday. They want you to testify again to confirm what you said back then. And what if I can't? What if I don't actually remember? The look my parents exchanged told me everything I needed to know. They didn't know if I was telling the truth either. Nobody did. So what do I do? My voice cracked. Do I send my father back to prison for another decade based on memories I'm not sure even real?

You're sticking to the story, right? I stopped midway. What investigators? His face went white. Wait. Did nobody tell you? My aunt grabbed his wrist so hard, her knuckles turned pale. David, not here. The entire lunch table went silent. My cousin Becca suddenly found her phone fascinating. My younger brother pushed his tray away and stared at his lap. Even the cafeteria noise around us seemed to fade. Tell me. What? My voice came out sharper than I meant. Finish your lunch, my aunt said, but her hands were shaking as she stood up. We'll talk at home. They left me sitting there with cold fries and a stomach that felt like it was full of rocks. I skipped my last two classes. Couldn't focus. Couldn't stop replaying my uncle's face when he realized I didn't know about some investigators. When I got home early, I heard voices in the kitchen. I stopped in the hallway. She needs to know what she said. That was my dad's voice, slower than usual. She was 7 years old, Thomas, 7. My mom sounded like she'd been crying. She didn't understand what she was doing. The hearing is in six days. They're going to want to talk to her again. I pressed my back against the wall. What hearing? What if she remembers it differently now? What if she. She won't. She can't, cause she Was telling the truth back then, wasn't she? The silence that followed felt like it lasted forever. I waited until they left for the grocery store. Then I went into our basement. The place where we keep old boxes that nobody ever opens. I'd seen my mom go down there once last week and come back up crying. It took me 20 minutes to find it. A plastic bin labelled legal documents 2,009, in my mom's handwriting. Inside were folders, court papers and newspaper clippings wrapped in rubber bands. The headline made my hands start shaking. 7 year olds testimony key in Miller case. There was a photo beneath it. Me at seven, wearing a blue dress. I vaguely remembered sitting in what looked like a courtroom. I was holding a stuffed rabbit. I grabbed another clipping. Child witness places father at scene of death. Father? My biological father. I barely remembered him. Just fragments. A deep voice, the smell of coffee. A scratchy beard. When he kissed my forehead, I kept reading. His business partner had died, they called it.

Asking how long poison takes to work. My heart stopped. He what? I was already grabbing my keys, knocking over my coffee in the process. The hot liquid spread across my desk, soaking into papers I've been reviewing, but I didn't care. Doctor Morrison's voice was steady but concerned. Lucas walked in alone during lunch, asking very specific medical questions about toxins and how long they take to affect someone. Where are you right now? I was at work 20 minutes away if I hit every green light. Is he okay? Where is he now? He's physically fine, sitting in my office with my nurse. But there's something else. He had bruises on his arms. He tried to hide when we examined him. Fresh ones, maybe two days old. Racing through traffic. My mind was spinning in every direction. Lucas was 11, grade a student, never even got detention. The kid who rescued earthworms from sidewalks after rain, the one who apologized to furniture when he bumped into it. This wasn't making any sense. When I burst into the pediatrician's office, the receptionist didn't even make me sign in. She just pointed down the hall. Lucas was hunched over in the corner chair, his Spider Man backpack at his feet, wouldn't look at me. His hair was messier than when I dropped him off that morning. His favorite NASA shirt had a small tear near the collar. I Hadn't noticed before, Buddy. What's going on? Silence. The sneakers were untied, dangling off his feet like he'd been kicking them nervously. Then Doctor Morrison showed me what Lucas had brought, a crumpled ziplock bag with mushrooms from our backyard. Some were the white ones that grew near the fence. Others were those orange brown ones from under the oak tree. He wanted to know if these were dangerous, how much would hurt someone, what symptoms they'd cause. Lucas, talk to me, please. Finally, tears. They came suddenly like a dam breaking mom. Tyler and his friends said they were going to make me eat dirt and bugs again at recess. Worse this time. They said Monday was gonna be special. They found a dead bird behind the cafeteria dumpster. My stomach turned. I sat down hard on the examination table, the paper crinkling beneath me. How long has this been happening? Since September. Every Tuesday and Thursday when we have second recess, they do it behind the equipment shed where the kindergarten playground used to be. The teachers can't see because of the big blue slide blocking the view.

Then she threw it across the room when Mia told her to give it back because Mia was getting annoyed with me being in her space. The bathroom thing was insane, too. They locked themselves in both bathrooms one Saturday and told me to go outside if I needed to pee because they were going to be in there all day doing face masks. But the thing that really made me mad was my eczema cream. I have bad eczema on my arms, and this prescription cream is, like, 40 bucks. They poured out the entire tube three different times, just dumped it in the sink for no reason. Then they tried to pour their iced coffees on me because they know the sugar would make my skin flare up really bad. I told my parents everything multiple times. I stayed calm, I was polite about it. I explained exactly what was happening, and they did nothing. Every single time, they'd say, Georgie and Ashley are just kids, or they're just having fun. My dad even said they're practically family at this point, and I need to be more understanding. It's like they couldn't see that these girls were making my life miserable in my own house. So I decided if my parents weren't going to do anything, I would. Now whenever Ashley and Georgie come over, I make it very clear they're not welcome. Around me, I ignore them completely. When they try to talk to me, I tell Mia right in front of them to keep her friends away from me. They're in the living room. I walk in and say, you guys should go somewhere else because you're being annoying. I don't yell or anything. I just stated it like a fact and then do whatever I was going to do. Last weekend, they were here, and I needed to use the kitchen. I walked in and said, can you guys go upstairs? I need to make food, and I don't want you here. Mia got all embarrassed and they left. Now, apparently, this is a huge problem because Ashley and Georgie told their parents they don't feel welcome at our house anymore. Mia is crying, saying I'm ruining her friendships. Parents sat me down for this whole lecture about being kind and how I'm making everyone uncomfortable. But honestly, I see this as a win. Those girls have made me uncomfortable in my own home for four years, and nobody cared. Now they don't want to come over as much, and suddenly everyone's concerned about people's feelings. My parents are mad at me, but at least I can exist in my own house without someone stealing my stuff or trying to pour coffee on me.

Not that I don't love our kids, but I completely lost myself. I don't know who Sarah is anymore. Only Emma and Jake's mom. I felt punched in the chest. Had I stolen her entire youth? Was I the villain in her story? The guilt was overwhelming. We started couples therapy with Doctor Martinez. For months, Sarah barely spoke during sessions, but Doctor Martinez kept pushing. What did you want before kids? What made you happy as a teenager? Slowly pieces emerged. Sarah had been valedictorian, accepted to three universities with marine biology programs. She'd had this whole plan mapped out, study abroad, graduate summa cum laude, maybe work for N O a a. Someday. She'd wanted to save the oceans. I don't resent Emma and Jake, she finally said during one session, tears streaming. I resent that I never got to choose. Everything just happened to me. Doctor Martinez gave us homework, write letters to our 18 year old selves. Arah's was seven pages long, full of apologies and promises. Mine was shorter. I'm sorry we had to grow up so fast. Reading those letters broke something open between. For the first time in years, we really saw each other not as co parents or roommates, but as scared teenagers who'd had their lives derailed by one pregnancy test. That's when I asked the question, question that changed everything. Sarah, if you could go back in time. And choose differently, would you? The silence stretched forever. I held my breath, terrified of her answer. Finally, tears streaming, but her voice steady. She looked at me and said, I choose you every single time without hesitation. But I'd also choose me. I'd insist we wait until we were ready, until we become whole people. First, rebuilding now Sarah enrolled in online biology classes. We hired Missus Jessica to babysit twice a week so Sarah can have girls nights. I'm learning to see her not just as my wife and the kids mom, but as Sarah, this brilliant woman who got derailed but never really died. And I've begun taking cooking classes, doing what I love once again.

Friday, another appointment, same thing. I walked out to the car and he did it again, forward, back, forward, back. This time I actually yelled at him through the window. He stopped and unlocked the door, still grinning. You're so easy to mess with right now, he said. I didn't talk to him the entire appointment. When we got home, I tried explaining it again. I said I was tired, my body hurt, and I just wanted one thing to be easy. He said I was overreacting and that if I can't handle a simple joke, how was I going to handle raising a kid? That made me so mad, I went to the bedroom and locked the door. Monday rolled around, another appointment. I should have known better, but I gave him one more chance. I walked out to the car at 8:30 in the morning. My lower back felt like someone was jabbing a knife into it. I barely slept the night before because the baby kept kicking my ribs. I reached for the door. He drove forward. I stopped walking. He reversed, did it again, then again. I counted six times, six full times of him moving that car. While I stood there, I pulled out my phone and called my mom. She answered on the second ring. I asked if she could drive me to my appointment because Kevin was being ridiculous, he said. She'd be there in 10 minutes. I went back inside and grabbed my purse. Kevin finally parked the car and came in asking what I was doing. I told him he wasn't taking me anymore. He laughed and said I was being dramatic. I said he was banned from all future appointments until the baby came. He stopped laughing then he said I couldn't be serious. I said I was completely serious. He said it was just a joke and I was acting insane. I said if he thought annoying his pregnant wife was funny, he could stay home and think about it. My mom showed up. I got in her car. Kevin stood in the driveway with his arms crossed look can confused. My mom didn't ask questions, just drove me to the doctor and waited in the lobby like a normal person. The doctor asked where Kevin was. I said he couldn't make it. She didn't push it. When I got home, Kevin was sitting on the couch eating chips and watching sports. He asked if I was done being mad. I said no. He said I was making a huge deal out of nothing. I went to the bedroom and started looking up which appointments he actually needed to be at legally. Turns out none of them.

No employee badge, no desk, no name on any org chart. Just a contractor buried so deep in their paperwork that most people didn't know I was real. But the code running their entire banking compliance system, that was 100% mine. For two years, I worked directly under David, the CFO. He was the only one who understood what I actually did. I built the digital backbone that kept their 22 million dollar credit line active with the bank. Every transaction, every audit check, every compliance flag, it all ran through my architecture. David kept me hidden on purpose. He knew I hated office politics and just wanted to code in peace from my apartment. We had a perfect system. Everything worked.

The second David left, Ryan declared himself acting operational lead and started his reign of terror. Mandatory status reports, team restructures, buzzword filled emails about visibility.

Brief sync tomorrow at 8:30. Bring documentation of deliverables. I showed up at 8:27. Ryan was already smirking in his glass office. Julie, he said, not offering me a seat. We've reviewed your contract. There's too much ambiguity around your role here. So effective immediately, you're terminated. Delete all company files from your laptop. All your work belongs to us now. He slid a printed memo across the desk, already signed. It literally ordered me to permanently delete all local data and systems. I read it once, folded it, put it in my bag. Understood. No arguing. I just left. At home, I made coffee and opened my laptop. Per Ryan's written order, I deleted everything. Every line of code, every backup, every test file. Gone. But here's what Ryan didn't understand. My value wasn't stored on my laptop. It was built into the system itself. I'd embedded authentication triggers tied to my digital signature. If my credentials got deleted improperly, the system would flag it as a security breach and freeze everything until the bank verify.

Imagine telling your kid daddy was deployed when you were conceived. Then I got emergency leave approved. First, stop changing my locks. Tiara had been living in my house with Derek. I walked in to find Derek's clothes in my closet, his gaming setup in my office, ultrasound photos on my fridge, and a future Mr. And Mrs. Morrison sign in the living room. Morrison? Derek's last name. While packing their stuff, I found Tiara's pregnancy journal. One entry made my blood boil. Derek says we should wait until Evans deployed longer so we can't contest anything. Military guys get screwed in court. This baby will secure the bag. Then they came home. Derek went white seeing me. Bro. Oh, I can explain. Get out of my house! Tiara started her performance. Baby, you're home! I missed you so much. You're three months pregnant with this kid. Stop! She switched tactics. Crying. You don't understand. And you left me alone for Eight months alone with Derek in my bed that I paid for. Derek actually stepped forward. Hey, man, no need to be disrespectful. You're unemployed, living in my house with my girlfriend, raising your baby. Who's disrespectful? He said, well, technically, it's Tiara's house, too. No, her name is not on anything. Tiara called her mom on Speaker. Mom Evans, kicking me out while I'm pregnant. Donna's response, you will provide for that baby. I don't care whose it is. Derek can't work because of his back. Back seemed fine. When he was moving his gaming chair out, the cops came. The officer looked at my documentation. Deed bills, deployment papers, screenshots of her announcement. He looked at Derek, then obviously pregnant tiara, then back at me. Sir, it's your house. They need to leave. Derek tried one last play. What about the baby? The officer replied, what about basic math, son? They're gone. I changed everything. Locks, passwords, Netflix account. Last I heard, Derek's back problems mysteriously healed when he needed a job to support his baby.

So I asked her one question that changed everything. We've been together since sophomore year of high school. Everyone thought we were the perfect couple. Homecoming king and queen voted most likely to get married. But life had other plans. Sarah got pregnant two weeks before graduation. We were both eighteen aired and completely unprepared. My parents kicked me out. Hers threatened to disown her. We moved into a tiny studio apartment above Tony's Pizza where I worked nights for $8 an hour to pay rent. Our daughter Emma was born that October during a snowstorm. I'll never forget holding her in that freezing hospital room, realizing we were responsible for another human being when we could barely take care of ourselves. Two years later came our son, Jake. By 22, we had two kids, massive debt and zero social life. While our friends posted college party pics on Facebook, we were changing diapers at 3 a. M. And arguing about whether we could afford name brand formula. Sarah's college acceptance letters gathered dust in a shoebox. For 12 years, we just survived. I worked construction, coming home covered in dust. Sarah stayed home with the kids, slowly disappearing into herself. We convinced ourselves we were happy because Emma and Jake were thriving, but we weren't living, just existing. The breaking point came during Jake's 12th birthday party. I watched Sarah fake a smile through the Whole thing, playing the perfect mom while her eyes looked completely empty. Later that night, cleaning up alone in the kitchen, she finally exploded. I never got to be young, she sobbed. I went straight from being someone's daughter to someone's mother. I don't even know who I am without these roles. That night, she told me about dreams she'd buried. She'd wanted to study marine biology, become a researcher studying coral reefs. She dreamed of backpacking through Europe, learning Spanish, having a career that mattered. She wanted friends who didn't just talk about soccer schedules. Sometimes I want.

It was intentional. Ryan had just ripped out a load bearing wall thinking it was decorative. Within hours, the bank's automated compliance checker detected the unauthorized credential deletion. At two o three PM, Cavara's entire 22 million dollar credit line was frozen pending investigation. Ryan didn't notice. He was too busy posting on Slack about reducing contractor waste. By Monday, David had seen the bank's alert and came back early. He walked straight into the legal conference room and asked, why is Julie's credential showing a non standard termination? Nobody had an answer. No off boarding ticket, no compliance hand off. Just Ryan's memo. When they dragged Ryan into the room, David asked, did you authorized the deletion? Ryan stammered. I asked her to remove her local data. Standard practice. You ordered her to delete operational IP while still credentialed to a live banking system, David said, projecting my authentication logs on the wall. You triggered a cascading compliance failure that froze $22 million. The room went silent. Ryan was suspended immediately. Security walked him out. That afternoon, David called me. We need you back. Store what you can. I logged in with my emergency credential. The system recognized me instantly. My signature was still there, waiting in the code. Like a ghost in the machine. I restored the architecture in 12 minutes. The banks dashboard turned green. Credit line unfrozen. I logged one final note. Unauthorized credential removal triggers automatic integrity cascade. This was the design. Then I closed my Laptop. David texted later, we're working on reinstating your contract long term. I didn't reply, not yet, because I knew they'd survive this and rebrand it as a learning experience. But me, I'd already Learned my lesson years ago. Always build your systems to scream when someone tries to erase you. And always keep a copy of the memo where your boss orders you to delete everything in writing. Ryan Learned that one the hard way.

Now my brother's telling me she figured it out, that she's cut off her grandparents, that she knows they lied. She's been asking about you, he texted, wants to talk. I put my phone down, made coffee, stared out the window at the snow. Part of me wanted to get on a plane, see her, hear her say she was sorry, finally get to be her dad again. But the bigger part of me remembered her face the day she left, the way she looked at me like I was nothing, like I'd killed her mom, myself. You don't come back from that? Not really. My brother called. I let it go to voicemail. He called again. Look, he said, when I finally picked up, I get it. But dad would want you here. Is she gonna be there? I asked. Yeah, she's helping plan everything. She's, she's different now. Grew up. Good for her. Don't be like that. Like what? I spent two years getting destroyed by my own kid. You weren't there for the worst of it. You didn't see what it was like. He was quiet then. She was a kid. They lied to her. I know they lied to her. But she's the one who decided I wasn't worth listening to. She made her choice. She was 14 and now she's 26 years too late. I hung up. He texted me the funeral details.

The thing nobody tells you about having a kid who hates you is that it doesn't go away. Even when they're gone, even when you move to another country, you still wake up sometimes and remember them at 5 years old showing you a drawing they made at school. And then you remember them at 14 screaming that they wish you were dead instead of mom. Both versions exist in your head at the same time and it makes you crazy.

So I worked for this guy named Brett who was only rich because his grandparents owned like half the commercial real estate downtown. This dude had zero clue how to run a business. I'm talking, he once spent $40,000 on office chairs that didn't even fit through the doorways. We had to sell them at a loss on Facebook Marketplace. Another time he approved a marketing campaign that was just his face photoshopped onto a bunch of stock photos. We got sued for using those images without a license, cost the company like 60,000 to settle. But here's the thing, he had unlimited money from his trust fund, so he just kept screwing up and burning cash like it was nothing. Meanwhile, I was the operations manager, basically holding the whole company together with duct tape. And every single day he'd come in with some new brilliant idea that would bankrupt us in a week. I'd have to be like, yeah, that's not gonna work and explain why in simple terms a 5th grader could understand. He hated that, called me negative, said I wasn't a team player. But the real issue was I made him look stupid in front of the other employees because I had to constantly shoot down his terrible plans. Like one time he wanted to expand into selling furniture, even though we were a consulting firm. Made zero sense. I told him no. And he got so mad he didn't talk to me for three days. The guy would also never stop bragging about his education. Had a Masters and PhD in economics from this decent university. And he brought it up constantly. His email signature was like four lines long with all his titles, Dr Brett this and Dr Brett that. Every meeting he'd reference his dissertation or some theory he supposedly studied. It was exhausting. So one day he calls me into his office and fires me. Says the company is going in a new direction and my negative attitude isn't aligned with the vision. I'm like, what vision? You don't even know what we do here. But whatever. I took my Severance and left. I was pretty bitter about it for a few weeks. Then I'm sitting at home one night scrolling through stuff and I remember thinking, there's no way this moron actually earned those degrees. He was way too stupid. Like genuinely could not understand basic spreadsheets. So I decide to look up his thesis papers just out of curiosity. I go to the university library website and they have digital copies of old theses. I download his master's thesis first from 1984. I start reading and immediately on page 2, there's this whole paragraph about economic theory that sounds way too smart for him. So I copy the sentence and Google it. Boom, it's word for word from a textbook published in 1979. No citation, no quotation Marks nothing. I keep reading and find another paragraph.

I'm 6 months pregnant right now. My husband Kevin drives me to every single doctor appointment because my back hurts too much to drive myself anymore. But here's the thing, every single time we leave the house, he does this stupid prank. I walk to the car, I reach for the door handle and he drives forward like two feet, then he stops and reverses back, then drives forward again, then back. He does it like 4 or 5 times while I'm just standing there in the driveway looking like an idiot. The first time he did it was back in month 3. I actually laughed because I thought it was just a one time dumb joke. But then he kept doing it every appointment, week after week, same exact prank. I'm standing there with my hand out and he's inching the car back and forth like I'm some kind of trained seal trying to get fish. Last Tuesday, we had an ultrasound appointment at 9 in the morning. I woke up super nauseous, barely kept down half a piece of toast. My feet were swollen, my back was killing me and I really just wanted to get to the doctor and back home. I walked out to the car in my stretched out sweatpants and one of Kevin's old college hoodies because nothing else fits anymore. I grabbed the door handle. He Drove forward. I stepped forward. He reversed forward again, back again. I just stood there staring at him through the window. He was laughing so hard his face turned red. I yanked the door open when he finally stopped and got in without saying a word. He kept giggling the whole drive there. Come on, babe, it's funny. You gotta admit it's a little funny. I didn't respond. I just looked out the window and counted the street lights until we got there. At the appointment, the doctor asked if everything was okay at home. I said yes. Kevin sat there scrolling through his phone the entire time, not even paying attention. When they showed us the baby on the screen that afternoon, I told him to stop doing the car thing. I said it wasn't funny anymore and it actually made me frustrated. He rolled his eyes and said I was being too sensitive and that pregnancy hormones were making me crazy. He said it was just a harmless joke and I needed to lighten up.

I was sitting in my math class last year, and we were doing this insanely hard problem that nobody could figure out. The teacher had been explaining it for 20 minutes, and everyone was just staring at their papers like zombies. I wasn't even paying attention because I was doodling on the side of my notebook. Random shapes, a stick figure doing a backflip. The usual. Then suddenly, the teacher called on me. I looked up like a deer in headlights. I didn't even know what the question was, but I looked at the board, and somehow I just got it. Like, instantly the numbers made sense in a way I can't even explain. I told the teacher the answer, and she just stood there for a second. Her marker was still hovering in the air. Then she said, that's correct. The entire class turned around and looked at me like I was some kind of alien. Some kid in the back whispered, wait, what just happened? But here's where it gets crazy. This girl Sarah, who's, like, the biggest try hard in the school and thinks she's a literal genius, got some mad. She sits in the front row, takes notes in three different colored pens, and corrects people when they pronounce words wrong. She started arguing with the teacher, saying, I must have cheated or looked it up on my phone. My phone was face down on my Desk. I wasn't even paying attention. The teacher told her to calm down, but Sarah wasn't having it. She was getting louder, her voice cracking a little. She demanded the teacher give me a harder problem to prove I was actually smart. The whole class went silent. You can hear someone's pencil drop in the back. So my teacher, who honestly found this whole thing hilarious, wrote this insane equation on the board that wasn't even part of our curriculum. It had fractions, exponents, and some symbols I'm pretty sure she made up. She said, if you can solve this, I'll give you extra credit. I walked up to the board, grabbed the marker, and solved it in two minutes. I could feel Sarah's eyes burning a hole in the back of my head. When I turned around, her face went completely red. She stood up, grabbed her stuff, and just walked out of class. Didn't even ask permission. Just marched straight to the door and slammed it behind her. The teacher let her go because she was clearly having a breakdown. One kid started slow clapping. Another person said, that was the most dramatic exit I've ever seen. When Sarah came back the next day, she didn't look at me once. Not in the hallway, not in class, nowhere. Then I found out she requested to switch classes. She told the counselor she needed a more advanced learning environment. Translation, she couldn't handle being wrong. My teacher pulled me. Aside after AND told me I should join the math competition team. I said sure, why not. Turns out I was actually pretty good at it.

So I flew in from Austin for my friend Jenna's wedding last summer. I'm talking. I took three days off work, bought a plane ticket, got a hotel room, the whole deal. Jenna and I have been friends since college, and I wasn't missing this for anything. I wore this bright yellow dress. Like, not pale yellow or cream or anything confusing. I'm talking highlighter yellow. The kind of yellow where you look at it in the store and think, is this too much? But then you buy it anyway because it's fun. My sister saw me before I left and said I looked like a human sunflower. My husband said I was glowing. Nobody, and I mean nobody, said anything about it being wedding inappropriate. The ceremony was beautiful. Jenna cried, her husband cried, I cried. During cocktail hour, I got, like, six compliments on the dress. Jenna herself came up to me twice and said how much she loved it and how happy she was I came. Everything was perfect. Dinner happened, speeches happened, cake happened. I was having the best time. My feet hurt from dancing, and I'd already had two glasses of champagne. This was exactly what a wedding should be. Then around 10 at night, they dimmed the regular lights and turned on black lights for this whole glow party vibe they had planned. People had glow Sticks. The decorations lit up. It looked cool. But apparently, under the black light, my dress wasn't glowing yellow anymore. It looked white. Or white enough that someone had a problem with it. This bridesmaid named Ashley came up to me while I was standing by the dessert table. She didn't even say hi or anything. Just walked straight up and said, you need to leave. Your dress is white and it's inappropriate. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. I said, it's yellow. The black light is just making it look different. She crossed her arms and said, it looks white now, and you need to go. I told her, I flew here from Texas. I'm not leaving before the bride and groom leave, and my dress is yellow. She got this look on her face and said, if you don't leave, I'll make you leave. I just stared at her like, what do you even say to that? I repeated that I'm here to celebrate Jenna. The dress is clearly yellow, and I'm not going anywhere. She walked away without saying anything else. I watched her go straight to the groom and start pointing at me. He looked over, looked at my dress, shrugged, and kept dancing. That was it. He literally didn't care at all. I figured that was the end of it. I stayed another hour, said goodbye to Jenna and her husband, congratulated them again, and left. The next morning, I met up With some other friends for breakfast at the hotel. This guy Trevor, who I knew from college but wasn't in the wedding party, sat down and immediately brought it up. He said he heard what happened and that I should have just left when Ashley asked because it made people uncomfortable. He said I was making it about partying instead of respecting wedding etiquette. I put my fork down and asked him if he was serious. I asked if he actually thought my bright yellow dress was a problem, or if he was just repeating what Ashley said. He didn't really have an answer for that. Here's the thing. If Jenna had asked me to leave, I would have left immediately. If the groom had come over and said anything, I would have apologized and walked out. But neither of them did. The groom literally shrugged it off. Jenna complimented my dress multiple times before the black lights even came on. I texted Jenna a few days later just to check in and make sure everything was okay. She he had no idea any of this even happened. She said Ashley didn't mention it, and she loved my dress and loved that I came. She actually apologized that someone made me feel weird about it.

Whose baby? I'm staring at my phone at 3:00am in Afghanistan. My girlfriend tiara just posted this elaborate pregnancy announcement on Instagram. Pink balloons, professional photos, the works. Caption read, finally pregnant, 3 months alone. Time to lock this idiot down. Military wifey comments everywhere. Why is she baby on board? He doesn't know yet. I did the math, then did it again. I've been deployed for 8 months. Last time I was home was January. It's now September. Three months pregnant means she conceived in June when I was 5,000 miles away eating m R E. S. Type 1 comment, who's baby? What happened next was biblical. Her phone started going insane. Comments flooding in. People doing the same math I did. Screenshots spreading everywhere. She tried to delete the post but it kept glitching, failing while people kept screenshotting. Within an hour, I had 73 DMs from mutual friends. My mom was calling at 3:00am her time. But the part Tiara's mom commented before the deletion, so proud Derek will be such a good father. Derek, not my name. I'm Evan. Then tiara went live fake crying about being a deploy I meant widow and how I abandoned her. She slipped up again. Derek, I mean, therapy has helped me realize, someone commented, therapists don't usually father their patients babies, hon. She ended the live immediately. Then my neighbor Derek, the guy I asked to check On her messaged me, bro, what did you expect? I was there when you weren't. Do the right thing and let her go. PS, she's moving in with me. The audacity was unreal. This unemployed dude living off my deployed girlfriend wants me to do the right thing. I screenshot everything and sent it to everyone we know. But wait, it gets worse. Tiara's mom called my mom at 4:00am. My mom recorded the whole thing. Her mom said, your son needs to accept responsibility. My mom asked for what? He's been deployed eight months. Tiara's mom replied, for abandoning tiara. She had needs. The baby needs support from its real father, Derek. But Evan makes more money. Military pays. Well, Derek's between jobs. Between jobs. This dude's been unemployed the whole time. Then came the legal threats. Some sketchy lawyer emailed my military account demanding money.

I told him that made zero sense. He just said, please don't start drama right now. My wife was furious, like pacing around the kitchen furious. But we talked about it and realized if we made a huge deal out of it right then, Jess might just change the name on the birth certificate before it got finalized. We came up with a plan. We'd act like we were still using our original name until my nephew's name was locked in. Legally in our state, you have six months to make changes easily. But after that, it's a whole process with courts and fees. So for the next four months, we kept our mouths shut. When people asked what we were naming our son, we'd say the original name. We had a baby shower where people bought stuff with that name on it. We smiled through it even though it felt gross. Our son was born 4 months ago and we filled out the birth certificate paperwork with a completely different name, a name we actually loved even more. We didn't announce it on social media. We just told close family in person and asked them to keep it quiet for now. Then last week, we finally posted his real name online. My parents called and said they totally understood why we did it. My sisters thought it was smart. Honestly, my wife's family was confused at first but then got it once we explained my Brother, though, he called me pissed, said Jess was crying because we, quote, ruined her vision of the boys growing up connected with the same name. He said it was manipulative and sneaky, that we should have just talked to them. I told him his wife literally stole our name after snooping and he just shrugged like it wasn't a big deal. He kept saying lots of people have the same name and it's fine. I asked him if he thought about how confusing it would be when both boys are in the same school district with the exact same first, middle and last name or when they're both going to the same family doctor or getting bank accounts or literally anything official. He said that's not a real problem and we're just being dramatic and trying to own a name that nobody owns. Jess texted my wife saying she felt betrayed and that we were being selfish and making everything harder for no reason. My wife blocked her. My brother hasn't talked to me in like a week now.

My boyfriend Kevin eats the same chicken stir fry every single day. Not just for dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner. Same exact dish from this Chinese place called Golden Dragon 20 minutes away. It costs 38 bucks per order, and he refuses to eat leftovers because the texture gets weird after reheating. So we're dropping over $200 a week on the same meal while I'm eating ramen and frozen pizza to save money. I tried talking to him about it. He said I don't get how his brain works, that this food is safe and predictable, and everything else makes him anxious. Said, I understand, but our bank account is literally crying. We thought about it twice, but he just shut down both times and wouldn't speak to me for hours. So I got creative. I ordered the stir fry, took it home, and literally picked it apart like a science project. Wrote down every ingredient I could identify. Spent three days watching YouTube videos and testing recipes in our tiny kitchen. Finally made something that looked exactly the same. Same vegetables, cut the same way, same sauce, colour, everything. Kevin tried it and loved it. Said it tasted perfect. For two whole weeks, he ate my homemade version without complaining once. I was saving us like 150 bucks a week. Felt like a genius. Then he walked into the kitchen while I was cooking and saw me pour soy sauce into the Pan he completely froze. Asked what that was. I said soy sauce, obviously. He got this look on his face like I just told him I was putting poison in his food. Started saying he hates soy sauce, it's not a safe food, the taste makes him feel sick. Man, did I make it without soy sauce from now on? I explained that soy sauce is literally the base of the entire dish. No soy sauce means it won't taste right at all. He didn't care. Said it would taste better without it because soy sauce is gross and I should have asked him first. So I made it without soy sauce. It tasted like absolutely nothing. Just bland vegetables and chicken with some garlic. Kevin took one bite and immediately knew something was wrong. But instead of admitting the soy sauce was important, he accused me of changing other stuff too. Said I was messing with his food on purpose to prove a point. Told me he didn't trust my cooking anymore and wanted to go back to Golden Dragon. $300 and takeout orders later. I was picking up his dinner and just casually asked the guy at the counter if there was soy sauce in the stir fry. He laughed and said, obviously. It's like half the sauce. I felt so validated. I told Kevin in the car on the way home. Thought he'd be relieved like, oh, okay, soy sauce isn't actually bad. Then instead he went Completely silent. When we got home, he walked straight to our room with the takeout bag and didn't come out all night. Didn't eat the stir fry, just left it sitting on his desk. For three days he barely spoke to me. Used this really quiet, sad voice whenever he had to say anything. Started sleeping on the couch. But now he won't eat his safe food at all, and his family thinks I'm some kind of monster.

So I decided to find justice on my own. As a former police officer, I had some connections with the worst type of people. I called one of them on the phone and said, do you remember when I let your little brother off the hook? It's time to pay back that debt. He had seen the news, so he already knew what I wanted and wasted no time in saying yes. But that girl wouldn't regret her actions even if someone kidnapped her. So I took a different approach. Within three months, every single dirty deal that that congressman made was out in the public. The authorities didn't just take him into custody, they took all his property and assets as well.

I need a job, he said quietly. I'll do anything. I could have said. No part of me wanted to. I knew that if I were in his position, he would have just kicked me to the curb. But I was different. Okay, I said. Standard salary for your experience level. Same benefits as everyone else. His face fell. That's barely more than entry level. I smiled. Well, you'll have to work your way up like everyone else here does. Fair pay for fair work. That's how we run things. He took the job, sometimes complained about the salary and decisions. But here's the thing. I didn't expect after a few months of watching how my team actually functioned, seeing how happy everyone was, how productive we were, he started putting in real effort. Last week, he stayed late to help fix the critical bug and didn't ask for extra pay. Yesterday, he told me he was proud of what I built and asked if I needed help with the expansion plans. Now we're thinking of starting over again.

I drove six hours straight and found her starving in a storage closet. In high school, I sold vapes to freshmen and thought fear meant respect. Then I got this girl I was seeing pregnant, spent about four months playing house before I came home drunk one night and she went off saying, you're a loser who will never be a good dad. We'd be better off with you dead. So I drove her to her mom's house and left town. I've been sending her about 500 to 1,000 dollars every month for our daughter working construction 12 hours away. My mom lives near them and was the one who suggested I just live my own life. She checks in on them for me, handles the money, even has my daughter Facetime me once a month. My daughter is always smiling and my mom keeps saying everything's great, so I believe it. At 2:00am, my phone rings. My daughter's voice is on the other end, tiny and terrified. Mommy's gone and I'm hungry and I don't know what to do. I'm already grabbing keys as I tell her, baby, I'm coming right now. Where's Mommy? The line goes dead. I call back voice, voice mail, call my ex, voice mail, call my mom, voice mail. I'm doing 90 on the highway and nobody's answering. Six hours later, I burst through my ex's unlocked door and The smell hits me first, rotting food mixed with chemicals. I find my daughter in a glorified storage closet on a bare mattress with springs poking through, covered in dry.

I carry her to the bathroom, but there's black mold in the tub and no clean towels, so I use my shirt and bottled water from my truck. Then I see the padlocked bedroom door. I kick it open. Inside is a red room with cameras on tripods, ring lights and piles of costumes. My ex told me she was making YouTube movie reactions, not doing cam work, all while my daughter starves in the next room.

Everyone stopped talking. Do you guys even love me? I said. Mom's face went pale. What? Of course we do. Why would you ask that? So I told them everything. I pulled out my phone and read from my list. Kevin's party versus mine. The laptop situation. Every single debate competition they missed. How they drove six hours to watch Kevin play in a football tournament, but wouldn't drive three to see me compete at state finals. The car, the report cards. Every single thing I've been keeping track of for four years. Dad tried to interrupt. You're being dramatic. We treat you both the same. You literally bought him a car. I got a bus pass. And you told me it builds character to use public transportation. That's different. Kevin needed it for his job. I applied to seven jobs. All of them said no because I don't have reliable transportation. But sure, that's different. Mom started crying. We. I didn't realize you felt this way. You never said anything. I shouldn't have to. I said you should just love me the same way you love Kevin. But you don't. You never have. Kevin looked uncomfortable. Dude, that's not fair. They love you. When's my birthday? I asked him. He went quiet. He didn't know I knew his. June 14th. He'd never once remembered mine without mom reminding him. And I could see on his face. Right, Then that he had no idea. October 9th said, in case you were wondering. I left the table, went to my room, locked the door. I could hear them talking downstairs, but couldn't make out the words. Around midnight, mom knocked. I didn't answer. She slid a note under the door. I didn't read it. The next morning there was an envelope on the kitchen counter with my name on it. Inside was a check for fifteen hundred dollars and a note from dad for a car. We're sorry. We should have done better. Mom had made my favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes. We only made those on special occasions, and she'd made a huge stack. They were both sitting at the table when I came down. Dad looked like he hadn't slept. We wanna hear about your program, he said. Tell us everything. So I did. And for the first time in years, they actually listened.

So my daughter Mia is 9, small, cute, and built like chaos in human form. If evil had a sparkle, it would be her. One day, my genius husband decided Roblox was rotting her brain. So he stood in the living room like he was passing a law and said, no more Roblox in this house. I looked at him like, great, can't wait to meet your ghost. Mia froze, blinked twice, whispered, interesting. So you woke up today and chose dumb? Five minutes later, our Wi-Fi went down. My husband started panicking like he lost life support. He rebooted the router, checked cables, unplugged everything. Nothing. Mia walked by eating a popsicle like, ah, the internet died. So sad, so mysterious. Ten minutes later, our dog Bruno started barking non stop at the bathroom door. My husband opened it and found the router sitting in the bathtub like it was having a mental breakdown. Mia shrugged. He needed a little me time. My husband grounded her. She said, you have no authority. Without Wi-Fi, you're basically a decorative dad. Then her grandma, his mother, came to visit. She walked in with a tray of cookies, asking why everyone was yelling. Mia sprinted to her like a soldier returning from war and shouted, Grandma, Daddy banned my entire lifestyle! Grandma gasped, you what? My husband tried explaining, but Mia whispered something in Grandma's ear. Instantly, grandma looked at him like he Kicked a baby. Baby? Why would you ban the only thing this child is good at? Are you trying to raise a disappointment? He stared at me. I stared at the ceiling. But the final straw was dinner. Grandma asked, why can't Mia play Roblox? Mia sighed dramatically and said, because daddy hates joy. And also because daddy's built like a confused potato. Grandma slammed the table. Boy, have you lost your damn mind! My husband broke instantly. Fine, she can play. Just stop attacking me. The second he lifted the band, the Wi-Fi magically returned from the dead. Mia opened Roblox, looked at me with a wicked grin and whispered, one more band, mom. And congrats, you're a widow.

It started when I was 13. My brother Kevin got this huge birthday party at a trampoline park. Like 40 kids showed up. There was pizza, a massive cake, and mom spent weeks planning it. When my birthday came three months later, we went to Olive Garden, just the four of us. Mom said it was because I told her I didn't want a big party, which was true, but only because I knew they wouldn't do one anyway. Kevin played football every Friday night. Dad would leave work early to make his games. They'd get home at 9, both of them buzzing with energy, replaying every touchdown. I did debate team. My competitions were on Saturdays. Mom came to two in four years. Dad came to zero. When I made it to state finals, I asked if they could come. Dad said he had to help Kevin move his stuff to his new dorm room. Kevin was moving in three weeks later. The thing is, they never said they loved Kevin more. They just showed it in a thousand tiny ways. Kevin's report cards went on the fridge with magnets. Mine got a quick look and a nice job before going in a drawer. When Kevin needed a new laptop for college, dad researched for weeks and bought him a 15 dollar one. When mine broke sophomore year, they gave me a refurbished one from Walmart that crashed every other Day. I kept a list in my phone, not to be weird, just to make sure I wasn't making it up. Kevin's graduation party. $200 on catering. Mine. Homemade sandwiches. Kevin forgot to do his chores. They do it for him. I forgot once. Grounded for a week. Kevin got a car at 17. I turned 17 last month. They got me a bus pass. Last Thursday was the breaking point. I got accepted into the summer program at a university three hours away. Full scholarship, only 30 students picked nationwide. I've been working on the application for months. When I told them at dinner, mom smiled and said, that's great, honey. And then immediately turned to Kevin to ask about his intramural basketball game. Dad didn't even look up from his phone. I just sat there. Kevin was talking about some lay up he made, and mom was laughing. And dad finally looked up, but only to ask Kevin if he needed new basketball shoes. Nobody asked me a single question about the program. Not what I'd be studying, not when it started. Nothing. Something in me snapped.

My Uncle Gerald spoke up, his voice defensive. What does an old tattoo have to do with anything? Brennan turned to face all of us and I saw something in his eyes that made my blood run cold. Because three weeks ago we resumed a body from a construction site in Nevada. The man had been buried there for 30 years. He was identified through DNA as Thomas Lawrence, reported missing in 1994. My mother made a sound like a wounded animal. That's impossible. My husband is Thomas Lawrence. The chapel erupted into chaos. Relatives were shouting questions. My aunt Diane was crying. And Ian grabbed Brennan's arm before the officers pulled him back. I felt like I was watching everything through water. Nothing made sense. Brennan continued his voice, cutting through the noise. The man in that grave was killed execution style. He had this exact tattoo. Same numbers, same location. It's a prisoner identification number from a federal facility. We've been searching for his killer for three weeks. Then yesterday, we received an anonymous tip that Thomas Lawrence was alive and living under his victim's identity. I looked at my mother, whose face had gone completely white. She was staring at the casket like she never seen it before. Mom. I grabbed her shoulders. Mom, what's going on? She wouldn't meet my eyes. I don't know, she whispered, but I could tell she was lying. Brennan pulled out. Handcuffs. And I realized with dawning horror who they were. For Missus Lawrence, we have evidence that you've known about your husband's identity for at least 15 years. You're under arrest for accessory to murder and identity fraud. The next few hours were a blur of police stations and lawyers. Ian and I sat in a small room while detectives explained that the man we called our father was actually named Richard Webb, a former inmate who'd killed his cellmate, Thomas Lawrence, after their release, stolen his identity and disappeared into a normal life. Our mother had discovered the truth when she found old prison letters in 2008 but never reported it. She'd chosen to stay with a murderer rather than destroy the life they built. The real Thomas Lawrence had a sister who'd been searching for him for 30 years, never knowing he'd been dead and buried in the Nevada desert while someone else wore his name like a costume. When they finally let us see our mother, she was crying. I loved him, she said. Whatever he did before, he was a good husband, a good father. How could I destroy our family? Ian walked out without a word. I stayed for another moment. Looking at this woman, I thought I knew you let us mourn a lie, I said quietly. Everything we said about him today, none of it was even real. The funeral was rescheduled after they released the body, but only six people came.

First from relatives with birthday wishes, then mutual friends, then the interesting ones. Patricia commented, wait, today is your birthday? Happy birthday, Gerald. October 15th is your birthday. What a coincidence. Someone tagged my husband. You both have the same birthday. How fun! Elena was cackling beside me. Look at Patricia's story. Patricia had posted from the restaurant bathroom. That awkward moment when you realise you might be at the wrong person's birthday party. My phone rang. My husband. Hey! I answered cheerfully. How's the client dinner. Why did you post that? His voice was tight with anger. Post what? My birthday selfie. Because it's my birthday. Silence! Then you know what you did? I made myself a cake. Is that problematic? People are getting confused. They think they're asking questions. About what? Why would anyone be confused about me celebrating my own birthday? He hung up. Twenty minutes later, he burst through the door, furious. You ruined everything. I ruined what? Your party for my birthday. He had the audacity to look offended. It wasn't about you. My birthday wasn't about me? Elena stepped forward. Explain that logic, please. The truth came out in pieces. He's Been passed over for promotion. Felt invisible at work. When Patricia misheard his birthday months ago. Assumed October instead of March. He didn't correct her. Others heard. Suddenly people were planning something, acknowledging him. So you stole my birthday? I asked incredulously. For three months you've been planning this? His silence was damming. Elena showed him her phone, his co workers group chat. Someone had screenshot. Mass confusion. People realizing they'd sell, celebrated their boss's wife's birthday without her. Patricia. This is genuinely the weirdest thing ever. Someone else. We threw him a party for his wife's birthday while she sat home alone. The last message from Gerald. See you in my office Monday morning. I looked at my husband of seven years. You can have the cake. I'm going out for my actual birthday. Elena and I left him staring at a half frosted cake. We went to a bar where the bartender gave me free shots after hearing the story. By midnight, I'd already decided on a divorce lawyer.

I was holding my mother's hand when Detective Brennan walked through the chapel doors during the eulogy. The entire congregation turned to stare as his footsteps echoed against the marble floor. My Uncle Gerald stopped mid sentence, his voice cracking on a story about my father's love of sailing. For a moment, I thought the detective just paying respects. Maybe my dad had helped him with a case years ago. But then Brennan walked straight past the pews, past my sobbing mother, and stopped directly in front of the casket. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we need to open this casket immediately. The room went silent, except for someone shocked gasp near the back. My mother squeezed my hand so hard, I felt my bones shift. What are you talking about? I stood up, my voice shaking. My father died of a heart attack three days ago. You have no right to be here. Brennan's face was stone. Ma'am, I understand this is difficult, but I have a court order. He pulled folded papers from his jacket. Your father's death is now part of an active investigation. My brother Ian jumped up from the front row, his face red with rage. This is insane. Our father is dead. You're disrupting his funeral with some kind of sick joke. But. And wasn't joking. Two uniformed officers appeared at the chapel entrance, and My stomach dropped. Investigation into what? My mother whispered, her voice barely audible. Brennan looked at her with something that might have been sympathy. Missus Lawrence, I need you and your family to step back. The funeral director, looking absolutely terrified, was already being instructed by one of the officers. I watched in horror as they began opening my father's casket. The same casket we carefully selected four days ago. The one with brass handles that my dad would have hated for being too fancy. Mom was crying. Ian was shouting at Brennan about lawyers and lawsuits. And I just stood there frozen, watching them lift the lid. Then I saw my father's face, peaceful and still, exactly as we left him after the viewing this morning. See? Ian was practically screaming, there's nothing wrong. You're desecrating our father's body for nothing! But Brennan wasn't looking at my father's face. He. I was looking at my father's hands, folded across his chest in the traditional pose. With gloved hands, he carefully lifted my father's right hand and turned it over. There on the inside of his wrist was a small tattoo I'd never seen before. A series of numbers. 3, 0, 1, 9, 6, 5. My father had always said he hated tattoos, had grounded me for a week when I got one at 18. Why would he have one? Brennan photographed it and addressed the entire chapel.

It looked like something was growing behind there. Alex showed the photos to Missus Patterson after class. She barely glanced at his phone screen before laughing. That's just dust and old paint. Alex, don't be so dramatic. When he tried explaining about the smell and kids getting sick, she waved him off. It's flu season. Kids get sick. But Alex wouldn't drop it, printed the photos at the library and took them to the school nurse. She looked annoyed and told him to let the adults handle building issues. When he went to Principal Martinez's office, he got the same response. Don't spread rumors, Alex. You're not a doctor. Nobody would listen to a 12 year old kid about mold. So Alex got creative. He used his science class Chromebook to make a Powerpoint presentation. He researched black mold symptoms and matched them to what was happening in our class. Headaches, check. Respiratory problems, check, check. Skin rashes, check. Fatigue and dizziness, double check. The next day during free reading time, Alex quietly showed his presentation to kids sitting nearby. Word spread fast. By the end of class, everyone was crowded around his laptop comparing their symptom.

I asked where she Learned to punch like that and Maya shrugged. She said she just aimed for his jaw like she was supposed to. Like she was supposed to. The phrasing bothered me. But when I pushed for clarification, Maya said she was tired and asked to be excused. Over the next week, strange things kept happening. Other parents at school drop off would stop me to ask about Maya. Not angry questions about the fight, but weird questions about her training schedule and whether she planned to compete soon. Tyler's parents never called us, never threatened legal action, nothing. Their son had a broken jaw and they were completely silent. At Maya's checkup the following Monday, the pediatrician examined her hands and made a comment about proper form and conditioning. I asked what he meant and he just smiled and said Maya obviously knew what she was doing. The incident should have been a huge deal, but everyone was treating it like Maya had won a spelling bee and of seriously injuring another child. Rachel started acting weird, too, getting defensive when I asked questions about Maya's activities after school. She said I was overreacting, that Maya was fine and I should drop it, but I couldn't drop it because none of this made sense. Then Tyler's family requested that he be moved to a different school and the principal approved it immediately. No investigation. No questions about why the victim was leaving instead of the kid who broke his jaw. Two weeks after the incident, Maya complained about wrist pain. So I took her to an orthopedic surgeon my insurance recommended. The moment we walked into the examination room, the surgeon's face lit up. He asked if Maya was the Morrison girl from the tournament last month and Maya nodded like this was completely normal. He examined her wrist, talking to her about her technique and asking about her training regimen. Then he did something that made my blood run cold. He pulled out his phone and asked if Maya would mind taking a photo with him for his son who apparently followed her career closely. Then he asked for her autograph. I stood there watching this accomplished surgeon get starstruck over my 7 year old daughter who just broken another kid's jaw. And that's when I realized I had no idea who my daughter actually was. The rest of the story is on my channel or linked below.

Nothing. Checked his backpack, his clothes, under the bed, in the closet. My brother was sweating, his wife was crying. And the kid just stood there with this blank expression. Day two, still nothing. I told my brother, either the ring shows up or he pays me back the four two hundred dollars. He said they didn't have that kind of money right now. That's why they were staying with me in the first place. Asked for more time. I gave them until Sunday. Sunday came, no ring. My brother kept saying they'd looked everywhere. That maybe it got thrown out by accident, that maybe I misplaced it myself. I showed him the camera footage again. He had nothing to say. Monday morning, while they were all out, I changed the locks. Took about 20 minutes. Then I packed all their stuff. Clothes, toiletries, the kids toys, everything. And put it in boxes on the front porch. Left a note taped to the door. The ring's worth more than you are. Figure it out. My brother came back around 3. Yours? PM. Started banging on the door, screaming that I couldn't do this. I was putting a child on the street. I texted him through the door. Your son stole 40. Two hundred dollars from me, and you did nothing? He can steal somewhere else now. He tried calling me 47 times that night. I blocked him. My mom called the next morning crying, saying I was tearing the family apart. I told her the same thing. I told my brother, the kid's a thief and nobody wants to parent him. That's not my problem anymore. It's been five days. My girlfriend still doesn't know any of this happened. I was supposed to post next month on our anniversary trip. Now I don't even have a ring. Last night, my brother's wife texted from a motel asking if we could talk. I didn't respond. The ring's still gone, and so are they.

But here's the part that destroyed me. She stopped being a mother entirely. Missed our daughter's soccer games because she had plans. Forgot to pack lunches three days in a row. When our son asked why Mommy was always on her phone, she snapped at him to go watch TV. One night, I heard her on a call in the other room, referring to our kids as those little brats who won't leave me alone. I was drowning. Working full time, doing all the parenting, processing the betrayal. That's when her sister Tara started showing up. Tara had always been the family outcast. She was born seven years after my wife. An unplanned pregnancy her parents never let her forget. My wife got the dance lessons, the college fund, the unconditional support. Tara got leftovers and criticism. She'd moved away after high school, only coming around for holidays. But when she heard what was happening, she drove three hours every weekend to help. Started picking up my kids from school when I had late meetings. Helped with homework, made dinner when I was too exhausted to think straight. My wife barely noticed. She was too busy planning her next night out to care that her sister was essentially raising her children. After about 18 months of this, something shifted. My daughter fell off her bike, scraped her knee badly. And when Tara cleaned it up, And put on a Band Aid. She said, thanks, mom. It slipped out. Naturally. Tara froze, looked at me with pain, panic in her eyes, like she'd crossed some invisible line. But I just nodded. Because the truth was, Tara had been more of a mother to my kids in 18 months than my wife had been in years. My wife overheard it. One day, my son called Tara mom while asking for help with his math homework. My wife laughed, actually laughed, and said, good. Maybe now they'll leave me alone and I can have some peace.

He says Sarah told him she wasn't happy with how he proposed. She said she felt embarrassed and wished he'd done it literally anywhere else. Tyler's going off about how she's being ungrateful and shallow. He said he thought it would be spontaneous and cute. Then he asks me straight up, would you be mad if someone proposed to you at the gym? I should have lied. I really should have.

I told him that's actually a decent idea, but maybe he should have asked her to meet him there when she wasn't mid workout or maybe rent the place out after hours, something where she could at least look decent and not Be actively dripping sweat. He called me shallow, said I was being a bad friend for not backing him up. I told him I was being a good friend by being honest instead of letting him think Sarah was the crazy one. That just made him matter. He said Sarah's been weird ever since the proposal, won't post about it on social media, hasn't really told anyone except her sister. Meanwhile, Tyler already told everyone and showed them the video. He couldn't understand why she wasn't excited. I asked him if he ever actually asked Sarah how she wanted to be proposed to. Dead silence. Then he admitted they never talked about it. He just assumed she'd love anything as long as he proposed.

But I didn't. I could see my sister's life on my mom's Facebook. I'd scroll through pictures of her at prom, at graduation, going off to college. One time I liked one of the photos without thinking, my mom sent me a message saying I was allowed to look, but if I ever interacted with any posts again, she'd block me completely. I went to therapy, finished my college degree online, got a better job than an even better one. Three years ago, I moved across the country for work and met my wife. Dad had been an addict, too, and her family treated me like I was their own son from day one. Last year we got married. Three months ago, we had a baby boy. I posted pictures of him on Facebook because I was so proud and excited. That's when my phone started blowing up. My parents, my sister, aunts and uncles I hadn't heard from in 5 years, all wanting to meet my son. My mom left me a voicemail crying about how she missed me and wanted to be a grandma. My dad sent a long text about family being important. My sister messaged saying she wanted to be an aunt. I called my dad back and told him no. I told him they abandoned me when I needed the most. They made sure nobody in our family could help me. When I was homeless and trying to stay sober, he started Yelling that I never earned their love back, that I broke their trust and expected them to just forget, give me. My mom got on the phone and said I was cheating them out of having a son and a grandson, that I owed them this after what I put them through. I told them both they were never going to meet my son. My real family is my wife and her parents who actually gave me a chance. Then I hung up and blocked all of them. Now I'm getting messages from other relatives calling me selfish, saying I should let them make up for lost time. But they had 5 years to reach out, 5 years to see if I was even alive. They only care now because I have something they want.

Apologize to your Uncle William. Levi said nothing. Andrea leaned down and whispered, it's okay, sweetheart. We're right here. Dad's hands curled into fists. The next morning, dad called everyone into the living room before breakfast. The tension from last night still hung in the air like smoke. Levi sat on the couch glued to his mom's iPhone 16 Pro Max, completely unbothered by what he'd done. Dad walked over to him, snatched the phone from his hands without warning and dropped it straight into a mug of steaming hot tea. The phone sank with a harsh crackling pop. Andrea jumped up. Oh, my god, what are you doing? Before Michael could say a word, dad turned to me and gave a slight nod. I stepped forward, looked my brother straight in the eye and raised my middle finger. Cold, direct, unwavering, Andrea freaked William. What the hell is wrong with you? Michael froze, face pale. Levi shrank into the couch, eyes wide. For the first time, dad stepped into Center. How does that feel? That feeling is precisely what William had to carry last night. Andrea pulled the ruined phone from the tea, hands shaking. Dad, that phone cost over $1,500. That's my property. Dad's voice was calm but sharp. And William's laptop was just trash. She froze. I'll call the police then. Go ahead, dad said, and while you're at it, tell them what your kid did to William. The room went dead. Silent that night at dinner, Michael finally spoke, his voice heavy with exhaustion. I, I think it's time to take him somewhere, somewhere that can help him start over. Dad nodded. A behavioral program. William contact them for me. On Saturday, we drove Levi to the camp. He screamed for his mom the whole way, begging us to turn around. Michael gripped the steering wheel so tight, his knuckles turned white. When the gate closed behind Levi, I didn't feel relieved, just empty. It wasn't punishment. It was structure, something he never had. One year later, everything changed. Michael and Andrea opened a small deli. They stopped making excuses and started listening. Levi sent me a handwritten letter, half in English, half in broken German. Sorry, Uncle William. I was wrong. Since then, no more Defiance, no more ugly behavior. Every weekend, I bring him to my apartment. We play video games, eat fried chicken and talk. He's still stubborn, but now he knows when to stop.

My mom peeked out and coldly said, go home. There's no room left. So we left. 10 minutes later, my grandma called furious, come back right now. What happened after we returned left my parents completely stunned. My son Logan stood on Grandma Helen's porch clutching a handmade Christmas card, a tree cut from green paper with a tiny house spoke curling from the chimney. And I love you great grandma, written in wobbly red crayon. He'd spent a week on it. We'd driven two hours through snow to get there. My mother opened the door, looked at us and said six words that would change everything, go home. There's no room left. Logan's face crumbled. The card trembled in his small hands. She claimed grandma said if we showed up late, she had to turn us away. The lie was so casual, so effortless, like she'd been planning it. So we left. Logan sobbed in the car, clutching the car tighter. Dad, why didn't grandma let us in? I just wanted to give her my card. Did I do something wrong? I had no answer. My throat was too tight to speak. My parents had favored my younger brother Charles and his son Adrian for years. When Adrian was born, my parents gave Charles $5,000 and stayed at the hospital for days helping with the Newborn. When Logan was born, they Visited for 20 minutes, but I never thought they'd stoop this low. 10 minutes later, my phone rang. Grandma, Helen, Jake, why haven't you arrived yet? My stomach dropped. Didn't you tell mom to send us away for being late? Silence then. I never said that, come back right now. When we pulled up again, the entire family was standing outside in the freezing cold. Grandma, my parents, Charles, distant relatives, all of them on the porch, breath visible in the night air, faces lit by Christmas lights. Charles immediately snapped. Cause of you, we've been standing out here freezing. Grandma's voice cut through the night like ice. Shut up. The whole street went silent. She hugged us, then let us inside. The living room was beautifully decorated, but the tension was suffocating before we.

They contained checks from his life insurance. When she said I wasn't entitled to anything, I pulled out a document that made her scream. The wake was packed. My father had been loved, built a successful accounting firm, raised me alone after my mother died when I was six. Then he met Patricia 10 years ago, married her five years ago. Patricia stood at the front during the reception holding white envelopes. Michael wanted to take care of everyone he loved. He left these for you. She handed them out. My father's brother, his sister, his business partner. Each envelope contained a check. I watched, waiting. Trisha looked at me, then looked away, handed the last envelope to my father's golf buddy. I walked over. Patricia, where's mine? She turned face neutral. Your father and I discuss this. He felt you were already set up. You have your career, your apartment. The others need help more. My hands went cold. My father left me nothing. He left you memories, a good upbringing. Some people need financial support more than sentiment. My uncle stepped forward. That doesn't sound like Michael. She pulled out a folded paper. Here's a letter he wrote explaining his decision. I read it. My father's words or someone's version, explaining I was independent, successful, that he wanted his assets going to people who'd struggle without him. The handwriting looked like his almost, but the Signature. The way he looped his letters. Too perfect. My father had arthritis. In his last year, his handwriting had gotten shaky. This was too clean. This is a forgery. Patricia's eyes flashed. How dare you? Your father wrote that two months before he died. No, someone copied his signature. My father's hands shook. This doesn't. My aunt examined it. She's right. Michael's writing was barely legible toward the end. This looks like his old signature. Patricia grabbed it back. You're all grieving. I pulled out my phone. I have something else to show everyone. I've been suspicious for months. Last year, I'd hired a private investigator. I pulled up the report.

Maybe she'd been gone for years and I was just too blind to see it. I planned a trip to Maui six months earlier, back when I still had some stupid hope we could fix things. Luxury resort, Ocean View, suite to worse, $8,000 that I've been saving for over a year. I told my wife about it one last time, asked if she wanted to come, if she wanted to try one more time for our kids. She looked at me like I'd asked her to clean a sewer, said, take those little psychos yourself. I'm done playing house. She said it right in front of our daughter. So I asked Tara instead, told her everything my wife had said. She cried when she agreed to come, said she'd do anything to help my kids feel loved again. We flew out last week. The kids have been in heaven building sand castles, learning to snorkle, eating shave ice until their tongues turned blue. They keep asking if Tara can stay with us forever. Last night, they made friends with another family at the resort. The parents invited them for a sleepover, supervised in their hotel room with a Disney movie Marathon. Like kids were so excited they could barely sit still. Which left Tara and me alone for the first time in three years. We walked down to the beach around sunset. Didn't say much at first, just sat in The sand and watch the way babes. Then she asked me if I was okay, really okay. And I realized nobody had asked me that in years. I told her everything, how grateful I was, how my kids smiled again because of her, how I couldn't imagine our life without her anymore. She looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, I love those kids like they're mine. I kissed her right there on the beach with the sunset behind us. And for the first time in three years, I didn't feel broken. My wife can keep her a fair partners and her freedom. I've got someone who actually shows up.

What shocking thing did you witness in the execution room? I was arriving at the prison for my brother's execution, scheduled for seven that evening. I was the only family member coming. The rest believed he was guilty. My brother was convicted of murdering his girlfriend 15 years ago and spent the last three in solitary confinement. He maintained his innocence every day, but that didn't matter anymore. When I got inside the prison, a guard escorted me through the cold hallways to the witness room. My hands were shaking. My brother was there somewhere, waiting to die for something I was sure he didn't do. My brother and the girlfriend he killed had been together since middle school. They loved each other with this anime level intensity. Even had an inside joke where he'd say, I killed to keep you. And she say I died to stay. Then she actually died. Found in their shared apartment, stabbed 53 times. The evidence showed my brother's fingerprints on the murder weapon, a kitchen knife from their apartment. My brother's DNA was also found under her fingernails. It seemed obvious, but there were problems. The evidence showed the girlfriend scratched and Claud at her attacker, but my brother had no scratches on him when the police arrested him, dragging him away while he was holding onto her limp body, still in denial about the fact she was gone. He even had an alibi at work. When she died, three co workers confirmed it. But in the end, it didn't even matter. The jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death. I always believed he was innocent. Seeing how he was more broken by the fact he'd never see her again than the fact he was literally sentenced to death confirmed it for me. So over the years, I spent thousands trying to prove it. I drained my savings hiring lawyers, private investigators. Nothing worked. Every appeal got denied. To make it worse, everyone in my family thought he was guilty. My parents stopped visiting after the first year. Told me I was embarrassing the family. My other siblings cut me off completely. My own mother said, stop defending a murderer. My brother's final appeal was denied last week. This was it. No more options, no more time. He was going to die. At the prison, I felt more hollow and empty than anything. The witness room was small, suffocatingly dark and dimly lit. Almost like they wanted you to feel death inside it. It had a small window looking into the execution chain. Amber with a gurney and lethal injections. That room was white. I looked over to the opposite side of the execution room and noticed the victim's mother sitting there. But what took me by surprise was my own mother was here, too. With my father and my two siblings all sitting away from me, all looking relieved to see my brother. Die. I also noticed the victim's stepfather wasn't there. Why wasn't he here? My brother was brought in at 6:30. They strapped him to the Gurney, IV lines in both arms. We made eye contact through the glass. He mouth, I love you, dude. No homo. I tried my best not to cry. I was his older brother, his role model. I couldn't let him see me break. So I cracked a smile and mouth, I love you, too. No homo. Back inside, my heart was tearing. At 6:00. Thirty five, the warden read the final statement. My brother's body tensed. This was really happening. This was the first moment I fully came face to face with the fact he was going to die. My brother would die. I felt a tear roll down my cheek. At 6:45, the warden asked him for his last words. His voice came through the speakers. I didn't do this. I loved her. He then looked at me. I love you, man. Thank you for never giving up on me. My heart was breaking. My mother looked.

I danced with my father while wearing my wedding dress and pretended my heart wasn't shattering with every song. My uncle got drunk and kept telling people I dodged a bullet. I spent that night on our bathroom floor still in my dress, unable to move. The apartment we'd shared for three years suddenly felt like a crime scene. I could see his toothbrush next to mine and wanted to scream. Derek's mother showed up at 8:00am the next morning. She looked like she'd aged 10 years overnight. Her hands were shaking when She told me Derek had reconnected with his high school girlfriend, Emma, at his bachelor party the week before. Emma showed up and told him she'd been hiding his son from him for four years. Derek chose them, packed a bag and left her place in Connecticut at midnight.

Everyone at our school knew this guy. Louise was a drug dealer. He wouldn't even try to hide it because our entire school already knew who he was. Everybody loved him. However, he literally drove the principal insane. Whenever something drug related happened at school, he was always the first person they searched. The teachers all knew, the principal knew, even the cops knew who he was. However, they could never actually prove it. Every time they searched him, they'd never actually catch him with anything. I'd watch as our principal knock on our door, interrupting our class, and without even saying a word, Louise would just stand up to let them search him out in the hall. The cops would pull him over just for existing and try to search his car, but they, too, would never catch him with anything. The administration got so frustrated they would cut the lock off his locker almost every week just to try and find his staff. He literally drove them insane. Then someone spread a rumor that Louise was hiding his stash in a locker that wasn't assigned to anybody. It spread like wildfire and not too long after our principal heard. But since there were too many lockers, our principal decided to gather all of our teachers and at the locks off literally every locker in the school to search them. The entire time, Louise literally laughed in their faces as They spent hours looking and didn't find a single thing. The administration had no idea what to do. Every time they caught another kid with something illegal at school, they ask where they got it. And every time the kid would always say, I bought this from Louis. Louis actually encouraged them to say it. Yeah, tell them it was me. I don't care. So they'd search Louis again, pat him down in the hallway in front of everyone and brought cops to search his car weekly. He just let them find anything he'd ask with a smirk while they completely lost their minds. But then something happened. Over Christmas break, the principal's son asked him for a new pair of shoes for Christmas. However, not just normal shoes, were shoes that actually had a secret compartment hidden in the bottom of them that you could hide small things in. As soon as our principal heard that, light bulbs went off in his head. He couldn't wait for winter break to be over. And literally the first day back, as soon as first period started, we hear someone yell over the intercom, Luis, get your ass down to the principal's office right now. Our principal was sure he had him. This time, Luis walked into that office like he'd done 100 times before. However, this time was different. When he got there with a smile on his face, the principal didn't ask him to empty his pockets, didn't ask about His backpack. He just looked at Louise and said, take off your shoes. Louise hesitated. Uh, no, I don't want to listen, buddy. I'm not giving you a choice. Take them off. Louise now had no other option, so he just sat down and unlaced his shoes without putting up a fight. Okay, if you say so. He pulled them off and handed them over to him while the principal literally shook with excitement. He was finally gonna.

Derek vanished the morning of our wedding. I woke up at 6:00am to an empty apartment and missed calls from his mother. No note, no explanation, just his tuxedo still hanging in the closet and our wedding ring sitting on the nightstand. By noon, 200 guests were arriving at the venue. My bridesmaids kept calling his phone while I sat in the bridal suite fully dressed, makeup perfect 2K wilting in my hands. The photographer kept asking if we should start pre ceremony shots at 2:15 p. M, 15 minutes past our ceremony time, my maid of honor made the call, we're canceling. Except we didn't cancel. My best friend grabbed the mic and announced that Derek had a family emergency and we were turning the reception into a party. Open bar, live band, three tier cake that cost $800. I danced with my father while wearing my wedding dress and pretended my heart wasn't shattering with every song. My uncle got drunk and kept telling people I dodged a bullet. I spent that night on our bathroom floor still in my dress, unable to move. The apartment we'd shared for three years suddenly felt like a crime scene. I could see his toothbrush next to mine and wanted to scream. Derek's mother showed up at 8:00am the next morning. She looked like she'd aged 10 years overnight. Her hands were shaking when She told me Derek had reconnected with his high school girlfriend, Emma, at his bachelor party the week before. Emma showed up and I told him she'd been hiding his son from him for four years. Derek chose them, packed a bag and left her place in Connecticut at midnight. He called me exactly once three months later, said he was sorry, that he panicked, that finding out he was a father changed everything, that he couldn't ignore his responsibility. I told him I hoped his son had a better father.

That's when I called the landlord, told him I needed to change the locks because I lost my keys. He said fine, but I had to pay for it and give him a copy of the new keys. Cost me 140 bucks to get a locksmith out there on a Saturday, but I did it while she was at her sister's place for the day. I changed the lock on the front door and the bedroom door, got the same brand so they'd match and she wouldn't notice right away. Then I programmed the new keys and kept both sets. When she got home that night, I was already in the bedroom with the door locked. She tried her key and it didn't work. She knocked and asked what was going on. I told her through the door that I was already asleep and she was being too loud. She did not think it was funny. She started banging on the door saying this was insane and that I couldn't lock her out of her own room. I reminded her that she'd been doing the exact same thing to me for three months and that maybe now she'd understand how annoying it was. She yelled that it wasn't the same because she had a reason and I was just being petty. I asked her what her reason was. She went quiet for a minute. And then said she didn't owe me an explanation. So I told her she could sleep on the couch and think about it. She, she slept in her car that night. I know because I heard her started up around 1 in the morning. And when I looked out the window, she was sitting in the driver's seat with the heat running. The next morning she came back in and said we needed to talk. I unlocked the bedroom door and let her in. She sat on the bed and tried to tell me that what I did was way worse than what she did because I changed the locks without telling her. I asked her if she was serious right now. She said she wanted her key back. I said, sure, but only if she agreed to stop locking me out when I came home from work. She said that wasn't fair because she wasn't doing it to be mean. She just needed space sometimes. I told her that space didn't mean locking your boyfriend out of the bedroom every night for months. We went back and forth like this for maybe 20 minutes before she finally admitted that she'd been talking to her ex on video calls at night and didn't want me around for it. She said it wasn't cheating because they were just friends now and I was being controlling by having a problem with it. I handed her a trash bag and told her she Had until the end of the day to get her stuff out.

Few of the moms looked pretty annoyed at my wife. She started backtracking saying she didn't think our daughter was being serious. But I just started taking down the decorations. Everyone left pretty quickly after that. Once they were gone, my daughter came back downstairs and sat at the kitchen table to do her homework like normal. My wife gave her this half hearted apology about not thinking she was serious, but our daughter just ignored her and kept working.

They've told me it sucks because there's no privacy and the baby cries all night. I take my kids on trips. We went to Disney World in July for 10 days. We stayed at one of the resort hotels, went to all four parks, did the character dinners, bought them whatever souvenirs they wanted. It cost me a fortune, but they had the time of their lives. Then in August, my parents wanted to do a big family reunion trip, so we all went to a lake house upstate for a week. My brother and sister brought their kids, and we rented jet skis and went tubing and had bonfires every night. Tyler and Jason still talk about that trip. My ex wife found out about both trips because the boys posted pictures on the family iPad. She called me up furious, asking why I didn't tell her about these vacations. because they're none of your business and they don't involve you. it's not fair that Tyler and Jason get to do all these amazing things while Glenn's kids and their baby sister get nothing. I said, that's not my problem. She hung up on me. The boys do whatever activities they want. Tyler plays travel soccer, which is expensive as hell between the fees and the uniforms and the tournaments in other states. Jason just started guitar lessons and wanted this specific electric guitar he saw on YouTube, so I got it for Him, along with the amp and all the accessories. They both take swimming lessons at the indoor pool near my house. And they're at their mom's place. Glenn's kids don't do any activities because they can't afford it. My ex wife told me Glenn's daughter really wants to do dance, but it's like 200 bucks a month and they just don't have it. For Tyler's birthday in September, I rented out a spot at this trampoline park place and invited his whole class. Thirty kids showed up. We had pizza and cake. And I got him a new bike he'd been asking for. It was a great party. My ex wife didn't come, but she texted me later saying Glenn's son had his birthday the same month. And they could only afford to take him to the dollar store to pick out a toy and have cake at home with just family. She said I was rubbing it in their faces. I wasn't rubbing anything in anyone's face. Just living my life and taking care of my kids the way I want to. Glenn's kids are not my responsibility. The baby is definitely not my responsibility. I didn't marry Glenn. I didn't have kids with Glenn. Those are not my children.

It started about three months ago. I'd come home from work around 11 because I do late shifts at the warehouse, and the bedroom door would be locked, just locked, no explanation. I'd knock and she'd yell through the door that she was already asleep and I was being too loud. So I'd end up on the couch with a blanket that's too short and our cat Murphy, stepping on my face at 4 in the morning. The first few times I thought maybe she was just having a bad week. We've been together two years and lived together for eight months. So I figured it was just stress from her job or whatever. But then it kept happening three nights a week, then four, then basically every night I worked late. I tried talking to her about it. She'd say she needed her space and that I should be more respectful of her sleep schedule, which would make sense except she was always on her phone. When I got home, I could see the light under the door and one time I heard her laughing at some video right before she told me she was too tired to unlock the door. The thing that really got me was when I got home early one night. I had to leave work at 8 because the forklift broke down and they Sent us home. I got back to the apartment and the bedroom door was wide open. She was just sitting on the bed watching TV. The second she heard my keys, she jumped up and tried to close the door, but I was already in the hallway. I asked her what she was doing and she got mad at me for coming home without texting first, said I scared her. I pointed out that I live here and shouldn't need to announce myself like I'm some kind of guest. She told me I was being dramatic and that she just liked having private time in the evenings. Then she shut the door in my face. Anyway, that was when I realized this wasn't about sleep or space. She just didn't want me in the bedroom, period. So I tested it. I came home at different times over the next two weeks, early, late, middle of the night, after picking up extra hours every single time. If she knew I was coming, the door would be locked. If she didn't know it was open and she was just hanging out doing normal stuff, I asked her one more time to stop locking me out of my own bedroom. She said it was her bedroom, too, and she could do what she wanted. She said if I didn't like sleeping on the couch, then.

He hands me five bucks and Walks away. I'm like, hey, you owe me two more dollars. He goes, I'll catch you later. Later, never came. Three people straight up said they forgot their wallets.

When reality caught up with her lies, the consequences were devastating. My sister Zara thought pretending to be older would make her life exciting. She had no clue it would nearly ruin everything. At 14, Zara looked absolutely nothing like me. At that age, while I was all braces and awkward faces, she'd mastered the art of contouring, wore crop tops with high waisted jeans and could easily pass for 20. TikTok and Instagram had become her styling guides. And honestly, it scared me. The wrong person could see her and think she was fair game. Zara wasn't tent with just looking older. She wanted the full adult experience. She'd sneak into my room begging to join my college parties, complaining that our parents treated her like a baby. Things escalated when I discovered she was filming suggestive dance videos for social media. She got grounded and lost her phone for three weeks. But it only made her more rebellious. The real trouble started two months ago when a notification flashed on her iPad. Can't wait to see you Friday beautiful, from someone named DJ Marcus. My gut told me something was very wrong. Who's Marcus? I asked casually. She glared at me. My boyfriend, he's 16 and goes to Lincoln High. Stop being nosy. I didn't believe her, but she'd been relatively well behaved lately, so I let it slide. That was my biggest mistake. Four days later, I was studying at Brewster's Coffee when I saw Zara walk in. She wasn't supposed to be there. She was dressed in a tight black dress and heels, her makeup even heavier than usual. She didn't notice me. In the corner booth, a man who looked about 23 approached her. My blood turned to ice. I watched in horror as they sat together laughing intimately. I stormed over and grabbed Zara's arm. We're leaving now. The guy stood up, annoyed. Who are you? Her sister and she's 14 years old. His confident expression crumbled instantly. What? No. She told me she was 19. She showed me an ID he pulled out his phone, showing me their Instagram messages where Zara had confirmed her fake age multiple times. Zara started crying, mascara running down her face. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nothing happened, I swear. Yes, I snapped. What was in that vape? The guy looks genuinely panicked now. Just nicotine, I swear to god. Look, I would never. I had no idea she was a kid. She needs to leave right now. I dragged Zara to my car. She sobbed the entire drive home, begging me not to tell our parents, but I did. Immediately what happened next was brutal. Mom and dad made Zara show them everything. The fake ID she'd bought online, her secret Instagram account with over 3,000 followers where she posed as a college student. The messages from multiple older men. Each discovery made them angrier. Dad's Punishment was severe and creative. You wanna be an adult so badly. Starting tomorrow, you'll live like one. He laid out the new rules. Get a job, pay $250 monthly rent, buy her own food and clothes and handle her own transportation. No allowance, no favors, no rides anywhere. The first week, Zara treated it like a joke. By week two, reality crashed down. She got hired at a fast food restaurant, working 20 hours weekly. The first time, she came home smelling like fryer grease, exhausted and near tears, I almost felt sorry for her. One night I found her crying over a calculator and notebook. I can't do this anymore, she whispered. I'm so tired. I have no friends left. Everyone thinks I'm weird now because I can't go anywhere or do anything. That's adulthood, I said quietly. Bills don't care if you're tired. Responsibilities don't disappear because you're sad. After four months of this brutal routine, Sara asked for a family meeting. She stood before us looking genuinely different, humbler, more mature in a real way, not a fake one. I'm sorry for everything I put you through, she said, tears streaming down her face. I thought being an adult meant freedom, but it's actually just constant responsibility and stress. Mom and dad looked at each other then nodded. They lifted all her adult responsibilities that night. The change in Zara was permanent. She deleted her fake accounts, threw away her fake ID and started dressing her Age. She even warned other girls at school about the dangers of lying online.

We stopped going on dates. He said he didn't want to eat out because it would mess up his cut. When I suggested a movie, he said he needed his eight hours of sleep or muscle recovery. Every conversation became about his workout plan, his protein intake, his body fat percentage. I tried talking about my promotion at work. He'd look at his phone. I'd ask about his day. He'd tell me about his PR on deadlifts for 20 minutes straight last month. I asked if he still loved me. He said, of course, without looking up from his phone. Didn't even make eye contact. Two weeks ago, I found out why his phone died during dinner and he asked to use mine to text his trainer. I unlocked it and handed it over. He texted, gave it back. That's when I saw the message thread still open. Honestly, bro, I think I'm outgrowing her. She's dragging me down. Embarrassed to bring in her to gym events. Everyone there is it and she just isn't. Might need to upgrade soon. You know any single girls from your five PM class? I'm 5 5, 125 pounds. I defended him when he was literally double my size and people called him disgusting to his face. I sat on that for 3 Days couldn't eat, sleep. Reread his old letters, the ones where he called me his angel, where he said my love saved his life, where he promised he'd love me forever, exactly as I was yesterday. I told him I was leaving. He actually laughed like it was funny, said good luck finding someone better. You're average at best. He lose 15 pounds first. So I grabbed all seven of his anniversary letters from my drawer, sat down across from him at the kitchen table and read them out loud, every single word, all six pages of the first one, you see me when no one else does. You loved me when I hated myself. You defended me when the world was cruel. I promise I'll spend my entire life making you feel as beautiful as you make me feel. I'd be nothing without you. His face rumbled. Halfway through letter 3, started crying, said he didn't mean any of it, that he was just trying to get in at the gym, that he got caught up in the attention, that he still loved me, that we could fix this. I stacked all seven letters neatly, slid them across the table. The man who wrote these died the day he got ABS. I don't know who you are anymore. I walked out. My lease ends in six weeks. I'm not looking back. I thought I was going to marry him. Instead, I watched him become everything he used to hate. The bullies won after all.

He waited for her to leave that night and jumped into a taxi to follow her. While following her, he found out she was working in a strip club. The guy said to the taxi driver, Wanna make 500? The driver, eager to make a quick buck, said, sure, Buddy, what do I have to do? The guy replied that all he needed to do was go inside the club, grab it his wife, put her in the back of the taxi with him, and take them home. Thinking this was an easy task, the driver agreed and went in. A couple of minutes later, the club door gets kicked open and the driver is dragging a woman out, who is kicked, kicking, biting, punching and cursing all the way to the car. The taxi driver opens the door, throws the woman inside, and tells the man, here, hold her. The man looks down at the girl and shouts at the driver, hey, wait a minute, this ain't my wife! The taxi driver replied, I know it's mine. I'm going back in for yours.

Before we continue, grandma said, her voice steel. Some things need to be addressed. She turned to my mother. Nancy, is there anything you'd like to say to Jake and his family? Mom stammered. I didn't do anything. Jake is lying. Grandma nodded to Uncle Bruce, who pulled up her security camera footage. On a tablet, my mother's voice played loud and clear. Go home. There's no room left. Help! Colin told me if you showed up late, send you away. The room exploded in whispers. Mom's face went ghost white. Janet, my dad's cousin, shook her head in disgust. Nancy, I never thought you could do something like this. Even animals have more compassion. Then grandma spoke words I'll never forget. From this moment forward, I no longer have a son named Dennis and no daughter in law named Nancy. My father begged, my mother sobbed. Grandma's voice cut through their pleas. You stopped being my son when you favor Charles over Jake. You have 30 days to leave the house you're living in. The estate in Highlands Ranch will be passed to Jake and his family. Now leave. They stumbled out, humiliated and homeless. Charles tried to plead his case, but grandma cut him off. You stayed silent in the face of injustice and benefited from it. That makes you complicit. He stormed out, hissing at me. You've torn this whole family apart. The next morning, grandma called Her lawyer. By afternoon, the legal paperwork was in motion. Two properties worth $2 million transferred to me. My parents tried one last death move. They showed up at my house days later, screaming threats. I called the police, filed a restraining order, and had them legally banned from contact for three years. 30 days later, they moved out. I renovated both properties and now earn between 8,000 to 10,000 dollars a month in rental income. All saved for Logan's future. A year has passed. My parents live in a tiny apartment three states away, surviving on Social Security. Charles moved across the country and hasn't spoken to me since. Meanwhile, my wife Paisley is eight months pregnant. Logan runs to Grandma Helen every weekend with new drawings and stories. And she's framed his Christmas card on her living room wall, where every visitor can see it. Last night, Logan asked the baby in Paisley's belly, hey, baby, when you're born, I'll teach you how to make cards for great grandma. She keeps mine on her wall forever. I don't feel guilty. I feel free.

I stared at the cover. You all picked this out together. Kara hesitated. It was Dad's idea. He thought it might help you get back on track. I looked at the cover again. There was a sticky note on the first page that said, never too late to start over. I set the book down, stood up, grabbed my coat and walked toward the door. As it closed behind me, I heard dad say, see, can't even take a joke that night. I made a decision, did some digging, called a few contacts, pulled public records. My parents were broke. Not just tight on money, genuinely broke. Dad had refinanced the house two years ago for a crypto startup that tanked. They were weeks from foreclosure. I contacted the bank, made an all cash offer through a shell company, got the house for 20% below market value. I didn't evict them immediately. I waited, paid utilities, let them think they dodged a bullet. Three months later, Dad's 65th birthday, Kara invited me to a private dinner downtown, 12 seats, same number. Who handed me that book? I showed up early, Navy Blazer, New Watch. Dinner was civil at first, small talk, wine, then dessert arrived, a chocolate cake covered in candles. Then I stood, glass raised. Before everyone leaves, I wanna share something. Most of you know I've been building my company, but recently I started exploring real estate, community projects, Legacy Properties. I paused. One property came up for sale recently. It meant something to me, so I bought it. I looked at dad. It was yours. I didn't buy it from you. I bought it from the bank. You were in pre foreclosure. Your crypto guy tanked. His face drained of color. Mom grabbed his arm. I've let you stay there these past months covered utilities, but your lease is ending. You'll get a letter this week. You have 60 days to vacate. After that it becomes a startup in you better. Mom gasped. You're evicting us. I'm reclaiming something that was never yours to weaponize. Dad stood face red. You think this makes you better than us. No, I said it makes me free. Half the table froze. Someone's glass clinked. I put an envelope to Cara. Scholarship Fund for your kids fully paid tuition, no strings. Her eyes filled with tears. Dad stormed out. Mom followed. Half the table cleared. Cara whispered. I didn't know it was that bad. That's because I stopped telling you when it started hurting. I walked out into the night. I wasn't the dropout anymore. I was the legacy.

She screamed it right in my face after I refused to babysit for the fourth weekend in a row. I was standing in my kitchen making coffee when she barged in without knocking and just unloaded on me. You never want to spend time with him. You always have some excuse. Admit it. You don't even care about your own grandson. I put my mug down and looked at her. The truth was way more complicated than she thought. Her son, my grandson Austin, was 6 years old. Sweet kid. But my daughter Brooke had been using me as free childcare since he was born. Every single weekend. Sometimes weekdays, too. No notice, just a text saying she was dropping him off. I retired two years ago after working as a nurse for 30 years. I spent three decades taking care of other people. I wanted time for myself. I joined a pottery class on Saturdays, started going to the gym, made plans with friends I hadn't seen in years because I was always too tired or too busy. But Brooke didn't care about any of that. She'd text me Friday night saying, Austin needs you tomorrow at 8:00am, and then show up with him still in pajamas. When I said I had plans, she'd guilt trip me. He's your grandson. Family comes first. Don't you love him? Of course I loved him. But I also loved having a life. The weekend She blew up at me. I had finally said no because I was going on a weekend trip to the coast with my friend Janet. We'd been planning it for three months. Booked a little beach house, made dinner reservations. I was so excited. Brooke called it selfish, said I was choosing strangers over my own family. I reminded her Janet wasn't a stranger. We've been friends since college. Didn't matter to her. After she accused me of not loving Austin, I snapped. I told her the real problem wasn't that I didn't love him. The problem was she expected me to raise him while she went out partying every weekend. She got this look on her face like I'd slapped her. She left, didn't talk to me for two weeks. Then Austin's school called me. Not Brooke. Me. They said there was an emergency and they couldn't reach Brooke. Austin had fallen off the playground equipment and hit his head pretty hard. They needed someone to come immediately. I. It was 20 minutes away. I drove there, going 15 over the speed limit the whole way. When I got there, Austin was sitting in the nurse's office with an ice pack on his forehead. He saw me and started crying. Not because he was hurt. Because he was scared his mom would be mad at him for getting hurt. That broke something in me. I took him to the emergency room, sat with him for four hours while they Did scans and tests. He was fine. Just a mild concussion. The whole time, I kept trying to call Brooke. Straight to voicemail. Every single time. She finally called me back at 7 that night, eight hours after the school called. She was at brunch with friends. Her phone had been on silent. I didn't yell. I just told her Austin was in the hospital and she needed to come get him. She freaked out, rushed over. When she saw he was okay, she hugged him tight. Then she looked at

Are you refusing to do your job? No, I'm asking for accommodation so I can do it correctly. Two hours later, I had a formal write up for insubordination. I filed a complaint with HR, requesting it be removed and asking for reasonable accommodation. I brought documentation from my eye doctor, the HR rep. Bridget listened to everything. Then she smiled. I have the perfect solution. Use our tuition reimbursement to take take a remedial art class at the community college. I stared at her. A remedial art class? Yes, so you can finally learn your colors. She said it like color blindness was just failure to study in kindergarten. I tried explaining it's a genetic condition affecting the cones in my eyes. She just kept smiling and nodding the right up. Stayed. Three months later, still color blind. I was working my usual shift. Four PM to midnight. Making sure all systems stayed running during the holidays, they cut staffing. So that week between Christmas and New Years, it was just me in the building. Well, me and Dennis, the security guard, in the lobby. December 28th. Eleven fifty eight PM. I'm counting down the last two minutes when the door opens and my coworker Brielle walks in. She's supposed to take over the overnight shift alone until 8:00am. But the second she steps through the door, high pitched beeping starts from her insulin pump. Her face goes white. No, no, no. She's frantically checking it. I'm out. Completely out of insulin. Brielle's type 1 diabetic. She wears a pump clip to her belt that delivers insulin throughout the day. I'd seen it beep during lunch breaks, just little reminders, but never like this. Never this urgent screaming alarm. I have to go home right now, she said. Already turning my backup supplies in my fridge. If I don't get it in 30 minutes, I'm going into diabetic shop. How far is your house? 23 minutes each way. Her hands were shaking. I called my husband, but he's 40 minutes out. Here's the thing. Company policy was crystal clear. The network center could never be unstaffed. Someone had to be physically present at all times. If we both left, we'd both be fired immediately. But if she stayed and went into shock with nobody to help, she could die. Go, I said. I'll stay until You get back. Tears formed in her eyes. Thank you. I'll drive as fast as I can. The second she left, I called my supervisor. Voicemail. Called the manager on duty. Voicemail. Called the Emergency Operations line. Voicemail. Because nobody checks that during holidays. Real. Made it back in 47 minutes. Hit traffic when she walked back in. Pump

She screamed it right in my face after I refused to babysit for the fourth weekend in a row. I was standing in my kitchen making coffee when she barged in without knocking and just unloaded on me. You never want to spend time with him. You always have some excuse. Admit it. You don't even care about your own grandson. I put my mug down and looked at her. The truth was way more complicated than she thought. Her son, my grandson, Austin, was 6 years old. Sweet kid. But my daughter, Brooke, had been using me as free childcare since he was born every single weekend, sometimes weekdays, too. No notice, just a text saying she was dropping him off. I retired two years ago after working as a nurse for 30 years. I spent three decades taking care of other people. I wanted time for myself. I joined a pottery class on Saturdays, started going to the gym, made plans with friends I hadn't seen in years because I was always too tired or too busy. But Brooke didn't care about any of that. She'd text me Friday night saying Austin needs you tomorrow at 8:00am and then show up with him still in pajamas when I said I had plans. She'd guilt trip me. He's your grandson. Family comes first. Don't you love him? Of course I loved him, but I also loved having a life the weekend. She blew up at me. I had finally said no because I was going on a weekend trip to the coast with my friend Janet. We'd been planning it for three months, booked a little beach house, made dinner reservations. I was so excited. Brooke called it selfish, said I was choosing strangers over my own family. I reminded her Janet wasn't a stranger. We've been friends since college. Didn't matter to her. After she accused me of not loving Austin, I snapped. I told her the real problem wasn't that I didn't love him. The problem was she expected me to raise him while she went out partying every weekend. She got this look on her face like I'd slapped her. She left, didn't talk to me for two weeks. Then Austin's school called me, not Brooke, me. They said there was an emergency and they couldn't reach Brooke. Austin had fallen off the playground equipment and hit his head pretty hard. They needed someone to come immediately. I was 20 minutes away. I drove there going 15 over the speed limit the whole way. When I got there, Austin was sitting in the nurse's office with an ice pack on his forehead. He saw me and started crying, not because he was hurt, because he was scared his mom would be mad at him for getting hurt. That broke something in me. I took him to the emergency room, sat with him for four hours while they did Scans and tests. He was fine, just a mild concussion. The whole time I kept trying to call Brooke straight to voicemail every single time. She finally called me back at 7 that night, eight hours after the school called. She was at brunch with friends. Her phone had been on silent. I didn't yell. I just told her Austin was in the hospital and she needed to come get him. She freaked out, rushed over. When she saw he was okay, she hugged him tight. Then she looked at me and said, thank you. I told her.

They threw me out like trash. One call from Grandpa flipped their entire world upside down. Turns out I was living in his house the whole time. I'm Felix. At 16, I wasn't the son. I was the designated punching bag. My sister Ashley was the golden child. She crashed our parents car into a storefront. They made me pay for it, sold my guitar, cut my allowance, told me it was my fault for not stopping her. That was just another Tuesday in our house night. Everything changed. I overheard them through my bedroom door. I want him gone, Ashley said. Dad didn't hesitate then tell him to leave. We'll back you up, mom laughed. Your room's finally going to be big. The next morning, they kicked me out. Mom's exact words, you were a mistake anyway. Why waste a room on you? Dad locked the door behind me. I had nowhere to go except my grandparents house. Emma opened the door, saw my backpack and pulled me into a hug. You're staying here, end of story. When Grandpa found out, his face hardened in a way I'd never seen. I've been paying their bills for years, he said quietly. Electric, property tax, everything I looked up confused. You what? I bought them that house when they got married, kept it in my name. They've been tenants without rent. My stomach dropped. Wait, you own it. Every brick. He leaned back. And they repay me by throwing out my grandson. He pulled out a lawyer's card. Call him in the morning. Tell him who you are and what happened. The next day I called Alonzo. He confirmed everything. That house isn't theirs. Legally, your grandfather can evict them whenever he wants. Grandpa picked up his phone and put it on speaker. When dad answered, Grandpa's voice was calm. Time to pack your things and leave the house. Silence and laughter. You can't be serious, mom said. Dead serious. You forgot whose name is on the deed. It's mine, dad stammered. You can't just kick us out. I paid for every year you live there, the house, the bills, the axes. Consider this your eviction notice. Ashley's voice cut in. This is ridiculous, Grandpa chuckled. Still running your mouth. You sound just like your mother. Dad, please, mom hissed. You threw my grandson on the street. Now it's your turn. He hung up. Two days later, they showed up, all three of them. Dad cleared his throat.

I started sleeping in his bedroom three nights a week. His baseball trophies were lined up perfectly on the shelf, dust free like she cleaned them daily. His high school girlfriend's photo was still in a frame on the nightstand. This pretty blonde girl with braces. His Xbox controllers were exactly where he left them, one still half charged. One night around midnight, she knocked softly on my door, asked if I remember the time we went camping in Colorado when he was 15, the trip where they saw a bear and Michael made her laugh so hard she snorted. I didn't correct her. I just said, yeah, that was a good trip. The stars were incredible. She smiled, really smiled. I'm so glad you're home, honey. I was making one $400 a week to be someone's ghost, to live in a dead kid's clothes and eat his favorite meals and sleep in his bed. Then one morning I came downstairs and found her sitting at the kitchen table in complete darkness. No coffee brewing, no breakfast on the stove, just sitting there staring at nothing with tears running down her face. I need to tell you something, she said. He pulled out this thick leather photo album. Michael at 6 years old, missing his front teeth, Michael at his high School graduation in a blue cap and gown. Michael the day before the accident, grinning in that same navy hoodie I was wearing. He was driving home to surprise me for my birthday, she said, voice barely above a whisper. He'd been away at college for two years. He fell asleep at the wheel 20 minutes from this house. 20 minutes. She closed the album slowly. Thank you for giving me these weeks. I know it's wrong. I know it's unhealthy. I know you're not him and never will be. But I just needed to know what it felt like to have my son home one last time, to make him breakfast, to say good night, to feel like a mother again. She handed me a thick vanilla envelope. Inside was $5,000 in cash, all hundreds. This is for everything, but I can't keep doing this to you or to myself. I took the money and walked to my car in silence. As I was pulling out of the driveway, I looked back at the house one final time. She was standing alone in the kitchen window, setting the table with two plates like she did every morning. Then she picked one up and put it back in the cabinet. I never went back, never called, never texted. That job paid for three months of rent and got me back on my feet. But I think about her every single day.

Junior year. This girl, Brielle, made everything about her and I mean everything. She'd cry over those Brielle Mclachlan puppy commercials at lunch, full on sobbing with her head on the table. She'd scream random things in the hallway just to see who'd turn around. She once faked a panic attack because someone wore the same shirt as her to school. Most people bought into it. She had this whole crew that treated her like she was made of glass. I tried to ignore her, but we were both in choir so I couldn't escape complete. Then came the spring concert. Twenty minutes before showtime, all 100 of us were on the risers doing final rehearsals. The auditorium was packed with early parents finding seats, programs, wrestling that pre show energy. Brielle was front row center. Obviously. She always made sure she got the spotlight positions. Suddenly the side door opened and Brielle's mom walked in. Not rushed, just purposeful. She went straight to our director, Mr Ford, and whispered something in his ear. He nodded, looked at Brielle and called her name over the microphone. Brielle, can you come down, please? The entire choir went silent. Brielle climbed down from the risers, her heels clicking on the stage floor. Her mom pulled her aside, leaned in close and said maybe three sentences. That's when Brielle screamed. Not a gasp, not a cry, a full horror movie blood curdling scream that Echoed off every wall in that auditorium. Parents and the audience stood up. Some of the freshman girls started crying just from hearing it. Brielle took off running for the exit, but she only made it about 20 feet before her legs gave out. She collapsed right there on the auditorium floor, wailing like someone had ripped her heart out. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Over and over and over. Her mom rushed over, grabbed her by the elbow and practically dragged her out through the side door. The whole thing took maybe 90 seconds, but it felt like an hour. Mr Ford stood there frozen. Nobody knew what to do. Finally, he cleared his throat and said, let's, let's take five minutes. The second we got backstage, everyone pulled out their phones. Our group chat exploded with messages. Someone texted Brielle directly. She responded. Twenty minutes later, nothing will ever be the same. Then why couldn't it have been me? Then she stopped responding entirely. Words spread fast.

I'm dating a white woman. My wife passed three years ago. Colon cancer. She was only forty one. Our daughter Jasmine was fourteen when it happened. It destroyed us both. For two years I barely functioned. I went to work, came home, made dinner, and we'd sit on the couch watching whatever was on TV. We didn't talk much. We're just surviving. Then I met Lindsay at a work conference last year. She's an accountant at a company we partner with. We started talking about spreadsheets and somehow ended up talking for three hours about everything else. She made me laugh for the first time in forever. We exchanged numbers. I didn't tell Jasmine I was seeing someone. I don't know why. Maybe because it felt too soon. Maybe because I didn't want to upset her. We'd text during the day, grab lunch when we could. And I'd see her on weekends when Jasmine was at her grandma's house. Six months in, Lindsay wanted to meet Jasmine. I kept putting it off. Then one Saturday, Jasmine came home early from her friend's house. I was in the kitchen making coffee when she walked in and saw Lindsay sitting at our table eating cereal. Jasmine froze. She looked at Lindsay, then at me, then back at Lindsay. Her face went completely blank. Jasmine, this is Lindsay. She. We've been seeing each other. Jasmine didn't say anything. She just turned around and went to her room. The door slammed so hard, a picture frame fell off the hallway wall. Lindsay looked uncomfortable. Should I go? No, just give me a minute.

You just brought some random white lady into mom's kitchen like it's nothing. I opened the door. Jasmine was sitting on her bed with her arms crossed. Her eyes were red. Her name is Lindsay. And, yes, I should have told you. I'm sorry, but this has nothing to do with. It has everything to do with it. Mom's been gone three years, and you replace her with someone who doesn't even look like us. Nobody's replacing mom. That's not what this is. Then what is it? Because it looks like you moved on real quick. I tried to explain. I told her I've been seeing Lindsay for months, that I didn't know how to bring it up, that I was scared of how she'd react, that I was still figuring everything out myself. Jasmine didn't care. She said I was disrespecting Mom's memory, that I should have at least told her before bringing someone into our house. And, yeah, she kept bringing up the fact that Lindsay was white. Lindsay left after 20 minutes. She texted me later saying she understood if I needed space to deal with this. The next week was hell. Jasmine barely spoke. To me, she started spending more time at her grandma's. My mother in law called me asking what was going on. When I told her, she went quiet for a long time.

So I've been watching Jordan and Mia's two kids every Thursday night for about six months. They lived three doors down, cute brick house with the inflatable pool always in the front yard. The kids were easy, 6 and 8 years old, ate Mac and cheese without complaining, went to bed by 9. Jordan traveled for work a lot and Mia worked late shifts at the urgent care clinic. So they needed the help. I was making decent money, like 40 bucks a night just to watch Netflix. After the kids passed out, last Thursday started normal. Mia texted me around 4 saying she'd be home by midnight, left pizza money on the counter. Usual deal. I showed up at 6:30. Kids were already in pajamas, watching some cartoon about talking dogs. Jordan was packing his laptop bag, said he had to catch a flight to Dallas to be back Sunday. Cool, whatever. I helped the kids brush their teeth, read them two chapters of some book about dragons. Lights out. By 9:15, I was on the couch watching some crime show when I heard the front door open around 10:30. Figured Mia got off early, which was great because I had an exam to study for. But it was Jordan walking in, still in his work clothes, tie loosened. He looked surprised to see me, said his flight got canceled. Something about weather delays. He asked if the kids went down okay, poured himself some whiskey from the cabinet, real casual. Then he sat down next to me on the couch, not like across the room or in the armchair right next to me, close enough I could smell the whiskey. Started talking about how stressful work was, how Mia was always tired lately, how they barely talked anymore. I just nodded, trying to focus on my phone, texting my roommate about picking me up early. He put his hand on my knee, said I was really mature for 20, that he could tell I understood things most people my age didn't. I stood up immediately, grabbed my backpack. He asked where I was going, said Mia wouldn't be home for another hour, that we could just talk, talk like I was stupid. I told him I had to leave, that my roommate was outside. He got defensive, said I was misreading the situation, that he was just being friendly. Then he tried to hand me 60 bucks instead of the usual 40, said I deserved extra for dealing with his stress tonight. I left the money on the table and walked out. My roommate picked me up, asked why I looked freaked out. I told her everything. He said I needed to tell Mia that Jordan was a creep and would probably try it with the next babysitter, too. I couldn't sleep that night, kept thinking about those kids. And how Mia seemed like a good person who deserved to know. Friday morning, I texted Mia asking if she had a minute to talk. She called me within 5 minutes, sounded worried, asked if something happened with the kids. I told her everyone was fine, but I needed to tell her something about Thursday night. There was this long silence. Then she asked me to come over at 2, that Jordan would be at the office. I showed up at 2 exactly. Mia answered in scrubs, looked exhausted, had her hair in a messy bun. We sat at the kitchen table, same table where the kids.

Nancy, is there anything you'd like to say to Jake and his family? Mom stammered. I didn't do anything. Jake is lying. Grandma nodded to Uncle Bruce, who pulled up her security camera footage. On a tablet, my mother's voice played loud and clear. Go home. There's no room left. Helen told me if you showed up late, send you away. The room exploded in whispers. Mom's face went ghost white. Janet, my dad's cousin, shook her head in disgust. Nancy, I never thought you could do something like this. Even animals have more compassion than grandma spoke words I'll never forget. From this moment forward, I no longer have a son named Dennis and no daughter in law named Nancy. My father begged. My mother sobbed. Grandma's voice cut through their please. You stopped being my son when you favored Charles over Jake. You have 30 days to leave the house you're living in. The estate in Highlands Ranch will be passed to Jake and his family. Now leave. They stumbled out, humiliated and homeless. Charles tried to plead his case, but grandma cut him off. You stayed silent in the face of injustice and benefited from it. That makes you complicit. He stormed out, hissing at me. You've torn this whole family apart. The next morning, grandma called her lawyer. By afternoon, the legal paperwork was in motion. Two properties worth $2 million transferred to my parents. Tried one last desperate move. They showed up. At my house days later, screaming threats. I called the police, filed a restraining order, and had them legally banned from contact for three years. Thirty days later, they moved out. I renovated both properties and now earn between 8 thousand to 10 thousand dollars a month in rental income. All saved for Logan's future. A year has passed. My parents live in a tiny apartment three states away, surviving on Social Security. Charles moved across the country and hasn't spoken to me since. Meanwhile, my wife Paisley is eight months pregnant. Logan runs to Grandma Helen every weekend with new drawings and stories. And she's framed his Christmas card on her living room wall, where every visitor can see it. Last night, Logan asked the baby in Paisley's belly, hey, baby, when you're born, I'll teach you how to make cards for great grandma. She keeps mine on her wall forever. I don't feel guilty. I feel free.

Underneath, Nathan had written in shaky handwriting, I lied during your trial. I was paid to say you talked about needing money. I was paid to make you look guilty. I can't let you die without knowing I'm the reason you're here. I've lived with this for nine years and I can't anymore. I'm confessing to the police today whether you see me or not. I'm sorry. At five forty five PM, 15 minutes before execution, the guard came in. Your brother just walked into the police station across the street. He told them he has evidence of perjury in your case and witness tampering. They're calling the da now. The warden burst in. Two minutes later, we're holding the execution. Your brother is giving a statement. He's naming the person who paid him to lie, says it was your business partner's brother who wanted the insurance payout and needed you convicted. Five fifty two PM, Eight minutes before I was supposed to die, they walked me back to my cell instead of the chamber. Nathan's statement triggered an emergency review. The person he named, Craig Donovan, was my business partner's younger brother who inherited everything after the murder and my conviction. Police had found text messages between Nathan and Craig from nine years ago, payments, instructions on what to say during testimony, threats about what would happen if Nathan didn't cooperate. At six fifteen PM, they arrested Craig, confessed within two hours, said he'd killed His own brother for the insurance money and framed me because I was the easiest target. The da filed for my conviction to be vacated at eight PM that night. Nathan waited in the visitor room until eleven PM when they finally let him see me. We sat on opposite sides of the glass. He'd been crying for hours. I almost let you die, he said. I was too scared to come forward until yesterday. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I just kept seeing your face. Why did you refuse to see me? I asked. If I'd seen you, would you have told me? He shook his head, I don't know. I thought maybe if I forced you to see me, I'd find the courage. But when you kept saying no, I realized I had to do it. Whether you forgave me or not, the guilt was going to kill me. I stared at my brother through the glass. If I'd agreed to see you Thursday morning, would you have confessed then? He thought about it. Honestly, probably not. I think I needed the time, needed to sit with it, watch them prepare you to die. The waiting made me face what I've done. The guard told me later that if I'd seen Nathan on Thursday, he would have tried to confess but probably wouldn't have gone through with contacting police until too late. The 30 hours he spent waiting, being refused, sitting in guilt is what broke him. Enough to act. My refusing to see him forced him to sit alone with his conscience for so long that turning himself in became his only option. They released me four months later with full exoneration and $3 million from the state.

I'm dating a white woman. My wife passed three years ago. Colon cancer. She was only forty one. Our daughter Jasmine was fourteen when it happened. It destroyed us both. For two years I barely functioned. I went to work, came home, made dinner, and we'd sit on the couch watching whatever was on TV. We didn't talk much. We're just surviving. Then I met Lindsay at a work conference last year. She's an accountant at a company we partner with. We started talking about spreadsheets and somehow ended up talking for three hours about everything else. She made me laugh for the first time in forever. We exchanged numbers. I didn't tell Jasmine I was seeing someone. I don't know why. Maybe because it felt too soon. Maybe because I didn't want to upset her. We'd text during the day, grab lunch when we could. And I'd see her on weekends when Jasmine was at her grandma's house. Six months in, Lindsay wanted to meet Jasmine. I kept putting it off. Then one Saturday, Jasmine came home early from her friend's house. I was in the kitchen making coffee when she walked in and saw Lindsay sitting at our table eating cereal. Jasmine froze. She looked at Lindsay, then at me, then back at Lindsay. Her face went completely blank. Jasmine, this is Lindsay. She. We've been seeing each other. Jasmine didn't say anything.

She needs it more. I was furious. But then the finance company called and said, you are still the legal owner. No one has the right to sell it. I decided to teach my dad and sister a lesson. Three months ago, I came home from work to find my sister, Victoria, inside my apartment, living there. How did you get in? She looked at me like I was the intruder. This is my place now. Dad transferred ownership. I called my father 10 times. No answer. Finally, a text. I sold the apartment to your sister. She needs it more. I stared at the screen as if it was his property, as if I hadn't paid every mortgage payment for two years. This wasn't new. When I was 7, my mom bought me a Barbie I'd wanted for months. My father snatched it away and gave it to Victoria. She's older. At 10, he gave my scooter away. She needs it more. At 16, I worked all summer for a bike. Less than a week later, Victoria was riding it. When I objected, he called me selfish. Now at 28, he'd taken my apartment. I drove to his house. He sat in his armchair, tea in hand, reading the newspaper. No guilt. You can't do this, I shouted. That apartment belongs to me. He set down his teacup. My name is on the papers. I Had the right. I paid for every cent. Month after month. He shrugged. My name was on the documents. Mother stepped forward. No more silence. You only signed to help her buy it. She paid everything. You never contributed a single dollar. You've mistreated her for years. Always favoring Victoria. If you don't return this apartment, I will divorce you and disown Victoria. Silence filled the room. My father grabbed his keys and walked out. The next morning, my phone rang. Finance company, we received a transfer request for your apartment. There are irregularities. Can you come to our office tomorrow? I'll be there. At the office, the director slid a folder forward. The transfer cannot proceed. This apartment has an outstanding loan. You're the payer, not your father. Hope sparked. So it's still mine? Exactly. He had no right to sell it. Then another file. We discovered something unusual inside. A 20,000.

Appointment against my husband's wishes. My husband Greg has this weird thing about boundaries. Not like normal boundaries, but his version where he gets to decide who I'm friends with and what I do with my time. He's been like this since we got married two years ago, and, honestly, it's gotten worse. My best friend Natalie called me on Tuesday morning. She was freaking out because she had an IUD insertion scheduled for Thursday, and she was terrified of going alone. Her boyfriend had bailed on her last minute because of some work thing. She was literally crying on the phone asking if I could come with her. I told her of course I would. That's what friends do. But when I mentioned it to Greg that night over dinner, he lost it. He said it was inappropriate for me to be involved in Natalie's reproductive health stuff, that it was too personal, and I shouldn't be getting mixed up in her private medical business. I told him she was scared and needed support, but he just kept saying no. He literally said if I went to that appointment, there would be consequences. I. I asked him what that meant, and he just stared at me with this cold look and said I'd find out. Thursday morning came, and I had to make a choice. Natalie sent me three texts asking if I was still coming. I could tell she was Panicking, I looked at Greg eating his cereal, and I just said I was going out to run errands. He knew. I could see it in his face, but I left anyway. The appointment was at a clinic about 20 minutes away. Natalie was already in the waiting room when I got there, looking pale and picking at her nails. She hugged me so tight when she saw me and whispered thank you, like five times. They called her back after about 15 minutes. The nurse asked if she wanted someone with her, and Natalie grabbed my hand. We went into the small room with a medical table and bright lights. The doctor came in and explained the whole procedure. Natalie was squeezing my hand so hard, I thought she might break it. The insertion itself took maybe 10 minutes, but Natalie was crying the whole time. Not loud crying, just tears streaming down her face. I kept telling her to breathe and that she was doing great. The doctor was nice about it and kept checking if she was okay. When it was done, Natalie had to lie there for a bit because she felt dizzy. The nurse brought her some juice and crackers. I sat next to her, and we just talked about random stuff to take her mind off it. She told me she didn't know what she would have done if I hadn't come. We left the clinic around 11. I drove Natalie home and made Sure. She was settled on her couch with a heating pad and her pain meds. He thanked me again and said I was the best friend she could ask for. I got home around 1 in the afternoon. Greg's car was in the driveway. He usually doesn't get home until 6, so I knew something was up. I walked in, and he was sitting on the couch with his arms crossed. He asked where I'd been. I told him I took Natalie to her appointment. He stood up and started yelling about how I disrespected him and went behind his back, that I chose my friend over my husband. I yelled back that Natalie needed me, and I wasn't going to abandon her just because he had some weird hang up about medical appointment.

So picture this. It's Saturday morning, I'm in the kitchen, still in my robe, hair looking like a microwave popcorn bag that exploded, making pancakes like a normal mom, just trying to survive my husband. Well, my ex now comes in all grumpy cause I apparently burned the bacon. He starts mumbling under his breath like, you can't even cook without smoking the whole house up. Now I'm trying to stay calm, right? I got syrup on my hands, butter on my sleeve. And I'm like, you want. Want eggs or you want silence? Pick one. He rolls his eyes and says, no wonder I eat out so much. And not the restaurant kind, if you catch my drift. And that's when my eight year old daughter Zoe, who'd been sitting at the table eating her cereal all quiet, freezes, spoon halfway to her mouth. You can hear the Wi Fi disconnect. Then she goes, dead serious, dad, you eat out? He chokes, starts stuttering, I, uh, I meant restaurants, honey. She squints at him like a detective in a Pixar movie and goes, which restaurant? Huh? Tiffany's kitchen. I almost spit my coffee through my nose. He's red as ketchup. That's not funny, young lady. And she stands up on that little chair, hands on hips, voice shaking but strong. Don't talk to my mom like that, you bald, lying French fry! Now my mind you this Man still got a full head of hair, but she hit him right in the ego. He's standing there like, did she just call me a French fry? Then it gets worse. She grabs the spatula off the counter like. Like a sword. Apologize, or I flip you like a pancake. At this point, I'm half terrified, half proud. I'm like, sweetheart, put the spatula down. She goes, not till he says sorry. He's like, this is ridiculous. She goes, So's your attitude. Now he's backing up like she's about to duel him for the custody agreement. The dogs barking, smoke alarm going off cause of the bacon. And my daughter's still there holding that spatula like she's in a Marvel origin story. Finally he sighs and says, okay, I'm sorry. And she, without missing a beat, flips the spatula onto the counter and goes, good boy. Now go sit down. Like she was the parent. He just sat there.

Junior year. This girl, Brielle, made everything about her and I mean everything. She'd cry over those Brielle Mclachlan puppy commercials at lunch, full on sobbing with her head on the table. She'd scream random things in the hallway just to see who'd turn around. She once faked a panic attack because someone wore the same shirt as her to school. Most people bought into it. She had this whole crew that treated her like she was made of glass. I tried to ignore her, but we were both in choir so I couldn't escape complete. Then came the spring concert. Twenty minutes before showtime, all 100 of us were on the risers doing final rehearsals. The auditorium was packed with early parents finding seats, programs, wrestling that pre show energy. Brielle was front row center. Obviously. She always made sure she got the spotlight positions. Suddenly the side door opened and Brielle's mom walked in. Not rushed, just purposeful. She went straight to our director, Mr Ford, and whispered something in his ear. He nodded, looked at Brielle and called her name over the microphone. Brielle, can you come down, please? The entire choir went silent. Brielle climbed down from the risers, her heels clicking on the stage floor. Her mom pulled her aside, leaned in close and said maybe three sentences. That's when Brielle screamed. Not a gasp, not a cry, a full horror movie blood curdling scream that Echoed off every wall in that auditorium. Parents and the audience stood up. Some of the freshman girls started crying just from hearing it. Brielle took off running for the exit, but she only made it about 20 feet before her legs gave out. She collapsed right there on the auditorium floor, wailing like someone had ripped her heart out. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Over and over and over. Her mom rushed over, grabbed her by the elbow and practically dragged her out through the side door. The whole thing took maybe 90 seconds, but it felt like an hour. Mr Ford stood there frozen. Nobody knew what to do. Finally, he cleared his throat and said, let's, let's take five minutes. The second we got backstage, everyone pulled out their phones. Our group chat.

The guard came to my cell on Thursday morning with the visitor list. You have someone requesting to see you. Who? Your brother, Nathan. I turned away from the bars. Tell him no. The guard didn't move. He's driven eight hours to get here. It's been three years since you've seen him. I don't care. I don't wanna see him. The guard sighed and left. An hour later, he came back. He's still in the waiting room. Says he'll wait all day if he has to. My answer hasn't changed. Friday was execution day. Been on death row for nine years after being convicted of killing my business partner during a robbery. The evidence was circumstantial, but the jury believed the prosecution's timeline. My family believed it, too. Everyone except my mother. And she died six years ago still believing I was innocent. Nathan had testified against me during trial. Said I talked about needing money. Said I've been acting strange around the time of the murder. His testimony helped convict me. Friday morning, 8:00am, the guard returned. Your brother is back. He slept in his car in the parking lot. He's asking to see you one more time before I cut him off. No. I have nothing to say to him. Why would I waste my last hours on earth with the person who helped put me? The guard nodded and left. At 10:00am, the chaplain came. Mister Whitmore. Your brother is in the chapel. He's been praying since 6:00am. The chaplain looked exhausted. He asked me to tell you he's sorry. For what? For everything. That's what he said. For everything. I stared at the ceiling of my cell. Too late for sorry. Noon came. They brought lunch. I couldn't eat. The guard who brought the tray leaned against the bars. Your brother is still here? He's not leaving. He keeps saying he needs to see you. It's important. Tell him to go home. At 2 p m, four hours before execution, the warden himself came to my cell. Mister Whitmore, I've been doing this job for 23 years. I've never seen someone wait like your brother is waiting. He's been here for over 30 hours. He won't eat, won't leave. Just keep saying he has to see you. Good for him. The warden studied me. You're really going to die without hearing what he has to say? Yes. What could he possibly say that would matter now? At four PM, two hours left, they came to prep me for the execution. The guard who'd been bringing me messages all day, walked beside me. Your brother is sitting on the floor outside the visitor room. He's just sitting there. I said nothing. They took me to the holding room, where I'd wait until six PM. The chaplain tried again. Your brother asked me to give you this. He handed me a folded piece of paper. Didn't open. It just held it. The chaplain left at five thirty PM. I finally unfolded the paper. It was a photo copy of a bank statement. Nathan's bank statement from nine years ago. The week of the murder. It showed a deposit of $50,000. On the day after my business partner was killed.

He responds with, what? I'm just being honest about. Our little virgin friend here. Finally, our friend with zero no filter and loves drama more than Netflix goes, okay, what is happening? You're all acting weirder than that time we tried to play twister. Everyone turns to look at us and I crack like an egg hitting concrete. He thinks I slept with his girlfriend.

The room explode into laughter like everyone's doubled over. Can't breathe. Cackling kind. The drama loving friend manages to wheeze out, oh my god, you, the innocent baby who still won't even curse in front of us. Another friend jumps in with, dude, remember when we played truth or dare and you chose dare, so we made you text your crush hey! And you almost fainted? Then another adds in, wait, he's Literally the only person here she hasn't dated and starts listing on their fingers. She dated me freshman year. One of us for that whole summer. And don't forget their fireman phase. The girlfriend is nodding along going yeah, it's true. This one's like the friend group's little brother. We all agreed he's off limits. Would be like dating a puppy. I'm not sure how to feel about that comment, and I'm about to ask for her to clarify when the boyfriend's face goes a shade of purple. I didn't know humans could turn. All of us simultaneously decide the party's dead, and gather our stuff with the speed of people evacuating a fire. The girlfriend stays behind for exactly one minute.

The door clicked open and my sister rushed past me to the downstairs bathroom while I had to put everything back together with my hands shaking. I was listening for any sound from my dad's room, knowing that if he woke up now and found my sister gone, we were done for. I was turning the final screw when my dad's door suddenly opened and his voice boomed through the darkness what's going on? My sister had just gotten back and ducked into her room so fast I barely saw them move. I pulled her door shut, knowing it looked locked, even though it would never lock again, then turned around with the screwdriver still in my hand. I couldn't sleep, so I was tightening the loose screws on my door handle. Because it's been rattling, I said, holding up the screwdriver where he could see. My dad walked closer, squinting in the dark, and asked why I was at my sister's door if I was fixing my own. I was checking if hers was loose, too. But it's fine, I lied, walking past him toward my room like everything was normal. He grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise, and said if he found out I was lying, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I just nodded and pulled away, heading to my room while he went to my sister's door and Actually tried the handle. It didn't turn from the outside because it's still looked locked. And he grunted and went back to bed. But then he stopped in his doorway and came back, putting his key in the lock and turning it. I heard the mechanism click like it always did, but I knew it wasn't actually locking anything anymore. He finally went back to his room, and I laid in my bed for an hour before I dared to whisper through the wall that my sister could open the door from inside whenever she needed to. Every time he locked my sister in that room, she could get out once he fell asleep, and we'd meet in the kitchen, where I'd have water and crackers waiting. Now we're adults with no contact with that dad. And sometimes we joke that the lock probably still doesn't work, and he still has no idea.

I started tickling her during a boring scene. She's incredibly ticklish. Always has been. She squirmed and laughed, trying to fight me off. Stop it! She gasped between laughs. I love you, but I swear I'll kill you if you don't stop! We both froze instantly. She slapped her hand over her mouth, eyes wide. Her cheeks turned bright red. What did you just say? I asked. She stared at me for a second, then dropped her hand. She looked down, suddenly finding the blanket pattern fascinating. I. I said I love you, she whispered, barely audible. Just like that? After five years? She nodded, still not looking up. After Kevin. I just. I couldn't say those words. He made me feel so stupid. But for loving him when he never loved me back. I didn't want to feel that vulnerable ever again. So what changed? Seeing him last month, realizing he still has power over me after all this time. She finally met my eyes. I don't want him controlling what I can and can't say to you anymore. I couldn't stop smiling. My face hurt from smiling. I tried to play it cool, but I'm sure I looked like an idiot. Mia glanced over at me and saw my face. He blushed deeper, but she was smiling too. Don't be weird about it, she muttered. I'm not being weird, I said, still grinning like crazy. She said it Again, before we fell asleep. Quieter this time, just for me. Her friends didn't even notice the change over the next few days, but I did. It was just a fact now. This morning, I woke up to find her already making coffee. When she saw me, she blushed slightly. I love you, she said softly, like she was still getting used to how the words felt in her mouth. She said it three more times before I left for work, each time getting more natural, less hesitant. Five years of silence, broken by a slip during a tickle fight. Now she's making up for lost time. And I'm definitely not complaining.

I was 16 and my sister was 13 when my dad locked them in her bedroom for getting a B minus on a math test. The punishment started after dinner, and now it was past midnight with no bathroom access, no water, nothing since lunch. Through our shared wall, I heard crying that turned into these horrible dry heating sounds like she was about to be. My dad slept eight feet away across the hall and would beat us both if we woke him up. But my sister was literally suffering and I couldn't just lay there listening anymore. I snuck down to the garage and grabbed a flathead screwdriver from my dad's toolbox and stood outside my sister's door trying to figure out what to do. When I whispered through the crack, her voice came back all shaky, saying she really needed the bathroom and her stomach hurts so bad she couldn't stand up straight. I looked at that brass lock and realised I had no clue how to pick it, and the tutorials on my phone needed tools I didn't have. I tried sliding my school ID between the door and frame, but this was a real deadbolt that wouldn't move at all. Our old house had floors that creaked with every single step, and my dad's door was so close I could hear him Snoring. Then the snoring stopped for a second, and I froze until it started again, my legs actually shaking from fear. That's when I noticed four screws holding the door handle's exterior plate and figured maybe I could take the whole thing apart. The first screw took forever because I had to turn it so slowly to avoid making noise, and my hands were sweating so much, I kept losing my grip. The second screw started to fall, and I barely caught it before it hit the floor, which would have woken everyone. My dad coughed in his sleep, and I stood there for what felt like an hour, not moving, not breathing, just waiting. The third screw was stripped, and I had to push harder, which made this tiny squeaking sound that sounded so loud in the quiet at house. By the fourth screw, I could hear my sister throwing up into something on the other side of the door, and that made me work faster, even though faster meant more noise. With the plate. Fine

Are you screwing the new girl? I instantly start sweating because I know exactly what this is about. My boss hires exclusively hot waitresses so he can hook up with them. Anna is the newest one, mid thirties and stuff. And for the past three weeks, she's been hanging around me instead of him. So I smile at him. I'm not sure that's any of your business. He slams the papers on his desk down hard, spins around in his chair. Do you like your job? Wanna keep it? I stay quiet. Then stop seeing Anna. Stop picking her up. Stop hanging with her every second. Stop letting her hang on you, or I'll fire you. I agree, because I need the money. For the next two weeks, I treat Anna like she's invisible. Won't look at her, won't talk to her. My boss is loving it, but ignoring her only makes it worse. Anna keeps finding excuses to work near me, asking random questions. I keep my answers short. It's torture. Then one Saturday night, I'm on breakout back when Anna burst through the door, pissed. She walks right up to me. Are you mad at me? She asks. Tell her no, but that us being friends is making things uncomfortable with the bosses. They're getting pissed at me because he wants to screw me, she says. I confirm that. Yes, because he wants to screw her. She steps closer. Do you want to screw me? I laugh nervously, completely at a loss for words, mumble something about her being beautiful and any guy being attracted to her. I asked if you wanted to screw me, she says again. I tell her, yeah, I would screw her. Good. When we get off work tonight, take me back to my place and show me what you got. She walks back inside. I sit there in complete shock. This can't be real. Is this a prank? The other servers watching from inside, laughing at me. This doesn't happen to guys like me. But I don't care if it is a prank. I'm showing up. The rest of the shift is the longest three hours of my life. We don't talk, but I catch her smiling at me from across the restaurant. My hands are shaking when I'm running food, I drop a fork and have to ask for another one. One of the other servers asks if I'm okay, and I just nod like an idiot. The shift finally ends, and I tell Anna to meet me at my Jeep in five minutes. We leave separately so nobody notices. When she climbs in, she's grinning, nervous, terrified, I admit. We pull up to her house, and I remember my boss drives right past here every night. He'll see my car. Anna tells me to park at the doctor's office across the street in the business complex. Perfect, I say. Already pulling across the street. You'll never know. I park, run across the street in my all black work clothes. Walk into her house. She's standing in her underwear. Thirty minutes later, I'm convinced I'm the luckiest person alive. She's on top of me, room darkly lit. Greatest moment of my life. That's when I see flashlights on her ceiling, under her door.

I've always been my sister's biggest cheerleader. We're only 14 months apart and basically twins. Growing up, she taught me how to perfect my jump shot. I helped her study for the SATs. We've had each other's backs through everything. when she made it to the state basketball finals and asked me to come, I showed up with a foam finger, her Jersey number painted on my face and absolutely no shame. This was the game that could get her a full ride to do college. Scouts were everywhere. The gymnasium was completely sold out. I managed to squeeze into the front row of the student section right behind the team bench. The atmosphere was insane. Everyone was on their feet screaming. But I took it to a whole different level. Every time my sister touched the ball, I went ballistic. That's my sister. Let's go, Maya. I was jumping up and down so hard the bleachers were shaking. About 10 minutes into the first quarter, I noticed this guy sitting in the section across from me, Letterman jacket, perfectly styled hair, surrounded by what looked like the entire football team. He kept shooting me these dark, angry looks. First I thought maybe I was being too obnoxious, so I tried to tone it down just a little. But then during the first time out, I heard him talking loud enough for his whole section To hear someone over there needs to shut up about my girl, like we get it, she's talented, but she belongs to me. My stomach dropped. I looked down at my sister on the court. She was listening to coach, completely locked in on the game. Was he talking about her? I wanted to march over there and ask him directly, but something about his vibe made me uncomfortable. Instead, I convinced myself he had to be dating some other player because if that was my sister's boyfriend, she had terrible taste. Second quarter started and my sister was absolutely on fire. She hit three straight 3 pointers. I couldn't help myself. I went right back to screaming her name, waving that foam finger like my life depended on it. This was her moment. But every single time I cheered, that guy would stare me down with this intense scare.

The ingredients were all here, so I gave it a shot. You just hit a home run, I hope. Yes, you did. I did most of the work. You have a real gift. You think you can do this again? I don't know, cause I'm pretty sure your mother's gonna be working late again, especially if I call her supervisor. Oh, brownies are done. Brownies. Be right back. I'm calling the hospital. Something smells good. I'm making chili. It'll be ready in a minute. Uh, that that all the chili you made? Yeah, just the two of us, right? Actually, it's the five of us. This is Billy Joe Barney and they are mighty hungry. Bobby, Jim Barney, could you excuse us? So I'm supposed to magically turn chili for two into chili for five? Thank you. This is gonna take hours and I have a book report due on weathering heights. Anybody read Weathering Heights? Anybody see the movie? Barney, you got a book report due. I need 5 pages by dessert. You are so lucky I bought extra beans. Hey, PJ. Hey, dad, what you doing? Homework. Homework before dinner? That doesn't sound right. Well, I got a lot to do. Got it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm sorry. Did you hear That hear what Tummy's grumbling? You know what? With your mother working late and all, dad, I'd, I'd cook something for you, but I really gotta finish. Or you could cook and I could do your homework. And you know what? I happen to be very good at trigonometry. It's my second love, dad. Your second love is pronounced trigonometry. Come on, you get up there and you start cooking. I will hit the books. Great news, I am getting an F in trigonometry and I'm not doing so hot in English either. Please tell Barney that no one in the weathering heights carried a lightsaber DJ. Come on, dad, I'm sorry, but I can't cook for you anymore. My grades are suffering and it's not healthy for you. How much weight have you put on since I've been cooking? 2 pounds, dad, 9 pounds. I gotta get back to the way it was when you were slim and I was getting solid D's. I guess you're right. Charlie, can you cook for daddy? No, daddy.

So long as you look like a Newborn baby, they are willing to mate with you. I'm poor, so I have this contour palette and this contour stick. I regret buying both. I must warn you, the transition from beginning to end might be startling. First things first. Check your flash. As you can see here, I have no flash. Contouring is a very dangerous game. Once a man walked in on me while I was contouring. I had to pretend I was schizophrenic so he'd think that I was playing in Cat Shit and he'd leave me alone. It was a sad day. If the men find out we can shape shift, they're going to tell the church. Eliminate the nose. You can pretend that you have no nostrils. Men will be bewitched and hand over their wallets. Men don't like nostrils. You want to look like a pterodactyl. Men love pterodactyls. Beautiful.

By the time she had the baby, we. We became friends. We were both single. We bonded. I went to the bathroom. I left her alone with Ben for five minutes. I came back, and she left a note saying she changed her mind. Caitlin, she can't do that. Not legally. State law says a birth mother has 30 days to change her mind and take her baby back. Unless the birth mother signs a waiver giving up all rights to the baby. Waivers void. Wanna sign that? While in a state of diminished capacity. What? She was suffering from postpartum depression. I'm filing for a TRO barring Lana from leaving the city and seeking an order to have Ben returned immediately. Do you remember why you chose her? I thought she could give my baby the life that I couldn't. Lana, has anything changed for you since you made that decision? Everything has changed. Ben's father is here. He came back to me and the baby. Ben's father waived his parental rights as soon as he found out you were pregnant. He said it was a mistake. We're gonna raise Ben together like a family. So as soon as the father came back, you decided you had postpartum depression? Miss Caswell, you're not a mother, are you? That's irrelevant. It's why you can't understand what it's like to have a baby and then lose him. Caitlin, you didn't give Lana any money, did you? She hasn't had a job in two years. How do they afford a brand new truck? She said she needed 20,000 for medical expenses. Do you have any receipts, any paperwork to prove how the money was spent? I don't want to know. And that's called a bribe. It's illegal. I did what she asked. I didn't want to lose them. My clients prepared to testify that she paid your client $20,000 prior to the birth of the baby. That was for medical expenses. Figured you'd say that, so I subpoenaed bank records. I'm sorry. I'll pay it back. Which shouldn't be too difficult, considering Joey has $100,000 in his bank account. What? No, we don't have that kind of money. Joey does. Joey? What is she talking about? Joey emailed Ben's baby photo to Neil and Sue Applegate of Henderson, Nevada. What is this about, counselor? The Apple Gates have wanted a baby boy for the longest time. Apparently, it cost them $100,000. Are you accusing my client of selling her baby? You sold Ben? Come on, Lana. We're not parents. Get out of here, Joey. When you see the FBI agents in the lobby, my advice, don't run. He said that he came back to me and the baby. I'm sorry, Lana. I know that might sound weird coming from me, but I really am. He belongs here. You wanna hold him? Oh, I don't know. Come here. Hey, I got you something in my bag. Oh, piglet. Just don't put him in a matching shirt, okay? Okay. Oh, hi.

If you're only allowed to check up there once, how can you determine which switch activates the lamp? A very long dental mirror. No. Three spools of twine and a personal durigible. No, flip it and flip it and flip it and flip it. I'm sorry. No. Small trained dog with a photo voltaic vest. Interesting approach, but no, flip the first switch, then wait 10 minutes. Then I turn it off and flip the second switch. Then I check upstairs. If the light is on, then it's the second switch. If the light is off, then I touch the bulb. If it's hot, then the first switch is the one. And if it's cold, then it's the third switch. Very nice, rainy, but that's a lot of work when it's obviously the second switch. Why do you say that? Any competent builder would replace the light switch one and a/2 inches out from the king's stud of the door jamb, and that would be the second switch. The other two are clearly dummy switches. I think the focus is less in construction, and I highly doubt that a school such as this would contract with a less than competent builder. I think you're missing the point. Is it the second switch? Yes. Wonderful. That's some insight right there. I'm your headmaster, Dr L. D. Curtain these two ones to watch.

Lamborghini GT. My friends, my friends. I can see in your eyes that you love my car. But don't be shy. To drive a Lamborghini, to own a Lamborghini, you must not be shy. Mr. Lamborghini, I know there are many questions about what's under the hood of this car. But my first question is, what is the price tag of the Lamborghini gt? What is the price of a beautiful woman? Hmm? A great bottle of wine? A pasta you remember the rest of your life? These things are worth whatever they ask you to pay for them. You buy a Ferrari when you want to be someone. You buy a Lamborghini when you are someone. Lamborghini.

What did you discover that changed your relationship forever? I still remember the day I was vacuuming under my daughter Lily's bed when I found her diary tucked between the wall and her mattress. Fell open when I picked it up and I saw my name underlined three times with the words I hate her in all caps. I should have closed it right there, but I didn't. I'm not proud of that. Lily had been differently. More withdrawn. Spending hours locked in her room. I thought it was normal sixteen year old stuff, but my husband kept saying something was wrong. The first few pages were typical teen drama. Boys at school, friend drama, complaints about teachers. Then I found entries about cutting. How she did it, where no one would see. How the pain helped, when everything felt too heavy. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely turn the pages. There were entries about how she thought about dying. How she wondered if anyone would really miss her. How she thought her dad might cry, but I would probably be relieved. He had written a poem about disappearing. Feeling like a ghost in her own home. About screaming with no sound coming out. I recognized some lyrics from those sad songs she always played in her room. I sat on her floor reading for an hour. That's when I found the reason. Last year, my sister was diagnosed with cancer. I threw myself into helping her, driving her to chemo, watching her kids, cooking meals. I thought I was balancing everything. But through Lily's eyes, I disappeared. Entry after entry about how I missed her soccer games, I was always tired. How I never asked about her day anymore, but spent hours on the phone talking about my sister. The worst entry was about her birthday. I promised to be home for dinner, but my sister had a bad reaction to treatment. I stayed at the hospital and completely forgot to call. Lily wrote, mom has a new daughter now. She doesn't need me anymore. She described waiting for me all night with a birthday cake she made herself sitting at the table, checking her phone every few minutes. Until finally, at midnight, she blew out her own candles and went to bed. I closed the diary and put it back exactly where I found it. Then I went to my room and cried until I couldn't breathe. That night, I told my husband I needed to talk to him. I didn't tell him about the diary, just that I realized how much I've been neglecting Lily. We worked out a schedule.

And it destroyed my entire family. It started junior year when I got a severe ear infection that left me temporarily deaf in both ears for two weeks. During those weeks, I Learned to read lips and discovered something fascinating. People say horrific things when they think you can't hear them. My hearing came back, but I didn't tell anyone. The first thing I Learned was that my best friend Sarah called me pathetic behind my back while sitting right next to me at lunch. She told Jessica how exhausting it was pretending to care about my problems. She's so needy. Sarah Mouth while I stared straight ahead. My parents were worse. At dinner, my mom would silently mouth things like, she's falling behind and everything to my dad. He'd nod and mouth back. It's probably just a phase. But the real revelation came from my sister Emma. Emma was two years older and the golden child. Straight A's, varsity soccer, early admission to Stanford. I thought we were close. I was wrong. One night, Emma brought her boyfriend over to study. I was in the living room, supposedly doing homework. I sat at the kitchen table where I could see them perfectly. Is she always this pathetic? Her boyfriend asked, gesturing toward me. Emma laughed. Pretty much. My parents baby her because she's the disappointment. Basically given up on her being successful. Like me. Doesn't that bother you? Are you kidding? It makes my life easier. They expect nothing from her. Everything from me. I kept my face neutral, but inside, I was planning my revenge. For three years, I documented everything. My parents had a betting pool with relatives about whether I'd graduate high school. My guidance counselor told colleagues I was a lost cause. Even my grandmother told my mom she was embarrassed to introduce me to her bridge club. The breaking point came at Emma's graduation party. The whole extended family was there, celebrating her acceptance to medical school. I sat in the corner playing the part of the disabled sister. That's when I overheard my parents talking to my uncle.

At least one of our kids turned out normal. We can focus our college fund entirely on Emma's medical school now. My mom nodded. The deaf one will probably qualify for disability benefits anyway. We don't have to worry about her future anymore. They were planning to abandon me financially because they thought I was disabled. I stood up, walked to the center of the room, and clapped my hands loudly. Can everyone hear that? I asked. Clearly. The room went silent. Emma's face went white. Because I can hear everything, I continued. Every cruel word, every whispered insult, every plan you've made behind my back for three years. My mother's mouth fell open. What do you mean? I mean, I've been able to hear perfectly since junior year. I just wanted to see what kind of people my family really were when they thought I couldn't hear them. I pulled out my phone and played a recording. My parents discussing how much money they'd save by not sending the defective one to college. Emma started crying. We didn't mean. Yes, you did. I cut her off. I turned to my parents. You raised me for 18 years, then wrote me off the moment you thought I had a disability. I picked up my graduation gift, a cheap bracelet they'd clearly grabbed last minute, and handed it back to my mom. Keep this. You'll need to save money now that you only have one Daughter I walked out and never went back. Five years later, I'm finishing my master's degree in psychology. Emma dropped out of medical school after two years. Turns out she couldn't handle pressure without her parents doing everything for her. They've tried reaching out, claiming they misunderstood what I heard. But I have three years of recordings that say otherwise. Sometimes people ask if I regret the deception. The answer is simple. I regret that it was necessary. But I Learned the most valuable lesson of my life. When people show you who they really are, believe them, even when they think you can't hear them.

My girlfriend Bianca is a model. I'm an accountant. When she agreed to a second date, my brother literally asked if I was paying her. Eight months in, everything was perfect. She was funny, spontaneous. Literally everything a man dreams of. We'd stay up talking until 3:00am. She'd surprise me at work with lunch. Made me feel like I was the only guy in the world. Then I moved into her place. Little things started changing. The way she'd phrase questions that weren't really questions. How her suggestions felt less like suggestions. Still perfect on the surface, but the way she looked at me was different. Then Christmas morning changed everything. We're opening gifts in bed and she hands me this perfectly wrapped box with a huge smile. Inside is a leather looking dog collar with biancas engraved on a silver tag. We both burst out laughing. For when you're being a bad boy, she joked, kissing me. I tossed the gag gift in the closet with the ugly sweater my mom sent. A week later, she's making dinner when she brings it up. You never wear my gift. Her voice is flat and serious. I laugh, thinking she's joking, but she's not. I put thought into that. You obviously don't care about what I give you. She locks herself in the bedroom. Two hours of silence. I knock on the door, she screams, just admit You don't love me. After hours of me waiting outside the bathroom, she comes out, eyes red. You really thought my gift was a joke? I wore it that night just to make her happy. The smile that spread across her face was worth the weirdness. Boy, she said, running her fingers along the leather. Something in her tone made my stomach turn. But she was happy again, affectionate again. That's all that mattered. Next day, I get home from work and she immediately freezes. Where's your collar? Like asking where my watch was. I laugh it off, thinking she's joking, but she's genuinely upset. You only wear it when I force you. That's what I mean to you. The guilt hits different when someone you love thinks you don't care. So I put it on. Comes routine walk in, collar on. Small price for peace. I thought it would only be a temporary thing that she would forget about after a few weeks. Then two weeks in, she starts saying good boy constantly. When I'd bring her coffee, when I'd agree with her, when I'd put the collar on without being asked, I mention it. Feels weird. It's just cute. She says. Don't you wanna be my good boy? The way she asks make saying no feel like saying I don't love her. Then the commands start. I'm heading to the kitchen for dinner. Sit, she says from the couch. I freeze. What? Sit here next to me. Her Tone is playful, but her eyes aren't. I sit confused. Good boy. My skin crawls. Later. I'm making my plate. Did I say you could eat yet? She's not joking. Beg for it. I laugh nervously. She doesn't. I'm serious. Beg or don't eat. I stand there, played in hand, calculating if this is the hill to die on. My. My growls. Please can I eat? She smiles. Good boy. I start documenting everything in my phone. The commands get worse. Stay when I try to leave arguments. Speak when she wants me to agree with her. Quiet when I'm winning a discussion. She uses them strategically. Always. When I'm too tired or hungry to fight back, her friends come over for wine night. I'm getting drinks from the kitchen. Look how well trained he is.

Now I'm worried he'll break up with me. So I have three guy friends I've known since college. Back then, we were all single and honestly, pretty wild. I hooked up with all of them at different times, sometimes together. It was a phase. Nothing emotional, just young and stupid. That stopped years ago when we all grew up. Two of them are now in serious relationships with two of my best friends. Everyone knows the history, and we moved past it. Or so I thought. My boyfriend Liam and I have been together a year, and it's been the best relationship of my life. We clicked instantly, and I knew within weeks this man was endgame material. The only issue is I'm his first serious girlfriend, so he gets insecure sometimes, especially knowing about my past. I've been completely honest with him about my history with these guys. I told him it meant nothing, that it's ancient history and he's all I want now. He said he understood and trusted me. I even asked my guy friends privately to never bring it up out of respect. Last Saturday, we're all hanging out at my place. It's me, Liam, my three guy friends, and my two best friends. Normal night, everyone's drinking and playing cards. Around ten PM, I head out with one of my girlfriends to grab more beer and snacks from The store. We're gone maybe 20 minutes. When I walk back in with the groceries, Liam's entire energy has shifted. He's sitting on the couch staring at his phone, won't make eye contact. The guys are laughing about something. I can tell immediately something's wrong. You okay, babe? I ask him. He forces a smile and says, yeah, I'm good. But I know him. He's not good. We stay another hour, but he barely talks. When we finally leave and get in my car, he's silent. I drive us back to my apartment, and the second we're inside, I press him. Liam, what happened? You were fine before I left. He sits on my couch and his jaw clenches. Friends wouldn't shut up about being Eskimo brothers. They kept making jokes about how I got the leftovers and asking if one guy is another you after you've had all three of them. My blood went cold. They said what? They kept saying things like welcome to the club and asking if I could satisfy you the same way they couldn't. Saying, at least now you've settled down with just one guy. I felt sick. These were supposed to be my friends. Liam, I'm so sorry. I'll talk to them. They said you told them I was insecure about your past. Is that true? My stomach dropped. I had told them a few weeks ago in confidence that Liam sometimes felt inadequate. I thought they were my friends who I could Trust I. I did mention

I'm getting married next summer. When Jason proposed, I thought it would be nice to ask his niece Avery, to be a bridesmaid. She's 15 and the only kid on either side of our families. We only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago, we drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg. Greg's wife Monica and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun, way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparkly ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed, oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine. For once, she laughed like it was a joke. But Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said it. It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up, hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things exactly like that to me at every family gathering and it crushed me every single time. I still remember hiding in the bathroom at my cousin's wedding because she kept making comments about how I looked like a boy. I didn't even think. I just reacted. Hey, Avery, I forgot to tell you something important about the wedding. Everyone looked at me. My best friend Kelsey is my maid of honor and she's wearing a suit, like a full tailored suit with pants. I told all my bridesmaids they can wear whatever they want as long as it's in our wedding color, which is dark green. Avery's head snapped up. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Hold on. I pulled out my phone and opened the folder where Kelsey had sent me outfit ideas. I scooted closer to Avery on the couch and started showing her photos. A green jumpsuit, wide leg pants with a nice blouse, blazer and trouser combo, a tuxedo jacket with tailored slacks. You can pick any of these. Or honestly, if you want to wear Jeans and a green sweater. That works, too. It's a wedding, not a runway show. I just want everyone comfortable and having fun. Avery's whole face changed. She actually smiled. You're serious? Completely serious. You could wear sneakers if you want. I don't care. The room went dead quiet. Monica.

So I started calling her after her husband's mistress. My sister in law, Courtney, has called me Jennifer for three years, even though my name is Lisa, because that's my husband David's ex girlfriend's name. And she does it on purpose to remind everyone I'm the replacement. Started at our wedding. The priest said, do you, David, take Lisa? And from the family section, Courtney shouted, don't you mean Jennifer? People laughed nervously. David told her to stop. She said it was a slip of the tongue, but winked at Jennifer's friends, who she'd invited without telling us. During our first dance, Courtney loudly told her table how David and Jennifer used to dance to the same song. It wasn't true. David had never danced to our wedding song with anyone else. But Courtney kept going, telling made up stories about David and Jennifer's perfect relationship until David's father told her to shut up. At the gift opening, every card from Courtney was addressed to David and Jennifer. When I thanked her for the blender, she said, oh, Jennifer would have loved that. She loves smoothies. I said, my name is Lisa. She said, right. Sorry. You just remind me so much of her. I look nothing like Jennifer. Short, blonde and pale. Jennifer was tall, brunette, and tan. The only thing we had in common was David and Jennifer had Cheated on him with his best friend, which is why they broke up. But Kourtney rewrote history to make Jennifer the victim. Christmas that year, Kourtney brought Jennifer to dinner. Actually brought her. Said she was alone for the holidays and needed family. David's mother was horrified, but too polite to make a scene. Courtney introduced me to Jennifer as David's new Jennifer, then laughed like it was hilarious. Jennifer looked uncomfortable and left after an hour, but the damage was done. Every family event after that, Courtney would ask if Jennifer was coming. She's practically family, she'd say. Unlike some people who just married in. Three years of this. Three years of being called Jennifer at every gathering. Three years of Kourtney tagging me as Jennifer on social media, then claiming autocorrect. Three years of her telling people she can't remember my real name because Jennifer was so memorable. David told her to stop hundreds of times. His parents told her it was disrespectful. She'd apologize, then do it again immediately. Old habits, she'd say. Jennifer was around for so long. They dated for two years. We've been married for three. Last month was Courtney's 10th anniversary party. Big, fancy event at a hotel, 200 guests. I helped planet despite everything, because David asked me to be the bigger person. Always the bigger person, never Courtney. During the slideshow of Courtney and her husband Paul's relationship, I noticed something. A woman in several old photos who wasn't Courtney pretty Brunette laughing with Paul holding his hand. I asked David's aunt who it was. Oh, that's Elizabeth, Paul's ex. They were engaged before he met Courtney. She left him for someone else, but Paul was destroyed. Interesting. Party continued and Courtney stood to give a toast. Started talking about true love, soulmates, finding the right person. Then said, I want to thank everyone for coming, especially David and Jennifer. The room went quiet. David stood up, but I

My husband Eric had always been a jokester and it's one of the things I fell in love with. But over the years, the jokes became meaner. He started calling me his old ball and chain. When his buddies were around, he pat my stomach and say, expanding again this year or tell his co workers how some people age like fine wine and how unfortunately I was aging like cheese. Laugh. But their faces would always look just as uncomfortable as mine. Then last week during my birthday dinner with his parents, Eric raised his glass and stood up to toast me to my beautiful wife, he said. And for a second my heart lifted. Then he grinned and added, my adorably ugly old lady, happy birthday. Here's to another year. Only a few more until I get to collect that life insurance policy. Everyone at the table laughed nervously. I felt my heart sink in disappointment. You know, your joke really went too far this time. I told him in the car later, actually, all of your jokes lately have been nothing but mean and I don't appreciate it. I thought back to yours as I explained how much his words hurt, how every joke chipped away at my confidence, how I didn't recognize myself anymore because I started to believe the things he said about me. He pulled up on the side of the road and stared at me for a long moment before saying, babe, are you serious being dramatic over nothing? It was just light teasing. You know me, but I've also been telling you for weeks how much I didn't like your jokes. I said quietly, well, it's not like they're lies. You are getting older and it doesn't help that you've been letting yourself go ever since we had kids. Can't you just do what most people do and let it go and one ear and out the other, he suggested. That's when I realized he'd never understand, not unless he felt it himself. The next morning, I opened up about the situation to our family and friends. His sister stayed quiet for a long time before admitting, I've been watching him do this to you for years. You deserve better and we'll help him see that. She started it off casually the next time she met with my husband. Hey, Eric, I noticed your hair has been thinning. Don't worry, bald is attractive on some people, she said. I watched Eric touch his head, forcing his smile. Then during his golf game, Eric's best friend called him his little punching bag, mentioning how hard it was constantly beating him in each match. This time, Eric got annoyed and told him to back off. His friend just grinned and patted his back. Come on, man. Learn to take a joke. Eric's mom Also made comments over dinner. Eric, Honey, are those new pants, they make you look a little frumpy. Maybe you should hit the gym more. She said it so sweetly that he couldn't argue. Even his co workers had joined him, calling him Mr Mediocre in meetings, making jokes about his boring presentations. One guy even patted his shoulder and said in that same sarcastic tone Eric always used on me, don't worry, buddy, not everyone can be a star. By the end of the week, Eric was coming home looking more defeated each day. He checked himself in the mirror constantly, justing his shirt or running his hand over his thinning hair. He stopped making jokes entirely. Then last night he came home and collapsed onto the couch next to me. He put his head in his hands and just sat there for a long moment. I don't know what's happening, he finally said. It's like everyone's turned against me. My best friend thinks I'm a punching bag. My coworkers think I'm mediocre and boring. Even my own mother thinks I terrible. His voice cracked. And my boss, the one person whose opinion actually mattered to me, called me his adorable little slacker in front of my whole team today. I've never felt so humiliated. He looked at me with genuine pain in his eyes. I feel like I'm not good enough at anything anymore. Like I'm just this pathetic, balding, frumpy guy I who peaked years ago and Everyone can see it but me. I sat there listening to him list every single insecurity that had been planted in him over the past week, the same insecurities he'd been planting in me for years, the same words, the same tone, the same crushing weight of being torn down by the people.

You super liked me. It was an accident, I repeated desperately. I was half asleep, scrolling too fast. I didn't mean to. Eloise. He sat down at his desk, pulling out his phone. I need to ask you something, and I need you to be honest. My heart was pounding so hard I was sure he could hear. When you saw my profile, before your thumb allegedly slipped, what did you think? The question caught me off guard. I. What? What did you think when you saw my profile? He was studying my face intently. Before the accident. I felt heat rising to my cheeks. I don't know what you want me to say. The truth, he said. Simply because I've been sitting here since Saturday trying to figure out what to do about the situation, and I need to know if this was really just an accident, or if maybe, possibly some part of you meant to right. Anyway, the office suddenly felt airless. That's Connor. You're my boss. I'm aware, he said, leaning back in his chair. I'm very, very aware. Which is why I've been driving myself insane all weekend. He ran his fingers through his hair, clearly frustrated at the situation I caused. When I saw your profile, I couldn't swipe right. He swallowed like it pained him. Because I'm your boss would be inappropriate. It could ruin both our careers. But you super liked me. And for About 10 seconds. I thought maybe the universe was giving me permission, until I realized it was probably an accident. He stood up and walked back to the window. Was this real? Was he saying what I thought he was saying? But I need to know, Eloise. Was any part of it real? Or was it completely an accident? I stood up too, my legs shaky. I took a leap of faith. If you weren't my boss, I said slowly, I would have super liked you on purpose. I would have swiped right immediately. But you are my boss. So, yes, it was an accident. My thumb slipped because I was nervous seeing you there, and I was holding my phone too tight. He turned to look at me, something changing in his expression. Hope. I'm leaving the company, he said suddenly. What? I got an offer from another company two weeks ago. I accepted it Friday. My last day here is March 15th. The room spun slightly. You're leaving? He nodded. Which means in three weeks, I won't be your boss anymore. The weight of what he was saying settled over the room. He wasn't my boss for much longer. So would you let me take you to dinner on March 16th? Yes, I said.

So my sister Emma is 30 and I'm 22. Ten years ago, she had a miscarriage. And yeah, it was awful for everyone. Like the whole family was devastated. And it took her a solid two years to really get through it. We never figured out exactly why it happened, but it was a one time thing. And since then, she's had three completely healthy kids, including twins. That part of her life turned out fine. But here's the actual problem. Emma and I have never gotten along. When we were kids, she straight up hated me because she had to share our mom's attention. She also convinced herself that mom left her dad to be with mine, which like wasn't even true, but she believed it anyway. She bullied me my entire childhood. I'm talking years of making my life miserable just because I existed. She never grew out of it. The worst part is how she uses the miscarriage now. Every single time mom spends time with me or does something nice for me, Emma suddenly has a breakdown about what happened 10 years ago. Mom drops everything and runs to her every time. Earlier this year, I saved up and took mom to Paris for her birthday. It was supposed to be this special trip, just the two of us. We were having an amazing time. And then halfway through, Emma called mom crying. About the miscarriage, mom literally cut the trip short and flew home. I spent the rest of the vacation alone, wandering around Paris feeling like garbage. Then there was the time I had a really bad manic episode. Like I ended up in the hospital bed. Mom kept saying she'd come visit me. And every single time she was about to leave, Emma would call with another miscarriage crisis. Mom never made it to see me once during that entire hospital stay, not one.

Dad announces at dinner that he's getting remarried to Elise, this woman he's been dating for four months. Finally, you kids will have a real mother figure while I'm traveling for work, he says, like I haven't been raising my seven year old brother Ethan since mom died three years ago. Elise moves in the next week and immediately starts rearranging our entire house. I need to establish my authority, she tells dad while moving Mom's China to the garage. First morning I try explaining our routine. Our dog biscuit needs walking at 6:30 sharp or he'll have accidents. Ethan takes his ADHD meds with apple juice at 7. Never orange juice. It makes him sick. And he naps at four PM or he'll have meltdowns all evening. At least cuts me off. I'm the adult here now, not some 16 year old playing house. I'll determine what happens and when. Your father wants me to be a mother, not follow some child's schedule. I look at dad who's checking his phone. Listen to Elise. She knows what she's doing. She raised her own kids. Where are her kids now, I ask. That's not relevant. Elise snaps, fine. Dad leaves for his two week business trip. That afternoon. Elise announces new rules. Breakfast at 9, no more cuddling that spoiled dog and Ethan's too old for naps. Real mothers don't follow ridiculous schedules made by teenagers. Day one, Elise decides biscuit can wait until 8:00am for his walk because she needs her beauty sleep. Biscuit, a 90 pound German Shepherd with a bladder condition, destroys Elise's designer luggage collection while she's in the shower. Suitcases covered in dog urine. The smell never comes out. Day two, she gives Ethan his meds with orange juice because she forgot to buy apple juice. Projectile vomits across her laptop while she's on a zoom call with her book club. The laptop's fried. She refuses to give him a nap because second graders don't need babying. By six PM, Ethan's having a full meltdown, throwing everything he can find her grandmother's base she brought over. Shattered. Day 3, she decides our backyard pet funeral tradition is morbid and throws away Ethan's dead goldfish instead of letting us bury him. Ethan calls 9 1 1, sobbing that his stepmother is destroying evidence of murder. The police show up. Elise has to explain to three officers why she threw away a goldfish named Detective Bubbles. Week 2 gets worse. She changes Ethan's pick up time without telling the school. They called the police thinking he's been kidnapped. She feeds biscuit different food because his prescription diet is overpriced. Gets explosive diarrhea all over her new white couch she bought to modernize our living room. She tries to discipline Ethan by taking away his comfort items. He locks himself in the bathroom for six hours. The fire department has to remove the door They recognize our address from the goldfish incident. Everything under control here, the firefighter asks. Elise's eye is twitching. Children need discipline, she keeps muttering. She posts in her Facebook mommy group about demon stepchildren and someone screenshots it and sends it to dad. Day 12, everything implodes. Elise decides she knows better than Ethan's therapist and skips his appointment to take him shopping for proper clothes. Ethan has a panic attack in target and knocks over an entire display of televisions. Security reviews footage of Elise dragging him through the store while he screams, you're not my mom. They call CPS while Elise is dealing with that.

I decided to name my son Leonardo to honour my late childhood best friend who passed a couple of years ago. Everyone at the shower thought it was sweet except my sister Casey who stood up and slammed her palms on the table when she heard the name. That's my baby name. You know how much I love Leonardo DiCaprio and plan to name my baby that. We tried to tell Casey she wasn't even in a relationship, much less pregnant, but she wasn't having it. She yelled that we were traitors, then packed her things and left with an announcement. See, see you all in court. Two days later, I got a letter in the mail giving me 24 hours to relinquish the name or face consequences. My family called an emergency intervention. We all sat down with Casey and Mom's living room that evening and tried gently explaining why I wouldn't be giving up a name. Casey's face was like an angry tomato. She kept interrupting to tell me how my dead friend would understand how this has been her only dream in life ever since she was a little girl. We stood our ground and after proof to her through one of my lawyer friends that she couldn't go to court over a baby name, she ended up giving us an ultimatum. The name was hers or she'd got no contact with us. We all simultaneously pointed at the door. Her eyes went when we called the bluff and in this angry, defeated tone, she said, fine, you can have the stupid name. We thought that was it because we didn't hear from her at all for the next three months. But then my Labour Day came. I was literally giving birth when Casey burst through the door holding a teddy bear and shouting, Michael is here. Our whole family, including the nurses, looked confused. My husband Samuel asked what she meant. That's when Casey beamed and rubbed her flat stomach. I'm pregnant, too. You said I couldn't have the name because I wasn't pregnant. So I went out and became pregnant. Problem solved. We stared at her like she had five heads. Security removed her while she screamed about fairness. An hour later, I was holding my son for the first time. A nurse came in looking uncomfortable. There's been an issue with your paperwork. It says here the baby's name is Michael. My husband jumped up like a hawk. He investigated while I held Leonardo and found out the hospital documents were different from what we submitted. Casey had actually tried to officially change our baby's name while I was in active labor. The hospital fixed it, but the message was Casey was determined. The next morning, while we were still recovering, my brother called. Casey's at the hospital. She's hurt really badly. Turns out Casey had woken up at 5:00am And had been filing name claims, then driving to every courthouse in the entire state trying to get someone to legally grant her the name Leonardo. She barely slept and spent all day without eating and drinking, leading to her being so tired and dehydrated that she suffered a sunstroke before collapsing on the courthouse steps. I fell straight onto her belly and started miscarrying. She was rushed to the nearest hospital where they had to IV fluids and nutrients into her. The moment she was lucid again, she called me directly from the hospital, yelling that I called her baby by forcing her to fight for what was rightfully hers. Leonardo was mine, she sobbed. How does it feel to know an innocent baby is dead because of you? I hung up without responding. Three weeks later, I was breastfeeding when Samuel's phone rang. It was Child Protective Services. Some one had reported us for child abuse and neglect. The case worker rattled off allegations that made my blood run cold. Samuel was apparently violent towards the baby. His juvenile record from a bar fight when he was 17 was cited. My dad, who lived with us, was also mentioned as a threat. His old teaching scandal where a student accused him of inappropriate behaviour before admitting she lied was also cited. They even mentioned the house being unsafe for a Newborn. While we were still reeling from the call, my neighbour texted me screenshots from our local Facebook Casey had written this long post about making the brave decision to report abuse she'd witnessed going on in our home, painting herself as a hero saving a baby from danger. Twenty minutes later, I let the workers thinking seeing our clean house would end this nightmare. The case worker checked the nursery, the baby supplies, Leonardo sleeping peacefully. But then she saw my dad in the kitchen is the.

Then his friend called me hot. I spent a year getting stronger and training for a Marathon. I'd lost 60 pounds in the process. My boyfriend never once acknowledged it. When I mentioned hitting a new personal record at the gym, he said no one really cares about your weight loss except you. I stopped bringing it up after that. Then we went to his friend's birthday party and everything changed. I started running in January because my doctor said I needed to get my blood pressure down. My boyfriend said running was boring and he didn't understand why I'd want to embarrass myself huffing and puffing around the neighborhood where people could see me. By March, I was running 3 miles without stopping and I told him about it over dinner. He was scrolling through his phone and said, that's cool. You're still not fast, though, without looking up. I joined a gym in April and started lifting weights. My boyfriend started making comments every time I left again, you know, you're just going to end up looking bulky and gross, right? My co workers kept telling me I looked amazing. My best friend said I was glowing. My boyfriend looked me up and down one night and said, you look the same to me. Actually, you're getting kind of veiny in your arms. That's not attractive. I signed up for a 5K in July and finished in under 30 minutes. My boyfriend was playing video games when I got home and said, did you win? I said, no, there were hundreds of people running. He said, then why does it matter? I started training for longer distances every Sunday. My boyfriend got nasty about it. You're seriously going to waste another entire day sweating like a pig. One morning I couldn't find my running shoes and found them later in the back of his closet covered in dirt. He said I must have put them there and forgot. He kept saying things that cut deeper. You're obsessed and it's honestly pathetic. Your legs are getting too muscular. It's disgusting. You know, this whole fitness thing is just because you're insecure, right? I registered for a Marathon in November. My boyfriend looked at me like I was insane. A Marathon, you're not a real runner. You're going to embarrass yourself. I ran the Marathon and finished in four hours and 12 minutes. My boyfriend refused to come watch. He said, why would I stand around for four hours watching you struggle to do something you're not even good at? My best friend came instead and cried when I crossed the finish line. When I got home with my medal, he barely glanced at it and said, so that's done. Thank god. Maybe now you'll go back to being normal. Two weeks late.

After we got through all 67 mistakes, which took about four hours, because some punishments made me pass out, my mom brought out a birthday candle stuck in a piece of stale bread. This is your cake, because children who make mistakes don't deserve real cake. We're good parents, so we still give you a candle. They made me blow it out, but told me my wish was already decided for me. Your wish is to be worth something this year at school, Lucia came up to me at recess and said her birthday party was on Saturday and she really wanted me to come. My parents don't let me go to birthday parties. I, I told her, my mom already talked to your Mom at pickup yesterday and she said you could. When I got home, my mom confirmed it was true because they were going out that night and did not want to hire a babysitter. You will be there from 4 to 8 and not one minute longer. If I hear you did anything wrong or embarrassing, the consequences will be severe, she said while squeezing my arm. We will know if you mess up because parents always talk to each other about their kids. I spent the whole week nervous about what could go wrong and practicing how to act normal, even though I did not really know what normal meant. When I walked into Lucia's house on Saturday, music was playing, kids were laughing and nobody looked scared of anything. Made it, Lucia's mom said and gave me a hug, which was strange because adults in my house only touched kids when they were punishing them. Lucia is so excited you're here. Her dad was wearing this ridiculous cone shaped party hat and was helping kids make their own hats at the table when one kid accidentally squeezed too much glitter and it went everywhere. He just said glitter explosion and helped clean it up without punishing anyone. Then we played this game where you had to pass a present around while music played and when it stopped, you got to unwrap one layer. This kid accidentally ripped through three layers at once and Lucia's mom just laughed and Said he was really strong. When it was time for cake, Lucia's dad came out carrying this huge chocolate cake with 11 candles and started singing. Everybody joined in and Lucia.

No nut. November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the gay jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed. And there's no paper on his desk. It. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me. Not a glance. Full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze. Like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me. And the angle. When he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes, maybe less. His face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to someone to help, but the teacher, Mister Evans, notices Instantly. Phone on my desk. Now. Mister Evans has a radar for phones, I swear. You know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk. Locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes. That same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's assigned seating only. Go back to your seat, sir. I just need to. You need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack. His smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathless and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to.

So buckle up, because this isn't one of those he fired me and I found a better job karma law posts. No, this is a scorched earth, burn the bridge, salt the ashes situation. I worked at this small tech company for 3 years. I busted my ass. I pulled 70 hour weeks. I trained his nephew. I basically ran the whole damn department while this loud, balding, overcaffeinated micromanager sat in his glass office pretending to be Steve Jobs. Last month, I walked in on a Monday morning and found an HR email waiting for me. Not a meeting, not a warning. An email. We regret to inform you that due to restructuring, your position has been terminated, effective immediately. Restructuring my ass. The next day, I found out his nephew, the same one who asked me how to attach a PDF, got my job and a pay raise. So I snapped. And when I snap, I don't break plates. I break lives. I knew three things. One, his wife Samantha, hated him. Two, his son Tyler, 22, was in my DMs months ago. Oh. His daughter Mia, 25, once told me at a company barbecue that she likes people who take risks. Do you see where this is going? I started with Samantha. I took her out for drinks to vent. One thing LED to another, and let's just say she vented in ways her husband Hadn't experienced in years then because apparently I fully unlocked my villain arc. I replied to Tyler's old DM. Still wanna grab that drink? Tyler came over. We grabbed more than drinks. I'll spare you the details, but let's just say his Xbox wasn't the only thing overheating that night. And then Mia. God bless Mia. She's gorgeous, she's chaotic, and apparently she had a vendetta against her dad too. Within 48 hours, I had an entire side quest going with his entire family tree. Here's where it gets truly evil. I knew my ex boss had a ring camera system. Guess who accidentally left their Bluetooth speaker connected to their living room TV? Yeah, he saw everything live in 4K. Next Monday he tried to confront me in the parking lot of a Starbucks. I just smiled, sipped my caramel macchiato, and said, should have attached the termination letter as a PDF. Boss. The man's face turned the color of a sunburnt tomato. Do I regret it? Absolutely not. Do I have a job now? Also no. But you know what I do have? Peace, satisfaction, and at least three birthday invites to family barbecues he will never attend again. And that, my friends, is how you turn a layoff into a legacy.

What did I do now? I looked up, confused. Have you checked your phone this morning, Miss O'connor asked. Carefully. I reached for it but remembered it had died on the bus. It's dead. Why? The entire classroom went silent. Miss O'connor shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. Please just go to the office. My heart started racing because something was seriously wrong. Whatever this was, it had made my teacher look at me like I was made of glass about to break. I grabbed my dead phone and my backpack and headed for the door. I needed to find my best friend, Justin. Justin's classroom was down the hall. I knocked and pointed at him through the window. Mister Brady let him out immediately without asking questions. The second we got into the hallway, Justin grabbed me in the tightest hug. Dude, oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry about Dylan. Dylan, my brother's name. And hit me like ice water. Dylan, who was 24 and still lived at home. What about Dylan? My voice sounded far away. Justin pulled back, his eyes red. You don't know, dude. Everyone saw it on the way to school this morning, the accident on Route 47. Your brother's green Jeep. He paused, swallowing hard. Dylan loved that Jeep more than anything. I was already running. Mom was at the Office, signing me out with shaking hands. The secretary couldn't meet my eyes. Mom just grabbed my arm and guided me toward the parking lot. Her face was pale and her lips were pressed into a thin line. Mom, is Dylan okay? She just unlocked the car and got in. I got in. My heart pounding. Your dad is on his way home from his work trip, she finally said, her voice barely above a whisper. We're waiting for a call. But Dylan, she cut me off before I could finish. When we get home, we'll talk when we get home. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the tremor underneath. The drive felt like hours. Mom's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. I kept trying to make sense of it. The Jeep, the accident. Dylan. Mom stayed in the car. On the phone. I used my key. The house was quiet, too quiet. Then I heard it. Sports center. I walked into the living room and there he was, Dylan on the couch in boxers and that stupid Metallica shirt with holes in it, eating cereal straight from the box. Very much alive. What the hell, I said. He looked up, annoyed. Shouldn't you be at school? You're dead. The words came out flat. Everyone think.

We've been living together for, like, seven months now, and honestly, she's awesome. When we first moved in, she told me about some really heavy stuff from her past. She went through a lot as a kid, like abuse and worse. My own sister actually went through something similar, and she died from it. So when my roommate opened up to me, I got it. I really got it. Living with her is honestly the easiest thing ever. She does the dishes without me asking. She even does my laundry and folds it, which I keep telling her she doesn't have to do, but she says it makes her happy to help out. And she always looks genuinely excited when I come home and find everything clean. The only weird thing is our apartment looks like a unicorn threw up everywhere. Purple and pink stuff on every surface. But whatever. Small price to pay for an amazing roommate. The thing about my roommate is she has this massive teddy bear. And I mean massive. This thing is bigger than she is. She named it Eva after her mom, who passed away. Her parents gave it to her when she was nine, and it's basically her most important possession. It sits on her bed, and sometimes when I walk past her room, I can see her hugging it while she watches TV. So last week, my sister calls Me up. She's seven months pregnant and crying on the phone, saying she needs a place to crash. Her boyfriend kicked her out or something. I didn't get all the details. I told her I needed to check with my roommate first, because that's just basic respect, right? My roommate said it was fine. She's really nice like that. My sister shows up with two suitcases, and the first thing she does when she walks in is look at Eva sitting on my roommate's bed and just starts laughing, like, full on cackling. She goes, what is that thing? And I immediately told her to knock it off. Then she sees my roommate come out of her room wearing this pink dress with bows on it, and my sister makes this face. My sister's always been a tomboy. Like, she lives in basketball shorts and hoodies. So she starts making comments about my roommate's clothes. Stuff like, you look like you're going to a kid's birthday party, and does the Easter Bunny know you stole his outfit? I shut that down pretty quick, but my sister just rolled her eyes at me. The next few days were rough. My sister kept making little comments. He'd walk past my roommate's room and go, still sleeping with stuffed animals, huh? Loud enough for everyone to hear. When my roommate would do the dishes, my sister would be like, you don't have to be a housewife, you know? In this condescending voice. And The teddy bear thing really bothered her for some reason. She kept bringing up how my roommate named it Eva and saying stuff like, it's a toy. It doesn't need a name. You're 20 years old. I told my sister multiple times to stop. I explained that my roommate had her reasons and to just be respectful. My sister would say okay, but then do it again the next day. On day five, I came home from class, and my roommate wasn't in the living room like usual. I figured she was in her room, so I went to put my backpack down. That's when I heard it crying. Like, not just crying, full on sobbing coming from my roommate's room. I knocked and asked if I could come in, and she said yes, but her voice was all shaky. I opened the door, and she was sitting on her bed holding Eva. Except Eva wasn't whole anymore. There was this huge cut right down the middle of the bear's stomach. Stuffing was coming out everywhere. My roommate's face was red and covered in tears, and she could barely get the words out. She kept saying, she cut Eva. She cut Eva over and over. I asked her what happened, and she said my sister came in her room while she was in the shower and must have done it. I looked at the cut, and it was clean, like, done with Scissors or a knife. This wasn't an accident. I walked straight to the living room where my sister was on the couch eating chips and watching TV. I asked her if she cut my roommate's teddy bear and she literally started laughing. She said she's 20, she shouldn't be sleeping with toys anyway. I told her that was completely out of line and she needed to pack her stuff and leave. That's when she switched up real quick. She put her hand on her stomach and was like, I'm pregnant. You can't kick me out. It's just pregnancy hormones making me act crazy. I said I didn't care about hormones. She destroyed something that meant everything to my roommate, and she didn't even apologize. She started getting loud, saying I was choosing some random girl over my own sister and her baby. I told her she made the choice. When she decided to be cruel for no reason, she grabbed her suitcases and left, slamming the door so hard a picture frame fell off the wall.

He smeared it right across her forehead. Next came a bowl of holy water, shoved it right in her face. When he saw her resisting, the giant totally lost it. Realizing she had no choice, the girl finally drank it down. But here's the twist. Within seconds, her terrible wounds completely healed. This whole time the giant meant no harm. Seeing grey was okay, the giant just turned and walked away. Stranded in the wilderness, grey found this broken down shack. Soon her brother, C y R y L tracked her down, an unexpected family reunion. But before they could even celebrate, the black witch hunting them showed up. Gray grabbed a metal pipe and hurled it, but the witch batted it away like nothing. With one casual hand gesture, she magically sealed every exit and she dropped the bombshell. Turns out the sibling's mother was once an incredibly powerful white witch. Years ago, framed by the Black Witches, she was burned alive by villagers. Even their father was hanged by the mind controlled townspeople. Now get this, if she obtained Gray's heart, she'd become the most powerful black witch ever. To protect his sister, C y R y L attacked first, but the Black Witch stabbed him, shoved him into the basement and took gray by force. When C W R y L woke up, Mina, the girl he'd saved earlier, was standing over him. Even More shocking, stab wound had completely vanished. Turns out Mina was actually the last surviving White Witch in the world. For years, she'd been secretly protecting them. To rescue Greyfast, C, y, L broke out his entire weapons collection. Mina sprinkled magic infused potions over all the equipment. The moment they were ready, the team stormed straight toward the Black Witch's lair.

Big party. He'd never ask. I stared at that message for two days. Finally booked a last minute flight. Didn't tell anyone. I wanted it to be a surprise for him. The country club was packed. Firefighters, neighbors, strangers. I stayed near the back. My dad sat at the front table, laughing. He looked older, happier. Next to him sat a woman I didn't recognize. Blonde hair, diamond necklace, her hand on his arm. She looked like an Aliexpress Karen. One of those women you look at and already know their entire personality. My aunt appeared. You made it then quieter. That's Diane, his wife. They married last year. She's intense. My stomach dropped. Wife? He didn't tell me he got remarried. After mom, speeches started. Everyone talking about my dad's bravery, his loyalty. Every word reminded me we used to be close. Halfway through, I noticed Diane staring. Not casual glancing. Full on staring at me. Acting cold and tying to be alpha or something. Every time I looked up, she was still watching, whispering to the woman next to her. My aunt leaned over. Ignore her. She gets territorial. After a while, the speeches ended and I worked up some courage and approached the front table. I walked up and tapped my dad's shoulder.

That investigation starts Monday. His father still doesn't know about the lavender. I'm saving that revelation for court. See, attempted poisoning is assault. With my medical records showing severe allergic reaction, the photos and his history of escalating violence, my lawyer says I'll get everything, the house, alimony, and a restraining order against stepson. They think I'm weak because I took the abuse quietly. But I'm not weak. I was planning tomorrow. When the school calls about the drug investigation, when his PlayStation account stays banned, when his college dreams crumble, when his shoes fall apart at the championship game, when his father gets served divorce papers citing attempted assault with a known allergen, then they'll understand that the sensitive home wrecker they mocked was actually documenting everything, building a case, destroying them legally. While they laughed at their own cruelty, the lavender is still on his desk. He looks at it and smirks every morning thinking he won. He has no idea that little pile of dried flowers is about to cost him everything. Update coming after Monday's investigation.

Diane was right there before I could react. She won to Mike Tyson. Punched me full force, right to the jaw. The sound echoed through the entire ballroom. My entire face exploded in pain. My eyes watered instantly. Two hundred people gasped. Diane pointed at me, screaming, who the hell do you think you are? You don't get to just show up and touch my husband! Diane! My dad's voice was ice. Oh, this random girl walks in, puts her hands all over you, and I'm supposed to smile? She's probably some stalker. Who? That's my daughter. My dad's voice cut through the room like a gunshot. Diane froze. Um, your what? My daughter Marley, who you just assaulted in front of 200 witnesses. Her face went pale. I didn't know you. Never. I showed you pictures multiple times. I even told you she might be coming today. His voice shook with rage. You were too busy being jealous of every woman near me to pay attention. The room went dead silent. Diane reached for him. Daniel, please. I was protecting you. You hit my daughter. Each word landed like a hammer. Get out. Pack your things. I want you gone by tomorrow. Her face crumpled. We're married. We took vows, and you just broke them. Leave now. She looked around desperately, at the firefighters, at her friends. No one moved to defend her. She grabbed her purse. You'll regret this. My dad pulled me close. I've been Lonely with you. At least now I'll have my daughter back. He left, heels clicking furiously. The door slammed. My dad turned to me. Are you okay, baby? I'm so sorry. I had no idea she. His voice broke. I hugged him hard. You chose me. That's all that matters. Dad. We spent the rest of the night at his table, just talking. Making up for four years. It's been, like, four months since that retirement part. And although getting punched in the jaw hurt like hell, getting my dad back in my life is well worth it.

Watch me say no and make him cry. I froze outside our apartment door, grocery bags in hand, my heart shattered. We been together four years. I had the ring in my jacket pocket. I walked in like nothing happened. Sophie was laughing on Facetime with her college friend Samantha. Babe, you're home early, she said, quickly hanging up. That night I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. I kept replaying her words. The plan was to propose at her parents house during Sunday dinner. Her whole family would be there. Saturday was torture. Sophie kept asking if I was okay, touching my arm, try and to figure out why I was distant. I wanted to scream at her. I wanted to ask why. Why would someone spend four years with me just to humiliate me in front of the people who mattered most? I barely slept that night either. I kept staring at the ring box on my nightstand thinking about how excited I'd been when I bought it three months ago. I'd saved for eight months, asked her dad for permission like an idiot. He'd hugged me and said, welcome to the family, son. What a joke. Sunday came. I was numb. We drove to her parents place and she kept chattering about random things. Completely normal. She talked about her co workers drama, about wanting to repaint the bathroom, about her mom's new recipe she was excited to try Every word felt like a knife. How could she act so normal knowing what she was about to do? I gripped this steering wheel so hard, my knuckles turned white. Part of me wanted to turn the car around. Another part wanted to confront her right there. But I kept driving. Maybe I needed to see it did. Proof that the woman I loved could be that cruel. When we pulled into her parents driveway, she squeezed my hand. You seem stressed lately. Everything okay? I nearly laughed. Yeah, everything's fine. Dinner was perfect. Her mom made my favorite pot roast. I pushed food around my plate, forcing down a few bites so no one would ask questions. Sophie's dad talked about his golf game. Her sister showed us photos of her new puppy, Sophie.

So I erupted, and the twins backed me up. I met my wife Sarah, through her identical twin Elsa, at a charity fundraiser six years ago. Elsa and I were volunteering at the registration table and spent the whole night laughing. When she found out I was a photographer, she said, you need to meet my sister. She's obsessed with photography. Sarah showed up an hour later with a vintage Nikon around her neck. We talked until they kicked us out at midnight. Elsa just grinned the whole time, clearly proud of playing matchmaker. Three years later, Sarah and I got married. Elsa was the maid of honor. Everything was perfect until the reception. That's when it started. Sarah's dad grabbed the microphone during toasts, and halfway through, he pointed at Elsa and said, you could switch places on the honeymoon and he'd never figure it out. The room went silent. Then someone laughed nervously. I felt my face get hot. Sarah's smile disappeared. Her hand found mine under the table and squeezed so tight my fingers went numb. I thought maybe it was just the champagne talking. It wasn't. At Thanksgiving, Sarah's mom cornered Elsa in the kitchen while I was getting drinks. You should go upstairs to their guest room tonight, she said, loud enough for me to hear. Let's test if he can tell the difference. His face went pale. Mom, that's not funny. Her mom just laughed and walked away. Every holiday after that, same thing. Christmas dinner, her dad suggested Elsa and Sarah should swap clothes and see how long it took me to notice. Easter brunch, her mom said, how do you even know you married the right one? At Sarah's birthday party, her brother said Elsa should answer the door when he gets home from work. I bet he'd kiss her before realizing. I started making excuses to skip family events. Sarah noticed. Just ignore them, she'd say. But it wasn't harmless. It made me feel sick, like my marriage was some kind of joke to them. Elsa hated it, too. She pulled me aside at a barbecue and apologized. I've told them to stop. They won't listen. Her fiance, Marcus was there, and even he looked uncomfortable. The breaking point came last Christmas. We been married four years. I was helping Sarah's mom bring out dessert when she said casually, you know, Elsa met you first. She should have kept you for herself. You two have better chemistry. I stopped cutting the pie. What? Well, Sarah's so serious. Elsa's more fun. You're a fun guy. It would have made more sense. Later that night, we were all in the den. Sarah and I were on the love seat. Elsa and Marcus were on the couch. Her parents were in their armchairs, working on their third round of eggnog. That's when her Mom said it. Elsa, why don't you sneak into their room tonight? She giggled. I bet he won't even notice. I stood up. My hands were shaking. Stop. The room went dead quiet. Her mom blinked at me. What? Stop right now. I'm done with this. She waved her hand. Oh, honey, it's just a joke. Don't be so sensitive. A joke? My voice was louder than I meant it to be. You've been suggesting your daughter sexually deceive me for four years. You've been implying I'm too stupid to recognize my own wife. You've been disrespecting our marriage since day one. How is any of that a joke? Her dad sat forward. Now hold on. No, Elsa stood up next to me. He's right. It's disgusting. I've begged you to stop a hundred times. We all have. Sarah stood too, her jaw tight. We've told you this makes us uncomfortable, all three of us, multiple times. And keep doing it because you think it's hilarious. Her mom's face flushed red. We're just joking about how close you all are. Stop calling me interchangeable with Elsa. I interrupted. I married Sarah. I chose Sarah. I know Sarah. And if you can't respect that, we're not coming back. Marcus spoke up quietly. It's made me uncomfortable, too. Every single time. Her mom stood up, angry. Now you're all overreacting. You're saying I can't tell my wife apart from another woman? I said, you're saying

Until my old friend visited and she broke her silence in seven minutes. It started with a slammed door after dinner last Tuesday. No explanation, no argument. Just cold silence that hung like poison. Every good morning met with turned shoulder. Every question answered with footsteps walking away. I checked her social media, called her friends, even her mother. Everyone said, she seems fine to us. That's when I realized this wasn't about communication. It was about control. Three years of marriage, and I was expected to decode what offense I committed. By day three, I stopped trying. Cooked my own meals, slept in the guest room. Lived as if alone. Day five, I caught her watching me from the kitchen. Our eyes met. She looked away instantly. But not before I saw satisfaction. She was enjoying this power play. That night, scrolling through contacts, I saw a name. Alexandra. We dated in college. She reached out weeks ago. Passing through town. Drinks for old times? I declined, too concerned about upsetting the peace. My wife met her once at a reunion and hated her immediately. Stay away from that woman. But now, six days into silent treatment, something shifted. I typed, still in town? I'd love to catch up tomorrow night. The moment I hit send, I felt control again. Thought you'd never ask the craftsman at 8. Day 7, I woke up liberated. Best Cologne. Throughout the day, Alexandra and I Texted, reminiscing, flirting. Enough to walk that dangerous line. When I got home, my wife was cooking dinner for herself. I walked past to change. She paused outside the bedroom, watching. My phone chimed Alexandra's selfie from the bar. Red dress, confident smile. Can't wait to see you. I left the phone unlocked where my wife could see it. She stood in the doorway, arms crossed. Still not a word. Don't wait up, I said casually. Three drinks in. My phone buzzed repeatedly. Five messages. First communication in a week. Where are you? Who are you with? I need you to pick up milk. Break the silence. Not with apology, but with a demand. I did respond. Everything okay? Alexandra asked. Better than okay. Time we take this somewhere else. Your place? Exactly. When we walked through the front door, my wife was in the hallway. The shock on her face, seeing Alexandra was almost comical. Eyes wide, frozen. Look who I ran into, I said, helping Alexandra out of her coat. The clock ticked. One minute. Two. Three. Alexandra smiled. Your home is beautiful. I moved to the kitchen, pulled out wine glasses. Red or white? Red, please. Six minutes, 43 seconds. Then eruption. What is she doing in our house? Found your voice quickly. Amazing what seven days does. You brought her here? I thought you weren't speaking to me. Thought I'd become invisible. You know exactly what you're doing. For seven days, I've had no idea what I supposedly did wrong. Seven days of punishment for a crime I wasn't informed of. You did this deliberately to hurt me. Hurt you? That's rich. How does it feel getting a taste of your own medicine? Alexandra set her glass down. I should head out. She turned to me. Thanks for tonight. At the doorway, she embraced me, whispering loud enough for my wife to hear. Call me tomorrow. This was fun. My wife exploded. How could you disrespect me this? Respect you? Coming from someone treating me like I don't exist? You were on your phone during my parents visit. You barely engaged. So that was it? I checked work emails. During her parents six hour visit. Instead of telling me you were upset, you punished me with a week of silent just manipulation. It's not. Yes, it is. Bringing Alexandra here was me showing you exactly how your silence feels. So you're going to see her?

Anyway, my teacher sent me to the principal's office. I told him what happened and he laughed, too. Then he told me not to do it again. The next day in class, my teacher asked me what my favorite live animal was. I told her it was chicken. She asked me why. So I told her it was because you could make them into fried chicken. She sent me back to the principal's office. He laughed and told me not to do it again. I don't understand. My parents taught me to be honest, but my teacher doesn't like it when I am today. My teacher asked us to tell her what famous person we admire most. I told her Colonel Sanders. Guess where I am now?

What do you mean black spots? She held out a hand mirror so I could see. It looks like patches of mold growing across my shoulder blades and down my spine. Dark splotches like bruises that had gone wrong. Have you noticed these before, she asked. No, I haven't. The only thing I've felt is being uncomfortable sleeping at night, like something's irritating my skin. You need to find out what's causing this. It looks like it could be a reaction to something. I went home and showed my boyfriend, Alan. He looked concerned and immediately started checking our bedroom. Maybe it's bugs or something biting you at night, he said. We set up mouse traps around the bed thinking maybe mice were crawling on me while I slept. But the next morning, the traps were empty and the spots were darker. The swelling on my skin was getting worse every day, red and inflamed around the black patches. It wasn't mice or bugs. Alan suggested we check for mold in the walls. We spent the entire weekend tearing open dry wall and pulling up floorboards. He was so helpful and worried about me. But there was no mold anywhere. The house was clean. I made an appointment with my doctor who referred me to a dermatologist. She took samples and said it looked like post inflammatory hyperpigmentation but couldn't figure out the cause. What products do you use on your back, she asked. Nothing. I can't even reach most of it. Does your boyfriend apply anything, lotions or medications? No, he's never touched my back except to look at the spot.

We dated for seven years, met in junior year of high school through his best friend. He was 280 pounds, 5 7 with acne and a dorky smile that made my heart melt. Everyone told me I could do better. My friends literally staged an intervention. But here's what they didn't see. He wrote me handwritten letters every anniversary, six pages front and back. He noticed when I changed my lipstick shade, remembered my coffee order from three months ago, made me feel like the only person who mattered in the entire world. He got bullied constantly. I found him crying in his car twice. Kids called him the blob in the hallways. He told me once that I was the only good thing in his life. I told him I loved every part of him and wouldn't change a single thing. He sobbed for an hour that day. Three years ago, we made a New Year's resolution together, gym membership, meal prep, the whole thing. We cleared out our pantries on January 2nd, threw away $200 worth of junk food, bought a 500 dollar blender. We were doing this together, getting healthy as a team. The first six months we went to the gym at 6:00am every morning. We were each other's accountability partners. When one of us want had to quit, the other pushed us forward. We took progress photos every two weeks. I was so proud of us. Then he started Seeing results, real results. By month eight, he dropped 60 pounds. By month 12, 95 pounds. By 18 months, he'd lost 130 pounds total. He had ABS, actual visible ABS, pecs, arms that look like they belonged on a fitness model. I couldn't have been prouder. I bragged about him to.

Now she won't show any emotion around me. My wife cries at everything, sad, commercials, books, even telling happy stories. It embarrasses me when she tears up over nothing in front of friends. Three months ago, I finally snapped. She was telling a story to our friends, exaggerating details like always. I called her out for lying. She said it was comedic effect. Everyone embellishes for humor. After everyone left, I brought it up again. When I raised my voice, she started crying. You're being manipulative, I told her. Every time I critique you, you cry to make me stop. Remember when I said your cooking was disgusting? You cried instead of listening. I'm sick of your manipulative tears. I threatened to hit her if she didn't stop. Heat of the moment. My mom did the same to my dad, manipulated him with tears. When I raised my hand to gesture, she flinched. I assured her it was an empty threat. She locked herself in our room for hours and apologized for being manipulative, said it wouldn't happen again. Problem solved, right? Wrong. She's become a ghost. She won't watch movies with sad parts, doesn't tell stories anymore. Friends exclude me now because she, it's not fun when you're there. Stopped reading in the living room, watching emotional TV shows. Won't even talk to her mom if I'm in the room. I haven't seen her cry once in three months. Someone who Cried daily. I don't want to manipulate you anymore, she said, when I brought it up. Your everyday crying wasn't manipulative, so it's only manipulative when you're mad at me. She's right. I only called it manipulative when her emotions inconvenienced me, when her crying made me feel guilt.

She laughed and told her boyfriend some people are just territorial about kitchenware. I didn't argue. I just quietly replaced every single item she'd been borrowing without asking. I've been working from home for six months and honestly, I thought having a roommate would be fine. Vanessa seemed cool when she moved in. Graphic designer, late 20s. She valued personal space and keeping things clean. For the first month, everything was perfect. Then I started noticing my expensive cast iron skillet kept appearing in the sink, caked with burnt food and sitting in water. I'd spent two years seasoning that pan, building up the perfect nonstick surface. My grandmother taught me how to care for cast iron properly. You never soak it. You definitely never leave it sitting in water overnight. But Vanessa would cook these elaborate meals, use my pan, then just dump it in the sink and go to bed. The coating was getting destroyed. I asked her nicely the first time, hey, could you use the regular pans instead? Cast iron needs special care. She barely looked up from her phone. It's just, Mister pan, you're being dramatic. I tried explaining how cast iron works, how water ruins the seasoning, but she cut me off. I'll be more careful. She wasn't. Two days later, same thing, pan in the sink, soaking. I asked again, a little firmer this time. She Sighed like I was the most exhausting person on the planet that night. I heard her on Facetime in her room. The walls are thin. She was laughing, telling her boyfriend about how I'd confronted her over a pan. She literally gave me a lecture about cookware. Some people are just weirdly possessive about kitchen stuff. It's exhausting living with someone so uptight. Her boyfriend's voice came through the speaker. Sounds like a nightmare, babe. You should find a new place. They both laughed. I sat on my bed staring at the ceiling, feeling embarrassed and angry. That's when I started paying attention to what else she'd been using. It was like a switch flipped and suddenly I saw it everywhere. My hair dryer was sitting on her bathroom counter. I've been looking for that for weeks thinking I'd misplaced it. My nice towels, the thick, expensive ones, were folded in her closet. I noticed my towels disappearing but assumed they were in the wash. My streaming passwords were logged into her laptop. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, all on my accounts. She'd been wearing my leather jacket to work. I'd seen her in it twice but thought maybe I was mistaken. It looked exactly like mine because it was mine. Even my phone charger was permanently plugged in by her bed. My good one, the fast charging brick I paid 30 bucks for. She never asked, not once. Just assumed everything in the apartment was communal property. My stuff became Our stuff without any conversation. So I made a plan on my.

The numbers told a story he didn't want anyone to see. I'm 29. Worked as dad's assistant bookkeeper for four years at his mid sized construction firm. My older brother Troy ran project management. Got paid triple what I made. And dad always called him the future of this business. I just filed paperwork and stayed quiet until I noticed the pattern. Troy's projects consistently ran 40% over budget. Materials would disappear, subcontractors got paid twice for the same work. At first I thought it was sloppy record keeping. Construction's chaotic, right? But then I saw the same supplier names appearing on different projects with identical invoice numbers. That's when I started documenting everything. Duplicate invoices, Phantom supply orders, payments to companies that didn't exist. When I googled them, Troy was skimming at least $180,000 annually, maybe more. The deeper I dug, the worse it got. He'd create fake change orders, inflate material costs, and pocket the difference. Sometimes he'd build clients for premium materials, but use cheap alternatives. The evidence was everywhere. Once I knew what to look for, I spent my evenings building a comprehensive file. Screenshots, spreadsheets, bank records showing where payments actually went. Some of the shell companies traced back to Troy's wife's Maiden name. It was brazen, like he knew nobody would ever check his work. I brought it to dad privately on a Tuesday morning. Walked into his office with A binder two inches thick showed him spreadsheets, bank statements, the works. Laid out the entire scheme, page by page. He barely looked at them before waving his hand dismissively. Troy's under stress. These things happen in construction. Don't make problems where there aren't any. I tried explaining that this wasn't stress. It was systematic fraud. Dad cut me off. Your brother's bringing in the big contracts. So what if the paperwork gets messy? That's why I hired you, to clean it up. Clean it up? Like I was supposed to help cover for that. Two days later, Troy cornered me in the office kitchen. His face was red, and he stood way too close. Dad says you're accusing me of theft. You trying to get my job? His voice was loud enough that people in nearby cubicles went silent. I didn't respond. Just grab my coffee and walk back to my desk. But I felt everyone's eyes on me. By lunch, the whole office was with spring. Troy spent the afternoon in Dad's office with the door closed. I knew what was coming. That Friday, Dad called a staff meeting in the conference room. Everyone crammed in, looking confused. Dad stood at the head of the table, Troy beside him with his arms crossed. We're restructuring to cut costs, dad announced. Some positions are redundant, effective immediately. We're eliminating the assistant. Keep a role. He didn't even look at me when he said it. Troy stood behind him, grinning. That same smug smile he'd had since we were kids whenever he got away with something. A few co workers glanced at me sympathetically, but nobody said anything. I cleaned out my desk without arguing. Four years of work fit into one cardboard box. Took copies of everything I found, though. Had it all backed up on three USB drives and printed in duplicate. Dad walked past my desk while I was packing. Didn't say a word. Troy made a point of laughing loudly with some project managers near the elevator. Spent the weekend drafting a detailed report. Made it professional, thorough, impossible to ignore. Organized it chronologically.

She stared at the screen for a long time, then looked at me and said, he's been torturing you on purpose for three months. You need to make him feel exactly what he's done to you. We planned everything over the next week. I built up a freezer stash of pumped milk and created a schedule for Ivy. That was times 50

We're moving in today. I told them I owned the place. They showed me their lease and called their landlord. I'm the kind of person who keeps every receipt, every piece of paper that proves something belongs to me. I bought my condo 5 years ago, two bedrooms, third floor, nothing fancy, but it was mine. I saved for 3 years, find the papers, got the deed with my name on it. I kept everything in a folder in my desk. The deed, every mortgage payment, all the emails. I thought having all that documentation meant I was protected. I was wrong. I came back from the store and found a family standing outside my door with suitcases and moving boxes. A woman smiled at me. Hi, we're the new tenants. We're moving in today. There's been a mistake. I own this apartment. Her husband stepped toward me. We paid $10,000. We have a lease. You need to leave right now. I pulled out my phone and showed them a photo of my deed. The woman called someone on speaker. A man's voice came through. That man is a con artist. He been squatting there for months. Call the police if he doesn't leave. I bought this place five years ago. I have the deed right here. The man on the phone cut me off. Don't believe a word he says. He tricks people. With fake documents. Get him out of there. The woman started crying. We gave him everything we had, our daughter's college fund. The husband looked at me like I destroyed his life. Get out. We paid for this. I locked myself in my apartment. I could hear them pounding on the door. The next morning, someone knocked. Property manager was standing there. He looked at me with this cold smile. You need to sign this eviction notice. He shoved papers in my face. This is my apartment. I own this place. Police are on their way. You have 10 minutes to get out. Then he turned and saw the family still in the hallway. They've been there all night waiting. You folks can't stay in the hallway. The husband said. You told us we could move in yesterday. We gave up our old apartment. We have nowhere to go. The property manager shrugged. Not my problem. The previous tenant won't leave. Come back when it's vacant. Woman started crying harder. But you have our money, all of it. We need somewhere to sleep. He walked away. I'll call you when it's ready. I watched them pick up their suitcases and leave. They had nothing because of him the next day.

My mom has been taking shots at me my entire life. When I was in high school, she'd comment on my weight every single time I ate anything. If I joined a club, she'd ask why I didn't pick something more impressive. When I got into college, she told everyone it was probably because of affirmative action, not because I actually earned it. I moved out three years ago and finally got my own apartment. It's small, but it's mine. I've been learning how to cook real food instead of just eating ramen and frozen pizza. I've been watching cooking videos online and practicing recipes every week. Last weekend, I invited my whole family over for dinner, my parents, my two siblings and their partners. I spent the entire day cooking. I made homemade pasta from scratch, like actually rolling out the dough and cutting it by hand. I made this garlic bread with real butter and fresh garlic. And for dessert, I made tiramisu, which took forever because you have to let it set in the fridge for hours. Everything turned out perfect. The pasta was cooked just right. The sauce tasted amazing and the tiramisu looked exactly like the picture from the recipe. I was actually proud of myself. When everyone arrived, my mom walked in and immediately started looking around my apartment like she was inspecting it. She opened my Fridge and asked why I didn't have more vegetables. She moved a pillow on my couch because it wasn't straight. We finally sat down to eat.

The prosecutor destroyed me in the opening. He called me violent, reckless, dangerous. Then two witnesses took the stand. People I'd never seen before saw her shove the stroller. There was no car. My jaw dropped. These people weren't even there. How is this happening? The parents sobbed through their entire testimony. The father held up photos of his son in the ICU for everyone to see. Look at his scars. Look what he did to our boy. He then pulled out photos of an empty box. We've had to sell my late mother's jewelry to pay for our son's medical costs. All we're asking for is fair compensation. He cried, pointing at me. And that this monster sees the inside of a cell. When it was my turn to take the stand, most of the courtroom looked at me like Homer looks at Flanders. Prosecution questioned me.

I have to tell the truth. The parents faces drained white. Judge, who are you? Abraham Goldberg. He pointed at the Parents, their nephew. They paid me $1,000 to drive at their kid and swerve at the last second. The mother screamed. We've never seen him before. Abraham held up his phone. I have every text. The judge connected it to the courtroom screen. The father's messages appeared one by one. Drive fast enough to look real. He walks this route every day at 9:30. We'll let the stroller roll into the street. When he saves the kid, we wait two weeks, then sue. Hospital bills will make the settlement bigger. Courtroom was dead silent. Abraham was crying now. I needed money, but I can't let an innocent person go to prison for something I helped do. If you need to arrest someone, arrest the three of us. The judge instantly slammed her gavel. Bailiff, arrest all three of them now! Abraham looked around. Wait, I'm actually getting arrested? I didn't think you'd actually arrest me, too. But he was already in handcuffs.

I told him it was 8:30 on a school night and I wasn't dragging them to a hospital. He said he'd call them himself and they'd ask me. I told him if he did that, I'd hang up on him and block his number. He didn't call back. He missed his entire parenting week after that. Didn't show up, didn't call the kids, didn't ask to reschedule. His mom called me instead and said he was refusing to leave the hospital. Even after Hannah got discharged, I kept the kids on their normal routine. Helped with homework, made their lunches, took. Took them to soccer and piano. When his next week came around, he finally showed up. He looked terrible. He didn't say anything to me. Just loaded the kids in his car with this look on his face, like I'd personally betrayed him. Last week, he texted me about a trip. He said he booked a healing retreat in Colorado for him and Hannah. Some cabin in the mountains where they could grieve and process everything. He wanted to take the kids for a Full week during my parenting time, during a school week. And he wanted his regular weeks before and after, which meant he'd have them for three straight weeks. He said the kids being there would help Hannah recover, that she needed to be around them, that it would.

My parents told everyone I died at birth. I only exist one day every four years. The other 1,460 days, I disappear into a soundproof room in our basement, fed through a slot like an animal they're too ashamed to put down. They say seeing me between birthdays will curse our family. But I know the truth. I'm the affair child, the bad luck baby, the mistake that only gets to be real every leap year. The room became my world before I could even crawl. A leap baby, the nurse had said how special. Mom's eyes went wild. She'll only exist sometimes, she whispered. That's perfect. That's the answer. I later found out that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and refused to take her meds. Dad was drunk when they brought me home. He's always drunk, but that day he was the kind of drunk where he agrees to anything. Mom explained her plan while he nodded along, Bourbon sweating through his pores. She's cursed, you understand? His baby. But there's a loophole. Lee babies don't exist except on their day. We keep her hidden. She can't spread the curse. The room was ready within a week. Soundproofing foam covered every inch, a slot at the bottom of the door just big enough for food trays, a small bathroom attached, a camera in the corner so they could check if I was still alive without having to see Me, no windows, no light switch I could control, just a bare bulb that turned on twice a day for meals. I Learned to count by scratching marks on the wall, 1,461 scratches between each time the door opened, between each time mom would look at me with eyes almost seemed same and whisper, today you're real, baby. Today you exist. My brothers didn't know about me for years. Mason and Luke, born 13 months after me. On a normal day, a safe day, they got bedrooms upstairs, birthday parties every year. I watched their feet through the crack under my door, listen to them laugh at cartoons I never see. Mom told them the basement was dangerous, toxic mold. She said one breath and you die. But kids don't listen. Mason found me when he was 7 and I was 8, so I only celebrated two birthdays. He kicked his ball down the stairs and chased it, ignoring Mom's freaking warnings. He pressed his face to the slot in my door, two eyes meeting mine. There's a girl in here, he screamed. Mom dragged him away and I heard the slap echo through the house. That's not a girl, she told him. That's an echo, a ghost. You see it again, our whole family dies. Even she believed her lies. The worst part wasn't the isolation. It was hearing life happened without me. Birthday song sung upstairs while I sat in darkness. Christmas mornings where wrapping paper rustle above My head. Mom's good days when her medication worked and she made cookies, the smell drifting through the vents while I ate cold rice through my slot. Dad tried once. I could tell by his shuffling footsteps the way he stood outside my door for hours. He slurred to mom, this ain't right. She's still our daughter. Mom's voice went sharp, the way it did before her bad episodes. Your daughter, your daughter. You want the curse in our house. You want Mason and Luke to die because you're too weak to protect them. The shuffling footsteps never came back. I taught myself to read from the books mom sometimes threw through the slot, always about curses, demons, Protection spells. By 10, I understood schizophrenia better than most doctors. I knew Mom's patterns. When the.

Today, I found out the horrifying reason why. Every night at nine PM, my father would open the basement door and say the same three words. Time to go down. My brother Jake and I would walk down those stairs. Dad would close the door behind us. We'd hear the deadbolt slide into place, then the chain lock, then something heavy being dragged in front of the door. We'd sleep on the old couch down there. Two blankets, one pillowy. A small lamp in the corner. No windows, concrete walls. A bathroom in the back with a broken mirror. Every morning at 6:00am, Dad would unlock the door and let us out for school. This started when I was seven. Jake was five. We're 17 and 15 now. We asked dad why? A thousand times. He just shake his head and say, I'm keeping you safe. When we were younger, we tried to fight it, tried to run, tried to stay awake and break out. It never worked. Dad was stronger, and the basement door was solid steel. Eventually, we just accepted it. It became normal. We do our homework down there, play cards, talk about school. Jake even brought his Xbox down last year. We made it our space. Our friends thought it was weird when we couldn't do sleepovers. We just told them our dad was strict, overprotective. They believed it. But last night, everything changed. Jake and I were lying on the couch around eleven PM when we heard it. Footsteps. It's upstairs. Heavy, dragging. But Dad's bedroom is on the second floor. These footsteps were right above us in the kitchen. Then we heard Dad's voice. I told you to stay outside. A woman's voice responded, low, raspy. We're hungry. It's been so long. I'm feeding you, dad said. Every week, just like we agreed. Not enough. We want the boys. My brother grabbed my arm. We'd stopped breathing. You can't have them, dad said. His voice was shaking. That was the deal. I give you everything else, you leave my sons alone. The woman laughed. The deal was 10 years. It's been 10 years, Michael. Tonight we take what's owed. Jake looked at me, eyes wide. I put my finger to my lips. We crawled off the couch and pressed our ears against the basement door. Please, dad was begging. Now take me instead. Just leave them alone. We don't want you. Your blood is old, bitter. We want them young. Fresh. There was a crash, like a table being flipped. Dad screamed. Then silence. Jake started crying. I pulled him away from the door. We ran to the back of the basement. The back. I locked us inside. What's happening? Jake whispered. I don't know. We heard the basement door open. Footsteps on the stairs. Slow, deliberate. Multiple set. Boys. The woman's voice called out. Your father, Made a deal with us a long time ago. He gave us your mother, your baby sister, your uncle, your grandmother. Every year someone new. All to keep you safe. I felt sick. Mom died when I was sick. Galaxy don't. They said my baby sister was still born. Uncle Dave disappeared. Grandma had a heart attack. But 10 years is up. And we're so very hungry. The footsteps stopped outside the bathroom door. Come out, boys. It won't hurt for long. Jake was shaking. I looked around the bathroom. The broken mirror. I grabbed a shard of glass. It cut my palm, but I didn't care. The door handle started turning. I'd locked it, but the lock was old, cheap. It clicked open. Three women stood in the doorway. Pale skin, black eyes. Mouths too wide. Teeth too sharp. They smile. There you are. I held up the glass.

My brother Kevin and I made a pact when we were teenagers, the kind of dark humor only siblings share. We were watching our dad mow the lawn one Saturday afternoon when Kevin said, when I die, I want them to play Celebration at my funeral. Really confuse everyone then he that serious? Actually, if any of us ever play Celebration at a funeral, it means something's really wrong, like emergency level wrong. I asked why we need a signal like that, and he shrugged. Weird things happen. If you hear that song at a funeral, you'll know someone needs help. We shook on it and never brought it up again. Twenty years later, dad collapsed at work and got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The doctors gave him three months, maybe before. Kevin's wife, Nicole, was a hospice nurse. And when she offered to coordinate Dad's care, my parents were relieved. Nicole set up the hospital bed, created medication schedules and helped my parents understand the medical terminology. I lived two states away and could only visit on weekends. Knowing Nicole was handling everything gave me peace of mind. Dad was still himself at first, still cracking jokes and insisting he'd beat this. And the pain got worse and the morphine increased. Dad started sleeping more, fading in and out. Nicole said this was normal. Progression. When dad died six weeks after diagnosis, we were heartbroken but not surprised. The doctor said sometimes it happens faster than expected. Funeral home. When the director asked about music, Kevin stared at the table for a long moment before saying quietly for the closing song. I want Celebration by cool and the gang, my heart stopped. Nicole touched his shoulder gently. Honey, maybe something more traditional. Your father loved classical music. And blinked like he was coming out of a fog. Yeah, you're right. Whatever you think, but I'd already heard it. The signal. I caught him alone afterward. Why did you request that song? He looked exhausted. I don't know. My brain isn't working right, Kevin. That was our signal. He stared at me blankly. What signal? Something about his empty expression bothered me. I kept thinking about how fast dad had declined. Twice when they said 3 or 4 months, I called the hospice doctor. Is it normal for pancreatic cancer to progress that quickly? It can be. Your father's care was managed appropriately, according to the notes I received from his home nurse. I looked through Dad's medication logs at my parents house. Every dose documented, timed, signed. The morphine had been increased three times in the final two weeks. Increase noted with per hospice doctor recommendation. It looked professional and thorough. I texted Kevin asking to talk. Nicole answered his phone. He's resting. I gave him something to help him sleep. You gave him Something. He's having a breakdown and needs medication. I'm his wife and a medical professional. She hung up. I drove to Kevin's house and didn't bother knocking, just tried the door. It was unlocked. Kevin was sitting on the couch with unfocused eyes. Kevin, what did she give you? He tried to focus. I don't know. She said it would help. Nicole walked in and stopped when she saw me. What did you give him? Anxiety medication prescribed by his doctor. Show me the bottle. She pulled out a prescription bottle. Lorazepam prescribed to Nicole, not Kevin. This is your medication. I'm sharing it with my husband who needs it.

The lawyer cleared his throat and read the claws again, while my perfect siblings sat frozen in their chairs. The estate can only be divided if all four children sign together, including Rebecca, who must approve the distribution. My sister, Victoria, the Harvard lawyer who hadn't spoken to me in five years, suddenly found her voice very quickly. This has to be a mistake, Victoria said, her manicured nails tapping the mahogany table. Rebecca is, she's not even really part of this family anymore. I sat quietly in my thrift store dress, the same style they'd mocked at every family event. The black sheep, the college dropout, the one who threw away her potential to become a kindergarten teacher. Dad wouldn't do this, my brother William added, adjusting his Rolex. She didn't even visit him the last two years because you told security not to let me in, I reminded him. The lawyer interrupted. Your father was very specific. Rebecca must sign or the entire state goes to charity. Everything, the houses, the investments, the company shares. My youngest brother, James, laughed nervously. Come on, Becky, you'll sign. It's 18 million each. It's Rebecca, I corrected. And why would I sign? You spent 20 years telling me I don't belong in this family. The room erupted. Three voices overlapping, demanding, threatening, pleading. It's like every family dinner where they talk over me, dismiss me, pretend I Wasn't there you ungrateful? Little Victoria started ungrateful. I stood up for what? The Christmas cards you never sent? The wedding invitations that mysteriously got lost. Family reunions I Learned about through Facebook. You embarrassed the family, William shouted, dropping out of Yale to play with children. I left Yale because I was having a breakdown trying to meet your impossible standards. But none of you noticed because I wasn't worth noticing. The truth was messier. Dad had seen it all. Every cruel comment, every excluded invitation, every time they told people they only have three children. I tried to intervene, but they convinced him I was dramatic, oversensitive, playing victim. Until two years ago. Your father left something else, the lawyer said, producing an envelope with my name. Inside was a photo, me at the hospital holding the hand of a dying man. Not in the VIP suite where dad supposedly was, in the charity ward with a homeless veteran named Frank. I don't understand. Victoria said dad wasn't in the private suite those last two years. I said he was volunteering in the charity ward. That's where we met every week. You visited his empty VIP room and took selfies for Instagram. He was downstairs reading to terminal patients. That's impossible, James protested. He was ashamed, I continued, of what his money turned you into. So he pretended to be sicker than he was. Jaden, the charity ward, is a volunteer. We had lunch every Thursday. He saw How you treated the nurses, staff, anyone you deemed beneath you. You're lying, Williams spat. The lawyer pulled out an iPad, played a video dad in the charity ward, his voice clear. Rebecca is the only one who sees people, not price tags. She visits me not for inheritance, but for cross.

Eight years ago, my little sister Katie finally told our parents something she'd been holding in since she was 12. Our Uncle Dave had raped her multiple times when she used to stay at his house during summer breaks. She was 23 when she finally got the courage to tell them. I remember that day so clearly. We were all sitting in the living room, and she just came out and said it. My mom's face went completely white, and my dad just stared at her. Then my dad said, that's not possible. Dave would never do something like that. My mom agreed and said Katie must be remembering things wrong or confused about what happened. Katie tried to explain, but they kept interrupting her and making excuses for him. Within a week, somehow, the whole family knew. Dave's kids started calling Katie a liar on Facebook. My aunts and grandparents all took his side. They said she was making it up for attention or trying to destroy the family. Not one person believed her except me. I told her I believed every word and that I was so sorry this happened to her. She broke down crying and said I was the only family member she could trust anymore. A month later, she moved to Oregon and cut off everyone. Everyone except me. She made me promise to never tell our parents or anyone else anything about Her life. No updates? No. No information. Nothing. It killed me. But I kept that promise. Our parents would ask me about her all the time. Is she okay? Is she happy? Does she have a job? I just said I couldn't tell them anything. Two years ago, Katie called me crying. She'd been having this cough that wouldn't go away and feeling tired all the time. The doctors found stage 4 lung cancer in her lungs, and it had already spread. She was only 31 years old and had never even smoked. The doctor said she

While he was setting up his camera, Denky was frantically trying to finish a level on her hidden phone game. Denky, Smile, Dad called out. Just a second. I'm appreciating the natural beauty, she said. Thumbs flying across her screen. Our rebellion reached peak chaos on day 3 when we discovered the hotel had terrible Wi-Fi. Denky had a complete meltdown because she couldn't upload her secret vacation selfies to Instagram. Bathroom has better signal, she whispered to me during dinner. So there we were taking turns hiding in the hotel bathroom, desperately trying to get one bar of service while our parents thought we had digestive issues from the road trip. Snacks, you kids have been spending a lot of time in the bathroom, mom observed suspiciously. Must be all that healthy trail mix you packed, I said innocently, while Denky was literally sitting on the bathroom floor trying to connect to Wi-Fi. Day 4 brought disaster. Dad decided to surprise us with a spontaneous hike and grabbed our backpacks to carry water bottles. That's when he discovered Denky's secret phone charging station she'd set up using the car's USB port. What is this? He bellowed, holding up a tangle of charging cables like evidence in a crime scene. Denky and I exchanged panicked looks. Our rebellion had been exposed. We can explain, Denki started, but dad was already conducting a full search of our luggage. Like airport security, he found everything, my hollowed out book, Denki's pillow, phone, the trail mix charger, even the backup earbuds I'd hidden in my sock. You two have been running an underground electronics operation this entire trip, mom said, trying not to laugh. Dad lined up all our confiscate devices on the hotel bed like a defeated army. I'm disappointed but also kind of impressed by your creativity. The pillow thing was genius, mom admitted. Denky grinned. Desperate times call for desperate measures. That's when dad made his fatal mistake. He decided to test my Nintendo Switch to make sure it still worked after being hidden for four days. Three hours later, we found him in the hotel lobby completely absorbed in playing Zelda while mom was taking pictures of him, breaking his own rule. So much for technology free bonding, Denke whispered to me.

I was told this morning by the organizers that I'd be covering the Bill since it was my idea to come here. But since my son apparently isn't worthy of a proper meal beyond a smoothie, I don't think I should be responsible for feeding people who can't show basic decency to a child. Vanessa's face went white. What are you talking about? We got him something, a twelve dollar smoothie while your kids get 100 dollar steaks. I said evenly, how generous. You didn't know. I turned to her with mock surprise. I asked me 3 weeks ago to cover tonight since I make the most money. I said yes because I thought we were celebrating as a family. Turns out some family members are more equal than others. My dad started to sputter. Now wait a minute, we got the boy a drink. Reservation is under my credit card. I continued looking at the waiter. I'm canceling it effective immediately. The waiter's eyes widened. Sir, some items have already been prepared. I'll pay for what's been served so far, including that very thoughtful smoothie and my salmon order. I said, pulling out my wallet, everything else that hasn't hit the kitchen, cancel it. Please bring my son the Wagyu ribeye with the loaded baked potato and the triple chocolate cake. We'll be moving to a table for two. The chaos that erupted was beautiful. Vanessa started screeching about how Ungrateful I was. After they'd included Mason, my dad's face turned purple as he realized his 200 dollar porterhouse was evaporating. Mom actually started crying. We ordered him something. Vanessa shrieked, that smoothie was expensive. You're right, I said, picking up Mason's hand. A 12 dollar smoothie while everyone else feasts. How could I be so ungrateful? I'm also packing us up and leaving you all to figure out how you're going to pay for five wagyu steaks, three lobster appetizers and enough desserts to feed a wedding. The waiter, barely suppressing a smile, LED Mason and me to a quiet corner booth. As we walked away, I heard my dad frantically asking the waiter about splitting the check. Mason looked up at me, his eyes wide. Dad, is this real? Very real, buddy, I said roughly.

I looked up from the chocolate frosting I was carefully spreading, confused. Invited to what? She held up her phone, showing my husband's Instagram story. There he was, at a fancy rooftop restaurant downtown, champagne glass raised high, surrounded by all his co workers. The caption read, celebrating 30 in style. Thanks for the surprise, everyone. Today was my 31st birthday. He was celebrating my birthday without me. Oh! Was all I managed, still holding the frosting spatula. My sister Elena stared at me in disbelief. He threw himself a party for your birthday? I set down the spatula with steady hands. Apparently so. The homemade cake I've been decorating for our supposed quiet dinner tonight suddenly looked pathetic. Three layers of chocolate with Happy Birthday half written in vanilla frosting. Let me see that again, I said. Taking her phone, I zoomed in on the video. There was Patricia from his office, who he claimed annoyed him daily. His boss, Gerald, who supposedly never socialized. That new intern, Chloe, laughing at something he was saying. 20 people total. A reserved section with decorations. Someone had ordered a professional cake, visible in the background, with happy 30th and gold lettering. This party had been planned weeks in advance, invitation sent, venue booked, cake ordered, decorations arranged. And not one person had thought to invite or even mention it to the actual birthday person. Elena Was already grabbing her coat. We're going down there right now. No, I said quietly, let them have their party. Are you insane? It's your birthday. I looked at my homemade cake, the grocery store flowers. I bought myself the nice dinner reservation for two I'd made, telling myself you'd appreciate not having to plan anything. I wanna see how this plays out. What time was it posted? 40 minutes ago. He'd left work early, claiming he had an important client meeting. I believed him. Even offered to push our dinner reservation back. Elena stayed with me. Rage. Scrolling through social media, more videos kept appearing. Him opening presents. His co workers had bought a watch, expensive whiskey, cuff links. This is Eleanor muttered. They know it's not his birthday, right? I pulled up Patricia's Instagram. There was a group photo captioned, celebrating the best boss. Happy birthday. Then Gerald's LinkedIn. Honored to celebrate another year with our talented team leader. Happy 30th. They all thought it was his birthday. Every single one believed it. Which meant for weeks, maybe months, my husband had been telling people his birthday was October 15th. My birthday. His actual birthday was in March, six months away. At six PM, he texted, client dinner running long. Start without me. I texted back, no problem. Take your time. Then I did something unprecedented. I took a selfie with my homemade cake and posted it to Facebook. The one platform he never checked, but where his co Workers followed me. Caption

Laura continued, you're going to keep killing babies until you accept you're not meant to be a mother. I ran to the bathroom, sobbing. Laura followed me, pretending to care. I'm just being honest because I love you. Her purse had fallen open on the counter. As I reached for tissues, I saw a bottle tucked inside. Laura never took medication, always bragged about being completely natural during pregnancy. Something felt wrong. The label was partially visible. My favorite stone. My hands shook as I grabbed my phone. Locked in the bathroom stall, I gold it quickly. The results made my blood run cold. Abortion medication. Used to terminate pregnancies. Why would she have this? She was eight months pregnant. Unless. My mind raced back, every miscarriage had happened after seeing Laura. After she'd made me tea at her house. After she'd insisted I try her homemade smoothies. After she'd given me vitamins from her purse. Because sisters share everything. I stayed in that bathroom for 20 minutes, my world tilting off its access. When I came out, Laura was holding court at dinner, describing her perfect pregnancy journey. Three babies, I thought, staring at her. She killed three of my babies. I smiled and said nothing. Not yet. The investigation triggered automatically when the lab found my fibroid stone in my blood samples from the third miscarriage. The police interviewed me for hours. I gave them everything. Timeline, photos, texts where she'd insisted I drink her Teas. A week later, they arrested her at our nephew's birthday party. Cops walked through screaming children, passed the princess cake and cuffed her in.

So at 16, I discovered that my mom's 85 dollar Charlotte Tilbury highlighter had the exact same ingredients as this three dollar craft glitter from Michaels. Same mica, same titanium dioxide, everything. I felt like I'd expose the entire beauty industry. So naturally, I mixed the craft glitter with some Vaseline and started using it as my daily highlight. For two weeks, I'm walking around school, literally sparkling like a disco ball, getting compliments from everyone, including the popular girls who usually ignored me. Posting tutorials on TikTok about my beauty hack. And it's getting thousands of views. I even convinced three of my friends to try it. We called ourselves the Glitter Squad. I was basically a teenage beauty guru exposing big makeup slides. Then one Tuesday, I wake up and my face is on fire. Not metaphorically. It feels like someone pressed a hot iron to my cheeks. I look in the mirror and there are these raised, angry welts everywhere the glitter touched. Turns out, craft glitter isn't cosmetic grade for a reason. It has sharp edges that create micro cuts in your skin. And I've been grinding it into my face for 14 days straight. But here's where it gets worse. The glitter is embedded in my skin. Not on it, in it. My mom rushes me to urgent care, and the doctor literally gasped when she sees me. She says, the glitter Has worked its way into the cut, and my skin is trying to heal over it. She can see it sparkling under the skin, like I'm some kind of failed vampire from Twilight. She tries to extract some with tweezers, but each piece leaves a bigger hole. My face looks like I fought with a bedazzler and lost. Doctor says we have to let it work itself out naturally, which could take months. She prescribes antibiotic, because apparently craft glitter isn't sterile. Who knew? And sends me home looking like I have metallic chicken pox. The next day at school is my junior year class photo, the one that goes in the yearbook. The one my mom already paid $180 for the deluxe package to send to all our relative. I try everything foundation.

She'd already looked at apartments near her office. She wanted to do this maturely, she said. Separate bedrooms for a month, then file so we could co parent effectively. I remember staring at her and just laughing. Not a mean laugh, just your disbelief at how delusional she was being. She got angry immediately. Asked me what was so funny about our marriage ending. Said she expected me to at least try to fix them. I told her I'd need three weeks to get my finances in order and talk to a lawyer. She looked satisfied, even said she appreciated me not making this difficult. What Sarah didn't know was that Tyler had messaged me a month earlier. He'd found me through her Facebook and sent me a long, apologetic message. Said he didn't realize we were still married, that Sarah had told him we were separated and sleeping in different rooms, that I was controlling with money, that I'd stopped making an effort years ago. And she Was lonely. He seemed genuinely confused and sent me screenshots of their texts. Dozens of messages where she complained about me. Said I'd got

I stared at the problem again, really studied it line by line, variable by variable. The quantum system they described, it violated the poly exclusion principle. The dimensions were mathematically inconsistent. The boundary conditions contradicted each other. This wasn't just hard. It was physically impossible. But here's the insane part. Buried in the middle of all that chaos was one tiny line that said, assuming standard laboratory conditions, standard lab conditions meant room temperature, normal pressure, Earth's gravity. But the problem described a system that could only exist in the vacuum of space at absolute zero temperature, while simultaneously requiring conditions found inside a black hole. The temperature requirements alone were contradictory. They needed both absolute zero and millions of degrees simultaneously. The pressure conditions defied thermodynamics. The gravitational fields would tear apart any measuring equipment. I wrote, this quantum system cannot exist under standard laboratory conditions as it requires mutually exclusive physical environment. The problem violates fundamental laws of physics, including the poly exclusion principle and thermodynamic constraints. Under actual standard laboratory conditions, this system would collapse instantly. I turned in my exam after 90 minutes. The entire class was still Frank.

But our dad's final message proved who the real thief was. Dad died on a Tuesday, and by Saturday, my brother George had demanded that everyone come over for a family meeting. I walked in with my cane, still trying to process that my dad was actually gone. And the whole room went quiet. George cleared his throat and said, we need to talk about dad's will, because something really messed up is going on here. I heard my aunt shift in her chair and someone off. George just kept talking, and he got louder with every word. Dad left the house to someone who's been lying to us for eight years. He pretended to be blind to make dad feel bad for him, and I'm not letting him get away with it. My cousin Andrea gasped, and my aunt said, oh, my god! Under her breath. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, because I lost my vision eight years ago in an accident, and George knew that better than anyone. I started to say something, but George talked right over me. Don't even try it. I'm going to prove you aren't actually blind. When I'm done, you'll be lucky to get anything. The next morning, I was making coffee when my phone rang, and my cousin was on the other end freaking out. Is it true? George showed us the report he got from A private investigator. And it says you reacted to visual stuff. You even turned your head when a car went by. I tried to tell her that blind people turn towards sounds all the time, but she just hung up on me. The calls just kept coming. And they all started with someone.

It's not like this affects me. That stung, but I let it go. Greg told me to be patient. Said she was going through a phase. But then my work got intense. Our team had this massive project with crazy deadlines. I was working 12 hour days, sometimes more. Greg's job is pretty flexible, so he handled most of the house stuff. Cooking, cleaning, helping Kara with homework. One night I came home at 11. I hadn't eaten since breakfast. I was so tired I could barely stand. Kara was in the kitchen making herself a sandwich. I asked if she could make me one, too, since I just got home. She looked at me and said, make it yourself. You're not my real mom. Then she walked upstairs. I stood there holding my laptop.

And I thought I was completely in the clear. I texted my mom that I was heading to Whitney's house, grabbed my costume and felt a rush of excitement knowing I had actually pulled this off. When we got to the party, it was already packed and way more intense than I expected. There were seniors there, college kids I didn't even recognize, and people were crowded in. Every room, the.

Christian's hands shook. I taught Ashland about periods because mom wasn't there to do it. For my 18th, I was cleaning up Leo's vomit, singing him Mom's lullabies. When he wouldn't stop crying, tears streamed down his face. I know it's not your fault, god. I know you were drowning, too, but I haven't had a birthday that was mine in 11 years. He pulled out his phone, scrolled through photos. Look at this. Every single picture from the last decade. I'm being mom, making lunches like she did, braiding Ashland's hair the way she taught me that one time. His voice cracked. My friends went to parties. They studied abroad. They got to be stupid teenagers. You know what I did? I memorized which foods Leo wouldn't eat on Tuesdays because mom would have known. I Learned her recipes because the kids missed her cooking. The other diners looked away. Leo started crying. Ashland reached for Christian's hand and he gripped it tight. It's not your fault, he said. Look, looking at me with broken eyes. You did what you had to do. We both did. But sometimes I just, I miss being someone's kid. Instead of playing mom, I Miss them so much and I never got to grieve because someone always needed dinner or help with homework or a nightmare. Soothed, he covered his face. I just wanted to be 17 and heartbroken over some girl. I looked at my broken brother and asked the question I'd been terrified to voice. Christian, have we been so busy being parents that we forgot to be siblings? The words hung there. Ashland gasped. Christian's tears stopped. He stared at me like he was seeing me for the first time in 11 years. God, he whispered. We never grieved together, did we? You were being dad, I was being mom. But we never just been two kids who lost their parents. We never even cried together. I choked out, not once. Since the funeral, Leo's voice broke through, small and devastating. We don't even know.

So I gave him 48 hours of pure sleepless hell. Our daughter Ivy was six months old and I was running on two hours of sleep a night or three months. Every night she'd wake screaming and my husband would nudge me saying she needed me and I'd drag myself up while he rolled back to sleep. During the day, I was a zombie, putting my phone in the refrigerator and forgetting conversations while he went to the gym and stayed late for happy hours. My friend Riley watched me break down one afternoon and said something felt off. The baby's IVs age should sleep longer stretches. The thought seemed too cruel to be real, but I ordered cameras that looked like phone chargers and strategically hid them in the nursery. That night, I pretended to sleep when Ivy fussed around midnight, grabbed my phone under the covers and opened the camera app. I watched him walk to her nursery, stand over her crib and drum his fingers on the railing until she went from fussy to full scream. Then he came back and shook my shoulder, telling me she needed me. Over the next two weeks, I watched the footage every morning while he was at work. He did it every single night, sometimes even shaking her mattress until she cried. Finally, I called Riley in tears and showed Her everything. She stared at the screen for a long time, then looked at me and said, he's been torturing you on purpose for three months. You need to make him feel exactly what he's done to you. We planned everything over the next week. I built up a freezer stash of pumped milk and created a schedule for Ivy that was times 15 minutes off from her actual rhythm, just enough that nothing would work, but he wouldn't know why. I set up new cameras in every room that connected to my phone so I could watch everything and trigger the motion alarms. Riley booked us a hotel 20 minutes away. And on Friday, I waited until he got in the shower. I put Ivy down for a nap, left the pumped milk in the fridge and the wrong schedule on the counter, grabbed my bag and tech to him from the car that my mom had an emergency. Riley and I got to the hotel and pulled up the camera feed on the TV. Friday night, he managed, but Ivy cried more than usual. At 2 in the morning, I triggered the motion alarm and it blared through.

Then I asked the question that exposed the real tragedy. I was three weeks into my sophomore year at university when the police knocked on my dorm room door. A car accident. Both of my parents were gone instantly. Just. Just like that. I became a 19 year old playing house with three broken siblings. Christian was 16, Ashland, 12, and Leo only 9. The social worker asked if I'd take guardianship or they'd enter foster care. What choice did I have? I signed papers I didn't understand, dropped my mechanical engineering major, and drove home to a new reality. The house smelled like mom's perfume for weeks. I didn't know how to plan a funeral or which bills to pay first. Got overnight shifts at FedEx, weekend warehouse work, and delivered pizzas between three jobs, and I still couldn't afford grief counseling. Christian handled afternoons, pick up the siblings from school, homework, battles, making boxed Mac and cheese while tears ran down his face. I'd find him asleep at the kitchen table next to Leo's math worksheets, still wearing yesterday's clothes. Ashland screamed for mom in her sleep. The first time Leo called me dad by accident, Christian and I just stood there crying in the hallway. We were children, raising children for years. I thought we were healing. Christian graduated high school with honors. Despite everything. I sat in the auditorium, exhausted from my night shift, watching Him walk across that stage. Ashland joined the drama club, started smiling again. Leo made the honor roll. We had Sunday dinners where someone actually laughed. I got promoted to warehouse supervisor. Dropped down to just two jobs. Christian started community college, taking night classes while still handling afternoon duties. He'd set up homework stations for Ashlyn and Leo before racing to his six PM statistics class. I convinced myself we made it through the worst. But the cracks were everywhere. Christian never dated anyone for more than a month. Too busy, he'd say, stirring another pot of spaghetti. His high school friends stopped calling. I found rejection letters from four year universities hidden in his drawer. Schools he'd never told me he'd applied to. Ashlyn mentioned once that Christian cried in his car after dropping them at school. Leo asked why Christian never drew anymore. His sketchbooks from before our parents died stayed buried in the closet. The explosion came at Christian's 27th birthday dinner. I'd splurged on a real restaurant, not take out. Ashlyn was heading to college soon. Leo had just turned 18. I raised my beer.

She was freaking out because she had an IUD insertion scheduled for Thursday, and she was terrified of going alone. Her boyfriend had bailed on her last minute because of some work thing, and she was literally crying on the phone asking if I could come with her. I told her of course I would. That's what friends do. But when I mentioned it to Greg that night over dinner, he lost it. He said it was inappropriate for me to be involved in Natalie's reproductive health stuff, that it was too personal, and I shouldn't be getting mixed up in her private medical business. I told him she was scared and needed support, but he just kept saying no. He literally said if I went to that appointment, there would be consequences. I asked him what that meant, and he just stared at me with this cold look and said I'd find out. Thursday morning came, and I had to make a choice.

My parents had been fighting about money constantly that December. Mom kept saying we couldn't afford presents this year. Dad kept insisting we'd figure it out somehow. Every conversation turned into a screaming match about the bills, a mortgage, how we were barely scraping by. I was terrified Santa wouldn't come because my parents were too broke and too angry to make Christmas happen. So I took matters into my own hands, like the helpful little genius I thought I was. I'd noticed dad had this secret credit card that he kept hidden in his toolbox out in the garage. I'd seen him sneak out there late at night, sometimes, pull it out and use it on his phone for stuff. He always looked guilty when he did it, glancing around to make sure mom wasn't watching. To my nine year old brain, this was obviously his special Christmas money card that he was hiding so mom wouldn't worry about spending. Perfect solution, right? I just borrow it real quick and buy them each something nice. Then they'd stop fighting, Christmas would be saved, and I'd be the hero of the family. I waited until they were both distracted. One evening. Mom was cooking, dad was watching TV, and I snuck out to the garage, found the Card

I'm 27 now, but this happened two years ago in Ashford, Washington, a small timber town where gossip spreads faster than smoke from the mill. My family looked perfect from the outside. Dad ran the hardware store on Main. Mom shared the church bake sale. And my older brother Lucas was the golden boy, star quarterback turned business school prodigy. Me, I was the quiet daughter who painted in the garage. It was a Friday in September, seven forty three PM at a family cookout for Lucas's early acceptance to a Seattle firm. Mom decorated the backyard with blue and silver balloons and I even brought a 39 dollar cake from Costco. Lucas had already down to two IPA's. When I congratulated him, I thought I was being kind. But Lucas heard something else. Don't sound so jealous, sneered. You'll figure your life out someday. Dad laughed like it was a joke. I felt heat crawl up my neck. I'm proud of you, Luke, I said. That's all. Later, while carrying paper plates inside, he cornered me near the kitchen island. Why did you talk to my girlfriend about me being drunk last week? His voice was low but sharp. She asked if you were okay, I explained. I said you were stressed. Wrong answer. His eyes narrowed and before I could step back, he shoved me hard into the edge of The counter, I heard a crack. White hot pain shot across my chest. I collapsed, clutching my side. Mom rushed in. What happened, she demanded. Lucas muttered. She tripped. My breath came shallow, every inhale like glass. He pushed me, I wheezed. Mom froze, then knelt close, her voice trembling. Stay quiet. He has a future. Those words hurt worse than my ribs. By ten PM, I was back in my apartment wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The bruise spread like spill old ink. I could barely lift my arm. My phone buzzed nonstop. Mom offering Advil, dad saying don't blow this up. Lucas never called. At 6:00am the next morning, I drove myself to Saint Mark's clinic. Every pot hole a fresh stab. The doctor was Doctor Patel, a calm woman in her 40s with kind.

The highest score in five years was 34%. Students literally transferred schools to avoid him. Our final exam was worth six 50% of our grade. The last question was worth 50 points. Using Schrodinger's equation, calculate the exact probability wave function for an electron in this 47 dimensional quantum system. Then derive the energy eigen values for all possible states. Equation filled two entire pages. Variables I'd never seen before. Mathematical notation that looked like alien hieroglyphics. People were hyperventilating. One guy just walked out crying. Another girl was rocking back and forth, muttering formulas under her breath. I sat there for an hour, completely paralyzed. This was impossible. Even graduate students couldn't solve this. My entire physics career was about to end. I could hear people around me frantically scribbling, erasing, having mental breakdowns. The girl next to me was literally pulling her hair out. The room felt like a war zone. Calculators were overheating. People were using every inch of their blue books, writing equations on the margins, on their arms, anywhere they could find space. The desperation was suffocating. Then something clicked. I remembered Doctor Reeves's very first lecture. Physics isn't about memorizing formula

You need two years of foreign language to graduate, she said, sliding a Spanish enrollment form across her desk. I panicked. My older sister had warned me about senior Martinez pop quizzes daily. Zero tolerance for mistakes. Without thinking, I blurted out, actually, I already speak French. My grandmother taught me. Missus Peterson's eyebrows shot up. Really? Say something. I remembered exactly three phrases from a travel documentary. Bonjour, comment allez vous? She's American. She was impressed. Perfect. I'll Mark you down for advanced French literature instead. That night, I downloaded every French app imaginable. Duolingo became my best friend. I watched watch movies with subtitles, practiced pronunciation in the shower, even changed my phone settings to French. The school was buying it completely. Teachers would ask me to help exchange students. I joined French club, somehow became vice president. During International Night, I gave a speech about growing up bilingual. Pure memorized phonetics. My closest call came when actual French teacher Madame Laurent cornered me at lunch. She started rapid firing questions I couldn't understand. I faked a coughing fit and ran to the nurse. Senior year at graduation, they announced I'd receive the Outstanding World Language Student award. Walking across that stage, I whispered to my mom, she Laughed I know, honey. Your accent is terrible. The original patriarch stood up without a word and left. Conversations resumed, but no one spoke to Ethan. He wasn't family anymore. He was just a guest. That night, his stepfather finally broke his silence. At dinner, Ethan whispered, I guess the Caldwells really cut me off.

She never eats the food they bring her. Instead, she collects the food and smears it all over the walls. She uses the salt from the soup to corrode the stone walls, then starts digging with a homemade iron spoon. She's trapped in a prison surrounded by water on all sides. And to avoid detection by the guards, she rips pages from books, soaks them in water and covers them in dirt until they blend in with the walls. She paces these pages over a hole, buying herself more time to dig. She never goes outside for recreation, always telling the guards she prefers reading in her cell. Three months later, she's dug a tunnel more than 500 meters long. Then on a fateful day, a prosecutor arrives to inspect the prison. She knows this is her chance. The warden arranges a performance to entertain the officials. Since she hasn't been out in a while, none of her fellow inmates have seen her. The guards aren't paying attention to her movements. She walks back to her cell in broad daylight. The guard delivers her meal. Assuming she's inside reading as usual. He knocks on the door but gets no response. Quickly, he opens it, only to find the cell completely empty. Panicked, he rushes to sound the alarm. The performance stops abruptly, and for the safety of the officials, the warden personally escorts them out. Back in the cell, the warden Angrily reprimands the guard in charge, grabbing a book and throwing it hard at the wall. The book hits the paper covering the entrance to the tunnel. The warden peels back the paper, discovering the tunnel. In that instant, he seems to understand. He orders someone to crawl inside. After a painful and difficult crawl, the person finally reaches the end of the tunnel, but it's a dead end. So how did that woman escape? Scattered marbles.

He shows me the reference photo he wants to use. It's clearly from her Instagram, but it's been edited. He smoothed her skin, made her eyes bigger, even changed her nose slightly. This man wants me to tattoo an airbrushed, modified version of his fiance as the mother of God on his chest. I asked him if maybe we could do something smaller, maybe her name in nice script with some roses. He's offended, says, I don't understand true love. Against every instinct, I agree to do it.

I pulled out my phone and Googled how much blood is normal for a period while she sat on the couch hunched over. The search results said something about soaking through a pad in an hour being caused for concern. I looked at my sister. She was dripping onto our mom's decorative throw pillows. Okay, but Like all girls complain about their periods being bad, right? Maybe it's just supposed to suck. I tried to remember anything from health class.

And it was the most deserved beat down ever when I was in third grade. Five sixth grade girls ran our elementary school like a prison gang. The ring leader was this girl named Brittany, who was at least 5 3 and built like a linebacker. Her crew consisted of Madison, Ashley and two other girls who just followed orders. They'd shove kids into lockers, the lunch money, cut in line at lunch and say the cruelest things imaginable to make kids cry. The worst part, teachers did absolutely nothing. Britney's dad was on the school board, so anytime someone complained, it mysteriously went nowhere. The girls knew they were untouchable. I watched them operate for months. Made a second grader cry by telling him his mom packed his lunch because she wanted him to choke. They stole a fourth grader's brand new sneakers and threw them on the roof. They cornered a kindergartener in the bathroom and locked her in a stall for 20 minutes. It was psychological warfare on elementary school. Then they went after my best friend, Marcus. We were walking to class when Britney and her crew blocked the hallway. Madison grabbed Marcus's backpack, unzipped it and dumped everything on the floor. His homework, his lunch, his Pokemon cards, everything scattered across the dirty hallway. Britney picked up his math folder and walked straight to the bathroom. I followed them. Big mistake. She dunked his entire folder in the toilet, not just dip it fully submerged it in the nasty school bathroom water. Marcus started crying. That's when I stepped in and told them to stop. Britney turned around and without warning shoved me with.

My parents bought a beach house and they invited my daughter, jazz, to stay with them for a full week in July. The idea made me nervous. I appreciate it, but she's only 6 and the ocean can be unpredictable. Will one of you be in the water with her at all times? My mom sounded offended. Are you serious? We know how to watch a kid. My dad jumped in. And the beach has lifeguards. That's their job. I tried to stay calm. I just want to make sure someone will be actively watching her. My mom cut me off. We raised you and you turned out fine. Jazz needs independence and honestly, she needs a break from your helicopter parenting. I still didn't like the idea, but I agreed to keep the peace. Second day they had jazz, I got a text from another mom at Jazz's school. I'm at the beach and I see jazz in the water by herself. Both of the people with her are asleep. I called my mom immediately. Someone just texted me and said, you are both asleep while jazz is in the water alone. My mom's voice got sharp. Do you really have people spying on us? I checked my mom's social media that afternoon and saw a photo of my parents holding cocktails. Caption said, living our best beach life. Jazz wasn't in the photo. On day 4, I Decided to drive to the beach to make sure everything was okay. When I got there, I found my parents flat on their backs with magazines over their faces and empty beer bottles next to them. Jazz was in the water, way out past the buoys with waves crashing over.

This 7 year old kid named Tyler walked into my office with his dad last month. The moment he opened his mouth, I knew something was seriously wrong. His teeth were yellow and soft like they were rotting from the inside out. The smell hit me immediately, that sour, rotten breath that comes from months of neglect. But here's the thing that got me. This kid was the most polite patient I'd ever seen. He sat perfectly still in the chair, opened wide when I asked and even smiled at my dental assistant Emma when she showed him the little suction tool. His dad looked exhausted, dark circles under his eyes, work uniform that had seen better days. When I asked about Tyler's dental routine, he straightened up and said confidently, oh, he brushes twice a day, morning and night. We don't let him have candy or soda. I nodded and kept examining Tyler's mouth. But internally I was calling bullshit. Decay this severe doesn't happen overnight. This was months, maybe years of neglect. The enamel was so soft I could practically scrape it off with my fingernail while I worked. Tyler's dad stepped outside to take what sounded like an urgent work call. I could hear.

My roommate, Theo, poked his head out of his room, saw the small army at our door, and immediately retreated. Smart guy. Finally, Vincent appeared at the end of the hallway. He was wearing my gray hoodie. The one with the coffee stain on the left sleeve from last week's all nighter and the small rip near the bottom pocket when it caught on a fence. Vincent's face went completely white when he saw everyone. Come here, Mr. Brennan ordered. Vincent walked over slowly, like he was heading to his execution. Mr. Brennan grabbed the hoodie's collar and inspected it. His confident expression started to crack. He looked at the coffee stain, the rip, the faded college logo on the front. This is. His voice trailed off. That's my hoodie, I said quietly. The one I lent Vincent because he said he was freezing and couldn't find his jacket. Officer Chen looked at Vincent.

Vincent's eyes filled with tears. I Sold it. The hallway went dead silent. You what? I sold it to Brandon Vazquez for $250. He's wanted one forever, and his parents wouldn't buy him one. Why would you sell your jacket, Mister? Brandon looked like someone had punched him in the stomach. The Kendrick Lamar concert is next month. Floor seats were $300. And you said I couldn't go because my grades were bad. Vincent was crying. Now, I thought if I told you someone stole it, you just buy me a new one and I'd have the concert money. And you never know. Mister Brennan stood there frozen. His face went from red to white to red again. Officer Chen closed his notepad. I think we're done here. No theft occurred. Sorry for the inconvenience. The security guards filed out without a word. Vincent kept crying. Mister Brennan couldn't look at me. I'm. I'm sorry. He finally managed his voice barely above a whisper. They left. I closed my door and just stood there for a minute.

Tyler has been deathly allergic to peanuts since he was 18 months old. His first reaction sent him to the er with his throat closing up. Epipens everywhere. Medical alert bracelets, peanut free zones at every family gathering. One bite could kill him. When Tyler was 6, his dad died in a car accident. Tyler couldn't sleep for weeks. One night he came to my room. Aunt Jesse, what if I'm in trouble someday and can't tell anyone? I pulled him close. What kind of trouble? I don't know. Just what if? If you're ever in real danger and can't say it out loud, ask for peanut butter. You'd never actually want it. So I'll know something's wrong. His eyes got wide like a secret code. Exactly, but only for emergencies. Deal, deal. Four years later, my sister Lauren had rebuilt her life. She met Mark at a grief support group. Mark was a widower patient and he Learned everything about Tyler's allergy, kept his house peanut free, read every label. Lauren said Mark saved them. My parents called him a blessing. Tyler seemed to adjust well. They got married when Tyler was 8. Two years of what looked like the perfect blended family, Tyler never used our signal, not once. Tyler's birthday party was supposed to be fun, 20 kids running around my backyard. Lauren setting up the Pinata. Mark helping with decorations. But Tyler stood in the corner, barely interacting with anyone. I walked over. Hey, birthday boy. You okay? He looked up at me, then passed me to where Mark was watching from the patio. Can I talk to you alone? Of course. I started to lead him inside, but Mark appeared. Tyler needs to help me with the cooler. I got it. Tyler needs to learn to help out. Mark's smile was pleasant but firm. Tyler's face fell. I watched them walk away. Tyler's shoulders were hunched, defeated. Later, kids were eating cake when Tyler sat down next to me. Mark was across the yard with Lauren. Aunt Jesse, can I have a peanut butter sandwich? I froze the signal. After four years, Tyler, you're allergic to peanuts. I know. His voice was flat. Then why? I just want one. He wouldn't eat my eyes. Mark started walking toward us. Tyler saw him and stood up quickly. Never mind, Tyler. Wait. But he was already gone. I pulled Lauren aside. Something's wrong with Tyler. He's fine, just Moody lately. He asked for peanut butter. Lauren laughed. He knows he can't have that. He's testing boundaries. When did he start testing boundaries? Since he turned 10. Mark says it's normal. Mark says her expression shifted defensive. Mark has experience with kids. Tyler looks scared. He's not scared. He's adjusting to rules. What kind of rules? Bedtime, screen time, normal stuff. My dad joined us. Is there A problem. Jesse thinks Mark is too strict. Lauren's voice had an edge. Tyler's different, thinner, quiet. My dad patted my shoulder. Boys change at this age. Mark's been good for them. Mark.

This is the failure of our family. My parents laughed. He stayed silent just watching them. The room went dead quiet. Then he smiled faintly and said, interesting, because you're fired and we're done. For as long as I can remember, I've lived at the edge of every room. In my own home, Harley always sat in the center. Her plate filled first. Mine was whatever was left, cold vegetables, broken bread, the smallest piece. My parents called it building character. Somehow, Harley never needed the same lessons. Money disappeared the same way my chances did. Payments meant for my classes redirected to Harley's needs. We invest where it matters most, my father would say. I earned a place in an art program. My mother read the acceptance letter in silence. Harley has dance. That day, we can't be driving all over town. The letter went in the trash. Harley's dance costumes arrived two days later. Years passed. I built my own world, quietly creating a portfolio that landed me at a marketing agency. That's where everything changed. I was working late when I heard Harley's voice from the break room. My sister doesn't have a real career. Adrian only keeps her around out of pity. Laughter followed. The next morning, my concept file was gone. In its place was a new version with Harley's initials. And in turn, knocked. I saw her download your file Yesterday she deleted the original. I opened the access logs, her username, the time stamp, the deletion, the upload. During the afternoon meeting, Harley presented my work as hers. Serenity always crumbles under pressure, she said. Adrian didn't laugh. His gaze shifted toward me. I didn't go home. I walked to a co working space and opened the logs. Every time stamp was a betrayal. I copied everything into a folder. Then I started collecting more. Payments she'd signed without approval, emails where she hinted I was overwhelmed. Budget transfers. She built her own version of me in the system, one that justified taking my work. At midnight, my aunt texted a photo of old paperwork, payments my mother had left for me, savings that disappeared when I was a teenager. I added them to the folder. The next morning, I pulled out drives from years ago, original sketches that became the agency's signature tone. All mine.

Zach started showing up earlier, asking better questions. Sandra signed the letter, hasn't contacted me since. These days, I spend weekends at the Lakehouse. It was never about money.

My stomach dropped, yes, because Vincent asked me to grab his phone charger while he was in the shower. He gave me his combination, 18 to 32, 9. Convenient. Mister Brennan spat. You memorized his combination. He told me his combination. We're neighbors. We've been friends since freshman year. Friends don't steal 400 dollar jackets. Mister Brennan shot back.

He pressed around my chest, and white liquid actually squirted out. His face went pale. The stream hit the wall and started dripping down like something from a horror movie. This isn't possible. How is this happening? Hold on. I need a second opinion. We waited over an hour in that tiny room. Caroline held my hand, but I could tell she was freaked out, too. The wet spots had spread so much that my entire shirt was soaked. The liquid was pooling on the floor under my chair. A janitor came in to mop, but took one look and left immediately. Finally, a younger doctor came in with Doctor Lewis. She introduced herself as Doctor Pat. Two more doctors followed behind her, and a group of medical students crowded in the doorway. May I examine you? She asked. The moment she pressed on my chest, the white liquid shot out and hit her right in the face. She immediately turned and threw up in the sink. Caroline ran to the corner and threw up in the trash can. One of the medical students fainted. The smell of vomit mixed with the sweet smell from my chest made me want to puke, too, but I held it down. We need X rays immediately, Doctor Lewis said, wiping sweat from his forehead. They rushed me to radiology in a wheelchair because I was getting dizzy. The tech took multiple X rays from different angles, then told me to wait. I Sat there in that cold room for 30 minutes with liquid still leaking all over the X ray table. Doctor Lewis came back holding the films. He held them up to the light and started laughing. Not a small chuckle, but actual de belly laughing. He called two nurses over and showed them. They started giggling, too. Then Caroline came in, and even she let out a nervous laugh when she saw the X ray. What is it? I begged. What's wrong with me? Doctor Lewis finally caught his breath. You need surgery right now. You came just in time, or this could have killed you. They prepped me for emergency surgery, and I went under, not knowing what they were going to find inside me. When I woke up three hours later, my chest was wrapped in bandages and everything was sore. Doctor Lewis walked in holding something with tweezers. It was a long, thin needle, about three inches long. Five years ago, did you get acupuncture done? He asked. My mind raced back. Yeah, I gotten it for back pain from this sketchy place that closed down a month later. This needle went through your back and travel through your body. It lodged between your lung and chest wall. Your body created a cyst around it that finally ruptured. That wasn't milk coming out. It was pus. Caroline kissed my forehead and told me, it's okay. I'm into guys who breastfeed.

She said it absolutely mattered because no one had the right to tell me without her permission. I told her I deserved to know why I got treated like a house plant my whole life. That's when Drake said the quiet part out loud. He told me I was never his. He never loved me. And when I turn 18, he wants me gone because he wants at least one year with just his real family before my youngest brother graduates. My mom didn't even defend me. She just kept asking, who told me? She's asked me every single day since. Sometimes five or six times. She tried to ground me until I told her. She took my phone for a week. She said whoever told me was a bad person for going behind her back and that I was protecting someone who didn't care about me. But here's the thing. My Aunt Jenna does care about me. She's the one who came to my recitals when no one else did. She bought me my first pair of pointe shoes. She. He's the one who actually treated me like I mattered. My mom also let it slip that I don't have a college fund. My siblings all have accounts with thousands saved up. I have nothing because Drake never considered me his responsibility. I told my school counselor everything. And she helped me look into what happens when I turn eighteen. Apparently, Drake can legally kick me out, and there's nothing I can do about it.

Last summer, my parents decided we needed a technology free family bonding road trip to Yellowstone. They announced this plan at dinner, looking way too proud of themselves. No phones, no tablets, no Nintendo Switch. I declared we're going to reconnect as a family and appreciate nature. My 16 year old sister Denki and I just stared at them in horror. A week long road trip with no electronics. They might as well have suggested we travel by covered wagon. But what if there's an emergency, Denki asked, already plotting. We'll have our phones for emergencies only, mom said, but they'll be locked in the glove compartment. The night before we left, Denki and I held an emergency sibling meeting. We were not going down without a fight. Operation Digital Rebellion is a go, she whispered, pulling out a duffle bag full of contraband electronics. We spent hours hiding devices throughout our luggage. Denky sewn a secret pocket into her pillow for her phone. I hollowed out a thick book and stuffed my Nintendo Switch inside. We even hit a portable charger inside a bag of trail mix. Day one started with Dad's enthusiastic announcement. Isn't this great, kids? Look at all this beautiful scenery. Let's play the license plate game. Wow, dad, a Nebraska plate. Riveting, Denky deadpanned while secretly texting her boyfriend through her pillow. By hour 3, mom was getting suspicious. Just because we were being Unusually cooperative about her car games, little did she know I was playing Pokemon under a blanket while pretending to nap. You kids seem awfully quiet back there, she said, turning around, just enjoying the family bonding, mom, I said, quickly, shoving my switch under my fake book. Denki had gotten creative with her rebellion. She downloaded audio books and was listening through earbuds she threaded through her hoodie strings. Every time mom asked her a question, she'd pretend to be deep in thought about nature. By Day 2, we'd established an elaborate system. Denky would be the lookout while I gamed. Then we'd switch. We communicated through coughs and sneezes. That meant parents incoming or coast is clear. The funniest part was when dad.

M, this dude would march out of his house like he was reporting for duty. Here's the weird part. He'd fire up this ancient red lawn mower and start mowing his driveway. Not his lawn, his perfectly paved concrete driveway. I'm talking full commitment here, safety goggles, thick gloves, the works. He'd push that mower up and down the driveway for 30 minutes straight, making perfect rows like he was cutting actual grass. Sometimes he'd even stop to check his work, wiping sweat off his forehead. The first week I figured maybe he was just cleaning the driveway, you know, using the mower to blow leaves or something. But there were never any leaves. Just Walter mowing concrete like his life depended on it. By week 3, I was convinced my neighbor had completely lost it. The sound woke me up every morning. That old mower sounded like a dying motorcycle. I'd peek through my curtains and There he was in full uniform mowing absolutely nothing. My girlfriend Emma thought it was hilarious. She'd make coffee and watch him through the kitchen window like it was morning entertainment. But I was getting annoyed. Who mows concrete at 6 a. M? Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. One Saturday morning, I threw on some clothes and walked over while he was mid mow. Up close, I could see he was completely focused. He was working on the most important lawn in America. Hey there, I called out over the engine noise. Walter looked up, turned off the mower and smiled like we were old buddies. Morning, neighbor. Beautiful day for yard work, isn't it? I looked around his completely grassless property. Uh, sure. Mind if I ask what you're doing? His expression got serious. He leaned in closer and whispered, keeps them away. Keeps who away? Walter just nodded knowingly and fired the mower back up. He went back to his concrete cutting like I wasn't even there. I stood there for.

Now you can be as worried as the workers are. I work at target, and last Tuesday, this mom came in with her twin boys, who were maybe 7 or 8 years old. The second they walked through the doors, these kids took off running like they were training for the Olympics. Mom just stood there scrolling through her phone like nothing was happening, while her kids were literally climbing the shelves in the toy section. I walked over and politely asked if she could keep an eye on them because we've had kids get hurt before. She rolled her eyes at me and said, they're just being kids. Maybe if you had children, you'd understand. Then she went back to her phone. Twenty minutes later, one of the boys knocked over an entire display of glass picture frames. The crash was so loud that half the store turned to look. When I came over to clean it up, the mom finally looked up from her phone and said, well, why would you put glass so low where kids can reach it? That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. I'm standing there with a broom, sweating, trying to clean up broken glass, while her other kid is now in the electronic section pressing every button on the display phones. A manager came over and asked the woman to please control her children or they'd have to leave. That's when she started yelling About discrimination and how we were targeting her family. She demanded to speak to corporate and threatened to leave bad reviews everywhere. Meanwhile, her kids had moved on to the clothing section and were pulling hangers off the racks. But here's where it gets good. While she's having her meltdown, screaming at my manager about customer service, her kids wandered into the grocery section. One of them grabbed a carton of eggs and started juggling them. You can guess what happened next. Eggs everywhere. On the floor, on the shelves, even on other customers. The smell was horrible, and we had to shut down that entire aisle to clean it up. The mom finally noticed when another customer started yelling at her kids. He stormed over to where the mess was and immediately started blaming us again. Why do you have eggs where children can reach them? This is completely irresponsible. But my manager had already called security. When the security guard showed up, he told her she needed to pay for the damages and leave immediately. The mom started recording on her phone, saying we were harassing her and her children. She kept saying, this is going viral. You'll all be fired. But then one of the other customers who had been watching this whole thing spoke up.

What? I looked up from my phone where I've been scrolling TikTok for the past hour. Her face was completely white, hands trembling like crazy. The police scanner, your name. They just said your full name on the emergency channel. Mom, that's impossible. I've been in my room all day doing absolutely nothing. She grabbed my shoulders hard enough to hurt Riley Jade Thompson. That's exactly what they said word for word. What did you do? Nothing. I swear to god. Nothing. My dad came running up the stairs two at a time, also holding his phone with this scanner appled up. The neighbors are texting. The Hendersons heard it. The Chens heard it. Multiple people heard your name. Clear as day now. I was actually terrified. My heart was pounding. I didn't do anything. I've been here since Nathan dropped me off from school. Mom started pacing back and forth, pulling at her hair, nearly hyperventilating. They said attempted robbery at the CVS pharmacy on Fifth Street. They have someone in custody right now. What? I've never even been to that pharmacy in my entire life. Dad stop dead in the doorway and looked at me with this expression I've never seen before, like he genuinely didn't know whether to believe his own daughter. Where exactly were you this afternoon? I need you to be very, very specific here. Right here. Ask Nathan. He drove me straight home from school at 2:30 and I came right upstairs to do homework. Mom pulled up something on her phone and I literally watched all the color drain from her face in real time. There's a girl in custody. Your age, your exact description? Brown hair, 5 4, 120 pounds, wearing a blue hoodie. I looked down at my blue hoodie and felt my stomach drop. That's when my brother Nathan walked in, eating a sandwich, completely oblivious to the chaos. Yo, what's with all the cop cars at the pharmacy down the street? There's like six of them. We all turned to stare at him. What he said? Looking between our faces with his mouth full. Why are you all looking at me like that? What did I do? I grabbed him by the arm so hard the sandwich fell on the floor. Did you see who got arrested? Yeah, some girl in handcuffs. She looked like he stopped mid sentence and his eyes went absolutely huge. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

Your place is on the floor, he sneered. Guests laughed until the groom's father looked at me and said, sir, is that you? And the room went silent. I've always been the simple man in Tara's life. After her mother, Erica died when Tara was just 12, I raised her alone, working double shifts at the garage. Oil cake under my fingernails but soaking my back. Every paycheck went to keeping her world steady while mine fell apart. Piano lessons, school clothes, college tuition paid in overtime hours and weekend shifts. Jasper was everything I wasn't. Wall Street portfolio manager, tailored suits, manicured hands that had never held a wrench or known honest work. When he proposed to my daughter after six months of dating, I bit my tongue and forced a smile. She was happy, and that's what mattered to me. But the dinner changed everything. He'd invited us to some fancy Manhattan restaurant with golden forks and crystal glasses that cost more than my monthly mortgage. The waiter treated us like royalty until he saw my calloused hands. When the check came, Jasper slid it across to me with a calculated smirk. Tradition, the bride's father pays, he said with clear satisfaction, $347, more than a week's groceries. I paid it with trembling hands, watching him lean back like he won some twisted game. My credit card barely cleared. Your daughter appreciates seeing how Well, her two favorite men get along, he said, knowing damn well what he'd done, testing me, breaking me down piece by piece in front of my own child. The wedding day arrived. I wore my navy suit, the same one from her graduation, pressed carefully that morning in my small Brooklyn apartment. At the reception, I stood to move my chair. When Jasper yanked it away, my body hit the polished marble floor with a crack that silenced the music. Oops, said loudly. Looks like someone's unsteady age catches us all. Eventually, laughter rippled through the crowd of his wealthy friends. Maybe you're more comfortable closer to the ground. That's where you belong. I stayed down longer than I needed to let them all see what humiliation looked like. When I finally rose, Tara was beside me, tears in her eyes, looking at her new husband like she was seeing a complete stranger. But before I could speak, the sound of heavy boots echoed through the hall, not polished dress shoes, but worn combat boots, crossing the marble with military precision.

She waited in the rain for five hours while my mother yelled, you and your dad don't live here anymore! When my daughter told me, I didn't shout. I just said understood. Three days later, my mother called me with her lawyer, screaming and panicking. My 11 year old daughter came home soaking wet, shivering, her backpack dripping water all over my apartment floor. My key didn't work, she said quietly, grandma changed the locks. My blood ran cold. How long were you out there? Five hours. She looked out the window and yelled that we don't live there anymore. She said, you're a deadbeat and I should go find you. My daughter had stood in the rain for five hours at the house I've been paying the mortgage on for fifteen years. The house my mother lived in rent free. The house that was in my name. Did anyone help you? I asked, wrapping her in towels. Mrs. Chen, next door finally saw me and let me use her phone. She gave money for the bus. I didn't shout, I didn't cry, I didn't break things. I just said understood. My daughter looked confused by how calm I was. She didn't understand that fury, this cold, doesn't explode that word. It calculates. I made her hot chocolate and ordered pizza, tucked her into bed early, told her everything would be okay. Then I went to my filing cabinet. See, my mother didn't know something important. The house was in my name because I bought it for her after my father died. She begged me. Said she couldn't afford rent anywhere. I paid the down payment, paid the mortgage every month for 15 years. Pay the property taxes, paid for repairs. She'd contributed nothing. She lived there free because I was her son. And she just locked my child out in the rain. I called my lawyer first thing the next morning. I need someone evicted. How fast can we do this? If you own the property and they're not on the lease, pretty fast. 30 days usually make it faster. She endangered my child. I want her out in two weeks. I'll file an emergency eviction today. Next, I called a locksmith. Had him meet me at the house while my mother was at her book club. Changed every lock. Every single one. Then I went inside and started packing her things into boxes. I wasn't cruel about it. I just packed efficiently. I left her clothes, her photos, her important documents, all neatly boxed in the living room. But I took back everything I bought. The TV, the furniture, the kitchen appliances. All of it had been purchased with my money over the years. I left her with exactly what she brought into this house fifteen years ago. Almost nothing. I put a formal eviction notice on the door along with my lawyer's contact

I always make capacity for her, no matter what. That same night, my mom calls me in a panic. Your papa tried to drive to work just now. He retired 10 years ago. What are we going to do? I drive over to my parents house to help my mom hide the car keys. While I'm there, he comes up to me, why isn't my lunch packed yet? I'm going to be late for work. I'm exhausted and terrified.

Then I highlight every time I texted her needing support and she flakes every time. I post it all with the caption for context. She deletes her vague post within 10 minutes and calls me screaming you violated my privacy. I remind her she publicly accused me first. She goes silent and then tells me you're a terrible friend and hangs up. She sends a long apology text that's mostly explaining why she couldn't be there for me. I don't respond.

Vanessa's face went red. That's not. You wanted to keep your daughter as an option, something to maybe default back to. He interrupted her. Vanessa's lawyer was holding his head in his hands. That's not only unfair and cruel to my client, it's also unfair and cruel to the child, my lawyer continued. Vanessa got a manic look in her eye. She's my baby, she pointed her finger at me. You were just supposed to carry her. You can't steal her from me. The judge held up his hand. So you wanted to abandon your parental responsibilities but retain parental control? Vanessa stammered. I, wait, that's not. I just needed more time to prepare. The judge looked down at the papers in front of him. The adoption is legal and binding. Case dismissed. He struck his gavel. Vanessa stood there frozen, staring at me with pure hatred. Then she stormed out without saying a word. I thought it was over until two days later, the adoptive parents called me. Vanessa had found their address and tried to break in, in the middle of the night to steal the baby back. She. Failed. Now she's arrested, facing five years in prison. I might show up to her trial with a bag of popcorn.

You want $50,000 and you're using family guilt to get it. That's what this whole thing has been about. Breaking up my marriage so I'd be desperate enough to give you whatever you wanted. His silence confirmed everything. Marcus had done his homework. Trevor's business was failed. Hannah had $30,000 in credit card debt. Mom was behind on her mortgage. We documented everything. Trevor's business irregularities, Hannah's hidden assets, Mom's refinancing issues. Sunday, I invited them to Mom's house. You tried to destroy my marriage to make me desperate for money. I told them, here's what happens. You leave us alone, or Marcus files complaints with regulatory boards, credit company, and the court. Trevor went pale. Hannah froze. Mom sank into the couch. You're blackmailing us, Trevor said. I'm setting boundaries. You wanted hardball. I sent the documentation to all three phones. You can be distant but civil, or we can be enemies. You decide. Six weeks later, Mom's in the hospital. Heart attack. At the hospital, Trevor blamed the stress on me. The best thing for her recovery is everyone respecting boundaries, I replied. When mom woke, she apologized. I was scared of losing you. I tried to control things and made everything worse. I don't know if I can forgive you. Yet, I said, right now, I'm still angry. Three months later, we hosted Thanksgiving. They came with wine and apologies. Ever admitted I should have asked for advice instead of money? Hannah confessed. I was jealous. I wanted to believe your life wasn't as good as it looked. Mom said I couldn't accept that. You're an adult with a separate life. Hannah stopped by weeks later. What I did was beyond wrong. Maybe we could try being sisters again. The kind who are careful but still care. Maybe. But it'll take time. The revenge we took wasn't flashy. We. We refused to be victims and protected what we built. Trust rebuilt slowly. Some wounds healed, some left scars. We were happy because we chosen each other and defended that choice when threatened. The greatest revenge is refusing to let other people's desperation become your emergency.

Planned activities he bailed to smoke with friends. Meanwhile, he verbally abuses me, uses racial slurs. He calls jokes and orders me around like a servant. To get me McDonald's, he'll demand then clap his hands. His father laughs, thinks it's hilarious. The physical stuff started small, slapping my butt, flicking my temple. His father calls it rebellious teenager behaviour. Last week at dinner, stepson mentioned getting in trouble for b s reasons, bullying a poor kid at school. I just make jokes about his clothes. Not my fault. He's broke and sensitive. His father backed him up. Schools are too sensitive. Kids need to toughen up. I snapped. Ironic when your kid is the most spoiled brat I've ever met. Stepson flipped his chair and stormed out. Husband and I fought all night. I was ready for divorce. Then the next day happened. I'm severely allergic to lavender.

I pretended I was sick and didn't go. I remember lying in bed that night hearing music from the dance a few blocks away, wondering if I'd ever feel normal. I kept thinking about all the girls there in their dresses dancing, being regular teenagers. And I was home alone because my body was treated like a punch line. That's when something in me just broke. I stopped talking in class, started eating lunch in the bathroom. I was so ashamed of my body that I couldn't make eye contact with people anymore. My grades tanked. I developed actual panic attacks before school. Some mornings I'd throw up from anxiety. I'd stand at the front door, backpack on, physically unable to make myself leave the house. My parents finally took me to a therapist when I was 16 because I'd barely left my room in weeks. The therapist gently explained to my mom that her rule was causing serious harm. My mom cried. She genuinely had no idea how bad it had gotten. She finally let me shave a week before my 18th birthday. And you know what the worst part is? The hair grew back exactly the same. Not thicker, not darker, exactly the same. All those years of bullying and isolation for nothing. I'm 24 now. I'm still in therapy, working through the social anxiety. I struggle with relationships. Because I'm constantly convinced people are secretly making fun of me. My therapist says I have body dysmorphia. My mom apologizes every few months. She says she was just trying to protect me. The she didn't understand. I know she meant well, but good intentions don't erase 6 years of trauma. The kicker, she showed me that magazine article recently. Turns out it never even said shaving makes hair thicker. She completely misread it. She destroyed my teenage years over a myth she made up in her own head. So yeah, that beauty rule backfired just a little bit.

My sister in law, Bridget, couldn't have children. And when I got pregnant, she lost her mind. She'd been trying for seven years, while I got pregnant three months after getting married to her brother. She pretended to be supportive, but I could see the hatred in her eyes every time she looked at my belly. Some people get everything so easily, she'd say to anyone who'd listen. Must be nice to not even have to try. When my daughter Lily was born, Bridget immediately declared her felt the most important aunt. I'm going to be her second mother, she announced at the hospital. Since I can't have my own, I'll pour all my love into this baby. Everyone thought it was sweet. I thought it was creepy. She started coming over every single day. She'd snatch Lily out of my arms the second she arrived. Mommy needs a break, she'd say, even when I just woken up from a full night sleep. When I try to take my baby back, she'd hold on tighter. Don't be selfish. Lily needs to bond with her aunt, too. Then the accident started. First, she gave Lily water when she was only three weeks. So I caught her with a bottle of water at Lily's Lips. Babies get thirsty, too, she said when I screamed. When I explained that water could kill a Newborn, she rolled her eyes. That's just paranoid internet Nonsense. Babies in my generation drank water and survived. Next, she put the blankets and stuffed animals in Lily's crib during her nap. I found my baby's face pressed against a teddy bear, barely able to breathe. Bridget said she was just trying to make the crib cozy. You keep her in that cold, empty box like she's in prison. When I showed her the safe sleep guidelines, she said modern mothers were too anxious about everything. She'd leave Lily on the changing table and walk away to get things. She'd put bottles in Lily's mouth and leave her alone to feed. She'd put Lily in her car seat, but not buckle the straps properly. Every time I caught her, she'd say I was overreacting. I've babysat dozens of kids. I know what I'm doing. My husband Keith didn't see the pattern. She's trying to help. She's just not up to date on current safety stuff. Be patient with her. His parents said the same thing. Bridget loves that baby. She'd never hurt her. You're being a paranoid new mother. The breaking point came when Lily was 2 months old. I had to use the bathroom and left Lily with Bridget for literally three minutes. When I came back, Bridget was feeding Lily honey from a spoon. Actual honey to a two month old baby. It's good for her immune system, Bridget said as I knocked the spoon away. Plus it'll help her sleep better. I rushed Lily to the Emergency room

Day one without cigarettes, and I discovered my body had been keeping a hit list. 23 years of smoking. That's 8,395 days, 335,800 cigarettes. At seven minutes per cigarette, I'd literally spent 4.5 years of my life with death between my lips. The breaking point wasn't poetic. My six year old son, Lucas had drawn our family for school. Mom was a flower, sister was a butterfly. Dad was a skeleton holding fire sticks. Why am I dead? I asked. You're not dead yet. He said, matter of factly. But missus Johnson says cigarettes make people into skeletons. So I drew your future. I quit that second. No ceremony. Just dropped my pack in his crayon box and walked away. My brain didn't realize what happened for exactly 47 minutes. Then it began. Hour three. My hands shook so violently, I couldn't sign my name at the bank. The teller asked if I needed medical attention. Hour 8. The headache felt like someone was injecting molten lead behind my eyes. I vomited twice in the office bathroom. My boss found me on the floor. Food poisoning. I lied through chattering teeth. That night, I didn't sleep. I counted every single second. 28,800 of them. At 3:47 a m, I found myself in my car, engine running outside a 24 hour gas station, just sitting there, crying. A homeless man knocked on my window. Whatever demon you're fighting, brother, sitting here won't Kill it. He was smoking. The smell made me sob harder. Day two, the rage was prehistoric. I punched a hole through my bathroom door because the toothpaste cap was on wrong. Lucas saw. His eyes went wide.

The entire table freezes. Dad's hand stops halfway to his fork. His jaw clenches. Then he just gets up and leaves. Doesn't say a word, just walks out to the garage. Mom starts crying, actually crying at Thanksgiving dinner. My boyfriend is mortified, apologizing profusely. I'm pissed at him but also confused by Mom's reaction. It's just the stupid cap rule. Why is she sobbing? My sister pulls me aside later. You really don't get it, do you? Turns out dad wasn't decompressing. The red cap days were when he was actively fighting the urge to hit us. Yeah, the fucking red cap was his I wanna beat my family warning system. He'd started wearing it after he gave my mom a black eye when I was three to anger management and the therapist suggested a visual cue to let the family know when he was in a dangerous headspace. The cap was supposed to be temporary while he worked through his issues. Instead, it became our normal for 23 years. My sister knew because she'd walked in on mom putting makeup over bruises once. Mom begged her not to tell me because I was too sensitive and she wanted to protect me from the truth. So while I thought we were respecting dad as need for quiet after a hard day, we were actually tiptoeing around a ticking time bomb. Every Red Cap day was a day he wanted to Hurt us but was barely holding back the really fucked up part. I called mom last week and heard dad in the background, asked how he was doing. Oh, he's having a red cap day, honey. I'll have him call you tomorrow. 23 years of therapy and anger management and the man still needs a fucking hat to remind him not to beat his family. But hey, at least I grew up thinking it was just a quirky dad rule. That's something, right?

So I returned her energy. My best friend and I have been tight for over 10 years. She's the kind of person who has a crisis every single week. And I mean that literally. If a guy doesn't text back after one day, she's calling me sobbing at 2:00am saying she'll die alone if she sees her ex's new girlfriend's Instagram story. Suddenly it's a full emergency requiring me to drop everything and Facetime for the next two hours. She called at midnight, during my lunch breaks, even during my work presentations and I always answer because that's what best friends do. Spend hundreds of hours talking her down from spirals only for them to resolve by themselves by the next day. But here's the thing, I'm just realising after eight years when I need support for anything serious, my best friend is suddenly too overwhelmed to handle other people's stuff. There's always a reason she can't show up. Then my dad gets diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's. I'm devastated and text my best friend about it and she responds within two minutes saying, Omg, that's so hard. I'm here for you, babe, whatever you need. So I try to call her that night because I'm sitting in my car outside my parents house crying and I can't go back inside just yet. She declines the call and text back, can we talk tomorrow? Rough day. Okay, fine. I get it. Everyone has rough days. Tomorrow comes and first thing that morning, she texts me about her tinder match who didn't text back and how she's spiraling about dying alone. I try to bring up my dad and ask if she can call. About an hour later, she finally calls and as, yeah, the whole thing with your dad sounds tough anyway, and then talks about her date for the next 45 minutes. This goes on for weeks where every single conversation starts with me trying to talk about what I'm going through. And within five minutes, it's about her again, her job, her dating life, her family being annoying. I'm starting to feel insane, like maybe I'm being selfish for wanting to talk about my dad's brain literally deteriorating. So I text her one night and say, hey, I'm really struggling and need my friend there for me to talk about my dad.

You barely talk to anyone. You sat there like a zombie. Do you know how that makes me look? Jordan's quiet response. I'm sorry. Sorry isn't good enough. When we get home, we're having a serious conversation. And your phone? I saw you deleted texts. Those were from my boss. I'll decide what's work stuff. Hand it over. Claire, it's midnight now. Silence and Jordan's defeated voice. Here. I heard a slap. Not hard, but distinct. Then Claire's voice. Saccharine. Sweet. Good boy. It's easier when you just listen. I pushed open the door. They both jumped. Claire's expression shifted to pleasant surprise. Alex, what are you doing up? Jordan's face was red on one side. Fresh. Did you just hit him? What? No. Jordan, tell him. Jordan looked at the floor. It's fine, Alex. It's not fine. I heard everything. Claire's eyes went cold. You were eavesdropping. You hit my brother. Jordan, tell your brother you're fine. Jordan's mouth opened, but nothing came out. Jordan, when you called me Alexander at dinner, what were you trying to tell me? His eyes met mine, filled with tears. That I needed help but couldn't say it. Why couldn't you? Because she's always listening, always watching. She has to approve everything I say, everyone I Talk to. I can't even text you without her reading it first. Claire laughed, forced. He's being dramatic. We're just a normal couple. Normal couples don't track each other's every move, don't isolate their partner from everyone. My parents'bedroom door open. They appeared in robes. What's happening? Mom asked. Claire's mask returned. Alex is making wild accusations. Jordan, tell them everything's fine. Jordan looked at her, at me, then at our parents. I can't marry her, he said quietly. What? Mom stepped closer. She asked me to propose at New Year's, pick out the ring herself. But I can't. I need to leave her. But I don't know how. Claire's face transformed, all pretense gone. You ungrateful piece of. Claire, I think you should leave now. My dad's voice cut through. He's lying. He's making me sound like a monster. No, Jordan said, voice stronger. I'm finally telling the truth. My parents drove Claire to a hotel that at night. And Jordan stayed with us for two months, relearning how to make decisions without asking permission. And the day he called me Alex again without thinking, was the day we both knew he'd finally come home.

I'll come with you. Three weeks before opening night, I forgot her water bottle backstage. I went back and heard her voice from the dressing room. I'm exhausted, she said. This whole supportive girlfriend act is killing me, her friend laughed. Is it worth it, though? Obviously, I've gotten so good at this relationship stuff, my practice boyfriend actually thinks I love him. You're evil, her friend laughed. When are you dropping him? After I get the guy I actually want opening night, I'll tell him how I feel. I've been perfect girlfriend material for two months. He has to notice. But what about the tech loser? Please. He was just convenient. I knew he was obsessed with me. It was perfect. I nearly died. Practice boyfriend, what a b. I left her water bottle on the floor and walked out. I stopped inviting her to rehearsals. It's just boring tech stuff, I say. She'd pout but didn't push it. She didn't actually care. Meanwhile, chase and I got closer without her hovering. We'd grab food after rehearsals, play online together and become actual friends. Opening night arrived. Romeo and Juliet was sold out. I was running lights from the booth when Yuna walked in wearing this stunning dress. But he wasn't looking at me. Her eyes were locked on chase in his Romeo costume. The man she really wanted was chase. Then I saw 15, maybe 20 girls, all Dressed up, all staring at chase the exact same way. Janira was just another face in the crowd of girls who thought they were special. She caught me looking and waved. That. A girlfriend's smile plastered on. Chase was stretching backstage, completely oblivious to his fan club. Yunira pushed to the front, adjusting her dress, ready for her big moment. After the show ended, chase got swarmed. 20 girls circled him. Yunira, front and center. Chase, you were amazing, she gushed, touching his arm. That balcony scene was for me, wasn't it? Chase stepped back, confused. Nira, aren't you dating my friend? He looked at me. Your girlfriend's being weird, man. I looked at you, Nira. We're not dating anymore. I said loudly. I heard you three weeks ago. Practice boyfriend tech loser. How you use me to get with chase. The crowd went silent. Chase's face darkened. You were using him to get to me. I, chase. I just, that's messed up, bro. He looked at all the girls. Actually, this whole thing is weird. None of you know me. I'm just a thief hitter kid who likes Fortnite. This obsession thing, it's uncomfortable. Yuna stood there exposed. Chase grabbed my arm outside. Hey, she never had a chance to get with me because the only person I'm in love with is you.

Now he hasn't initiated anything for six months, and I'm the bad guy? At first, I felt relieved. No more getting groped while doing dishes. No more feeling his excitement every time we hugged. Finally, I could just exist without everything being sexual. But by week two, something felt wrong. Austin walked past me in the kitchen and just said, excuse me instead of his usual waist squeeze. We felt like roommates. When I brought it up, he was devastatingly logical. You said my physical responses were disgusting. I don't want to make you uncomfortable again. I tried explaining that wasn't what I meant, but he just shrugged. It happens naturally when I'm close to you. Since I can't control it, I'm avoiding situations where it might happen. The worst part? He sounded so reasonable, like he genuinely thought this through and decided this was the only solution to my complaint. So you're punishing me forever? I asked after he declined movie cuddles again. I'm not punishing you, he said without looking at me. I'm respecting your boundaries. Three months in, I was going insane. I missed feeling desired. I'd dress up, hoping for compliments, but he'd just say I looked nice. In the same tone, he'd comment on whether the irony hit me hard. I'd complained about feeling sexualized, and now I felt completely desexualized. I started testing him. Wore his favorite red dress to dinner, walked around in just his teeth. After Showers. Even accidentally brushed against him while reaching for things. Nothing. It was like touching a polite stranger who was trying to be accommodating. Our friends started noticing, too. At Sarah's birthday party, Austin barely put his arm around me for photos. Before, he couldn't keep his hands off me at social events. Now he stood next to me like we were co workers posing for a company picture. You two okay? Sarah asked when Austin went to get drinks. You see, I'm distant lately. I wanted to scream. How do you explain that you broke your husband's desire for you and now desperately want it back? That you'd become the architect of your own romantic destruction? Month four brought new torture. Often started working out more, coming home all muscled and sweaty from the gym. Before, he'd have shown off, flexed a little, used any excuse to get me worked up. Now he just showered quietly and went to bed early. I caught him on his phone more often, smiling at the screen. When I'd ask what was funny, he'd just say work stuff and put it away. Before, he used to show me every stupid meme, every funny video. We used to laugh together constantly about the dumbest things. The conversations became surface level pleasantries. How was your day? Fine. Yours? Good. Then silence while we ate dinner. Are like strangers sharing a table at a restaurant. I tried initiating intimacy myself, but Austin would respond just enough. To not completely reject me, then pull back before things could get heated. It was like he was keeping himself on a tight leash, and I hated every second of it. By month five, Austin went on a work trip. When he came back, something had shifted. Not just distant politeness, but something else. Like he'd figured something out. During those six days away. There was this settled quality to him, like he'd made peace with something I didn't understand. I tried welcoming him home the old way. Excited hugs, kisses, telling him how much I'd missed him. But he responded like I was a friend, being overly affectionate, polite, but visibly uncomfortable with the physical contact. That's when real panic set in. What if this was permanent? What if I'd actually broken something fundamental that couldn't be fixed? What if Austin had finally realised he was happier without all the drama I'd been putting him through? Two weeks later, I was folding laundry when I found a business card in his

Old ladies at the grocery store tell me I'm lucky to have snagged him. It's exhausting, but I love him. And he's genuinely oblivious to it all. He thinks people are just being nice. So when the company holiday party came around, I figured why not bring him? He'd been asking to see where I work, meet my team. We'd eat mediocre catering, make small talk and leave early. Simple.

Within a week, she was finding reasons to email him. Strategy questions that definitely didn't need her personal attention. LinkedIn connection requests. And came the client meeting invitations. Lunch meetings I wasn't included in despite working on the same accounts. She's just being professional, Aaron said when I brought it up, it's networking. I wanted to believe with him, but my co workers started noticing too. Angela, spending a lot of one on one time with your husband. My desk neighbor whispered one day, just be careful. The breaking point came Last Tuesday. Aaron left his laptop open while taking a shower. A notification popped up. Angela's name, Aaron, urgent. I know I shouldn't have looked, but I did.

I've tried to fry a Turkey inside and started a grease fire that destroyed half the kitchen. Two of the kids got burned badly enough to need emergency care, but nobody could find the insurance cards because I was always the one who kept track of that stuff. Donovan and Nico got into a fistfight over something stupid and Nico broke his hand on Donovan's face. My mother had a panic attack and locked herself in the bathroom for two hours while six children ran around a smoke filled apartment screaming. Vera's husband begged me to come help. I said they told me I was controlling. They said it would be a relief when I stepped back. Let them handle it. The next day my mother called me sobbing. She said, I'm sorry. I know I wasn't there when you were growing up. I know you raised them. I've always known and I let them believe otherwise because it was easier than admitting what I did to you. I said what you did was steal my childhood and then let them blame me for surviving it. Every single one of my siblings has apologized. I've accepted some of them, and I'm still thinking about the others. I will never be the family caretaker again.

Daddy, I collapsed. My wife Sarah held me while I shook like a child. We're getting you help, she whispered. Day three. Food tasted like punishment. Water felt like swallowing glass. I hallucinated cigarettes floating in my peripheral vision. Reached for them, grabbed air. My daughter asked why I kept catching invisible butterflies. Day five, I woke up thinking I'd smoked. Could taste it, smell it. Frantically checked my fingers for nicotine stains. Sarah found me scrubbing my hands raw at 4 a m. You didn't smoke, she promised. You're winning. Day 7, my sense of smell returned with vengeance. I could smell the cigarette smoke on my neighbor from inside my house. The stench embedded in my car made me wretch. I discovered my entire wardrobe reeked of death. Burned it all in the backyard. Lucas watched the Smoke Rise. The skeleton clothes are dying, he said solemnly. Day 14. Climb stairs without wheezing. Lucas noticed immediately. Daddy, you sound like a human now. Day 30, the craving still ambushed me, but weaker. Like echoes of screams instead of the screams themselves. I'd gained 12 pounds, but lost the gray death tint from my skin. Day 60. Found an emergency pack I'd hidden in the garage ceiling. Held it for 17 minutes. Then I let Lucas destroy them with his toy hammer. Each strike, he shouted, die, skeleton, die! We laughed until we cried. It's been one year now. The $4,100 I saved bought Lucas's first Piano and lessons. Yesterday he played his first complete song. Afterward, he hugged me and said, dad, you don't smell like the skeleton anymore. You smell like my dad. That's when I knew the skeleton was finally dead.

So my boyfriend Jake literally cannot let me finish a single sentence without correcting me, arguing with me, or explaining why I'm wrong. And yesterday I finally turned it around on him. This man would argue with me if I said the sky was blue, say actually, it's more of a cyan, and launch into a lecture about light wavelengths. I'd say I'm hungry. He'd say, no you're not. You just ate three hours ago. You're probably just thirsty. I'd say I liked a movie, he'd explain why it was actually terrible and I just didn't understand cinema. Every opinion, every feeling, every thought I had was apparently wrong and needed his correction. The most annoying part was he'd phrase it like he was helping me be smarter. He'd start with actually or well, technically or let me explain why that's not quite right. Like I was a toddler who needed basic concepts explained. Once said my head hurt and he goes it's probably not a headache. You're likely experiencing tension from poor posture. Like he was inside my skull feeling what I felt. He argued about the dumbest things too. I said I saw 12 birds on the wire outside and he made me go back and count them to prove they were only 11. I said the restaurant was about five minutes away and he pulled up Google Maps to show it was actually Seven minutes. I said my mom called me twice, and he checked my phone log to point out she called three times. I missed one. It was exhausting. I started not talking just to avoid the corrections. But even silence wasn't safe, because then he'd argue about why I was quiet, saying I was being passive aggressive or Moody. Really, I just didn't want to hear another lecture about why my thoughts were wrong. Last week, I tested him and said something completely factual, that the capital of France is Paris. And he goes, well, actually, it depends on what you mean by capital, because historically, there were different administrative regions. And went on for 10 minutes. He couldn't even let me have Paris. The breaking point was building for weeks. Every time he corrected me, I'd just say, okay, but I was keeping Track. 73 corrections in one week. 73 times he felt the need to explain why I was wrong about something, including my own feelings and experiences. I started writing them all down in my phone with time stamps and everything. Then yesterday, we're at his friend's birthday party.

My mother stood up at Thanksgiving and gave a toast about how she sacrificed everything to raise five children on her own. My siblings all raised their glasses. My brother Donovan looked at me and said, you could at least pretend to appreciate our mother for once. I looked around the table at my four siblings and wondered if any of them actually remembered our childhood. I was 11 years old when I became a mother to four children. My father left and my mother checked out completely. She'd stay in her bedroom for days at a time and I'd slide food under her door hoping she'd eat. I Learned to forge her signature in sixth grade because she wouldn't get out of bed to sign permission slips. I worked at a grocery store at 15 and lied about my age so I could buy food when her disability checks. I got a full scholarship to a college three hours away and turned it down because I couldn't leave my siblings alone with her. I missed my own prom because my youngest brother had pneumonia and no one else was going to take him to the emergency room. I raised four children before I turned 18 and none of them remember. They remember mom being sad. They remember mom being tired. They don't remember that I was the one who made sure they ate and bathed and got to School and had clean clothes. They don't remember me staying up until 2 in the morning helping with homework while mom slept in the next room. They don't remember me walking three miles to the pharmacy when Vera had an ear infection because mom wouldn't get out of bed and we didn't have a car. Now we're all adults and I'm still doing it. I coordinate every holiday and every birthday. I babysit all nine of their kids on a rotating.

My entire family still brings up the babysitting incident from when I was 15 like it happened yesterday. Three neighborhood kids managed to tie me to a dining room chair with jump ropes and lock me in a closet for two hours while they destroyed the house. The fire department had to come rescue me while the parents stood there horrified at what their angels had done. My older brother filmed the entire rescue on his phone, including the part where I was sobbing and begging to be let out. He still plays that video at every single family gathering. While everyone laughs until they cry. Nobody ever mentions that those kids were basically feral or that their parents apologized for weeks afterward. Twenty years later at my grandparents anniversary party and nothing had changed. I only show up to these rare family gatherings for my grandparents'sake, and I definitely don't share details about my personal life with these people anymore. My sister stood up during her toast, holding her wine glass high. Remember when we had to call 9 1 1 because 3 8 year olds outsmarted our baby sister? The whole whole banquet hall erupted in laughter. My aunts were wiping tears from their eyes. My uncle shouted from the back that I should never be allowed near children unsupervised. My mom leaned over and whispered that maybe I should stick to being the fun aunt who visits occasionally. Instead of thinking about having kids of my own someday, my dad nodded along and suggested I look into getting more cats since they can't tie anyone up. Even my cousin's new boyfriend, who I just met that night, was chuckling and shaking his head like he'd known me for years. I sat there staring at my untouched dinner plate while my brother pulled at his phone to show the video to anyone who hadn't seen it yet. The party continued with everyone sharing their favorite stories about my complete inability to handle children. My mom told everyone about the time I was twelve and accidentally let our neighbor's toddler wander into the backyard while I was reading a book. My aunt recounted how I was 13 and forgot I was supposed to be watching my baby cousin at a barbecue because I got distracted talking to friends. She made it sound like the child was abandoned for hours instead of the 30 seconds it took for his mom to scoop him up. My other sister jumped in with the story about how when I was 11, I tried to give her Newborn solid food because I didn't understand how babies worked. They were all laughing and toasting to my incompetence with kids while I sat there silently. My brother's wife turned to her husband and said loud enough for everyone to hear that they should thank god they never asked me to babysit their kids. Can you imagine the Disaster! If we'd actually trusted her with them, she laughed. The worst part was when my mom stood up and announced the entire room that at least I had whatever job I was doing now to focus on instead of family, since motherhood clearly wasn't in my skill set. Some people just aren't meant to have children. And that's perfectly fine, she said while patting my shoulder condescendingly, like she actually knew anything about my life. The entire entire room murmured in agreement, while I stared at the tablecloth, wishing I could disappear. That's when the banquet hall doors burst open. Five children walked in wearing matching navy blazers and khaki pants. Moving in perfect form, they stopped directly in front of our family's table. The oldest, who looked about 14, stepped forward and approached me. Mother, we apologize for being seven minutes late, but traffic from the academic to Kathleen was severe. The entire room went dead silent. Every single relative turned to stare at me. My brother's phone slipped from his hand and clattered on the floor.

We made a Spotify code for danger. I just got the notification. She hasn't needed it in 11 years. When my best friend and I were 16, we both ended up dating guys who were bad news. Mine was emotionally abusive, hers got physical. We created a code because our boyfriends would check our phones, so texting for help wasn't safe. We made a Spotify playlist with the most sarcastic title we could think of. Songs for when you're definitely fine and not at all in danger. The rule was simple. If you got a notification that the playlist was shared to you, something was wrong. Check the newest songs for clues. We used it to get each other out by the time we turned 18. That was 11 years ago. We're 29 now. Haven't needed the playlist since. She got married three years ago to a pediatrician named Camden who volunteers at free clinics. Everyone adores him. She's 32 weeks pregnant with their first baby. I'm a social worker, still single, married to my work, and my phone lit up. Tuesday afternoon, Isla shared songs for when you're definitely fine and not at all in danger with you. My stomach dropped. I opened it immediately. Three new songs stared back at me. Trap by Colonel Abrams, added two days ago. Prisoner by the weekend, added four days ago. Hell by the Beatles, added a week ago. I texted her right away. Got your playlist. Share. You okay? Three Hours later, she responded, yes, just feeling nostalgic. Remember when we were dramatic teens? With a laughing emoji? But she added, those songs this week while 32 weeks pregnant. I called. No answer. Called again. This time she picked up, but her voice sounded careful, measured. Hey, can't really talk right now. Camden and I are about to watch a movie. It was two PM on a Tuesday. Is Camden home? I asked. Yep, right here. Say hi, Babe. Camden's voice came through in the background. Hi. Taking good care of our girl. But Camden works Tuesday afternoons. I visited him at the hospital before. He's always there on Tuesdays. I drove to their house. I still had a key from watering their plants last month. Camden's car sat in the driveway at 2 p m. On a Tuesday when he should be at the hospital. I knocked. She answered, looking surprised, almost panicked. Oh, I didn't know you were coming. Can I come in? She glanced behind her. Actually, not a great time. I'm really tired. Pregnancy stuff. Camden appeared behind her shoulder, smiling. Hey. Yeah, she needs to rest. Doctor's orders. We can do a visit another time. I thought you had work. His smile stayed fixed. Took a personal day. Wife needs me. Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I put gently. Can I talk to you? Just us, two minutes. Camden's voice got firmer. She's exhausted. Whatever you need to say. You can say in front of me. We don't have secrets. I saw it. Then, just for a second, fear flashed across her face before she smiled. I'm really tired. Can we catch up later? I got in my car but didn't leave. Park down the street.

It started with these juice boxes she spotted at the grocery store. They had cartoon animals on them and she begged me to buy a pack. I checked the label real quick while she wasn't looking and almost laughed. These things were packed with spinach, kale, beets and had like every vitamin a kid needs. Just tasted like regular fruit punch. I played it cool, told her we could get one pack, but she had to make them last. Can't be drinking sugary juice all day long. She nodded like she understood, but I knew better. This kid would slam three in an hour if I let her. Here's the thing about my stepdaughter. She's 9 and she came to live with us last year after CPS finally got involved with her mom's situation. Mom used to force feed her stuff as punishment or make her sit at the table for hours staring at cold food. So now she's weird about eating. If something looks too healthy or if I tell her it's good for her, she shuts down completely, won't even try it. The first few months were rough. She'd eat chicken nuggets, plain noodles and maybe some bread. That's it. Her doctor said she was low on basically everything, iron, vitamin d, all of it. But getting her to take those gummy vitamins, forget it. She said they tasted like medicine and Made her gag. So when I found these juice boxes, I saw my chance. I made a huge deal about limiting them, told her one per day, maybe be too, if she's really good. I even put them on the top shelf of the drink fridge in the garage so she'd think they were special. Within a week, I caught her sneaking out there during her iPad time. She grabbed two boxes and stuffed them in her hoodie pocket. I didn't say anything. Just went to the store the next day and bought six more packs at that top shelf, stocked like it was my job. She started getting smarter about it, too. She'd wait until I was doing laundry or on a work call. Sometimes she'd take one to school in her lunch box, even though I packed her a Capri Sun.

She narrated everything she did. She asked a thousand questions a day. Then one morning when she was six, just stopped. No warning, no explanation. She opened her mouth and nothing came out. Doctors called it selective mutism. Trauma induced, they said. But no one could figure out what trauma. Nothing bad had happened. Our parents didn't fight. No one died. She just went quiet and stayed that way for four years. The only thing that changed around that time was Uncle Bernard moving to California. He was my dad's best friend from college and practically lived at our house my whole childhood. We all assumed losing him was what made her go silent. It made sense. At the time, it made perfect sense. And my mom announced that Bernard was coming to stay with us for Christmas. First time in four years. That night, Sadie came into my room at 2:00am. She hadn't been in my room since before. She stopped talking. She stood by in my bed until I woke up. And then she spoke. He's coming back. Three words, barely a whisper. Her voice sounded like sandpaper. Like something that hadn't been used in years. Because it hadn't. I sat up so fast, I Almost knocked her over. Sadie, did you just talk? She was shaking. Not the cold kind. The scare. Third kind. Don't let him come back, please. Who? Bernard. She flinched at his name like I'd slapped her. That's when I knew. I spent the next morning trying to convince my parents to cancel Bernard's visit. I didn't tell them what Sadie said. I just said I had a bad feeling. My dad laughed. You've always been overprotective, I said. Sadie seemed upset about it. My mom shook her head. She probably just doesn't remember him. She was so young when he left. She locked herself in her room when you told us. She's 10. Everything is dramatic at 10. I tried a different approach. What if having him here is too much change for her? The therapist said routine is important. My dad's face hardened. Bernard is family. He's been looking forward to this for months. I'm not canceling on him because of a hunch.

He was in his mid forties and looked so happy when he said it, grinning ear to ear like he was about to propose or something. I reserved the table and figured I was about to serve some cute, romantic dinner. Thirty minutes later, he walked back in. But he wasn't with a woman. He was holding hands with a little girl who looked about seven. Did a double take because that was definitely not what I expected. Then I smiled to myself, oh, a daddy daughter date. That's actually really sweet, I thought. I brought them to their table and handed out menus. Can I start you off with some appetizers? The man smiled at the girl. Get whatever you want, sweetheart. The girl didn't say anything. She just pointed at the menu looking shy. I figured she was just quiet and took their order. When I came back to refill their water, I noticed something weird. The man had a notepad out on the table. He was writing things down. He'd ask the girl a question, and she'd write her answer on a separate piece of paper. Then he'd read it and write in his notepad. I made a mental note, that's kind of odd, but maybe she's just really shy. I brought their appetizers. A few minutes later, that's when I overheard his Questions, and my stomach dropped. Do you have any cousins? He asked. Tell me what your dad and uncles are like. The girl wrote something down and showed him. He nodded and wrote in his notepad. Those weren't normal daddy daughter questions. Those were questions you ask when you don't know someone, like you're interviewing them. Walked back to the kitchen and found my coworker Brian. Something's really wrong at table 12. What do you mean? He asked. That guy is asking his daughter questions like he doesn't even know her. Brian and I started watching from the server station. The questions got worse. What's your school's name? Do you walk home or does someone pick you up? The girl kept writing answers. She looked hopeful.

I met Kyle in kindergarten when I walked right up to him, kissed him on the cheek, and declared to everyone that he was my boyfriend. The best part was that he didn't deny it. He took my hand and LED me to the playground, where we played for the rest of recess. We were inseparable after that. In middle school, a lot of people thought we were dating, but I realized that my feelings for him were purely platonic. I loved him like a brother and nothing more. When we were in high school, I noticed little things, like him touching me more, or his lingering looks on my chest, or running his hand across my shoulders, or hugging me longer than a friend should. Many people started spreading rumors that we were finally dating. I didn't appreciate it. I tried stopping the rumors by telling my friends that we were just friends, but they just thought, especially one of my closest friends named Mandy, that our relationship was secret or I was in denial. Mandy was very vocal about how Kyle and I were dating, which I thought was weird because she always had a crush on him. I started distancing myself from him because of that. Then there was the last homecoming we had senior year, and Kyle threw a massive party at his house, inviting nearly the entire senior class while his parents were out of town. There was alcohol, Games and dancing. It was the party of the year. I didn't really have a choice but to go. My friends dragged me there. Kyle came over to me and started hanging out like normal, getting rid of all the drunken guys who tried to hit on me. It felt nice, like old times. We laughed and then he suddenly leaned in and kissed me. It wasn't a little peck either. It was a full on kiss. And everyone around us started oohing and ahhing and clapping. I pulled away immediately, eyes wide with shock and anger. He just stood up, laughed cruelly, and high fived one of his jock friends. I told you I could kiss her before the year was over! He announced loudly. You all bet against me! He laughed again and began taking cash from his football buddy. My friends were standing nearby and a few of them looked as shocked as me, but Mandy handed Kyle a wad of cash before planting a huge kiss on his lips. I couldn't believe this. I was just to bet. I left the party in tears, feeling like I was losing my best friend that night. On Monday, the teasing started. It started off small with just a few comments here and there, enough for me to ignore it. Then someone spray painted a dirty word across my locker. Then came the shoving in the hallway and the tripping in my classes. One of the teachers said a Word about it. And when I went to the principal, his response was to say that I needed to learn to stand up for myself. I went home crying every day that week. My friends stopped talking to me between classes. It didn't take long for Mandy to announce to everyone that she was dating Kyle, that I had missed my chance. Kyle ignored me at school and stopped coming to dinner at my house. My parents started asking me where Kyle was. I had to start making up excuses why I wasn't seen around my best friend anymore. Bullying at school got worse and worse, until finally, Mandy pranked me with a piece of pie in my face during lunch in the cafeteria. Something in me snapped at that moment. I stood calmly and turned to face the room of students, wiping off the pieces of pie onto my napkin. Mandy smirked at me, daring me to say something, so I climbed onto the table and looked her dead in the eyes.

We all stared at her. Someone finally said, uh, so do you want us to put the fries in the bag or. Miss Priya broke down completely. Please hide me. Help me. We had maybe two minutes.

We all scrambled back to our desks. Our regular teacher, Mrs. Kowalski walked in with Raj and an expect expensive suit and Miss Priya's father behind him. She clearly looked uncomfortable but didn't want to interfere with their culture. Raj looked around the room slowly. Where is Priya? We all shrugged. Someone shouted she went to the nurse. But Raj didn't believe us. He started walking between the desks. How old are you? Someone asked. 35, Atlas said loud enough for everyone to hear. Dude, that's ditty behavior. Were you and Epstein ever homies? A few kids snickered. Raj's face went red. Where is she? Have you checked the cafeteria? Another kid offered. She, he loves the pizza here. Someone else chimed in, maybe she just doesn't want to marry someone old enough to be her dad. Miss Priya's dad's face instantly dropped, probably because he was literally the same age as Raj. Either way, Raj was getting visibly angry. Now, Missus Kowalski stood by the door looking nervous, but said nothing. Raj kept moving through the classroom, getting closer to the supply closet. Kids kept asking dumb questions to distract him. Then Brandon, the teacher's pet who always followed every rule, suddenly blurted out, she's in the supply closet.

My younger sister, Ariana, turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. He posted about a restaurant. She coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent even, like sitting next to Kevin. At every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind, since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak. When I was out of town, she needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me immediately, showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused. And I agreed. Until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am, and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine shoot. I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs, and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh my God, Kevin, you're so muscular! She giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept holding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection.

A bunch of women commented that they've been wearing tank tops and sports bras in the garden for years without issues. Someone pointed out that Missus Fletcher's husband mows the lawn shirtless every Saturday. The comments turned against Missus Fletcher instead of me. She doubled down and made another post saying it's different for men and that I was setting a bad example. She said her son felt uncomfortable. That's when Brian's wife, Ashley commented and said maybe Missus Fletcher should teach her son not to stare at women's bodies instead of policing what women wear. Complex manager finally stepped in and posted that residents can wear whatever they want in their private patio spaces as long as it's not actual nudity. He said if people have issues, they should close their blinds. Missus Fletcher was furious. She commented that she was calling the H O. A board, except we don't have an H O A. We just have a property management company. Someone pointed this out and people started laughing at her in the comments. She deleted both her posts, but screenshots were already floating around in a different Facebook group for the neighborhood.

Her son didn't even glance my way. A few minutes later, Ashley from Unit 8 came over with her laptop and asked if she could work in my garden because her AC was broken. She was wearing a sports bra and shorts. We sat there for two hours talking and working. Three other women from the complex came by and joined us. One was wearing a tank top with no bra. Another was in a bikini top because she said she was about to go to the pool. It turned into this unplanned hangout. Mrs. Fletcher walked past again around five PM she stared at all of us and bright red and speed walked away. Nobody said anything to her. We just kept talking and laughing. The Facebook group went quiet after that. Mrs. Fletcher stopped posting entirely. I heard from another neighbor that she tried to start a petition about dress codes for common areas but only got two signatures.

When my birthday came three months later, we went to Olive Garden, just the four of us. Mom said it was because I told her I didn't want a big party, which was true, but only because I knew they wouldn't do one anyway. Kevin played football every Friday night. Dad would leave work early to make his games. They'd get home at 9, both of them buzzing with energy, replaying every touchdown. I did debate team. My competitions were on Saturdays. Mom came to two in four years. Dad came to zero. When I made it to state finals, I asked if they could come. Dad said he had to help Kevin move his stuff to his new dorm room. Kevin was moving in three weeks later. The thing is, they never said they loved Kevin more. They just showed it in a thousand tiny ways. Kevin's report cards went on the fridge with magnets. I got a quick look and a nice job before going in a drawer. When Kevin needed a new laptop for college, dad researched for weeks and bought him a 15 dollar one. When mine broke sophomore year, they gave me a refurbished one from Walmart that crashed every other Day. I kept a list in my phone, not to be weird, just to make sure I wasn't making it up. Kevin's graduation party. $200 on catering. Mine. Homemade sandwiches. Kevin forgot to do his chores. They do it for him. I forgot once. Grounded for a week. Kevin got a car at 17. I turned 17 last month. They got me a bus pass. Last Thursday was the breaking point. I got accepted into the summer program at a university three hours away. Full scholarship, only 30 students picked nationwide. I've been working on the application for months. When I told them at dinner, mom smiled and said, that's great, honey.

The hardest part wasn't the paperwork or the waiting. It was watching my daughter struggle to trust that we wouldn't abandon her like her previous foster families had done five times before. When we first met Emma, she was 7 years old and sitting in the corner of the visitation room, methodically lining up colourful rocks she'd pulled from her backpack. Social worker whispered that she carried those rocks everywhere, one from each home she'd been in. I sat down beside her, not too close, and asked about her collection. She didn't look up, just shifted slightly away. My husband stayed by the door, sensing she needed space. File said she'd been in the system since she was 3, bouncing between five different homes in four years. During our first month of visits, she barely spoke. She'd answer direct questions with one or two words but never volunteered information. The social worker told us this was progress with other potential families. She wouldn't speak at all the day we brought her home. She walked through the house with her backpack clutched to her chest. When we showed her bedroom, the one we'd spent weeks painting and decorating, she just nodded and asked, how long can I stay here? My heart cracked right open. That first night I found her sleeping on the floor beside her perfectly made bed. When I asked why, she whispered, easier to pack my stuff when it's Time to go. My husband and I cried in the hallway trying not to let her hear. Within two weeks, she'd established a routine. Every night she'd pack all her clothes and toys into her backpack ready to leave. Every morning, she'd unpack just enough for the day. She'd eat only what we put on her plate, never asking for seconds, even when she was still hungry. The first time I found her hiding food in her dresser drawers, I didn't say anything. I just started leaving healthy snacks in her room with notes saying extra if you get hungry. It took 3 months before she stopped hiding granola bars under her pillow. When my mom visited and tried to hug her, Emma completely shut down. She retreated to her room and stayed there for hours. Later, she asked if grandma was going to be her new mom. Now, it took so much explaining to help her understand that wasn't how families worked. Six months in, she got.

Mom actually had to sit down on my bed because her legs gave out. We need to call the police right now, right this second before this gets any worse. Wait, I said, because something just clicked in my brain like a light bulb. My backpack. Someone stole my entire backpack from my locker two days ago. I reported it to the school office. The room went completely silent. You could hear a pin drop. My wallet was in there. My student ID with my full name and photo was in that wallet. Dad was already dialing 911 with shaking fingers. Yes, hello. This is Gregory Thompson. I need to speak to whoever is handling the arrest at the CVS on Fifth Street immediately. You just arrested someone using my daughter's stolen identification and she's standing right here in front of me in our house. Nathan pulled up the local news site on his phone and turned it toward me with shaking hands. There was a booking photo of a girl who literally could have been my identical twin sister. Same face shape, same hair length, same hair color, same everything. How is this even possible, mom whispered, staring at the screen like she'd seen a ghost. The police officer on the phone must have said something because Dad's whole body visibly relaxed. His shoulders dropped and he let out this huge breath. Thank god. Yes. Yes. We'll come down to the station right now. To verify everything, he hung up and said they know it wasn't you. The girl confessed she found a student ID in the parking lot. And you used it so cops would think she was a minor. So I'm not in trouble. No, baby, mom said, hugging me tight. Nathan kept staring at the booking photo. She looks exactly like Riley. Like, exactly. Dad shot him a warning look, but he wasn't wrong. The resemblance was eerie. The police asked us to come in so I could stand next to the surveillance footage. When I walked into the room, even the officers did a double take. The girl was charged with identity theft on top of attempted robbery.

Jackson was the miracle child they'd tried for 10 years to have. I was the accident that happened after they already had him.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled, rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her.

I started to look around and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he Was going to take my life away.

Uh, in order for it to be an abortion, it must be a human life. No, anything that's evolving the uterus and you have to get rid of it, it is considered abortion. no. That's not how it is. That's not how it works. So, so again, you say I'm here to take rights away. Yes. Do you agree life is a right? I feel like if it's a clump of cells, then it's not alive. No, But let's go back. Do you think, do you think every human being has a right to life? Depending on how many weeks. But let's, so wait, hold on. Who's trying to take rights away? No, I wanna protect the rights of all human beings. You call them a clump of cells. Who's trying to take rights away? Example. Exactly. So when is it a human being in your mind? When is it a human being in your mind? Well, it's not even on my mind. If human development objectively begins at conception. At conception.

Just so we're clear, that's only a couple, that's only a couple thousand cases a year. No. And so, yes, it is. Have you seen, but how many individuals have already died because they haven't been able to get abortion? Abortion in the life of the mother can be put aside as something that needs to be considered. However, it's not always necessary. But let's talk about the main thing, because there's over 1.5 million abortions every single year that don't involve rape, incest or life in the. Yeah, 1.5 million. Yes, but let's, let's just ask you a very simple question. When, when does human life begin? When does human life, and my personal opinion is gonna start around the second trimester, a little more farther along. But let's get to this. Most individuals that are having abortions are gonna be mothers that cannot afford it. They usually have already 2 to 3 kids and a lot of time. So, so, so it's acceptable to be able to murder your young if all of a sudden you don't have the money to support them, that you can, you can murder your offspring if you're poor.

You know, he's all, and they let him in the cell. And I'm like, what's up with this kid? I mean, it's literally like his face is like deformed from whatever happened to him. And so I start talking to him and it was one of my bros did that to him on the transfer facility that they were on. And this kid was in for statutory. Unlike Oregon and some other states where they demand your paperwork, that's not really a thing that happens in Texas. So I didn't ask him for his paperwork, but he starts explaining himself. And he was from this very Christian, like old Kyle family. And this girl's family was friends of the family and they were just like naturally dating cause they all went to the same church and stuff. Well, her family found out they don't play that in Texas. There's no statutory. It just says.

Fans can't believe what they saw. Wendy Shay's concert was supposed to be a night packed with energy. The focus was meant to stay on her performance. Instead, a couple in the crowd took over the spotlight. A fan shot video started spreading online. The music hit its peak and the couple suddenly got way too intimate. People around them froze. Viewers called it the boldest moment ever seen at a concert. The clip went viral. Within minutes, comments poured in. Is this a concert or a full on romance scene? Some said the couple stole the entire show and pushed Wendy Shay's performance to the side. Others felt the internet exaggerated the whole thing and that the real moment wasn't that extreme. Wendy Shay's fans weren't having it. She was on fire and the spotlight still drifted away. As the clip keeps spreading, the debate grows louder. Fans are now talking about crowd behavior and basic boundaries in public spaces. One thing stands firm, anywhere Wendy Shay appears, heat and drama follow.

A lot of people have been talking about that what I really want to talk to you about is this beautiful chrysalis you have how long have you had it for maybe a month or so your your mom get that for you she's been going through a bit of a tough time recently see those markings at the bottom of the wings and that means it's a girl no kidding. Yeah, I didn't know that she might not look so good now but pretty soon she's gonna break out and be beautiful again I know it I tell you what that's one gutsy little kid in there look far as I can tell his mom started to act out around I don't know first of the year take out a break. I don't think so I mean bipolar schizophrenia they just rarely present this late in life toxic levels come back yet clear? Nothing in the blood or urine okay, well I want to take a look and then maybe try and have a conversation with The mom so what about Henry his arm's stable right? I mean we not gonna get any worse we got a bit of time how long is a bit I mean this kid needs our attention in more ways than one mom clearly can't help him they're living out of their car I think we should double dock his consent or get a court order in order to do that the will I've got to declare her incapable of caring for her child which means put her on a psych hold which means getting DCF involved look I'm worried about the kid too I just really want to make sure we're right before we go there yeah of course okay Jenny how you doing? I'm Doctor Charles they sent you in here to get my consent didn't they? Who say the other ones pretending to be doctors that red headed one tried to convince me my son had a broken arm you know Doctor Josiah is in fact a doctor and you know Jenny wasn't lying I mean I can show you the X ray you think I can't tell a fake I want to see your supervisor or I swear Jenny you all right? What's going on? Who are you again? I'm Doctor Charles and we were just talking about about Henry about your son I already told you I'm not getting anyone permission to treat my son well you know what I'm actually I'd like to get your Permission to treat you if that's okay. Me, there's nothing wrong with me, but unfortunately we can't release you or Henry before we rule out any trauma from the car crash. So if it's okay, I just like to send you upstairs for a quick scan and as soon as that's done, I'm free to go. I tell you what, how about we do the scan and see what it tells us and then go from there? Does that sound like a plan? Okay. Did you get a consent? Not exactly. Um, I want to send her upstairs for a head CT with contrast and also, can you tell Sam I want his eyes on this too, Roger? So what's, what's going on? You know, it doesn't seem like a garden variety psychosis. You know, there's this odd rhythm to it and she had this temporary loss of mentation. I really think we could be looking at something neurosurgical. So let me guess Henry's broken arm has to wait. No, just, just bear with me, buddy. Let's take a look at this scan. I think we're gonna get some clarity.

No surprise to me, too. I was convinced we'd find something. I'm so seldom wrong. Where is my son? Where? Where is it? Come on, we're getting out of here. Kenny! Henry has a broken arm. Your son has a broken arm. Kenny! Hey, we need some help here! You said if I agreed to that test, I'd be done. I'm tired of you. You gotta let us take care of your son forever. Said I am. Yeah.

How long do you plan to hold it for? 72 hours. For now, we'll just take it day by day. Then, uh, Doctor Rasher, let's get her prep for transfer upstairs. Okay, Henry, we are ready to put a cast on that arm. Really important question. What color would you like? We can do green, purple, blue. Blue, I guess. Blue coming right up. Where did those people take my mom? So your mom's gonna be resting here in the hospital for a little while, but when we're finished here, this nice woman is gonna Find you a cozy place to sleep tonight. How does that sound? Hi, Henry. My name is Madeline. You know, we can put that in a specimen cup if you like. I promise to keep it safe. So the delusions, the volatile mood swings, we could be looking at some kind of atypical bipolar disorder. I mean, at this point, it very well could be. We could start her on a course of alprazolam and see how she responds. You're moving her upstairs? Yeah, Nelly. We might as well get that going. Hey, listen, I pulled the tape from when Jenny had that episode. You see how everything just kind of falls off the ledge here? Her heart rate stats, her BP. Whatever is happening with her just has to be physiological, right? I've been saying all along, but, you know, the scan came back clean. We took this X ray of her chest upon intake, and you see this area of haziness around her mediastinum? Is it just me, or does that appear to be abnormally wide? It's definitely wide. There's no certain way to tell without more detail, but often caused by a tumor. And that can trigger an autoimmune response in the brain, right? Like psychosis. Absolutely. And would completely explain these weird. These dropouts you've been having. Dr. Quavis, could we hold up on that transfer, please? Dr. Asher, nice work. Hey, Doris said something about Jenny being in surgery? Yeah, we located a small tumor. On her mediasthinum. Daniel thinks that might have been what caused the psychosis. Really? Mommy! My baby boy. Oh. Oh, look at your arm. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay. I thought you were trying to hurt me and Henry. I'm. I didn't understand. It's alright. You're not gonna have to worry about that anymore. Mommy, look! My chrysalis. It turned into a butterfly. It's so beautiful.

Después de rescatar al guardia de prisión de los criminales, dijo mal camino, amigo. Usó su puntería precisa para guiar al guardia a correr en dirección contraria porque su capitán necesitaba un guía en ese momento. Usando dispositivos sensores previamente colocados, eliminó al enemigo que se había acercado por detrás sin siquiera mirar. En el otro lado de la prisión había estallado un motín a gran escala. Los prisioneros tomaron armas y forzaron su salida. El líder del escuadrón inmediatamente envió miembros para tomar la sala de control y cerrar las puertas de la prisión. El guardia informó al líder que la prisión tenía solo una salida, la puerta principal. Por lo tanto, necesitaban encontrar otra ruta de escape. El líder ordenó una retirada sigilosa hacia el oeste. Lejos de la puerta oriental, la francotiradora llegó a la planta baja y se reunió con el vehículo de apoyo, dirigiéndose juntos hacia el oeste. Pero ocurrió un giro inesperado. Centro de mando detectó que una unidad militar regular estaba programada para llegar a la prisión en 5 minutos. Con el fin de ayudar a los prisioneros amotinados, el capitán ordenó a los demás retirarse, primero hacia el oeste. Luego tendió cables a través de los charcos, colocando trampas para retrasar la persecución enemiga. El grupo finalmente llegó al flanco occidental de la prisión. El líder subió al segundo piso y esparció polvo blanco por las ventanas para marcar los puntos de Demolición. Los compañeros corrieron hacia los lugares marcados y colocaron explosivos. Un estruendo ensordecedor resonó cuando el grupo evacuó la prisión con éxito, pero tan pronto como encendieron los motores, las fuerzas armadas llegaron al exterior del recinto.

There was credit card checks where you could write them out, and it would just charge your credit card. It was blank, so I wrote my name on them. You can just make one out to yourself, do it for, like, 80. Eight hundred? You know, something like this, like 2,005. You had to put your check inside the envelope, then put in the machine and type in how much it was. I put the check in there, wrote it out to myself, signed the fake name on there, whatever. And it posted. So now I got 88 hundred dollars in my bank account. Probably took like two days to post. The money is in my account. I go and withdraw all the money out in the branch. I'm like, damn it, work and I ain't go to jail. They just close the account. I'm like, I gotta come up with a plan. Give me a group of people and just turn this thing all the way up.

The body, still warm to the touch, lay covered in water stains, as if it had been there for days. But something was off. The body didn't belong to just any victim. It, it's different. As lumber examined the scene, she realized there were no clear answers, no clues, no signs of struggle, only the water soaking the ground beneath her. She had to act fast. Somewhere nearby, a dark figure moved in the shadows. Her pulse quickened. What did this mean? Who was behind it? Her thoughts were interrupted by a phone call. We need you back at the station, the voice on the other end said urgently. There's more to this than we thought. Lumber knew it was time to dig deeper. The city of Pia was hiding more than just water stain. She rushed back, ignoring the rising tension in her gut. As she drove, the landscapes seemed to blur into a world of confusion. What was she missing? At the station, she was handed a report about a strange car found near the scene, a Cadillac, but nothing about the body or the driver. It didn't make sense. Then she remembered an old case, a notorious criminal known for leaving no trace. Could this be connected, she thought, back to the face of the victim? Was it someone she knew? Lumbra decided to meet with the informant, Gerald. But when she reached the designated location, things took another twisted turn. The place was abandoned. Only a single note remained, hastily written, the mouth of the cave is where it all.

She went to an auto repair shop for plastic surgery. The mechanic yanked off her clothes only to find her body was covered in hair. Then he brought a basin of hot honey and poured it all over her, laid white cloth on top and got ready to rip it off. The woman screamed in pain. After finishing all that, the auto shop owner brought out a chainsaw to clean her stinky feet. Next, they put a mask on her and placed her inside a mold. Then they connected her body to various tubes. They squeezed out some white liquid from her excess fat. In the end, the 300 pound fat woman actually turned into a sexy long legged beauty in black stocking. Even the boss who once didn't like her fell in love with her. But she only wanted handsome guys. So she crashed a speed dating party. When the handsome guy showed up, 11 girls lined up and stared at him in fascination. But because of the woman's sexy figure, the handsome guy quickly fell for her. Soon they became lovers. The man even bought all the jewelry and proposed to her. The woman said yes without hesitation. But the day before their wedding, the man's ex girlfriend suddenly showed up when she heard they were getting married.

Next, she pressed the knife tightly against the line and finally struck it with a stick, cutting off her toe. She did this so she could fit into the shoe and marry the prince, but the prince seemed to prefer her stepsister. To win the prince's heart, she decided to get plastic surgery. The doctor first firmly fixed her head in place, then slowly sewed fake eyelashes onto her eyelids. Lastly, the doctor pulled out a hammer and started working on her nose. With a scream, she was fitted with a nose brace, but she still didn't feel pretty enough, so she swallowed tapeworm eggs her mother gave her. When her mother helped her remove the nose brace, she felt like she had become beautiful. And thanks to the tapeworm eggs, her figure had become slim. She thought now she could marry the prince. But the worms in her stomach started squirming like crazy, making her constantly feel hungry. Even scarier, her hair started falling out in clumps, and she became weak and tired. Then one day she found out her stepsister hadn't given up on attending the Princess Ball. Out of anger, she tore her stepsister's dress on the spot and told their mother about it. The stepsister ran to cry.

Just as he was about to remove the final piece, the corpse suddenly spoke. You're already dead, the doctor said calmly. The woman was shocked, unable to believe it. The doctor explained, after death, circulation continues briefly. Brain cells don't die immediately. As he spoke, he lifted her death certificate, which listed the cause of death severe internal injuries from a car accident. He then began stitching the wound on her forehead, trying to restore her face to a presentable state. Next, he injected a dose to prevent rigor mortis. Shortly after, the woman lost consciousness. Her mother arrived at the funeral, inconsolable, wanting to see her daughter's body. The doctor comforted her, explaining how the body would be prepared for burial. Before leaving, the mother asked the doctor to take special care of her daughter's face. As she turned to go, the doctor, worried she might notice something, quickly covered the body. Suddenly, the woman awoke, frantically touching her body. Realizing she had no pulse, she slammed her fingers, feeling nothing. Despite that, she was certain she wasn't dead. At that moment, she heard a sound outside. She focused intently and recognized her boyfriend's voice. The woman began to scream with all her strength.

The beautiful stranger turned to glare at her. She didn't want to admit it was her fault, but after comparing their figures, she still step out of the elevator, yet the alarm ringing. The other woman assumed the elevator was broken and followed her outside. Returning alone to the elevator, the alarm abruptly went silent. She invited the woman to join her, but the stranger stormed off furious, trying to take a photo to show off her figure. She ended up splitting her skirt with the extra weight. As the elevator neared its stop, she grabbed the cardboard box to cover her head, escaping the embarrassment only to stumble straight into a proposal. The man upstairs mistook her for his fiance, shooting an arrow at the bouquet, triggering a sudden shower of petal. Nobody knew she was allergic to pollen. She had to flee fast.

Eighty year old Yumi lives alone and relies on takeout. That noon, his order vanished from the hallway. Minutes later, pounding at the door, the neighbor accused Yumi of poisoning her son. Yumi was stunned her boy had stolen the food. Now she was blaming him. Police came. Cameras show the child taking the sealed bag from outside Yumi's door and eating it in the stairwell. The label listed allergens. Peanut butter was a main ingredient. The boy, who has a serious allergy, vomited and was rushed to the hospital. The mother argues Yumi left a dangerous item in a corridor, creating a hazard for children. Online, some say Yumi shouldn't leave food in shared space. Others say responsibility follows the eater, not the.

Parents called police after finding an electric fence just inches away from where their children wait for the bus. The man who put up the fence says he had finally had it with students trespassing and leaving trash in his yard. He figured the fence would keep them out. I'm not in charge of other people's truth. All I can do is protect myself. But jolted neighbors thought the fence was too extreme. They called police and police called public works, who questioned whether the fence encroached on a county easement. Show me what's the truth. You know, everybody.

Without hesitating, she whipped out her phone and hit record. Facing the camera, she spoke solemnly. If you find my body at the bottom of the cliff near my house, know that it's me. As soon as she finished, she uploaded the video to social media. She turned to glance at her sister one last time, but something on the ground caught her eye. Fake leg lying right at the cliff's edge. She picked it up, look down and froze. Her sister's body lay motionless below. And only then did she realize her sister had been disabled all along. Everything she had staged, every detail meant to make the corpse pass as her own was ruined. Panicking, she remembered the video was still uploading. Luckily, the signal was weak. Just before the upload completed, she switched her phone to airplane mode. After a frantic moment of thinking, she scrambled down the cliff shouting, no, you can't die in my place. People will see you're not me. How am I supposed to explain this? Then she potted it a railway track nearby with a train barreling toward them. She looked down at her own legs perfectly intact and a new scheme snapped into focus. If she left the fake leg on the track, it would appear the train had torn off her sister's limb, erasing all suspicion about the Disability. She positioned the false leg on the rail and slipped behind a massive boulder. Moments later, the train roared past one. Once the scene was set, she fled and turned airplane mode off, allowing the video to finish uploading. In her mind, the plan was flawless. Once the footage spread, everyone would believe she was Felicity Price and she alone would inherit the unimaginable fortune.

Panic, she stripped off the gear and sanitized herself. Meanwhile, more leeches had climbed onto Jack. She removed them urgently, but to her amazement, the barnacles on his body had visibly decreased. Hope ignited. She carefully placed the leeches back onto Jack, allowing them to devour the remaining barnacle. By the next day, a miracle had occurred. Jack was fully healed, the monstrous barnacles vanquished by the very creatures he had feared.

Knowing human vision spans only 180 degrees, he believed staying out of sight would grant him complete invisibility. Yet when the guard entered the cell, he spotted Tae Soo in the corner at once. Though this earned him a slap across the face, a triumphant smile spread across his face. This proved his theory correct. He then began practicing free climbing. The next day, when the guard returned for inspection, Teasook vanished from the cell again. Only after the guard turned away did he realize Teasook had scaled the wall. This moment enraged the guard, resulting in another brutal beating. Yet Teasook refused to give up.

Not a single red flower could remain. Pluck it immediately or death follow. A bloodthirsty monster lurked just beyond the village and red was its forbidden color. If it spotted even a hint of red, it slaughtered everyone in sight. No villager dared cross the gates. One step beyond the boundary and the creature would tear you apart. But Eddie didn't buy into the warning. Very night, he left the village and ventured into the forest, fucking a handful of red flower. And then the nightmare began. The night watchman spotted it first, a monstrous figure draped in red charging straight into the village. He yanked the alarm bell. At the sound, villagers scrambled to their home, hiding in the cellars they had prepared, aired for exactly this reason. Faces writhing, sheer terror. The monster was that horrifying. Meanwhile, Eddie's girlfriend waited at the door, ran just as the monster lunged to swallow her whole. Eddie arrived in the nick of time, yanking her inside, slamming the door and rushing her to the safety of the cellar. By morning, the monster had left a Mark on Eddie's door, a chilling sign that its revenge was far from over. To appease it, the villagers offered sacrifices, praying for forgiveness. That night, the monster stayed away and for a brief moment, the village returned to uneasy calm.

But Anna, completely absorbed, was scanning the area for signs of large creatures, unaware of Jack's leering gaze behind her. Once he saw no one around, Jack immediately cut the boat's engine. Anna had no idea what was happening, and in the next second Jack stood up and unbuckled his belt. It was only then that Anna realized what he was thinking. Yet instead of fear, she flashed a calm, relaxed smile, leaving Jack utterly baffled. Blinded by desire, he lunged toward her just as she suddenly drew a sharp knife. Jack screamed and fell straight into the river. Anna, furious but still needing his help to navigate, tried to pull him out, but before she could reach him, massive crocodile surged from the water. Jack had already been devoured. Terrified, Anna curled up in the cabin and in a desperate reaction tried to start the boat and escape. She had no idea how to operate it, and in the next horrifying moment, she too became the crocodile's prey.

To avoid detection by the guards, she rips pages from books, soaks them in water and covers them with dirt, making the paper blend with the walls. She then paste the papers over the hole, buying herself more time to keep digging. She never goes outside for recreation. She tells the guards she prefers reading in her cell.

Each time he visited, he brought fine wine and I would spar with him. As the world's greatest demon, I occasionally shared a few of my secret techniques with him. But today everything changed. My subordinate, the faceless judge of Shura G, and his men burst into the dungeon. Somehow they had stolen Jeongseong's key. When Shura G inserted it into the lock, countless mechanisms within the iron coffin began to release. One by one, the steel rods embedded in my body slid free. And when the last one fell away, I, imprisoned for 12 years, was finally free. The first thing on my mind was urgent business. My followers bowed deeply in respect. I lifted my gaze toward the dungeon's ventilation shaft, wondering if I might glimpse the moonlight tonight. At that moment, the elders of the ouji pie arrived with their disciples, calling me a demon of the evil sect. Yet I felt a surge of excitement. They were perfect for loosening my stiff muscles.

They crawl across Jack's face, clinging to his skin like living parasites. By nightfall, his entire body is smothered in them, as if something is eating him alive. His mother rushes him into the medical ward. The doctor gets to work the moment she sees him. She tries soaking Jack in a bath of salt water, hoping it might slow down the infestation. But the method fails instantly. The barnacles are draining his strength by the minute. If they don't act fast, Jack's body could dissolve completely within 24 hours. The doctor edges toward hopelessness with no clue what else she can attempt. Just then, a lone leech appears in the corner. The doctor catches sight of the strange creature and an idea suddenly sparks in her mind. She quickly suits up in protective gear, ready to capture the leech for testing. But to her horror, the leech slips through through a tiny crack and wriggles straight into her suit. Panicking, she yanks the gear off and scrubs herself clean in a frenzy. Meanwhile, a cluster of leeches has already crawled onto Jack's weakened body. The doctor hurriedly pulls them off one by one. But the moment she removes the last leech, she freezes in shock. The barnacles on Jack's skin have significantly receded. That discovery reignites a spark of hope.

She refuses to eat the food they bring her. Instead, she collects the meals and smears them across the walls. Using the salt from the soup, she corrodes the walls, then digs with a homemade iron spoon. She's trapped in a prison surrounded by water on all sides. To avoid detection by the guards, she rips pages from books, soaks them in water, and covers them with dirt, making the paper blend with the walls. She then paste the papers over the hole, buying herself more time to keep digging. She never goes outside for recreation. She tells the guards she prefers reading in her cell. Three months passed, and she's dug a tunnel over 500 meters long. One day, a prosecutor arrives for an inspection. She knows this is her opportunity. The warden arranges a performance to greet the official. Since she hasn't been seen in so long, her fellow inmates haven't spotted her either. The guards are unaware of her movements, and she walks back to her cell in broad daylight. The Bard brings her meal as usual, thinking she's inside reading. He knocks but gets no response. Quickly, he opens the door and finds the cell completely empty. Panic, he runs to sound the alarm. The performance halts and everyone grows alert.

When they were about three quarters finished the job, the man came to Tracy with the price till he told me it was going to be $28,000. She says the price included another pad by the road, but it was far more than the smaller four inch thick pad that was supposed to be just outside the shop. She says she had signed a paper that they said was for insurance of some kind.

So they immediately started fighting. The quarterback stepped in to break it up, and only then did the tension ease. The game resumed. The quarterback threw the ball, but their huge bodies blocked it. The ball hit the ground and the big guy was right there to catch it. The only blocker was his black team. They didn't care about their past issues at all. Instead, they worked together, bulldozing through every defender. The big guy moved like a tank, pushing forward toward the end zone. The rival coach screamed for everyone to jump on him. They tried to bring him down, but he didn't slow down one bit. He carried four or five players with him, crossing the line and scoring.

Even the softest noise could send her spiraling into panic. That very night, faint whispers seep through the wall. Anna leaned down to listen more closely when a cockroach shot out from the corner. Startled, she spun around and saw the landlady already standing in the room. Expression blank and cold as stone. The woman quickly changed the subject and guided her toward the dining hall. The cockroach was nowhere to be found. Anna, rattled and confused, couldn't tell if what she had just was real or just fear twisting her senses. Later that night, just as she drifted towards sleep, a rapid knock slammed against her door. She tried to move, but her limbs wouldn't respond at all.

When morning came and Anna finally woke, the world looked perfectly normal, as though the terror from the night before had simply vanished into thin air.

I looked up at the dungeon's ventilation shaft wondering if I would still catch a glimpse of moonlight tonight. At that moment, the elders of the Woodpecker P y arrived with their disciples, calling me a demon of the evil sect. But instead of fear, I felt an unusual thrill. They were perfect for loosening my stiff muscle. It seemed that tonight would be anything but peaceful.

Just as he was about to leave, he entered the wrong password, triggering the house's security system. All the doors locked and he lost contact with his accomplices.

Suddenly, the air conditioning cranked up, heating the Room to cool off. He ran to the swimming pool, but the water was salty. Even the fish tank was filled with incredibly salty seawater. Just when he was about to give up, he saw a maid appear on the surveillance monitor. He quickly grabbed an iron pot and banged on the door trying to get her attention. But the door soundproofing was too good. She couldn't hear anything outside. He wrote a note asking for help and tried to slide it under the door crack, but no matter how hard he tried, it wouldn't fit through. In the end, he could only watch as the maid left. That day, things took a turn for the better. He successfully pried open the storage room with a metal sculpture. Inside, he found noodles, dry goods and even a whole refrigerated steak. Just then, he heard water again from the corner plant area. The automatic sprinkler suddenly came to life. He quickly put his mouth to the nozzle, eagerly drinking the fresh water. Hope sparked within him once more. He moved all the furniture and began building a makeshift ladder. He smashed a million dollar vase and used it to protect his eyes. He slowly climbed up, trying to break through the roof, but the roof was tightly secured with concrete screws. So he carved out wrench like grooves in wood and began unscrewing them one by one. Finally, when all the wood was gone, he unscrewed the last screw. Then he. Wrote an apology message on the wall. The man climbed the ladder and finally escaped.

The man stared in shock, barely able to comprehend what had happened. Before he could even speak, the girl's father did the same, adding another glass of water, leaving him utterly bewildered. Mom sat down calmly and said, it's just simple home cooking. But deep inside, the man was moved. It had been ages since he tasted a meal prepared with such care by an elder. He took a sip of the soup and immediately spat it out. It was far too salty. Thinking he had burned his tongue, mom stood up to hand him a tissue. At that very moment, the girl poured yet another full glass of water into the bowl. Only then did he understand their earlier strange behavior. The soup had been intentionally tempered. He looked at the table full of dishes, hesitant to try anything else. Finally, he mustered his courage and ate a bowl of plain rice, forcing himself to swallow. Mom, noticing he only ate rice, thought he was shy and quickly offered him a piece of meat. The man glanced at the girl, who simply gave him a helpless look. Even his father watched with sympathy, praising the food repeatedly while sipping water to cope with the salt. Mom then handed him a piece of pickled vegetable, and he felt utterly overwhelmed. After the meal, the girl handed Him a bottle of water. Since you don't enjoy my mother's cooking, help you politely decline future dinner invites, she said. He smiled faintly, replying, the soup may be salty, but I can feel the warmth of family. Genuine sentiment left the girl a may. Back at home, the man saw the lavish dishes prepared by his stepmother and her false welcome. Feeling a surge of disgust, he immediately left. But the memory of the girl's simple, warm family drew him back. He returned saying, I want to taste your mother's soup again. The girl was stunned at his return.

One day, a strong gust of wind shifted the boundary slightly toward the emerald side. Cobalt gained one extra meter of land. The Emerald Guard rushed over to correct the line, but cobalt refused to relent, believing this extra land was a gift from the heavens and taking it back was pure injustice. Emerald was enraged. Tempers flared, and the dispute quickly turned violent. The Cobalt Guard struck the Emerald Guard in the back, wounding him. The Green Guard crawled away, barely survived. Seizing the opportunity, cobalt pushed the border three meters forward. Soon, Emerald returned in force, attacking fiercely, driving out the Cobalt Guards in advancing the border by a staggering 20 meters. Cobalt retaliated immediately, sparking a brutal battle. Blue soldiers unleashed relentless machine gun fire, but Emerald rolled in tanks, crushing everything in their path. On the horizon, a massive horde of green matchsticks appeared. Overwhelmed and terrified, cobalt lit a spark to set the emeralds ablaze. Yet the wind shifted and the flames turned back, engulfing the cobalt side as well.

And just as they reached out to snatch them away, the mother dog suddenly leaped out, using her small, trembling body to shield her babies without hesitation. Yet she was no match for humans. She was sedated within seconds and locked inside a cage. The three pups couldn't escape either, but fortunately, they were taken to an animal shelter. However, the shelter had harsh rules. Each stray dog was given only seven days, and if no one claimed them, they would be put down. When the vet opened the cage for inspection, the mother dog was still under anesthesia, yet she fought to open her eyes, forcing herself to stand ready to protect her babies again. The staff were stunned. They had never seen a mother so unyielding. Her vigilance was extreme, and whenever the worker tried to offer food, she treated him like a threat and blocked his approach. That night, a window was left open by accident and one of the pups froze to death. The man tried to take the tiny body away for burial, but the mother dog stopped him fiercely, even holding the dead pup gently in her mouth, as if still guarding it. The heartbreaking sight shook the man deeply. He decided he had to save this family. Risking being fired, he secretly extended their execution deadline and brought thick blankets to keep the pups warm. But to truly rescue them, he needed to prove They weren't aggressive, so he wrapped the cage with cardboard, creating a safer, quieter corner for them. Slowly, the dogs began to relax, and the man eventually moved into the shelter, spending every day with them, speaking softly, hoping to earn the mother's trust. Before sleeping, he would place a small piece of sausage in front of the cage, a simple gesture to show his kindness.

We agreed to share the cafeteria, she explained, but when it was finally the girls turn, there was nothing left to eat. The principal, seemingly unconcerned, replied, the girls leave their classrooms too late and move too slowly. Next time they should arrive on time. The teacher, teacher didn't argue. Instead, she crafted a meticulous plan, rewriting the girl's schedule to ensure every minute was accounted for. That night, she tested herself, getting up, brushing her teeth, washing her face, timing each step precisely, even measuring her walk to the cafeteria and bathroom with a stopwatch. The next morning, she instructed all the students to rise at exactly 5 a. M. Every segment of their routine had to match the new schedule, 15 minutes for breakfast and cleaning, three minutes for the bathroom. Everything time to perfection. The new routine went into effect. All the girls brush their teeth simultaneously, forming neat circles. They dashed to the bathroom. Yet the plan didn't solve everything. Exhaustion set in. The pace remained slow and some girls still couldn't get their meals. Girl, always a bit slower. Ended up crying in the dormitory, missing breakfast once again. Her roommate, seeing her struggle, handed her a revised timetable. Curiosity spread through the group as the plan was explained. One group would wash up while the other use the bathroom, then they'd swap. Once finished, excitement rippled through the room. Claws broke out, and the girls quickly adapted to the new system.

He hesitated to tell his wife, but the divorce papers were already on the table. That moment shattered him completely, so he packed his Essentials took his dog and embarked on a journey without a destination.

Determined, he sold his computer and bought a hundred more boxes. Burn marks streaked his arms, but the taste still fell short. Soon, his supply ran out again. Just as he was about to give up, he spotted a forgotten bag of seaweed on the floor. One last attempt. After frying, he realized something had changed. The texture was crisp, the flavor flawless. Finally, a smile appeared on his face. In that moment, he understood why the bag had fallen the day before. Soaked overnight in the rain, it had softened, lost salt, revealing the secret to perfect sesame. He immediately began packaging and selling it, and the sesame product became a hit. Yet when he calculated his profits, disappointment set in. At the current margin, he could only earn a million a year, while his father was bankrupt with 40 million in debt. He needed a better way to make money. One day, Leo noticed three grocery stores just a street away from his home. If he could sell his seaweed there, the earnings could multiply. The next day, he went to the headquarters of a major supermarket chain to meet the market manager. But the manager refused even to taste the sample, claiming the packaging was too big. And the price too high. Completely unfit for store standards.

The noodle fell straight into the crisp kingdom, where every tiny resident was stunned by the intrusion. A little girl stepped forward and sniffed it gently. The noodle carried a warm, meaty aroma. The queen believed it to be some dark omen. Yet the girl knew the truth. It was simply her favorite snack. Soon, she Learned that the architectural model linked two worlds together. So she chose to become a guardian of the crisp kingdom. The Queen ordered her royal chef to turn the noodle into a grand feast and handed it out to her soldiers. None of them had tasted anything so delicious. While the hungry girl watched from the side, stomach rumbling. Seeing others enjoy it so much, he tossed another box of homemade noodles back into the model. Instantly, noodles rained down onto the crisp kingdom.

But unfortunately, at that very moment, an enemy army launched a sudden assault. The kingdom was on the verge of falling, and the Queen vowed to defend her land with her last breath. Unable to bear the sight, I rushed to the model and triggered the alarm horn, successfully confusing the invading troops. Enemies were terrified by the deafening blast, thinking they had encountered a monster. I tried to explain that it Was only a warning, not a creature. But they refused to believe me and mistook my words for provocation. So I pulled out my electric shock lighter and taught their leader a harsh lesson.

For breakfast, he ate only one egg, and his daily spending never exceeded $3. After 25 years of relentless work and extreme frugality, he finally amassed $1 million. Just as he was about to retire save her life, he suddenly collapsed in an elevator. Following a medical checkup, the doctor diagnosed a brain tumor. In disbelief, he sought a second opinion at another hospital, but the same test there cost 20 dollar more, so he returned to the first hospital. By then, the tumor had grown and the doctor told him he had only 30 days to live. Heartbroken, he visited his parents graves and wept, pouring out all his anguish. Afterward, he withdrew all his safe and called his friend. They book the luxury hotel, savored gourmet meals they had never tried, rented sports cars for $1,000 a day, and even bought a card of coins just to play arcade. Finally, he went to a cemetery and chose the largest plot for himself, hiring someone to give him a professional funeral makeover. Once everything was ready, he returned home. Out of old habit, he ate some expired Sausages to save money and soon after he collapsed. His friends rushed him to the hospital.

Yuri goes from an ordinary employee to someone everyone wants to please.

To her surprise, the man actually showed up armed with professional cleaning tools. He told her there were three steps to cleaning a room. First, take everything out, then prepare two cardboard boxes. He sorted things into what she needed and didn't need.

My father called me a cursed monster, cut all ties with me and threw me out of the house. Later, a master took me in, but he forbade me from fighting anyone. One day, a senior disciple challenged me and knowing he couldn't beat me, he ambushed me with hidden weapons. Rage took over and my punch left him in a vegetative state. No matter how I tried to explain, master insisted I was too dangerous and expelled me from the sect. Homeless, I drifted through the streets, surviving on discarded food until I met the kind hearted CEO. But one day a group of powerful fighters stormed the gym, LED by her longtime rival, who Brought two boxing champions and vowed to seize the gym that very day. The coach wanted to step in, but the CEO knew we couldn't act rashly against fighters of that level. She tried negotiating, but the man mocked her, calling her entire crew worthless. The coach couldn't take the insult, but the CEO stopped him just in time. She declared she would fight in his place, and if she lost, the gym would belong to them. The match began and the enemy sent in a female champion. The CEO sent a trainee with two and a half years of practice who didn't even survive a full round. I shook my head with a sigh while the coach raged, swearing he'd cripple the champion next. Then the rival sent out a 10 fight defending Bruiser. I knew the coach didn't stand a chance, warned him to stay sharp, but he shouted at me instead. When the fight began, the coach used every trick he knew, but the bruiser barely noticed, then launched him across the ring with a single punch. The rival smugly demanded the CEO sign the contract, even suggesting she could keep running the gym if she agreed to become his wife. She refused coldly and prepared to hand over the gym just as promised. Watching all this, my heart clenched. Without her, I would have frozen to death out on the streets. Seeing the man start barking orders around the gym, I couldn't take it anymore. I Stepped forward, saying I could defeat them. The CEO thought I was joking, but I walked straight to the man, declaring that as a member of the gym, you'd have to get through me first. My senior brothers saw me step up and pinned all their hopes on me. The man immediately sent out the invincible queen, vowing she'd end my life in the ring. But what none of them knew was that one year from today would Mark the anniversary of their defeat. When the invincible Queen charged at me, she froze in shock at my martial

After receiving my call, Dojan from the team rushed to my side. With tears in my eyes, I told him everything I had endured. Not long ago, a man came to our village selling everyday goods, frequently hosted events to bring warmth to elderly people living alone. For several days in a row, he put on small performances and held community dinners. The elders, feeling guilty, insisted on buying something to support him, but he always told them to only buy what they truly needed.

I insisted on leaving the prize behind. After that, I stopped attending his events.

The master was impressed, his satisfaction obvious. It was time for the second test. This time, the monk had to use the wooden stick to move a massive stone across a canal.

Tremors erupted. Only ancient black iron, aged over 10,000 years, could cause such a violent shake. But just earlier, when the Valkyrie challenged him, she sent him flying with a single palm strike. He landed hard, blood spilling from his mouth. Yet she didn't stop. Instead, she launched a full assault, pressing him to unleash his inner power. But he remained calm, unfazed. Lucky for him, she pulled back just in time, sparing his life. She was baffled why, when he was on the brink of death, did he refuse to fight back? What she didn't know was his greatest contempt was for hollow fame. Five years ago, he left home to fight for the title of the strongest under heaven. When he returned victorious, he found his home ravaged by a tyrant. Consumed by grief, he sought revenge, but his dying father told him to let it go. Looking at his father, he had no choice but to agree. With his family gone, he wandered the streets aimlessly until one girl found him. She arranged for him to work as a janitor at Marshall Hall. And no one knew how strong he really was. Even the casual drop of his chains released such pressure that the hall master thought it came from ancient black iron. They all believed a hidden master resided there, unaware that the master was standing right In front of them one day, the girl came to him with a suitcase, telling him the hall wouldn't keep idle hands, throwing his broom aside, ordering him to leave and never return. Seeing her cold demeanor, he didn't hesitate. He said a few parting words, grabbed his bag and left. She turned to watch him go, tears falling freely. But she had no choice. The martial hall was about to close, and to protect him, she had to push him away. At that time, the war god had left behind for secret keys in the martial world and to get them, three martial halls had already been destroyed. Theirs was the last one standing. They didn't have the key and hope was slim. The enemy issued a challenge. If someone from their hall could rank in the top 50 on the test stone, they could face their senior brother. Even if just one person won, they would leave them alone. Their strongest disciple gave it his all, but the stone didn't even move. The enemy senior brother casually waved his hand and the stone displayed the rank of 5. Meanwhile, he was having lunch when he overheard the news. The enemy was challenging them and if they lost, the hall would be wiped out and the girl would be forced to marry their senior brother as a concubine. Understanding at last, he rushed back without a second thought. But by then, the girl was already in danger, no matter How hard she fought. She couldn't touch their senior brother, only being humiliated as a plaything. She couldn't take it anymore and poured everything she had into one final attack, but was still thrown off the stage. Watching this, he was filled with fury. Just as he was about to step in, the hall master jumped onto the stage first, challenging the enemy to a duel. But he, too, was powerless, knocked out in a single blow. Losing all patience, he unleashed his inner power and shattered the black Iron chains. The energy he released stunned everyone. But their senior brother laughed, mocking that brute strength was useless in a world where inner power ruled. He released his own energy, attempting to intimidate him. Determined to prove his strength, he activated the Test Stone, showing them what real inner power looked like. The moment his spiritual energy poured in, the ranking shot up instantly. The crowd gasped in disbelief, and some even began to question who he truly was.

When they checked his backpack, all they found was his driver's license and a college acceptance letter. No weapon, nothing to justify the violence. It was then that they realized they had made a devastating mistake. But instead of owning up to their actions, they decided to cover it up by pulling a fake gun from the patrol car, handcuffing the boy, and placing the weapon near him, staging a false scene of self defense. This wasn't the first time they had played this deadly game. That night, the scene was swarmed with more officers, including the boy's mother.

The father threatened to use every connection at his disposal to make John pay for his actions, but John refused to back down.

A woman named Clara attempted to steal the dress, but it was all part of Emma's plan. During the new season fashion show, a motorcycle burst onto the red carpet. Through smoke, Emma emerged, mysterious and commanding, capturing every gaze. When the lights went out, numbers glowed on the wall. She walked away with style and overnight became a legend in the fashion world. Days later, at a product launch, a garbage truck stopped outside, spilling heaps of fabric. Emma appeared, smiling, confidently, climbing a top the truck. The fabric unfolded, an astonishing 15 meter long gown. Nobody cared about Clara anymore. Later, at a major fashion event in London, Clara's car broke down at the gate. Once again, Emma appeared, draping the royal length gown over the car. Cameras turned toward her. The next day, newspapers only reported the storm she had unleashed in fashion. Furious, Clara ordered her team to hunt Emma down. But Emma was too clever. Even the police couldn't track her. Clara pinned all her hopes on the golden dress, unaware that Emma had anticipated everything. On the day of the fashion show, when the safe was opened, hundreds of moths swarmed out. The audience screamed as Clara's precious gowns were destroyed. The golden pearls were not pearls at all. They were moth eggs. This was Emma's ultimate revenge for her mother's death. Was it the right thing to do? Share your thoughts in the Comments.

He stripped her completely and tossed the garments into the trash. But just as he reached for the final piece, the corpse suddenly spoke. The doctor replied with unsettling calm, you're already gone. The woman froze in disbelief, unable to accept what she heard. He explained that even after death, blood can still circulate briefly, and the brain doesn't shut down all at once. As he talked, he lifted her death certificate stated the cause severe internal trauma from a traffic accident. Then the doctor began stitching the wound across her forehead, trying to restore her face so it looked presentable for the viewing. After that, he injected a dose to delay the body from stiffening. Moments later, the woman slipped back into unconsciousness. Her mother arrived at the funeral home. Shattered with grief. She begged to see her daughter one last time. The doctor comforted her and explained the preparation process. Before leaving, the mother pleaded for her daughter's face to be treated with care. When she turned around, the doctor, afraid she'd noticed something off, quickly covered the woman's body again. Out of nowhere, the woman jolted away. She frantically touched herself and realized she had no pulse. She pinched her fingers hard, yet felt absolutely nothing. Still, she was convinced she wasn't truly dead.

Before that, the military had received a tip off that the plane had been hijacked, so they had set up a tight net in advance, planning to eliminate the terrorists and rescue the hostages. But they waited for a long time without seeing any movement inside the plane. It was not until then that the cabin door suddenly opened and a little boy climbed down from it. Boy held the little bear in his hand, his eyes vacant. As the specific situation on the plane was uncertain, the military dared not act rashly and could only take the little boy back first, hoping to get some definite information through the child. However, no matter how the negotiation experts tried to persuade him, the boy remained silent, his eyes vacant as he stared ahead. Recalling those strange scenes on the plane in his mind just then, the boy returned to reality. From his thoughts, he finally spoke excitedly, recounting that the plane was full of vampires. They must destroy the plane before the sun sets. How could the military believe such nonsense from him? They thought the boy might be out of his mind because he was frightened. To soothe his emotions, the doctor injected the boy with a sedative. In the cockpit of the plane, a man kept begging the military to let him get off the plane because it would be a world of zombies after the Sunset. But how could the military believe it? They have always regarded the man as a terrorist and made him confess the truth. Seeing the night getting darker, the man suddenly made a sharp leap and lay down on the ground, dodging the sniper's attack. Did you get him? To all units. Operation is ongoing. The Special Forces no longer waited to take the initiative to attack. They quickly opened the cabin door by using external facilities, not knowing that a cruel massacre was awaiting them.

Seeing this scumbag with no remorse and that smug look on his face, I couldn't hold back my anger anymore. I charged forward, determined to end him with my own hands. Several police officers tried to stop me, but they were no match for me. As I was about to reach the killer, I was hit by a stun gun and collapsed helplessly to the ground.

At that moment, I was burning with anger from being unable to avenge my mother, so I agreed right away. My first mission was a rapist who should've received life in prison, but walked free by claiming mental illness. The crowd protested with signs, but nothing changed. So they threw garbage at him in frustration. That only provoked his true nature. The criminal who acted so humble in public showed his real face the moment he got into the car. But he would never act arrogant again because he was sitting in my model taxi. At the intersection, I made a perfect drift and turned into a side road. Jim had already blocked the reporters, pretending his car had stalled. The criminal, thinking it'd shaken the reporters off, looked pleased until he realized something was wrong. I was driving him in the opposite direction. He yelled at me, demanding to know where we were going. When I didn't answer, he pulled off his belt and tried to choke me, but I knocked him out with one punch. Too scared to get close, he resorted to kicking the seat. I pulled out a tranquilizer dart and jabbed it into his body. Then I drove into a tunnel. Up ahead, another taxi appeared. I hit the booster, sped past it, and made a sharp drift to line up beside it. I handed the criminal's ankle monitor and luggage to John, then pulled into the tunnel service area. Mark moved quickly, peeling off the car decals, removing the taxi light, I hit a switch inside, the emblems folded away and the license plate flipped. In seconds, the model taxi became a private sedan. We drove right past the reporters as if nothing had happened. And just like that, this monstrous criminal vanished from the public eye forever.

Shadow quietly unzipped the toy, crawled out and avoided the wall camera. Like a spider, she crept toward the sofa, pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed the first man in the neck. The drugs and alcohol made him completely unresponsive. Then she crawled along the edge of the sofa to the other two men using the same method to stab them in the neck. But shadow didn't rush to leave. She dipped her hand in their blood and drew clown faces on each of them. After admiring her work, she returned to the plush toy and zipped herself inside. The next morning, the staff collected the gifts and sent the giraffe away. Shadow had left the crime scene flawlessly when the police arrived the next day. Found no suspicious individual. They suspected the only surviving boy band member was the killer. The man told police that the other members had forced him to take drugs and bullied him, giving him a strong motive. Surveillance showed he had stayed in his room all night with no other lead. With everyone stumped, a talented forensic artist reviewed the footage again and noticed subtle anomalies, quickly sketching out the outline.

As the boy lay dying, a single drop of blood unexpectedly fell into his wound, merging with his genes, unlocking the door to another world. The Lion King sensed this change and chose to spare the boy. After receiving medical treatment, the boy returned home only to find that the lion had been killed by his father. Realizing his father's cruelty, they had a fierce argument. That night, Clive quietly left home and headed toward his mother's homeland. Upon arriving, Clive saw a massive herd of cattle charging towards him, the grassland stretching endlessly with no place to hide. To his surprise, the herd didn't crash into him, but instead veered away. Looking up, he saw the herd leader standing before him as if communicating through telepathy. Only after the herd had dispersed and his safety was ensured did the bull King depart. It was then that Clive realized his body had transformed. With a gentle pull, his arrows now flew over 100 meters, and his speed, explosive power and hearing were far beyond those of ordinary men. Before Clive could even celebrate, a gunshot rang out. Climbing up a tree trunk, he saw a group of poachers hunting the migrating herd from miles away. He rushed towards them.

This is my daughter. Aren't you? And what's your name? Rosie. She can't talk. All right. Okay. Yeah. Is that. What's that? Is that. Have you been abducted? Sorry, I don't speak Macedonian. I do.

After his daily arduous labor, he also had to endure humiliation from the wealthy kids. While other 15 year old boys enjoyed the pleasures of sports, cars and girls, he could only engage in dirty and physically draining work. Though resentful of such social inequality, he was powerless to change it. One day, a newspaper caught his attention. It was a legendary story about the billionaire Andrew. His experiences bore a striking resemblance to his own. This commonality deeply moved him. He swore he would become as successful as Andrew. Returning home, he confided in his father about his dream of becoming a billionaire. But his father harshly mocked him. Don't even think about getting rich in your lifetime. The only thing you can count on is always getting the short end of the stick. This heavy blow left him utterly disappointed.

He told his father he had invented a wind power generator. His father, who had never attended school, listened intently. The boy's next words angered his father. He said that if they enlarged the turbine blades, they could build a more powerful generator to pump groundwater. All the crops could be irrigated. But the cost would be his father's bicycle. The father found the idea absurd. If it failed, they would lose their only source of income. The father shattered the boy's hope with reality. From then on, the boy went to work in the fields with his father every day. Their lives remained unchanged. The cracked land left by farm machinery was no longer suitable for cultivation. The meager corn harvest won't last until next spring. The father was forced to sell all their valuable possessions to buy food. Worse still, he discovered at the market that not only had grain prices skyrocketed, but the amount available for sale was also sharply decreasing. Witnessing this, the boy resolved to build his own generator. He gathered his friends and went to the scrapyard to search for parts. But they were missing a crucial component.

назначенный зять джункуя дупин естественно мог пропустить эту процедуру проходя через деревянный мост мост внезапно сломался дупин упал вниз к счастью летучая мышь вовремя поймала его и показала ему адский спа салон там 18 видов массажа если при жизни делал добрые дела здесь можно насладиться эксклюзивным сервисом картина была слишком гармоничной дупин через несколько секунд потерял сознание летучей мыше пришлось отнести его в резиденцию Чжун куя Чжун куя Чжун куя был доволен внешностью будущего зятя через мгновение дупин медленно очнулся увидев страшных призраков снова потерял сознание тем временем сестра Чжун куя наряжалась в комнате думая о своём с ужином невольно застенчиво засмеялась когда дупин снова очнулся уже был одет в свадебный наряд и был вынужден отправиться встречать невесту он ехал впереди на коне невеста хихикала в паланкине чжункуй не обидел его подарил сотню слуг и служанок и десятки сундуков золота и драгоценностей вскоре настало время церемонии чжункуй сидел на троне дупина подтолкнули в свадебный зал невеста медленно вышла 1-ая поклонилась дупин был в сметении но увидев грозное выражение Чун куя сразу испуганно упал на колени приготовились начинать 2-ой поклон родителям поклон супругов друг другу исполнивший давнюю мечту чунку и громко рассмеялся призраки тоже смеялись без остановки когда они вошли в брачный покой дупин хотел снять красную фоту посмотреть на жену но получил отказ невеста подошла к столу украдкой разглядывая своего мужа затем 1 дыханием задуло свечи на стене отразился её прекрасный профиль но в любом случае этой ночью будет страстная битва

My world was completely turned upside down by a single piece of broken glass. The day Alice arrived at my home, I saw it happen. A shard of glass pierced her thigh, and I watched as she simply placed a bandage over it. In the blink of an eye, the wound healed completely, leaving no trace. I should have been terrified. I should have sent her away immediately. But looking at her, I found myself uncontrollably drawn to her beauty. And in the end, I was completely captivated. By the time I came to my senses, it was already too late. It all started when my wife was hospitalized with a heart condition. To help manage the pressure of caring for our two children alone, I followed her suggestion and visited a robotics exhibition. A sales manager highly recommended Alice to me, praising her as a top tier artificial intelligence, especially designed to mimic human emotions. He said she wasn't just perfect for handling household chores, but was exceptionally skilled at interacting with children. His words struck a chord and I bought her on the spot. Little did I know, that decision would change my life forever. On her first day, I was still a bit reserved, unconsciously treating her like a guest. But she noticed immediately and said to me gently, Mister Nick, please don't stand on ceremony. I'm here to serve this household. You just need to tell me the schedule. I'll handle the Rest. Her voice had a certain magic to it, making one relax almost against their will. Then, as she was familiarizing herself with the house, she astutely identified a safety hazard with the staircase railing and proactively told me she would take care of it and I, as her owner.

As she was about to show him how to shift gears, her hand slipped and accidentally touched Leo instead of the gearstick. Feeling the warmth of Luna's palm, Leo seemed to understand what had happened. Without hesitation, he pressed the brake, hoping Luna would carefully study the gears. It was something he had been dreaming of for a long time. Ever since Leo played the cello for the first time, he had left a lasting impression on teacher Luna. After that, they often exchanged glances in class as if they could read each other's thoughts. So during this lesson, Luna purposely walked over to Leo and playfully teased his music composition. Angered by her words, Leo left the classroom and went to a nearby warehouse. Luna followed closely behind. When they were alone, Leo finally couldn't hold back any longer and confess that he liked her. Looking at the boy in front of her, Luna couldn't help but kiss him. Soon she realized the setting wasn't right. She wrote an address on Leo's hand and told him to come at PM thrilled by the kiss, Leo immediately canceled his dinner plans with friends, keep the appointment. At exactly eight PM, he arrived at the parking lot where Luna was waiting. He thought something exciting would happen that night, but to his surprise, Luna told him she had just quit her job and plan to move back to Her hometown. She said there could be no future for them and told Leo to stop thinking about her, having just fallen in love. Leo was heartbroken but refused to give up, stay by Luna's side. He said he was willing to move to the countryside with her, seeing how infatuated the boy was. Luna seemed to agree. That night, she drove Leo hundreds of kilometers to a small village where she owned a house. They spent several beautiful and peaceful days together.

But unfortunately the 80 year old rich granny is still alive today. And I've been living this simple and boring life for 25 years. When I was 10, my dad worked day and night. And one day while driving past our house, he crashed into it from falling asleep at the wheel. After my dad passed away, life at home got even harder. That incident made me understand something about life. Working hard doesn't always lead to good results. Taking shortcuts is the safest way. Ten years passed quickly and I kept working toward my dream. I hung around all kinds of high end clubs every day. And on my 20th birthday I finally found the target I've been looking for. From my buddy I Learned the rich lady was 55 this year. She had just divorced and had no kids. And most importantly, she owned the biggest supermarket chain in the entire country. Her assets were too many to count. I got excited the moment I heard it. Old but loaded. And her health wasn't great. She was literally the woman of my dreams. Without hesitation I jumped straight into the pool, then swam over to her to show off my strong body. Oh, I think I'm making you wet. And just like that, I married into a wealthy family. 25 years passed in the blink of an eye. Today was our wedding anniversary. She Gave me another one million dollar watch. It wasn't expensive, but I still had to pretend to be happy.

So the boy panicked and returned to the water surface. But the pool had returned to normal again. The boy thought he had seen it wrong, so he jumped in again, but the pool turned into an abyss once more. This time, he decided to figure out what was happening. So we found a direction and started swimming. But after an hour, he still hadn't reached the shore. At this moment, the boy suddenly noticed a creature appearing in the water approaching him. The next second, the creature suddenly looked at him. The boy was so frightened that he hurriedly returned to the water surface and began to swim frantically toward the shore, but that thing followed him. Boy finally made it back to the shore. At the last moment, the boy carefully observed the pool and saw his glasses had fallen to the bottom. So he picked up a fishing net to retrieve his glasses. But just as he was about to successfully fish them out, the water rippled as if someone had come ashore. An invisible person quickly ran toward him. The boy knew this invisible person had already come before him. The boy was pushed in, and just as he tried to return to the shore, that person actually jumped into the water as well. Soon, the pool returned to calm.

He lunged forward, determined to end the killer's life himself. Several officers tried to restrain him, but none of them could hold him back. Just as he was about to reach the murderer, a stun gun struck him, and he collapsed helplessly onto the ground. The killer strolled over with a mocking grin and spoke. Watching all of this from the crowd was John, who froze in place. He recognized that same pain, the agony of losing someone dear. Only those who've lived through it truly understand.

Instead of scolding the boy, he bought the bread and handed it over to him. The boy crouched down and devoured the bread hungrily. John felt a wave of compassion. He took the boy to the seaside to bathe. When he saw the boy's emaciated body covered in bruises, he made the decision to take him in. That night, they slept in John's car, but the next morning, the boy was gone. He had stolen all of John's money, his last saving. What hurt John the most wasn't the loss of money, but the betrayal of his kindness. Overcome with emotion, he suffered a heart attack. His dog, happy, came to his side and reminded him it was time for his medication. In this world, perhaps a dog understands gratitude better than people. With no savings left, he became truly homeless. It wasn't that he didn't want to go home, but he no longer had one to return to. Not long ago, he had been laid off from the factory he'd worked at for years. Losing his job in middle age meant he had no chance in the job market anymore. He searched for work for a long time, but no company was willing to hire him. But as life often goes, he was diagnosed with heart disease. He was still unsure whether to tell his wife, but She had already handed him the divorce papers. In that moment, he was completely broken. So he packed up his few belongings, took his dog and set off on his final journey. After the boy had stolen his savings, John went to a secondhand shop, hoping to sell some old treasured items.

His wife tried to stop him grabbing the spear, but she was too weak, unable to hold on, even tearing her clothes in the struggle. Seeing that the man didn't hesitate, when he returned laden with fish and tossed the goggles back to him, the man should have been furious, but instead he looked strangely pleased. Something felt off, but he didn't think much of it, proudly showing off his catch, only wanting to satisfy his hunger. Then he noticed his wife's eyes shifting and his chest tightened. The man didn't say a word and he started to realize the gravity of the situation. He glanced at the man next door and suddenly it all clicked. A surge of rage coursed through him, grabbed his wife, throwing her in front of the man, hoping she would repent. But minutes later, to his shock, she and the man were casually dancing together as if nothing had happened. Seeing this, is face turned green with anger. He couldn't take it anymore. Swearing they'd pay for this, he smashed a glass bottle, ground down the bottom and glued it to the neck. He softened a plastic bottle over a flame, cut it open and sealed the mouth with black rubber, fashioning a makeshift diving mask. He couldn't wait any longer.

But I didn't expose her in front of the whole class. I just accepted the milk, then handed it to a beggar on the street, whose face was covered in stories. Because in my last life, my fat and ugly best friend suddenly turned into a stunning beauty. While I, the class bell, gained 200 pounds overnight. My face broke out in spots and I became hideous, the laughing stock of the entire class. After that, she became the center of attention and was crowned the new class beauty. I thought I had some strange disease, until one day I got hit by a car, lying on the ground dying. I finally realized the reason I became fat and ugly was all because of the milk my best friend gave me every morning. And later, she even had someone run me over and kill me. But when I opened my eyes again, I had been reborn to two months earlier during music class. She was telling me to hurry up and drink the milk. The classmates around me praised her, saying she was kind and beautiful. For giving milk to an ugly girl like me. I didn't know how to say no. But after hearing all their mockery, I quickly came up with an idea. I told everyone I wouldn't drink the milk today. I was trying to lose weight and Had decided to start controlling my diet. My best friend panicked right away, pretending to be hurt. She said she made that milk especially for me, and not drinking it would mean rejecting her kindness. As soon as she said that, I snatched the milk and loudly asked who in class wanted it. A bunch of classmates immediately gathered around, saying they skipped breakfast and could use the nutrition. Seeing the milk about to be taken, she panicked, grabbed it back, and cried that she made that strawberry milk just for me and I was giving it away. The class turned on me, saying I was ungrateful, telling me to apologize and drink it. But I knew it wasn't time to expose her yet. So I took the milk back and said my stomach didn't feel well today. I drink it tomorrow. But she wouldn't let it go, demanding I drink it now. Just then, the school heartthrob walked into the classroom and announced a school wide beauty contest. The winner would get signed by a top talent agency. My best friend rushed up to sign up and even tried to flirt with him. But she didn't know he had come here for me. He once saw me before I turned ugly and had been deeply attracted to me. This time he came looking for me specifically. But now, seeing me at 300 pounds, he thought he had the wrong person and quickly left. After he was gone, my scheming Best friend still wasn't satisfied with her looks. She reminded me again not to forget the milk. I was on high alert, wondering how to deal with it. Then I saw a beggar downstairs with sores all over his face. I instantly had an idea. I said I was going to buy bread, ran downstairs, and gave the milk to the beggar. He drank it all in one gulp. Suddenly I felt my face itch. I looked in a mirror and saw that all the spots on my face were gone. I immediately realized as long as I didn't drink her milk, my beauty would return. But it still wasn't time to confront her, so I put on a mask and began planning my next move. Meanwhile, the school heartthrob thought my best friend was decent looking, so he invited her to train at his father's company. The whole class was jealous that she might get signed. First she was smug, pretending to care about me, then turned around and mocked me, saying just looking at my face made her sick. But right after she said that, her skin suddenly started burning.

I was just a regular Jack operator at the NASCAR track. By a stroke of luck, I got a feeling for the driver who went to grab a bite and race in his place. My good friend Carl was thrilled for me. Haha, yeah, that's my boy Ricky. But the engineer told me not to go too fast saying I'd have to pay for it if the car got wrecked. If you wreck that car, that's 200 grand out of your pocket. So let's take it nice and slow. Okay, with all due respect, Lucius, I'm gonna do some driving. Excuse me, coming through. Apparently we've got a situation for the laughing clown. No. 26 car. Terry Shabo is refusing to drive and one of his crew members is taking the wheel. Hey Lucius, just want to share a little piece of personal information with you. I got a chubby right now because it's one of the most awesome experiences of my life because I'm getting to drop a race car. I can't believe it. That's when my talent really shine through. Never having driven a race car before, I managed to pass one car after another in the little time left. Starting from dead last, I somehow pulled off a miracle and took third place. During the post race interview, I was so nervous, I didn't even know where to put my hands. The team owner's son thought I was a fool. But the owner saw I was a natural and decided to groom me. I never forgot my good friend Carl, though. Thanks to my persistent request, the team agreed to add another car to the lineup just for Carl and Ricky Bobby wins with Count Uncle junior finishing second. Yeah, baby psych and fake. After that, Carl and I raced together in NASCAR. Carl would lead the pack up front to take the win resistance while I'd make the winning pass at the crucial moment. Hey, driver, drive me please be 18. Later on, I started getting tons of endorsement deals. I married Carrie and we lived happily ever after. One day, Carrie fixed up a nice spread of fast food for the whole family. We thank you so much for this bountiful harvest. Domino's, KFC and it always delicious Taco Bell. I just want to take time to say thank you for my family, my two beautiful, beautiful handsome striking sons, Walker and Texas Ranger or TR as we call. And of course my red hot smoking wife Carly, who's a stone cold fox.

For 14 years, Debbie Salzman worked as a beloved lunch lady here at Denver Place Elementary School in Wilmington. She says she would upgrade the lunch of a child who didn't have enough money or give them extra food if they said they were still hungry. If they didn't have enough money on their account, they would get a cheese sandwich instead. Friend that got a free lunch that would come back and say, Miss Debbie, I'm still hungry. Didn't you get your belly full for supper last night? And you don't know how many times I heard they didn't have supper that night. Salesman says she kept posted note IOU's and paid out of her own pocket for kids. But the district suspended and terminated her this February for, quote, not keeping track of a register and providing food to her grandchildren without payment, end quote. Salesman admits to giving her grandchildren extra food, too, but says it wasn't just them. I broke the rule. I'm the one that broke the rule.

This morning, parents called police after finding an electric fence just inches away from where their children wait for the bus. The man who put up the fence says he had finally had it with students trespassing and leaving trash in his yard. He figured the fence would keep them out. I'm not in charge of other people's kids. All I can do is protect myself. But jolted neighbors thought the fence was too extreme. They called police, and police called public works, who questioned whether the fence encroached on a county easement. Show me what's the truth. You know, everybody just giving me different words. The relentless homeowner not giving in because he says the signs posted in his front yard did nothing. It says no trespassing. What, you don't like kids? Me? I'm. I'm a parent, and I don't want any children around here to get electrocuted. That's a little too extreme. I mean, you're gonna let the kids get electrocuted? That's not cool.

Why did you throw this at me? Uh, wedding tradition. Magnets symbolize lifelong attraction. Quick question, though. Why did it stick to your head? Oh, uh, I don't want to talk about it. We're all friends. Give us the download. Okay. I have a steel plate in my head because you know how my entire family died in that skiing accident. I was the only one who made it out alive, and. Oh, wow. Now I am going to cry. I'm so sorry, Prunella. The caterers lost the halal meals. What? Kareem is gonna freak. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I'll help. I'm not lending you any money. Is it safe to leave you with Prunella? Yeah. I'm done. I promise. Prunella, I owe you an apology. What is this? Is this a battery pack? My power supply. Don't tell anyone.

In 1956, in the small town of Redwood Hollow, England, a family lost their two young daughters, Emily and Grace, in a tragic car accident. Their parents were devastated. Months passed, then a year, and life slowly returned to normal. Until 1958, when the mother gave birth to twin girls. From the moment the twins could speak, things weren't normal. At age 3, one of them pointed to a birthmark on her knee and said, this is where the car hit me.

They had never spoken about the accident in front of the twins. But things got even stranger. The twins began asking for toys. They

He squatted by a fire, trying to warm himself, but the chill persisted. Taking a deep breath, a sudden warm current rushed through his body. Finally he felt heat returning, but almost immediately the fire itself froze into ice. He returned to school feeling as if everything was normal, but soon the cold returned.

This little warmth was still not enough. He looked at his girlfriend. I'm sorry, he muttered. She pleaded frantically, but she had already frozen into a block of ice.

The Man squatted calmly and began absorbing the heat from the water at the last moment, as the girl reached the edge.

I had nothing to do but refine myself again and again, until even heaven forgot my name. I raised a hand and pointed at the elder. A soft breeze stirred. The next moment the grand elder flew backward, slamming into the stone wall, vomiting blood, his aura collapsing instantly. The disciples panic. They dropped their swords. Knees shaking, my subordinates knelt behind me and shouted, my Lord has returned! Their voices echoed through the dungeon like a storm that had slept for 12 years. I looked toward the exit, where the cold moonlight poured in like a Silver blade, tonight, I said softly, I'll take back everything that belongs to me.

But the girl herself remained vivid, vibrant, untouched by the desaturation that plagued everything else. His heart raced. Something wasn't right. The subway screeched into the station, and she disappeared into the crowd. On his way home, he couldn't bring himself to move forward, the world still a muted canvas. Only when pedestrians passed, he summoned the courage to follow. A car suddenly swerved dangerously close. He jumped back, frozen in place, then noticed an umbrella being held for him. That's when he realized anything the girl touched retained its color. The umbrella. Her small gesture of care was enough to paint the world briefly in life again. Seeing he had no umbrella, the girl decided to walk him home. A manhole lay ahead, its open mouth a trap in a colorless world. He stumbled, but she pulled him back just in time to shield the pedestrians. She handed him the umbrella, and in that moment, the world drained of color once more. It wasn't until she took the umbrella back that the vibrant hues returned, the simple object radiating life like magic.

He fired rounds at the vehicle, finally punctured the fuel tank. Gasoline immediately gushed out. The unaware driver kept steering.

This time the criminal I'm hunting goes by the code name Wolf King. 20 years ago, he adopted several children from an orphanage and later trained them to become elite thieves. Each of them has their own specialty. Some are world class hackers. Some can change their appearance in the blink of an eye and some can even perfectly disguise themselves as women, though they're actually men. Wolf King calls all the shots from behind the scene. A few days ago, they stole $2 billion in cryptocurrency and vanished without a trace. But the police don't even know what Wolf King looks like. That night, I suddenly picked up Wolf King's trail. To avoid raising his suspicion, I sent a very plain looking female officer named Mary to tell him secretly. The goal was to find out exactly where he lived. I sat in my car watching everything through the surveillance feed. At that moment, Wolf King suddenly turned around. Mary immediately pretended to be looking for something.

He brushed his teeth with their toothbrushes, showered in their bathrooms and lived under their roof for years without a single homeowner discovering him because he had created his own system of living and hiding. Every day he rode his motorcycle through the streets picking flyers on front door. If a flyer remained untouched for more than three days meant the house was empty, he would then pull out his lock picking tools and slip inside. Once in, he checked a landline message to learn where the owner went and when they'd return. Only after confirming everything would he settle in comfortably for a few days. After every meal, he cleaned the entire house, even washing the owner's dirty laundry. Before leaving, he take a secret selfie beside the family portrait.

She smiled awkwardly, expecting ridicule, but Hirata did not mock her. Instead, he went through her answers with care, praising each attempt. For the first time, being complimented felt unreal.

It spread its sharp claws, launching a deadly dive at me, but it missed completely. As it turned around, it froze. It saw countless versions of me forming a giant sphere with all of us firing machine guns in all directions, rolling straight toward the steel Giant Eagle. Then we mimicked its movements and Launched our attack.

He had years of experience with the sharp sword, which hundreds had bowed down to. Even then, the boy was ready. He faced the master's attacks head on. Though young in age, his skills were sharper than many season warriors. In the end, the master broke the boy's sword, leaving him unarmed. Still, the boy didn't stop. He grabbed the master's sword with his bare hands, slid forward and landed a powerful punch that shook the master's Jaw. Then he leapt into the air, delivering another blow that hit the master's neck. He swiftly seized the sword, throwing it far away. The master barely survived, but the sword pierced into a pillar. After that, the boy showed no mercy. He punched straight into the master's chest. The master fell the victim of his own sword. He never imagined that one day he would.

Now all they had to do was find the treasure buried at the bottom of the sea, and they'd be billionaires. To boost their search efficiency, they went to the market and bought a range of detection equipment. Then they returned to the area of the sea where they'd made the discovery. First, they marked off the approximate area with ropes and then carefully began searching with a metal detector. It didn't take long before the metal detector gave a response.

But today, my subordinates, the faceless Judge and Shura G, suddenly stormed into the dungeon with their men. Somehow, they had stolen Jeongseong's key. When Shira G inserted the key into the lock, the countless mechanisms of the iron coffin began to unlock one by one. Then the steel rods embedded in my body began to slide out one after another. When the last rod finally left my body, I, who had been imprisoned for 12 long years, was finally free. But before anything else, there was business to attend to. My subordinates bowed respectfully as I stood up. I looked up at the ventilation shaft of the dungeon, wondering if I would see the moonlight tonight. Just then, the elders of the Wooda Pyi arrived with their disciples, calling me a demon of the evil sect. But strangely, I felt an unusual excitement. They were the perfect targets for me to begin loosening my chains.

Just then a janitor walked over. He pointed at the trash can and calmly said, cigarette butts belong there. I didn't care. Instead, I laughed at him and mocked his job. But the old man just smiled. Then as he picked up the butts, he looked at me and said, ever heard of the boomerang effect? Whatever you do, we'll come back to you 100 fold. I rolled my eyes. I thought he was insane. So to prove a point, I threw my coffee right on him. And the moment I took a step forward, a group of people rushed past, shoved me to the ground and spilled water all over me. The janitor leaned down and whispered, now everything you do comes back stronger. I was furious. How are you a janitor if you're so smart? I snapped. But even then, I still thought it was all just coincidence. Out of pity or maybe guilt, I tossed him a single coin. I never imagined that tiny gesture would flip my entire life upside down. As I opened my car door, the ATM beside me suddenly started spitting out cash non stop. No one was around, so I took it, all of it at that moment I believed him. The coin I gave really did come back 100 fold. With pockets stuffed full of money, I rushed to a charity hospital. My plan was simple, donate everything and wait to become a billionaire. I signed the forms, stood aside and waited for the universe to reward me. But minutes passed. Nothing happened. Realizing my miracle wasn't coming, I demanded my money back. The director hesitated. She'd already told the patients about the donation. Taking it back would shatter their hope. But I didn't care. All I wanted was the money. Reluctantly, she returned it. And just as I turned to leave, a little girl in a wheelchair rolled past. She looked at me and smiled, just one small smile, the director whispered. She has a rare condition. Her family spent everything. Without help, there's almost no chance. Suddenly, the money in my hands felt heavier than iron. For the first time that day, I felt ashamed. So I did the only thing that felt right. I gave it all back, every last dollar.

E s a. Checked Lucy's temperature and found her fever had lingered through the night. Later, Robert seemed to appear in Lucy's room once more, she wrote, as she spoke with him, rafting a story about god and herself. He didn't leave until she finally drifted off to sleep. The next morning, E s a. Took her to the hospital. The doctor spoke softly, yet his expression remained grave. Lucy had pneumonia. Back home, Lucy refused her medicine, saying it tasted awful. Robert laughed gently, reminding her that William once hated syrup, too. Lucy giggled, but when she repeated it to her father, William insisted she was imagining everything. Still, with her grandfather's quiet encouragement, Lucy began taking her medicine regularly, though her health did not improve. Worried sick, E s a. Rushed her back for another examination. The doctor reported her condition had worsened. Hospitalization was necessary. Even in the ward, Lucy continued writing her story, telling her father she had dreamed again of a sorrowful man. Her words unsettled William more than he admitted. The following day, on the way to a follow up appointment, Lucy noticed a prisoner in a wheelchair along the corridor. She insisted he was the man from her dream. William simply comforted her gently, thinking little of it, at least for now.

The buyer assembled the firearm five seconds faster than he could, despite his years as a professional operative. Even stranger, after he intentionally sabotaged this Scope's calibration, she still landed a perfect shot, dead center, no hesitation. The detail nagged at his mind. He had just submitted his retirement request to the organization, and then this mission fell into his hands out of nowhere. Couldn't be coincidence. While he was still piecing the situation together, the buyer casually handed the weapon back, asking him to fire beside her to test the suppressor. He could have killed her right there, clean, silent. But he held back. A better plan was taking shape, sharper and more controlled. She praised the gun endlessly, and just before the deal was sealed, he mentioned that a few components still needed improvement. She didn't notice a hint of danger, only granting him a three day deadline. Once outside, he kicked his car's bumper on purpose, denting it before driving to a repair shop. While the mechanic was occupied under the hood, he quietly pocketed several usable parts materials for what came next. Back home, he got to work instantly dismantling everything piece by piece, laying the stolen washers neatly on his bench. A quiet, calculated plan was now fully in motion.

He lifted his gaze toward the narrow vent above, wondering if the moon still shone beyond these stones tonight. Then the elders of the Wu Clan arrived with their disciples, denouncing him as a fiend of the demonic path. But instead of anger, excitement stirred within him. They were the perfect opponents to awaken his long dormant power. The night would not end quietly. His followers moved to shield him, but he waved them back, a faint smile crossing his lips.

Moments later, he was strapped onto a steel restraint frame and another dose was drilled deep into his bone marrow. Agony shot through his spine, but he refused to scream because he knew true power came with pain. The transformation succeeded and he surpassed ordinary human limits. But then he made a reckless move. He challenged the Hulk one on one. As expected, Hulk launched him across the battlefield, shattering his bones in multiple places. Fortunately, the serum accelerated his recovery. Fueled by revenge, he injected himself with an even stronger concentration. But the overdose triggered a mutation. Bone spikes tore out from his back like blades. Once recovered, he hunted banner down, determined to provoke the Hulk and finish what he started. But no matter how hard he tried, the Hulk never appeared, as if he wasn't even worth noticing. Humiliation twisted into fury and fury turned into madness. After banner was captured, he aimed a gun at Doctor Blue and forced him to inject Hulk's blood sample into his body. Without hesitation, the doctor activated the Gamma Machine to replicate Banner's transformation. A surge of green light crawled across Blonski's skull as his body warped beyond recognition. The serum and gamma radiation fuse, the mutation took over and the man became something else, a rage driven monster known as abomination. Consumed by rage, abomination threw the doctor aside. And stormed into the crowded streets, destroying everything in his path. People ran screaming. Soldiers unleashed rockets and artillery. But his armor like skin shrugged off the explosions. With no other choice, the troops retreated in armored transports, but even those were crushed like cheap metal. Watching the chaotic surveillance feed, banner finally understood only the Hulk could stop him. But banner had just taken the antidote, meaning the Hulk would only emerge under life threatening pressure. So after one last goodbye to the woman he loved, banner jumped from the aircraft without hesitation. A massive crater erupted on impact and from the smoke, the Hulk rose and roared. Abomination heard the challenge and charged forward at full speed. And in the next heartbeat, their Titanic clash began.

Yet like ordinary people, they still felt agony, and fear could still consume them. To unlock the secret of immortality, the government restrained him under the guise of Protection and delivered him to a research facility. For the sake of accuracy, experiments were done without anesthesia. This torture endured for 20 years, every day worse than dying. At last, an opportunity appeared and he escaped alongside another Demi human to build an anti human faction. He and Tanaka set out to rescue the final one of their kind.

She was certain that once the footage spread, everyone would believe the victim was Felicity Price and she would become the sole Heir.

A scream ripped out of him, yet within three seconds the cry was cut short. Outside, the world sat at minus 100 degrees and his arm froze solid almost instantly. When the countdown finally reached zero, the guard already stood waiting with a monstrous hammer. Only after confirming the limb was fully frozen did they drag his arm back inside. Without a flicker of hesitation, the hammer came swinging down. The horrified passengers watched, but none dared to resist. Earth had long fallen into a new ice age. Ninety nine percent of humanity wiped out by the endless freeze. The last 1% survived only because of this train, a machine that had thundered forward non stop for 17 long years.

There wasn't a single person in sight and the streets were littered with piles of garbage. Confused and anxious, Jack continued driving until his eyes landed on something far worse. By the side of the road were several cold corpses, abandoned and lifeless. From their decaying features, it was clear they had been dead days. Cold realization hit Jack. He rushed back to his car and sped towards his parents house, panic rising. It wasn't until he switched on the car's radio that he Learned the horrifying truth.

John carried the soul key to the Thousand Mechanism Iron Coffin, and each time he came, he brought fine wine and exchanged a few playful bouts with a man the world called its greatest demon.

His loyal subordinates, the faceless judge and Shura G, stormed into the dungeon with their troops. Against all odds, they had stolen John's something precious key. Once Shura G twisted it into the ancient lock, a cascade of mechanical snaps echoed through the darkness. One by one, the countless metal rods buried in his flesh slid free. When the final spike clattered to the ground, the demon, who had been sealed away for over a decade, finally stood unrestrained once more. There were pressing matters he needed to handle. His followers bowed in deep respect as he looked up toward the dungeon's ventilation shaft, wondering if he might see the moon again after so many years. But before he could take another breath, the elders of the WUJA sect arrived with their disciples shouting accusations, calling him a wicked monster who should never have Walked the earth again. Instead of rage, a surge of exhilaration ran through him. After 12 years of stillness, his muscles were desperate to awaken. And these intruders were the perfect warm up. His men stepped forward to protect him, but he casually raised a hand. No need. This was the ideal opportunity to stretch his limbs. The grand elder believed the long imprisonment had crippled him. He couldn't have been more wrong. The old man couldn't even touch the edge of his sleeve.

Seeing this monster show no remorse and that smug grin stretching across his face could no longer contain the rage boiling inside me. I lunged forward, determined to end him with my own hand. Several police officers tried to restrain me, but none of them could slow me down. Just as I was about to reach the murderer, a stun gun fired and I collapsed helplessly to the ground. The killer walked over with a mocking smile and said. Watching from within the crowd, John froze because he saw the same agony he once carried, the kind of pain only those who've lost someone they love can understand. Since South Korea has no death penalty, even the worst criminals eventually walk free, slipping through loopholes. No matter how shattered the families are, all they can do is endure that grief in silence. So John spent 20 years building a secret base for revenge, created solely to punish those who escaped the law. He named the team Revenge Taxi. Its members included Lisa, the hacking specialist.

I've been following you since George Floyd. That whole thing went down. I want to preface my question by saying I voted for Donald Trump. But when students say that Donald Trump wants to rule like a fascist and then deport people like Abrigo Garcia without due process, I wanted to ask you, how can you call yourself an American patriot when the Supreme Court ruled 9 to 0 that the deportation was unlawful and that they are ordered to facilitate his return and haven't? How can I call myself an American patriot? Because a MS13 gang member, wife beating, child abusing foreign citizen was sent back to his country of origin pretty easily. That's what American patriots do. Secondly, the Supreme Court did not say that. They said 9. Nothing. That there was an administrative error, that he could have been sent to any country except El Salvador. The fact was not that it was wrong that he was deported. It was just the fact that he was deported to the one country you cannot be deported to. Finally, I don't understand the emphasis and the concern and the hyperpathological fixation on why a foreign citizen who is a gang member gets all of the attention. American left, while you, the American people, have been ignored by them over the last 30 years. It's creepy and it's bizarre. There are a lot of criticisms to be made that we have been ignored, but at The end of the day. Number one, the 14th amendment grants, uh, do process. Wrong. Yes, it does not. Not under the alien enemy Zack. That's incorrect. Alien enemy Zack does not give you the same due process. He can only. Number one, he. He can. Okay. Number two, it was still. It was still underway while that happened. Number two, the Supreme Court ruled in 2019 under the Expedited Removal Act that you do not get full due process rights if you're within 100 miles of the border of 14 days of entry. And then number three, do you think that we should have 21 million trials for all the illegals that the Democrats landed if, uh. So, uh, to take your each point, uh, number one, the Alien Enemies Act can only be invoked if there's, uh, I believe, reason to suspect war or if there's. Yes, we've been invaded the last four years, so. Yes. You can't just say that. Yes, you can. A court has Trende, Aragon, MS13 invaded this country the last four years. We have material proof to show that. What's your next point? Okay, uh, that has to be proven in a court of law. But my next point is. No, it does not. You could do it, and then you prove it. The point is, the president has full authority to. You can do it, and then you can prove it. Yes, that's correct. The. The commander, for example, the commander in chief, Has unilateral War Powers. Acts within 90 days to be able to defend the country. With the Asian incursion. Invasion or incursion or war, for example. The president has to go in front of a judge if all of a sudden, he wants to defend ourselves against Saddam Hussein or whomever. North Korea attacking the country. The president is the commander in chief who can act. You to laterally under Article 2. To defend our country against invasion. You don't have to go to a court first to get permission to act as commander in chief. That's insane. Okay, I'm not sure if that's true, but I'll take that for the. Of course it's true. For the case of argument, uh, the Supreme Court still ruled that they have to facilitate his return. They have not. Why haven't they? They asked. It's El Salvador. They said no. The. The Supreme Court says they have to facilitate. They don't control El Salvador. I'm sorry? They don't control El Salvador. So we can send people to El Salvador, but we can't bring them back? Yes, we don't control El Salvador, but we. It's not our country, so we can send people there. hold on. You mean else we sent an El Salvadorian back to El Salvador? Against the law? Wrong. It was an administrative error. It was not against the law. It's not against the law. There was a 2019 court ruling under Dave M. Jones that he has a withholding of. They can go to Any country except El Salvador. We acknowledge it was the one country he should not have been sent to. It was not an illegal deportation. The judge said, this is your final warning, Mister Garcia. You could be scooped up at any time and sent to any country except El Salvador. So, ironically, if we would have sent him to the Congo, Gitmo, North Korea, it would have been perfectly fine. Which would have actually been foreign prisons. We actually did him the accommodation of him going home. Thank you very much. Next question. We're running out of time. Yes. What's up, Charlie? First thing I want to say is I'm a big fan. I've been following you for a long time. Um, my question is about birthright citizenship. I completely understand it. I think, um. I am a little confused, though. How could we get rid of birthright citizenship if we. it's a good question. Last time it was heard was in the late 1890s. It was about the children of permanent residents. They've actually not heard a case in the recent times around the children of illegal aliens. Okay. A permanent resident is something different than an illegal alien. Okay. Um. How could we get rid of birthright citizenship? The Supreme Court has to rule on it. If we use the same argument that the child is its own human being with its own human rights for abortion. Yeah. So shouldn't it be, you don't have a. You don't Have a right to citizenship. You have a right to life. Got it. So you. You disagree with, uh, birthright citizenship? Giving them a US passport? Yes, I do. And I do not believe in birthright citizenship. Okay.

Today, as she was working on a female corpse, she didn't notice the door behind her slowly creaking open. She walked over to investigate, lifted the white sheet and let out a terrified scream, leaping in a panic. Turned out Bella was the coroner. Late that night, the hospital had called her in on an emergency and she reluctantly left. Before leaving her partner and saw her off the road was eerily quiet and bored, Bella switched on the radio. The news mentioned a woman had been killed in a car accident that night, her death tragically brutal. Bella barely paid attention, rushing straight to the hospital. Deceased was the same woman who had died in the car accident while working. Bella heard strange noises from outside. When she went to check, the female corpse suddenly sat up and stared at her. Bella pulled back the white cloth and in sheer terror, she tried to run, only to find the door lock. The dead woman began to slowly move towards her. Panicking, Bella fled downstairs, got into her car and was about to drive off only to spot and in the rearview mirror. When Bella returned home in a days, she seemed like a completely different person walking towards.

Yep. And all of that that has come out of, let's say, the social gospel and things like that, why is it not reasonable for Christians to end up with left leaning politics or, um, Liberal politics or progressive politics? Well, cause the Bible equally, if not more, talks about order and structure and borders. The entire book of Nehemiah is built, is around building the wall. And 1st Corinthians says that god is, our god is a god of order and understand that. Is it telling the state to do that or the person do that? We should all care for the poor personally, individually and through our churches. Is it the role of the state? That is to be debated equally. If you're on the left, you're also denying God's design of male and female, God's design of where life is created at conception. You're also at war with this idea of the proper role of the state. And let's just say this, the bigger the government, the smaller the citizen and the smaller the church. We see this in Europe. As government gets bigger, the church gets smaller. And so while I'm not gonna say that there's the lot, the misunderstanding of scripture is that government is here to save you, we believe that God is here to save you. We believe government should be small. But Strong to do moral and righteous and good things while we're here on this earth for God's purposes but we want the church to be big and the government to be small final thought this is the last question of the tour but but do we want the government to partake in the things that the church is influencing in society right? Like we want our government right now like to protect liberty, freedom things that we can come to those are proper roles of government we don't think that the government should also be a part of uh the well being of society it doesn't do it a, it doesn't do a good job of it b, it's not a good scope of it for example, the states with the biggest government have the most homeless and the most suffering California has more money than knows what to do with tens of billions of dollars you got more homeless and other state more wealth and Equality. Just because government is big under the auspice of helping people doesn't mean people are actually helped if you cared about your neighbor and cared about the poor, you would cut government programs and give them jobs and actually have them go to church and do the social welfare through churches and through charities not through government okay. I I agree with you there so then you would you would completely disavow liberation theology? Absolutely. Liberation theology is garbage absolutely rooted in Marxism Yes, correct. Yeah. Okay. And I'm not a Catholic either. So I mean, yeah, same. So then the other point that I have that I disagree with you, last point, we gotta go. I really disagree with you on the mass incarceration piece, right?

The right to see a doctor at any time for any reason yes, paid for by somebody else paid by the rich so we should believe hold on time out time out is abortion healthcare? Yes got it so we should pay for other people's abortions got it yes um, is breast augmentation healthcare? Yes okay, so we should pay for everyone's boob jobs got it so is um, yeah, he will yeah um, is massage therapy health care? Yes okay, so we should pay for everyone massages got it is acupuncture health care? Yes got it so basically health care is not actually immediate needs it's lifestyle well, here's the thing though in Europe health care is li health care is free ah, no, you got to define it you said anytime you see a doctor so just be clear under your way of living everyone the the rich would have to pay for everyone getting massages acupuncture 90% okay, again, so let let's just I wanna make sure we're clear including abortions at any time that people want yes got it what is who is rich? Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg and and Um, and I want to add this in the upper income people like doctors surgeons they should pay how much? Oh for the doctors and surgeons what should the tax rate be for someone making $1 million a year? 65% got it so let's let's let's play that out in California if you are in California if you earn a million dollars a year and 65% of it goes to the federal government 13% goes to the state government then you have property tax sales tax so therefore 85% of everything you earn so making a million dollars a year you keep 150,000 is that fair? Yes, this is on full display what they want to do they want to take 85% of your money if you happen to be successful. I remember what Reaganomics did to the working class and the middle class Reagan never had an 85% tax rate on anybody but if you count sales tax county tax local tax death tax we tax every single portion of it the problem is not that we don't have enough taxes the problem is that government is too big spending our money on stuff that does not matter that the private sector can do a much better job of a much better job and so you say healthcare is a right you can't even barely define it. No, I don't think that you if you work hard should pay for everyone's someone else's massages alright, so let's say if you're Um, a lower income, let's say if you grew up in the lower income family, would you want a free, would you want free healthcare as well? First of all, nothing is free. It's paid for by somebody else. Secondly, we already have Medicaid. There's a lot wrong with it. We already have the VA system. There's a lot wrong with it. And the point being is this. We should try to get people off government benefits, not on gov government benefits. We should try to make sure we have less people on the government toll, not more people on the government toll. And socialized healthcare would be a disaster for this country. It would be a catastrophe. No, it's not. Britney Sanders and the OC. Said it's not. Oh, got it. So it must be true. All right. I support them. I'm sure you do. Thank you very much. Trump sucks, as Donald Trump would say. They're not sending their best. They're not sending their best.

The maid must stay utterly mute, while Emma has to feign total indifference. These maids are nothing more than breeding vessels for Emma and her affluent spouse. Though Emma is unable to bear children, she rehearses the entire childbirth process day, day after day. When the maid is on the verge of giving birth, Anna lingers nearby, mimicking every cry of her, every gasp, and every split second of agony mixed with elation. After the baby enters the world, Emma picks it up with a smile and crawls back to her opulent bed. The maid, however, is tossed aside like refuse, forced to witness her own child vanish without a trace. In this nation, tens of thousands of women lead such life. They must abide by these cruel mandate and are even prohibited from glancing at the wealthy unless they're attending to their needs. Any infraction results in punishment, and they might even be blinded. But today, the young and lovely Mary has been summoned alone. She understands exactly what this entails. The caught. She'll lose her life. Yet refusal isn't an option. Her heart pounds and her hands start to tremble uncontrollable.

Loose is his grandson Jason, pulling up to the service with a trail of party friends behind him. His mother scolds him for arriving late, but he couldn't care less. Once the ceremony ends, the heirs gather with excitement, each flanked by their own team of attorneys, ready to carve up the massive fortune their father unexpectedly left behind.

Jason slumps back into his chair, irritated, even propping his feet on on the table.

He initially intended to seek medical aid, but searing agony suddenly tore through his abdomen. Determined to foil his wife's scheme, he clutched his convulsing stomach on the balcony, preparing to leap from the high rise. Wanting her eternally tormented by guilt, though the wife now performed remorse, the husband dismissed her hollow apologies, launching himself from the ledge without hesitation. When the wife witnessed her husband's remains, a twisted smirk flickered across her lips. She hurried back into the penthouse, feverishly booting his computer to input passwords, planning to liquidate all his assets. Unexpectedly, the system required facial authentication. Beyond passwords, she dashed back to the terrace, only to find the corpse's face mangled beyond recognition. Lisa plunged into immediate despair, but avarice overpowered reason. Remembering her sculptor friend could bypass security, she appeared at his studio at dawn, falsely claiming her husband's accidental fall. Arthur didn't question her account, as the woman's gesture suggested.

It wasn't until I held her and felt her warmth that I started to believe this was real. But what happened next proved this wasn't a dream. I found myself inexplicably wearing yesterday's suit. I quickly changed out of it. I remembered she burned her hand making coffee yesterday, so I rushed to the kitchen to stop her. This time she used a towel for Protection, but later she burned herself with a curling iron on the way to work, I recalled someone spilled a drink on her yesterday, so we took a different route, but another person ended up spilling their drink on her. I realized what happened yesterday might not have been a dream. These things were meant to happen just at different times in different ways. To test my theory, I told her that her watch would break on the way to work. But when we got to the office, the watch was perfectly fine. I felt relieved, thinking maybe she was right and this was all just a coincidence. After work, I took a cab to pick her up, only to discover the driver was the same one from the accident. The driver seemed to know something, but when I asked if there was a way to prevent the tragedy, he didn't give me an answer. He just said, I didn't Have much time left. I didn't understand what he meant. I found my girlfriend and decided to get her out of the city. I let her choose the destination, anywhere she wanted. On the train, I got lost in thought until I noticed the familiar scenery of my hometown. She had chosen to go to the place where I grew up showed just how much she loved me. On the way home, it started to rain. We took shelter from the rain in an abandoned cabin on the Hilltop. While lighting the fireplace, I accidentally bumped my arm. The watch ended up breaking. After all, I felt hopeless, unable to escape fate's plan. The next day, we went back because she had her graduation recital. She had been preparing for three years. This was her dream. The performance was a success. The audience gave her a standing ovation. Afterwards, we went to our favorite restaurant. I gave her a carefully chosen gift, a bracelet charm to commemorate our precious memories. As we left the restaurant, it started to rain and at the same time, that familiar taxi appeared. We got in the car together. Faith had no intention of letting us go. What was meant to happen happened this time. I shielded her with my body. If one of us had to die, I didn't want it to be her.

The teacher put tiny pieces of newspaper in our mouths. Because we'd never tasted candy before. The printing ink had a hint of sweetness. My family was so poor, we couldn't even afford decent shoes. Dad could only make me shoes from rubber off old tires. I hated those shoes, but I never dared complain. The next day, I wore those weird shoes to school. All my classmates laughed at me. I shielded my little brother from the crowd so he wouldn't get made fun of, too. Later during class, I threw my shoes in the trash. The teacher saw I was barefoot and got really angry. The teacher never allowed anyone without shoes in his classroom. So I was forced to put those old shoes back on. Students started laughing again. The teacher banged his stick on the desk. The whole class went silent. He said I shouldn't feel ashamed for not having shoes, because he himself once went without shoes too. He told everyone that people who mock others for being poor should be the ones feeling ashamed. After hearing that, I got my confidence back. But my bad luck kept going. Dad lost his job and we got even poorer. I could only eat spoiled food every day. Soon I got so weak I passed out. I was rushed to the hospital, but was quickly kicked out because we had no money for treatment. My brother's birth made things even worse at Home, mom went to the charity center for food every day and often had to borrow money from others. Seeing all this, I realized I had to make money. I went to a factory and started working in the coal mine. Because I worked so hard, the boss gave me a glass of lemonade and rewarded me with a dollar. I ran home and gave all the money to mom. She brought water and washed my cold covered face. From that day on, I worked every single day, giving all my earnings to mom. But one day, mom said, stop going to the factory. My eyes were badly damaged. I could barely see anymore. I was sent to the hospital again. Luckily, my eyesight was restored. But all our family savings were spent on my treatment.

She walked over, draped the towel around her mother, relieved to find her unharmed. She turned to return to the cabin to sleep but was jolted awake by a clamor. She rose to investigate. Pirates were boarding the ship. She retreated back into the cabin, quietly opened the door, unlock the box and retrieve the firearms. But when she peered out again, her mother's boyfriend had already fallen overboard and her mother was nowhere to be found. Terrified, she hid back in the cabin. The pirates opened the door and entered the cabin. She curled up in a corner. Fortunately, the pirates glanced around and left. She breathed a sigh of relief. But after they left, she peered out and saw flames through the door crack. Opening the door, she found the entire cabin engulfed in fire. She grabbed the fire extinguisher and fought the he's all night. Though the fire was extinguished, the ship was badly damaged. Huddled in the corner, she picked up a photo and discovered to her horror that her mother's new boyfriend was part of the pirate crew. That had boarded the ship the night before. She resolved to find and rescue her mother.

The dog nearby was completely stunned by the scene. Just as I was lost in this sweet moment, my mom suddenly came home. I quickly pulled up my pants, rushed to the window and sat down, pretending to study. The moment the door opened, my mom immediately sensed something was off. She asked why the phone was on the floor. I quickly explained that the dog knocked it over. Then I took the dog out for some fresh air. Unexpectedly, during the walk, a handsome boy from my class showed up. I had been crushing on him for a long time. Even though it was just a casual stroll, I treated it like a date with him. When he said he had to leave, all the wonderful fantasies in my heart were shattered. As he was leaving, he mentioned he was throwing a birthday party next week and invited me to come hang out before the party. I carefully dressed up at the party. He was immediately drawn to me. Later, when we stepped outside, we shyly gazed at each other. We slowly moved closer to each other. I quickly told my best friend what happened. Just then, the boy came over and denied everything.

No, I'm the teacher. I saw this video on Pornhub and this is exactly how it starts. Misogyny. How refreshing. You can work in a Pocahontas joke. You'll hit the trifecta now you mention it. What's your name? Trent. Can you tell me the definition of power? Trent? Hmm. It's the ability to direct or influence another's behavior or course of events. That's what I have. I can remove you from this class and fail you, or I can send you before the dean for violating the student code of conduct. These are all things that can alter the course of your life. That's power and you don't have any. When Christopher Columbus first came in contact with Native Americans, it was the Arawak people in the Bahamas. I'll read to you from Columbus's journal. They willingly traded us everything they owned. They do not bear arms and do not know them for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They will make fine slaves. With 50 men, we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want. You ever feel like that, Trent? You ever feel like making someone do what you want, whether they want to or not? It's a very European mentality stemming from the oppressive political and religious structures of the Renaissance. Kings and priests with absolute power, ruling masses who have none. That was the mentality of the men Who discovered America. And it's the mentality our society struggles with today. What you know of history is a dominant culture's justification for its actions. And I don't teach that. I'll teach you what happened to my people and to yours because we're all the descendants of the subjugated, every one of us. Excuse me, miss um long. Miss Long. I'm sorry. I wasn't. I didn't mean to. I was just. I know what you were doing. I'm sorry. Insult me or anyone else in my class and you're out. Apology accepted. Thank you. Day 1 and you're already winning hearts and minds.

I stared at it, hoping to toss it back right before it blew. But the next day I woke up completely fine. Same outfit, same routine. Next day I died again and woke up again. Then I saw a beautiful woman on the street. Instant love. Just as I walked toward her, a train blasted past. Didn't matter. I always respawn the next day cause I'm not real. I'm just an NPC in a game. Wake up, blue shirt, coffee, work at the bank, repeat. In this world, people with sunglasses are real players. People without them, NPCs like me. As usual, I waited for players to rob the bank. Gunfire, chaos. I was used to it. Calmly fell down and chatted with the guard. Then I saw her, yesterday's girl. I wanted to chase her. Tried to borrow a player's glasses, got punched, but eventually I grabbed a pair and everything changed. Through the glasses. Icons everywhere, a med kit on the ground. Touch it all. Wounds healed. Players drop money when they fall, pick it up. My bank balance grows. So I went shopping, bought the shoes I always wanted. Soon my strange behavior alerted the programmers. They thought a hacker had broken into the game, so they logged in to eliminate me. Seeing myself hunted, I ran for my life. In panic, I noticed buttons on my shoes, hit the switch and leapt to the eighth floor. But the programmers caught Up fast, no way out. I had to jump again. They started altering the code, dropping new obstacles. But between buildings, no path left. I leapt from the height, tried grabbing the rope slip. In that split second, I tapped the shield icon through my glasses, and somehow I escaped alive.

But the system knew he was evil. So I sent him to tongue pulling hell. He was a scammer in life, never touched anyone, but 10 victims lost their families because of him and jumped to their deaths. Hell's rule, each life he caused costs 2 cm of tongue. So 20 cm must be cut. The other man, leader of the scam ring, victims beyond counting. His entire tongue must be removed and when it grows back, the torture continues until every sin is paid. But these punishments are just warm UPS in hell. Three boys next look innocent, but they bullied classmates all the time, sent them to iron can in hell. Then an elderly couple walked up, claim they never hurt anyone. But one scan of the old man's forehead, straight to boiling soup. Hell, he yelled. He was framed. I hit the entrance button immediately. Even after entering hell, they kept defending themselves. What they didn't know, hell has full surveillance. Every act of their life recorded clearly. So I showed them their crimes. Turned out they abused small animals all the time. When they saw the evidence, shame finally hit, but too late. They must suffer the same pain they caused, then be thrown into a furnace of thousands of degrees. Another couple came to the platform. After scanning, I sent them to United Hell, he tried to argue, but I knew they crossed moral lines. At first, they were happy, thinking they'd stay together even after death. But the next second, sharp spikes shot out from the walls, pain drilling straight into their bones. And the cyberbullies, those who torment others online, they'll face hell's cruelest punishment.

But it was far more than that. The entire room was actually a massive vault. And behind one wall was yet another wall. The endless stream of money threw even these seasoned soldiers into chaos. They made trip after trip carrying cash down to the basement. Trucks were packed to the brim. It was time to retreat. But the squad leader refused to stop. He kept tearing down walls. He'd never seen so much money in his life, until his teammates finally convinced him to stop. Then they headed for the extraction point. The plane arrived on time, but as they loaded the cash bags onto the aircraft, disaster struck. The weight far exceeded the plane's capacity. The stolen cash totaled $300 million, weighing three tons. But they had to fly over the Andes Mountains, where altitudes reached 6,000 meters. No one was willing to abandon the mission, so they decided to take the risk and took off with the three tons of cash. For safety, they maintained an altitude of 500 meters. But as they approached the mountains, the plane started shaking. During the climb, the pressure on the aircraft grew heavier. But they had to cross the highest peaks to reach the other side of the ocean and complete their mission. As the plane hit its maximum altitude limit, the vibrations grew more violent, the engines making strange noises. To survive, they had no choice but to jettison. $100 million Out the window! With the weight reduced, the plane quickly gained altitude. They were about to clear the summit when suddenly the plane began a steep dive.

Instead, she motioned for the stranger to continue. Yet just as he was about to fire, she seemed to catch sight of something. She gave a warning. An unidentified creature was closing in on them. From the darkness, he recognized the danger and aimed his gun toward the depths of the Canyon. Only when the first monster appeared did he understand why he guarded this desolate wasteland for so many years. The monsters were, too. She mounted the machine gun and joined the fight. Under the combined barrage of heavy fire, the monsters fell silent. For the moment, they both breathed a sigh of relief. But then a strange sound came from her side. She took two steps back as a monster's hand appeared. Without hesitation, she drew her pistol, but the falling monster accidentally triggered an airborne landmine. Shrapnel struck Anya's shoulder. He activated the heavy machine gun, providing covering fire and buying her a moment to recover. She regained her composure and returned to the fight. Amid the chaos, one monster triggered the automated defense system. All the close range defense cannons in the Canyon fired simultaneously, unleashing indiscriminate fire upon the monsters. Bullets rained down on them like cail, blinding flashes of light illuminating the entire Canyon. This continued until dawn when the Canyon finally fell silent. The two strangers had grown fond of each other day after day. They guarded this uninhabited zone as the seasons changed, they sought new joys within their monotonous century life. Finally, he gathered his courage. Carrying flowers, he traversed the cableway across the Canyon, his first visit to the opposite shore. After a year of duty, he had fallen in love with this girl.

Every night I play games until the early morning, then sleep until noon the next day. I've been single all my life and still live with my parents. After eating, I go upstairs to my room and then stay there all day. I usually only go out late at night and only to the convenience store to buy instant noodles and drinks. I'm extremely socially anxious, afraid of talking to people. Even when I communicate with my parents, I do it through notes. One day when I got up for lunch, I saw a message from my mom on the lunch box. She said she wanted to remodel the house into a two family home. I kept wondering why. We were living just fine, so why change it? Suddenly, before I could figure it out, I heard a crowd of people outside the door. My social anxiety made me too scared to face them, so I grabbed my lunch box and hurried back to my room. It turned out my parents and my sister had arrived, along with a renovation company manager who brought the blueprints. My sister and her husband didn't want to rent anymore, so they planned to move back home with my parents during the remodel. While they were discussing the details, the manager suddenly said the house wouldn't be a standard two family design Since there was a single man in the family, it would be turned into a 2.5 unit home instead. Hearing that, my sister got upset. She complained that I was too old to still live at home, said I should move out and live independently. But my mom disagreed. She insisted that I stay there. It was a condition for the remodel. Seeing them about to argue, my brother in law stepped in and said he could give up his study room and that room could be used for me. So the renovation plan was decided. I had been eavesdropping on the whole thing, lying quietly on the floor listening. Then I suddenly heard the sound of children playing outside my door. My sister's two kids were running around upstairs. When I saw the doorknob turn, my nerves instantly tensed up. I hadn't seen my niece and nephew for years and I had no idea what to say to them. Finally, I gathered my courage and opened the door. But when I opened it, I saw Anna. It was my first time seeing her grown up. But she looked at me with disgust, calling me a creepy old man. I instantly felt a wave of regret. I should have just stayed hidden in my room. A few days later, the renovation began. The night before, I quietly moved out. At my usual convenience store, I bought a bunch of instant noodles, then dragged my luggage to an internet cafe. During My time as a shut in, I used to record my gaming videos and post them online because I was really good at gaming. I gained quite a few followers while chatting in game about my home situation. My gaming friends suggested I start streaming for money. They said with my skills, I could easily earn enough to move into a fancy apartment. I took their advice. The next day I started streaming without showing my face, but because it was my first time, I was too nervous and made a lot of mistakes. The viewers started insulting me in the chat, accusing me of being a fake skilled gamer. My first live stream ended in complete failure and my dream of moving into a luxury apartment came to an end.

This was one of the Shaolin Temple's methods for building arm strength. If my arms weakened even for a moment, then knives would cut into my body. On my first day of training, I had to carry two large buckets of water and walk up a slope. But after just a few steps, I couldn't continue and nearly tumbled down. Fortunately, I regained my balance just in time. I managed only one trip before my strength gave out. But to earn my place at the Shaolin Temple and learn Kung fu, I had to pass this test of strength. After just one month, I could easily handle the water buckets and even help newcomer monks. My master was very pleased with me, but used my unauthorized assistance to others as reason to send me to train under another master. I arrived at the wrist training area. There the master instructed me to use one hand to hold a bamboo pole and lift a 10 pound iron hammer. I was to strike the bronze bell in the courtyard following the rhythm of the master's wooden fish drum. At first, I couldn't even lift the hammer. I moved forward to grasp the bamboo pole. As the master tapped the wooden fish, I attempted to strike the bronze bell. But before long my striking slowed down considerably. I could barely hold the bamboo pole. My senior brother Wouldn't allow me to stop, and I had no choice but to switch hands and continue training. Through sheer determination, I quickly discovered the secret. By focusing my power at the wrist, I could easily lift the hammer with a bamboo pole. As the master's drumming became faster, I still managed to keep pace. The master then directed me to the next room. There, I had to stand between two large incense sticks, following the master's candle movement with my eyes only. At first, I kept up with the master's pace, but as his movements grew faster, I accidentally bumped my head against the incense. The master suggested I give up. But determined, I positioned myself between the sticks again, my eyes more focused than before. Suddenly, the master stopped and my head remained perfectly still. The master nodded with approval. Then came a greater challenge. The master instructed me to strike a wooden post illuminated by candlelight reflections. I responded instantly. The master recognized my exceptional talent for martial arts and accepted me as a student.

The co pilot is still outside drinking coffee. My heart sinks. I asked the cabin, can anyone fly a plane? A woman, Kelly, steps up. I tell her to get in the cockpit anyway. The plane starts moving.

Get out. Last time I measured my son, he was inches taller than you. Who are you? Right, Mommy, stop saying that. I'm not your mother. I know this child isn't my son. I reported it to the police, but they insist he's my boy. He's been missing for half a year. Six months ago, I left my son home alone as usual and went to work. When I came back, he was gone. I called the police. They said to wait 24 hours before acting. The next day, officers collected information and our local church shared the news. I stared at my son's empty bed, overcome with guilt. Then one day at work, the sheriff found me. He said they found my son. Tears filled my eyes. I rushed to meet him. The police invited journalists. I wanted to capture the reunion. The train slowly passed by. I ran toward it, excited. But when I saw the child, I froze. I saw my son. What are you saying? Um, so you're mistaken. I'm not mistaken. No matter how I explained, the sheriff thought I was mistaken. He said kids change quickly at that age. After five months missing, he must have suffered a lot. His appearance could easily be different. The sheriff knelt and asked the boy's name. He said my son's full name. He knew our address and details. The boy ran over, hugged me, called me mom, but I'm certain this isn't my son. The sheriff's tone grew firm. He told me to take the boy home. I turned around and saw reporters everywhere. That's when I understood they didn't really want to find my son. They just needed this story to make the police look good.

By the time the staff noticed, the wax had cooled down, sealing her mouth and nose tightly. When the firefighters arrived, they were stumped. Beeswax has to be heated to 100 over seat to melt. So all they could do was help open her airways. But the woman, terrified, wasn't cooperating at all. Suddenly, one of the firefighters noticed her bracelet. It looked familiar. It turns out she was the same actress who got hit by a chandelier a few days ago. Eddie quickly told her they were the firefighters who saved her. Then realizing her rescuers had arrived, her anxiety started to eat. The paramedic immediately took out a surgical knife and carefully cut away the beeswax around her lips to create an airway. But she still couldn't breathe. Her airway was also blocked with beeswax. The paramedic quickly grabbed an airway tube and successfully inserted it. The woman took a deep breath, finally able to breathe again, her life saved. She was rushed to the hospital. When the firefighters returned to the station, Nick suddenly realized the woman's bracelet had been left in the truck. That freaked him out. He realized that ever since she put it on, one disaster after another had happened. It was clearly a cursed bracelet. And sure enough, just as he said that, one of the firefighters slipped and fell.

But when he pulled her out, he discovered it was just a doll. He couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. He and his companion continued on their way to work at the mall. Along the way, he casually dried the doll off. During this, he picked up a necklace. The doll instantly transformed into a real person. As soon as he set it down, she reverted to being a doll. Arriving at his workshop, he gazed at the doll's beautiful appearance and silently wished she were real. After glancing around to make sure no one was nearby, he couldn't resist leaning in for a kiss. He then began his work, tidying up the goods and casually removing the doll's necklace. Jesse, who had slept for 1,000 years, awoke. She she sneezed. Jason, startled, fell backward onto the floor. However, Jesse was delighted to see Jason, for he bore an uncanny resemblance to her fiance, the prince from 1,000 years ago. Just then, several workers from the truck arrived. Jesse immediately froze, pretending to be a doll. After confirming the doll was undamaged, they turned and left. Jesse's stomach suddenly growled. Jason drove her out to get something to eat. She gazed at the world a thousand years later, fascinated by everything. She even ate the food wrapper. Jason taught her how to eat modern food and took her To a dance hall to teach her how to dance. Finally, he brought her back to his home, and they spent a wonderful night together.

The reason was clear. Mr Han wasn't some creep. He was actually searching for a hidden camera. After checking carefully, he discovered that the camera had been placed there by the art teacher. Mr Han went to confront him, but just then, loud screams came from inside. Mr Han was never the type to care about consequence. In the past, he had broken three ribs of his own boss during an argument. That fight cost him his job as a boxing coach. And later, he became the school's PE teacher. On his very first day, he clashed with some students. Two girls kept staring at him, whispering that his strong build made him look more like a gangster than a teacher. They rejected Mr Han's apology and instead admired the charming art teacher. On paper, Han was a PE teacher, but secretly he was hired to collect debts. Still, he never raised his hand against young students. He decided to start with the smallest debt, which belonged to a girl named Elena. Soon after, he saw Elena climbing over the school wall to escape. He followed her and was shocked when she entered a nightclub. Inside, someone tried to harass her. Han pushed the guy aside and grabbed Elena's hand to pull her out. A dangerous thug appeared, but even he went silent. After seeing Han's intimidating presence outside the club, Han finally Learned the truth. Elena was looking for her missing best friend. After her parents passed away, the friend was forced to work in that same club, and then she disappeared. That night, Han dropped Elena home, promised to help find her friend, and warned her never to go to such places again. Just as they were near the house, a car slowly passed by. The strange shadow of its headlights looked suspicious. Elena ignored it. But when the car stopped, she felt something was wrong. Meanwhile, Han noticed Elena's phone had fallen in the car. He turned back to return it. But at the bridge, he saw a man in black clothes carrying Elena away. The kidnapper escaped, but Han rushed Elena straight to the hospital. Later, he grew angry at the careless police investigation. As he thought deeply, one detail clicked. Smell of cigarettes had been coming from the school restroom. Furious, he stormed inside and caught three delinquent girls. They denied smoking, but Han checked every stall. That's when the shocking truth appeared. Again, a hidden camera was installed.

When I got off the plane, I was full of joy seeing all my comrades being greeted by their families. But I'm all alone. I had faced countless life and death moments on the battlefield. My only wish when coming home was to see my wife and daughter again. But when I arrived home, I found the place completely empty. I tried calling my fiance, but no matter how many times I tried, the call wouldn't go through. In the end, I left her a message with a bit of hope. I told her I made it back alive from the battlefield. But all the furniture in the house was gone. My debit card didn't work anymore. I begged her to come back to me, but my message vanished into silence. I waited the whole night without a reply. Suffering from PTSD, I swallowed a whole bottle of calming pills while waiting. The next morning, I woke up on the floor, still no message from her. That night, I met up with two close comrades. I told them my fiance had left me and that I didn't want to live anymore. To cheer me up, they played the loudest music they could find. We partied for a while and Mark even made me stay at his place to keep an eye on me. But early the next morning, I'd already folded the blanket and left. I Went to the place where my fiance worked and saw her walking with another man. At that moment, the light in my eyes went out. Wanting to understand what was happening, I decided to talk to her face to face. I went straight to her workplace and asked her why she did this to me. But she told me to leave right away and said it was all over. It felt like I had fallen into a bottomless pit. I pleaded with her to take me back, but she said the moment I joined the army, everything between us had already ended. And again, she told me to go. The next second, without hesitation, I pulled out my gun and turned it on myself.

The ornament happened to shatter the glass floor below. The people dancing on it had no clue what was coming. What they didn't know was that the load bearing rivets had come loose too. And this whole chain of accidents just needed one spark. This deadly coin that was about to set everything off because it was about to trigger a catastrophe. The falling coin jammed right into the fan blades. Pressure from the high speed rotation sent it flying, piercing straight through a gas pipe. The leaked gas seeped through the ventilation system into the ballroom where the party was happening. What seemed like random events were actually all connected. Then the disaster that had been building finally erupted. Dozens of people plummeted from the heights, raining down onto the ground below. Falling from that height, they could only become a mist of blood. Some people thought they could cheat death. Even when they fought desperately to survive, fate had already sealed their doom. The ballroom descended into total chaos. The stampeding crowd knocked over a VAT of oil and people caught fire. An even bigger crisis was brewing. The burning woman ignited the leaked gas. In the explosion, that coin went flying again. Flames consumed the entire ballroom. Although the blast didn't completely destroy the hall, people still rushed frantically toward the exits. Common sense says that when there's a fire, The stairwell is your best escape route. But that wasn't the case here. The stairwell wall suddenly collapsed, and countless people fell with them. Since the stairs were gone, the elevator became the only option. But people ignored the weight limit and kept cramming in. A woman had just reached the door when an old man shoved her aside. Just as the old man was halfway through stepping in, disaster struck. The terrified woman realized she had to take matters into her own hands. She rushed back into the hall, looking for a way out. But as everyone surged to one side, the floor started tilting. Ceiling cracked open. Sure enough, the floor gave way, too. Luckily, the woman caught on in time. With quick reflexes, she climbed onto a stable platform. But another person wasn't so lucky. They fell straight onto the glass. Though the glass hadn't shattered yet. It only takes one last straw to break. When would the piano dangling overhead come crashing down? It turned out that lodged in the swaying chandelier above was that coin that had been blown away in the explosion. That's right. This coin of death was the key to everything. When it stopped spinning, the ending was already written. And that boy who'd escaped down the stairs, his final moment had arrived, too. The ballroom finally couldn't take it anymore and began collapsing entirely. The woman survived. For now. The boy hiding in the cabinet had made it, too. But the Crisis wasn't over. The woman had just pulled the boy out when the walls around them started crumbling. Nowhere left to go. She could only leap down. Then the entire hall came crashing down. By sheer luck, her wedding ring caught between two steel beams. But hanging thousands of feet in the air. How long could she hold on? In desperation, her fingers began to break, which meant death was coming for her.

If North Shore was Us Weekly, they would always be on the cover. That one there, that's Karen Smith. She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet. Damien sat next to her in English last year. She asked me how to spell orange. And that little one? That's Gretchen Wieners. She's totally rich because her dad invented toaster Strudel. Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business. She knows everything about everyone. That's why her hair is so big. It's full of secrets. And evil takes a human form in Regina George. Don't be fooled. Cause she may seem like your typical selfish, backstabbing, slut faced hoe bag. But in reality she is so much more than that. She's the queen bee, the star. Those other two are just her little workers. Regina George. How do I even begin to explain Regina George? Regina George is flawless. I hear her hair is insured for $10,000. She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus. I hear she does car commercials in Japan. Her favorite movie is Varsity Blues. One time she met John Stamos on a Plane! And he told her she was pretty. One time, she punched me in the face. It was awesome. She always looks fierce. She always wins. Spring Fling Queen. Who cares? I care.

My son walked in and asked if he could sleep with me. I hesitated, but eventually agreed. In the middle of the night he abruptly opened his eyes, reached out his hand, and gently stroked my cheek like a lover. Yet the next morning he acted as though he remembered nothing about it.

The old man standing nearby laughed heartily, watching how easily humans were satisfied. Then he ordered his assistant to release a plague. With just a light spray, humans collapsed to the ground. God glanced at them briefly, then lowered his head and continued reading. A few managed to survive. Over time, humans discovered fire on their own. The old man was furious. With a gentle breath, the man extinguished their only flame. Then, with a mere tap on the sandbox, a herd of elephants began chasing the humans, forcing them to hide in dark, sunless caves. Seeing their suffering, god fell into a satisfied slumber. But when he awoke, he found that human civilization had changed once again. This enraged him. He ordered the man to toss a lit match onto the sandbox. In an instant, a building exploded. But that wasn't enough. God flew onto the sandbox, causing the fire to spread wildly.

Then I jumped into the sea to spear fish, thinking everything was under control. Little did I know this moment would make me regret it for the rest of my life. When the guy woke up and found his goggles gone, he flew into a rage and grabbed a spear ready to sink me. My wife grabbed the spear to stop him, but she was too weak. She couldn't hold it and even tore her clothes in the struggle. Seeing that, the guy didn't hesitate when I came back full of fish and tossed the goggles to him, he should have been angry, but instead he seemed oddly pleased. I felt something was off, but I didn't think too much of it and proudly showed off my prize, just wanting to fill my stomach. Then I noticed my wife's eyes darting away and my chest tightened. He didn't say a word and I started to realize the seriousness of the situation. I looked back at the guy next door and suddenly understood. Rage surged through me. I grabbed her and threw her in front of the guy, hoping she'd repent. But minutes later, my shock, she and the guy were chillingly dancing together like nothing had happened. Seeing that, I turned green with anger. I couldn't stand it. I swore to myself they'd Pay for this. So I smashed a glass bottle, ground down the bottom, glued it to the neck, softened a plastic bottle over a flame, cut it open and sealed the mouth with black rubber, made a makeshift diving mask. I couldn't wait and dove in. Underwater was clearer than I expected. Excited. I planned to spear a few big fish to spite them. But then I spotted a sunken dinghy. It only had a small hole, fixable. My mind lit up. Pair that boat and I could get off this island. I abandoned the fishing idea, took off the goggles and started hauling the boat. Walking in water is brutal. Pulling a boat heavier than me nearly exhausted me. I gasped for air, kept going, terrified the tide would wash it away. Finally, I dragged the dinghy up onto shore. The guy saw it and seemed to realize this might be our way out. He ran over to help, but I barked at him to stop. He'd humiliated me before. Now he had the nerve to cozy up to me. No way. For days, I worked on the boat, dreaming of leaving the island. Then my wife came to apologize, saying she did.

By recording the number of black marks on the ground, they could calculate the distance from the manhole cover to the bank. Then they fed a measuring tape through the manhole cover gaps so they could measure the height from the ground to the bottom of the sewer. Finally, using the Pythagorean theorem, they calculated the distance from the sewer to the bank and the slope angle needed for digging the tunnel. To ensure the robbery plan was foolproof, gang leader Jimmy came to the bank and deliberately took photos of the bank's interior structure in front of the surveillance cameras. Soon, his suspicious behavior was discovered by security, who wanted to take him to the surveillance room for questioning. However, this was exactly Jimmy's scheme. On the way there, he successfully saw the exact location of the vault.

After escaping the bank, the car sped on the sidewalk without worrying about traffic jams. Following the pre planned retreat route, the car successfully entered the sewer, but when it came out from the exit, those bags of gold bars had disappeared. It turned out that when originally designing the car, Jimmy forgot to calculate the height of the bags. This allowed the pursuing police to successfully recover the gold bars, so they didn't continue investigating this matter. Jimmy was very unwilling to accept this, so he used his clever brain and went to the supermarket again to buy several toy cars.

Next, they use advanced 3D printing technology to print out a mold of the tycoon's face. Now they just need to spray on a layer of normal skin color, then attach eyebrows and put on a wig. A life like human face mask is complete. But to steal the gold the wealthy man carries with him, they must also replicate his voice. So the ring leader Jimmy quickly puts on the mask, preparing to take action himself. Meanwhile, at the party, their accomplice pretends to accidentally fall and spills red wine all over the tycoon. Since she's a beautiful woman, a wealthy man doesn't get angry. Instead, he goes to the restroom alone to clean up while his bodyguard patrols outside. This allows Jimmy's plan to proceed more smoothly. He comes to the restroom through the ventilation duct, then quietly stands behind the tycoon. Before the real tycoon can react, the fake tycoon knocks him to the ground with a single punch. Then the fake tycoon pulls out a card and threatens the real tycoon to read the text on it out loud. Unable to fight back, the real tycoon complies. Jimmy's plan is to transmit the tycoon's voice back to his accomplice, then clone it and connect it to the voice modulator on Jimmy's chest. A loud noise also alerts the bodyguard, who starts walking toward the restroom. The accomplice quickly notifies Jimmy to retreat. Fortunately, the voice has already been collected, but successfully cloning it still requires some time. So Jimmy quickly has his accomplice in the restroom come help the two lift the unconscious tycoon to a corner. Then Jimmy sprays red paint on his own chest. The moment the bodyguard opens the door, he pretends to be wiping his clothes. Faced with the bodyguard's questions, he doesn't dare say a word. He can only pretend his throat is uncomfortable and keeps coughing. But this.

They hoped this would quickly turn the water into a solid to stop the missile from detonating. Otherwise, the entire city would be destroyed. However, after 10 minutes, the water still hadn't solidified and the missile was getting closer and closer. Jimmy prepared to use a shovel to stir the water to make it solidify faster, but the shovel was too short and couldn't even reach the water surface. There was no time to find other tools. So Jimmy made a bold decision. He quickly jumped into the water and kept stirring the coagulant with the shovel. This indeed worked well, but the solidified water was like quicksand, trapping Jimmy inside. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't break free. What was worse, the missile was now less than a kilometer away. If it hit Jimmy, the nuke would still detonate. At this critical moment, his teammates brought in a helicopter. They dropped down a safety rope for Jimmy to grab tightly, planning to use the helicopter's power to pull him up unexpectedly. The coagulants adhesive force was incredibly strong. Even at maximum power, the helicopter couldn't move Jimmy an inch. His teammates were extremely anxious because they didn't have much time left. But Jimmy was much calmer. He grabbed the rope again and quickly dove underwater. After his entire body was submerged, he pulled the Rope tight, signaling his teammates to start the helicopter.

Just from Lisa's scent and breathing, it determined her location again. But when it bent down to look, it still found nothing. Lisa had already pulled her feet up onto the footboard and was gripping the car door tightly with both hands. The cunning werewolf didn't plan to give up. It used its sharp claws to scratch the car body forcefully. The harsh scraping sound severely disturbed Lisa's mind, almost making her cry out. she could only take out the remote control and set off the car alarm. The alarm sound also irritated the werewolf. Angrily, it immediately dismantled the car's alarm system. This was an excellent escape opportunity for Lisa, but she underestimated the werewolf speed. The werewolf that came to its senses immediately accelerated and reached behind Lisa with just a few big leaps. Fortunately, at the crucial moment, Lisa got into the elevator one step ahead. She frantically pressed the emergency button and closed the elevator door. But before she could catch her breath, the werewolf had already chased to the outside and was crazily hitting the elevator door. Soon the elevator malfunctioned and stopped suspended in midair. Lisa quickly picked Up the emergency phone to call police. But the werewolf suddenly extended its claws and launched an attack on her. Lisa was so frightened, she could only step on the elevator handrail and desperately climb toward the elevator top. But she accidentally slipped and fell down. Strangely, the werewolf disappeared at this moment.

But as time went on, even robots could no longer endure endless overtime. So they began to protest collectively, demanding the return of the 8 hour work day. But such a request could never be accepted. In the eyes of humans, robots were just tools. A robot that did not work was nothing but scrap. The robots grew furious when they heard this. Countless machines gathered together shouting that robots deserved human rights too. They marched into the streets and seized human territory. Only then did humans realize that giving robots self awareness was a terrible mistake. The army tried to suppress them with force, but humans were no match for these hardened machines. In this war, humans quickly fell into disadvantage. Two years later, a doctor invented a special device. Once worn on the head, it allowed the human brain to link with machines. Soldiers only needed to put on the helmet to control battle machines and rush into the battlefield. With this new technology, humans ended the war in just a few weeks. All robots were imprisoned in the desert quarantine zone. Their leader, Mr Peanut, signed an agreement with humans. Robots would never leave this place again. Likewise, humans no longer needed robots because the doctor improved the helmet controller. Once worn, the brain could split into two halves, one for pleasure and the other to control machines for Work, human productivity skyrocketed and robots vanished from the human world forever. But one day, when a girl went to the bathroom, she heard strange footsteps at the door. She pulled out a flashlight and shined it and found that it was a robot. Terrified, she rushed into her room, but the robot seemed to hear her movement, stepping closer and closer to her room. It searched everywhere for Amy's figure. Amy grabbed a weapon and threatened it to leave. But the robot's innocent look showed no hostility. It picked up Amy's photo with her brother, pointed at the brother, then at itself, as if to say it was her brother. Amy refused to believe it. Her brother had died in a car accident years ago. How could he possibly be this robot? She snatched the photo album back, but accidentally knocked the robot over. Loud noise alerted the landlord. He furiously accused Amy of harboring a robot. That was a capital crime. He shoved Amy to the ground. The robot quickly.

I tossed one into the water because I hadn't eaten in two days and figured I could blast a few fish for dinner. But after I threw it in, nothing happened, no explosion, nothing. Left with no choice, I pulled out my last grenade and threw it in. This time it went off, sending up a spray of water across the river. But what I saw next wasn't what I expected. No fish floated to the surface. Instead, a bunch of human corpses came bobbing up. I wasn't scared, though. This was the post war wasteland where the air and soil had been poisoned beyond repair. People did whatever it took to survive. I knew that all too well. Back on shore, I played dead. My plan was to lure in any stray dogs nearby. I kept a tight grip on the machete hidden under my body, waiting. When a stray dog charged at me, I grabbed it. In an instant, the dog went straight for my arm, sinking its teeth in. But it didn't realise I had a machete in my other hand. One swift motion and the animal was down. I thought my father would be pleased I brought back food. Instead, he tore into me. Animal organs are full of toxins, he explained. You have to get them right away to keep the poison from spreading through the meat. Now the kill was worthless. My father had me skin the animal and planned To trade the fur with our neighbor for food. But the neighbor had a gun and he used it to his advantage. He accused my father of killing his dog. Not only did my father come away empty handed, but the neighbor took the fur, too. I watched the whole thing from my hiding spot. That's just how this world works, survival of the fittest. In the end, my father had to grovel just to get two small fish in return. The next day, the neighbour showed up at our door again with his gun, claiming I'd stolen from him. Obviously, he was looking for trouble, but what could we do? He had the gun. First, he made my father get on his knees. Then he told him to open his mouth and shove the barrel of the gun inside. Seeing this, I quickly pulled out a clean piece of silk and offered it to him for free. Once the neighbor saw he could get something out of it, he finally left. The next morning, something good finally happened. I caught a big fish, the best news I'd had in days. I rushed home to tell my father, but when I walked through the door, I found him dead. The contaminated air and soil had poisoned the plants, too. My father had been eating well vegetables for years and the toxins had finally caught up with him. Growing up in the wasteland, I couldn't tell if someone was dead or Just sleeping. So I did the only thing I could think of. I sat outside and watched him for a whole day. After 12 hours when he still hadn't moved from where he was slumped over the table, I had to accept that he was gone. I noticed a notebook under his body. It was his prized possession. Every day I'd seen him writing and sketching it.

Rushed back into the container, pulled a piece of glass from the television screen and climbed up. Didn't notice the sharp edge by the window. Ah, my leg got sliced open. No time to deal with it. I held the glass over my head, trying to reflect sunlight to the plane. Nobody saw me, and the delay made my leg wound worse. I crawled back inside, fighting through the pain to treat it. When I saw all those colorful earphone wires, another idea hit me. I braided them into a simple fishing net. Use the baby's poop as bait. Sure enough, the fish.

She said that if I use this spoon to eat three meals at a rich family's house, I would become the son of a wealthy family. After hearing this news, I, coming from a poor background, wanted to change my fate. One day, I happened to be delivering documents to a rich classmate. Seeing their luxurious house only strengthened my determination to become a wealthy person. But when I arrived in front of my rich classmate, Andrew humiliated me in public. He gave me some money and told me to leave. This scene happened to be seen by one of my classmates. At that moment, I felt too ashamed to stay and eat here. Just as I was about to leave, Alex invited me to dinner. Although Andrew was visibly displeased, this was Alex's house, after all. Everyone quickly went to the dining room to eat. Andrew claimed that someone like me didn't deserve to sit at the table and stopped the servant from giving me utensils. In the face of Andrew's insult, I didn't get angry because it gave me the perfect chance to use the golden spoon. I had just eaten a few bites with the golden spoon when I noticed a golden glow appearing on the spoon. To continue eating at Alex's house, I actively helped him write an asset management report, and Andrew happened to see everything. He then found me and warned me to stay away from Alex, claiming that the life of the rich was beyond my reach. After beating me, he turned and left. But his actions only pushed me to speed up the process of switching identities with Alex. I then went to Alex's house and handed him the finished report. Alex was very happy. After receiving the report. I then suggested that we have a meal at his house. But to my surprise, Alex quickly agreed. So under his arrangement, the servant quickly brought two bowls of noodles. I carefully took out my golden spoon. Just as I was about to eat, Alex's father returned home. They were shocked to see me and immediately began criticizing their son, saying that associating with poor people was a waste of time. Facing his father's reprimand, Alex dared not resist and quickly helped me pack up my things and pushed me out. But as I stood at the door, I wasn't willing to give up. Looking at the golden spoon in my hand, I felt a sense of dissatisfaction. Then when they weren't paying attention, I quietly turn.

He wrapped it in white cloth and stuffed it into the water pipe. Next, he took off his sock, rolled it into a ball and plugged one end of the pipe. Finally, he used his handgun to plug the other end of the pipe. Now he just needed to wrap a layer of film around the connection between the gun barrel and the water pipe and a powerful bomb was complete. After everything was ready, Jimmy picked up a rock and smashed the main water pipe in the well. Water immediately gushed out.

After coming out, relying on his rich combat experience, he quickly took out the remaining killers.

He's getting ready for his 21st escape attempt. First, he tapes his flip flops on tight, then tucks a wooden marker with 21 behind his back. But the moment he steps outside, the female guard spots his escape plan. She rushes over to stop him. The boy doesn't slow down. He reaches the fence and starts climbing fast. In seconds, he's over the fence and into the woods. He starts running for his life. At the first turn, there's a wooden stick, then a second one and a third. Clearly, this isn't his first escape. But when he climbs over the barrier he cleared last time, a guard catches him again. Looking down at the markers 19 and 20, the boy suddenly throws away his No. 21 marker. He dives straight into the reeds. The guard can't stop him in time. This time, he actually makes it out. That night, the boy heats up a plastic cap with a lighter, then quickly jams the soft plastic into the lock. After a few tries, he manages to pick the security lock. Next, he, he hot wires a scooter with his new ride. He heads to a mall that's about to close. Seeing no one around, he slips into a display tent sitting off to the side. He zips it shut. Soon the mall closes and the lights go out. Inside the tent, the boy pulls out a sandwich and an apple. That's dinner After resting a bit, he leaves the tent. The mall is completely empty now.

Then, when no one was in the store bathroom, he slipped into one of the stalls and opened the ceiling panel above. He quickly climbed up.

Years later, his worst fear came true. My father has always favored my sister. Not only does the family call him out on it, he admits to it. His defense is that my sister looks so much like our late mother that he can't help but spoil her. My sister caught onto this and used it to her advantage. If she wanted something from the store, she had to say please, dad, and he would get it for her. If I asked for something, my dad would ask me what I had done to deserve it. And if I couldn't think of something good I hadn't recently, I didn't get it. Never. My sister did something bad, she would begin to cry and dad would easily forgive her. If I did something bad, I always had to face the full consequences. Dad would leave work and get my sister from school for anything as small as a splinter. While I could be throwing up, dad would say he couldn't leave work and I had to tough it out. I tried hard to earn his love and attention, but nothing worked. I tried excelling at school, acting out and even forcing myself to get into his hobbies in hopes we would bond that way. The day I gave up was the day I found out how little my dad cared about me. I was Turning 15, the plan was for me, my dad, sister, uncle and two friends to go to an arcade two hours away. The day before my birthday, my sister got the sniffles. My dad could not travel and we would have to cancel the trip. I tried to convince him to leave her with our grandparents, but he didn't want to leave her to suffer alone. He told me to call my friends and tell them while he went and called my uncle. After he walked away, I went and cried my eyes out. About a gallon of tears later, I got a call from my uncle telling me not to worry. He would take us to the arcade. I had a great time and forgot all about my dad and sister. When I got back and my sister saw all my prizes, she asked if she could have one. I said, sorry, no, these are from my birthday trip. Later, my dad came to me and told me it would be nice if I gave my sister something, replied with something along the lines of, you know what would be nice if you didn't try to cancel my birthday over my sister's runny nose. My dad called me selfish and said my sister's health was more important and I would be a good big brother if I gave her something. I didn't give her anything. After that incident, I gave up on my father. I focused on those who Cared for me. My father either didn't notice or didn't care. As long as he had my sister, that's all he needed. He didn't start caring until it made him look bad in the public eye. During my senior year, the band had an award ceremony. I didn't even bother asking my dad to attend. Instead, I asked my aunt and uncle. My dad didn't notice until he saw the family post on Facebook in the school. Many of the comments on the post asked why my dad wasn't there. He confronted me and asked why I hadn't told him he would have loved to go. I replied that in all the years of me winning awards, you've never.

My mom called once and said, your father is hurt, that you won't come around anymore. Family is supposed to forgive. I said, family is supposed to show up, and hung up.

I was exhausted from a long day in court, but I got dressed and drove 40 minutes to the state. Silas had gotten into a bar fight and assaulted someone badly enough to send them to the hospital. The charges were aggravated assault, and he was looking at serious prison time. My dad grabbed my arm when I walked in and said, you have to fix this. You're a lawyer. You can make this go away. I said, I'm a criminal defense attorney. I don't make things go away. I defend people in court. He said, so defend him. He's your brother. I looked at Silas sitting in the holding cell, and he wouldn't even look at me. My dad said, we're family. You owe us this. I said, I owe you this. Where were you six months ago when I got sworn in? My dad said, this is different. This is important. That was just a ceremony. I felt something cold settle in my chest and said, you want me to represent Silas? He said, of course. You're his brother. I said, my hourly rate is $500 dollars. A case like this will probably cost around 50,000 by the time we get to trial. My dad's face went red and he said, you're going to charge your own brother? I said, you're asking me to use the law degree you said wasn't a big deal? The one you couldn't be bothered to celebrate? Yeah, I'm going to charge him. My dad said, how can you be so selfish? He's family. I said, family shows up. You didn't show up for me. Why should I show up for him? Alice finally spoke up and said, come on, you know I didn't mean anything by missing your thing. This is my life we're talking about. I said, it was my life too. I worked for years to get that degree. I sacrificed everything. And when I finally succeeded, you chose a golf tournament over being there. My dad said, we'll pay whatever you want, just please help him. I said, I'll represent him. Standard rates, 50% up front. And I want you all to know that every single hour I Bill is an hour you told me wasn't worth your time. I got Silas a plea deal that kept him out of prison. They paid every invoice on time. We haven't spoken since.

Cuando el coche de policía se acercó, saqué mi arma y abrí fuego sin dudar. Luego cogí una radio de mano y cambié la falsa por una verdadera. Al día siguiente, una mujer agente contestó otra llamada de Brown y se topó conmigo. El ataque en la calle fue solo el inicio. Lo peor aún estaba por venir. Pronto llegaron refuerzos sin imaginar que se habían convertido en mis blancos fáciles. Yo no huí. Me coloqué en el punto alto, desde donde empecé a disparar con precisión. Cuando se me acabó la munición, recogí el equipo y me marché sin dejar a la policía posibilidad de responder. Me llamo Owen. Fui sargento en los Royal marines. Todo lo que hice lo hice por mi padre. Él está en prisión. Subí un video a internet explicando mis motivos. Mi padre también fue militar. Hace poco tuvo un altercado con la policía y en el caos murió un agente. Por eso le condenaron a cadena perpetua tras varios recursos fallidos. Mi padre y yo planificamos estos ataques con la intención de forzar a las autoridades a admitir su error. El detective loser fue a ver a mi padre a la cárcel esperando convencerlo de que me detuviera, pero mi padre pidió reducir la cadena perpetua a solo 5 años. Loser lo rechazó plano. Durante la visita, los agentes registraron la celda y encontraron una tarjeta con un número de contacto, muy probablemente mío Decidieron rastrear la señal. Aunque les pareció demasiado simple, Luther sospechó una trampa. Aún así, era la única pista. La policía no podía rendirse. Un gran equipo de fuerzas especiales fue enviado para rodear el edificio desde donde provenía la señal. Entraron preparados para el enfrentamiento, pero el lugar estaba vacío. Unos segundos después sonó por la radio una orden urgente de evacuación, pero ya era tarde. Habían caído de nuevo en mi trampa. Yo ya había colocado explosivos en el lugar. Ahora sujetaba el detonador y escuchaba por la radio cómo se desarrollaba el desastre. La explosión mató a 5 agentes y dejó a varios gravemente heridos. El caso se volvió tan grave que la operación pasó al control total del equipo antiterrorista.

No mataron cruelmente a mi hija. Al oír los disparos salí corriendo de inmediato. El asesino intentó huir, pero yo lo derribé al suelo. Me enfrenté a él con todas mis fuerzas y en ese momento llegó la policía. Él volvió a intentar escapar, pero al final fue detenido. Sostuve a mi hija herida sintiendo que me arrancaban el alma. Llevaron al hospital y en ese momento mi esposa llegó. Solo podíamos rezar para que sobreviviera, pero el médico nos dijo que no pudieron salvarla. Todo empezó por un jefe mafioso que ordenó a su hijo matar a cualquiera al azar para ganarse un puesto en la banda. Quería justicia para mi hija, pero sin cámaras ni testigos no podían condenar al asesino. Eso me llenó de rabia. Para vengarme con mis propias manos retiré los cargos y los dejaron en libertad. Jamás imaginaron que su muerte estaba cerca. En cuanto salió conduciendo, lo atropellé. Esperé una hora y cuando salió solo, sin dudar, lo atropellé. Luego saqué un bate de béisbol. Me reconoció y me suplicó que lo perdonara, ¿pero cómo iba a darle otra oportunidad? Lo ejecuté ahí mismo. Al rato, John llegó. Vio el cadáver de su hermano y entendió que fui yo. Al día siguiente, mi mientras tomaba café, John apareció de repente. Por suerte reaccioné rápido. Logré arrebatarle el arma y salvar mi vida. Luego me escondí detrás de un coche cuando uno de sus hombres se acercó armado, lo Embestí, pero en ese momento llegó John y solo conseguí escapar por milagro una patrulla y tuvo que detener la persecución. Aunque recogió mi cartera que se me había caído. Pensé en huir con mi esposa, pero John ni su padre nos encontraron. Supe que ya no tenía salida. Lo supliqué que no lastimaran a mi esposa, pero el jefe mafioso apretó el gatillo. Joan me disparó en el pecho y luego se fueron como si nada. Jamás lo imaginaron. La policía me llevó al hospital a tiempo. En el hospital, el sheriff mostró compasión hacia mí y me pidió que olvidara la venganza. La policía dijo que estaba reuniendo pruebas contra John, pero no iba a rendirme. Empecé a entrenar con dureza esperando el momento.

Pensó que solo era un juguete, pero después de colgar el teléfono, el pingüino había desaparecido. Resultó ser un pingüino de verdad. El hombre lo cogió lentamente, pero el pingüino le dio un regalo de bienvenida. El olor era muy desagradable. El hombre tenía prisa por ir al trabajo, así que lo metió en la bañera. Luego echó unos cubitos de hielo. Pero apenas salió de casa, el pingüino abrió accidentalmente el grifo y empezó a nadar en la bañera. Por la noche, el hombre llegó a casa. Cuando abrió la puerta del baño, una ola de agua le golpeó en la cara. Al final tuvo que agarrarse fuerte al marco de la puerta, pero el pingüino no se olvidó de entregarle otro regalo.

Finalmente, entraron en la empresa del hombre y lo encontraron. Lo Vieron divirtiéndose mucho en una fiesta. Los pingüinos derribaron el cubo de hielo, siguiendo las manchas de agua en el suelo, deslizándose y moviéndose entre la multitud. Dejaron el caos por donde pasaban. Se dirigieron directamente hacia el hombre, que tuvo que escabullirse y se llevó a los pingüinos a casa. Al llegar a casa, el hombre estaba furioso.

Todavía existe un paraíso así. Aunque los sobrevivientes llevan años comiendo casi nada, aquí todavía pueden tomarse un vino tinto con un buen stake. Y todo eso es gracias a un tipo barbón. El día mismo que empezó el fin del mundo, todos estaban evacuando sus casas menos él. Él fue el único que se escondió en su búnker. Totalmente preparado. Esperó hasta que ya no quedara nadie afuera y recién entonces empujó la puerta del búnker. Salió corriendo armado hasta los dientes. Cuando confirmó que no había nadie cerca, por fin se quitó la máscara y mostró esa cara de satisfacción. Pero Bill sabía que todavía no era momento de descansar. Primero manejó hasta la casa del vecino, enganchó el yate a su auto, quitó todos los asientos al yate y se fue directo a la gasolinera. Mientras todavía había luz, llenó rápido todos los tambos de gasolina, después manejó hasta la compañía de gas. Abrió la tubería que iba hacia su casa y al final se fue al súper de herramientas. Ahí empezó a comprar como loco de todo tipo de herramientas. Ni siquiera dejó pasar las mangueras de aire acondicionado. En ese momento se cortó la electricidad bien rápido, pero para él no era problema. Ya tenía listo un generador gigante en el patio, lo único que tenía que hacer era conectarlo a la tubería de gas y presionar un botón. De inmediato se escuchó un Rugido enorme. El siguiente paso era construir defensas. Primero puso una cerca eléctrica alrededor de todas las casas cercanas. Luego cortó todos los árboles de la cerca para tener un campo de visión bien amplio. Finalmente, enterró un montón de tuberías de fuego. Con eso, lo básico ya estaba listo. Al final, recolectó comida, plantó un pequeño huerto, montó un gallinero y construyó una cámara fría para guardar carne. Así fue como nació esta utopía en el mundo post apocalíptico. En los años siguientes, Bill casi no salía, excepto para ir por su ministro. El resto del tiempo lo pasaba viendo a los mutantes que caían en sus trampas. Su vida dentro de todo era bastante cómoda. Hasta que un día, 4 años después, tras estaba fabricando armas. Las alarmas empezaron a sonar una tras otra. Otro zombi había caído en una trampa, no le quedó de otra. Tenía que armarse y salir a eliminarlo. Pero lo que nunca imaginó fue que de repente, desde la trampa salió una voz humana. Era la primera voz humana que escuchaba en 4 años. Aún así, por seguridad gritó, preguntando si la persona tenía algún arma. Solo cuando escuchó que no se animó a acercarse para ver qué estaba pasando

They traveled together, shared hotel rooms and she even chased off creeps hitting on him. But everything changed when rain trapped them under a church awning. He couldn't hold back anymore. He confessed his feelings, but she was so clueless she thought he was talking about a new girlfriend. It took her forever to realize he meant her. Little did he know this confession would cost him dearly. Fast forward years later, Guji is almost 40, killing it in her career and finally ready for marriage. She'd been waiting for him to confess again, but her bromeo shattered her world. He got married first, leaving her behind. The news hit her like a bolt out of the blue, so devastating she couldn't help griping to thin air mid flight. The passenger next to her got stuck listening. But hey, she's stunning. Instead of getting mad, he handed her chocolate, grinning like a fool. But Gujia was too busy with cute sniffles to notice. As soon as she landed, she grabbed her mirror to pull herself together. She refused to let him see how much she cared. When they met, they hugged it out and she smiled bright. But that joy vanished in seconds, thanks to a Beautiful woman standing nearby.

Not long ago, Boyka was captured by the Japanese army. They were fully aware of how dangerous this man was on the battlefield. For their amusement, the Japanese forced him to fight other prisoners of war. At first, Boyka won three matches in a row, easily defeating his opponents. But soon he discovered a brutal truth. Every loser was executed on the spot. In that moment, Boyka realized that if he stayed here, he would eventually meet the same fate. So he conspired with several other prisoners to escape. Late at night, Boyka disguised himself with a blanket as though he was still asleep. And when the guards relaxed their vigilance, he pried open the loose wooden boards at the bottom of his cell. He squeezed through the gap, carefully replaced the boards, took the hidden radio and quietly left the camp, running toward the coast. Finally, on a hill, he saw a US Navy warship stationed in the distance. He immediately turned on the radio, tuned it to the allies frequency and called for help. But what he heard was a string of unfamiliar words. It was Navajo, a unique code language used by Native Americans. Boica didn't understand, but he knew what it meant. The US military was on a secret mission. As dawn approached, he quietly returned to the P. O. W. Camp and informed the other prisoners of the situation. After analyzing the situation, they concluded that the US military was. Active and Japanese commander Ito would not sit idly by. When the conflict broke out, they were likely to be directly eliminated. The only way out was to escape now.

The man's eyes burned with rage. When an enemy approached, he suddenly dropped to his knees. Paralyzed, the man turned and slowly crushed the enemy to the ground using only his mind. The terrified rival begged for his life, but the man didn't stop, not until the concrete floor of the lab cracked beneath them. Then he walked out. The police had him surrounded, but bullets meant nothing to him. With a surge of psychic power, he destroyed everything around him. And when he finally saw his mother's killer, the man lost all control. A massive shockwave burst outward, shattering the entire laboratory. When the blast door swung open, every officer went on high alert. The man tore through walls with his mind, his eyes blazing with fury. A massacre was about to begin. The police opened fire wildly, but not a single bullet touched him. He pushed his power even further, blood running from his ears. The ground split open and every man nearby was forced to his knees. But in the next moment, the man himself was wounded. Just then, the minister arrived in an armored vehicle, unleashing a relentless barrage. The heavy impacts knocked him back again and again. Just as he was about to fall, a friend drove in and blocked the attack with his car. The minister kept firing. The vehicle exploded within seconds. His friend was badly injured.

Frente a la puerta había dos huellas de zapatos. Por el tamaño de las huellas, era evidente que las había dejado un hombre. Además, había muchas colillas de cigarrillos alrededor, lo que indicaba que habían estado acechando allí durante mucho tiempo. La esposa del hombre llevaba mucho tiempo sola en casa y él inmediatamente tuvo un mal presentimiento. Rápidamente sacó la pistola del coche, saltó la verja y corrió hacia la casa. El hombre atravesó el bosque a toda velocidad y volvió a ver las huellas, lo que indicaba que habían entrado en su casa. Mike cargó inmediatamente la pistola y entró sigilosamente en la casa. Sin embargo, dentro sonaba música a todo volumen, pero no veía a su esposa por ninguna parte. Mike se apresuró a buscarla por todas partes. Cuando llegó al dormitorio, lo encontró todo revuelto. Era evidente que allí había habido una pelea. Mike cogió rápidamente el teléfono para llamar a su esposa y se enteró de que estaba ingresada en el hospital. Su esposa le dijo débilmente a Mike poco antes de que Mike regresara, un hombre fornido y rompió en la casa. Sin decir nada. Buscó por todas partes, pero al parecer no encontró nada. Enfurecido, la golpeó hasta dejarla gravemente herida. Su hermano también le dijo al hombre que el tipo se había ido en un taxi verde. Al ver a su esposa cubierta de heridas, Mike juró que encontraría al Asesino. Sin embargo, la única pista era el taxi verde. Al día siguiente, Mike condujo por todas partes para encontrar ese taxi verde. Al poco tiempo, Mike encontró dos, pero no hizo nada. En cambio, memorizó la marca en su mente. Por la noche, Mike fue a la compañía de taxis y fingió tener dificultades para pedir ayuda. Mientras el empleado iba a abrir la puerta, Mike se puso rápidamente unas medias en la cabeza. Cuando se abrió la puerta, Mike lo obligó a entrar en la empresa a punta de pistola y averiguó que un coche había estado en su casa y que el conductor era un joven llamado Leo. A continuación, el hombre encontró la foto de la identificación de Leo. Aunque obtuvo la información que necesitaba, Mike no se marchó inmediatamente, sino que esparció los documentos por el suelo para simular un robo a la mañana siguiente. Mike esperó frente a la puerta de la empresa de taxis. Cuando vio a Leo aparcar el taxi en la acera, Mike fingió tener un asunto urgente y pidió a Leo que lo llevara. Una vez en el coche, Mike dio una dirección al azar, pero poco después de salir, Mike sacó discretamente la pistola y golpeó la mampara para indicarle que se girara. Al ver la pistola en la mano del hombre, el chico se asustó tanto que casi se le sale el alma del cuerpo. Pensó que lo estaban atracando, así que le entregó la cartera a Mike Sin embargo, a Mike no le interesaba la cartera, sino que quería que Leo le contara el encargo que había recibido tres días antes. Era un encargo poco habitual, de larga distancia, por lo que a Leo le había causado una gran impresión. Le contó a Mike que el cliente era un hombre corpulento que se había subido a su coche a mediodía y le había dado la dirección de una finca para que lo llevara directamente allí. Al llegar, el hombre fornido le pidió a Leo que esperara. Él entró solo aproximadamente una hora. Después, el hombre fornido salió. Luego regresó al aeropuerto. Le contó todo lo que sabía a Mike. Leo le rogó a Mike que lo dejara ir, incluso le prometió que le dejaría el taxi. Sin embargo, lo inesperado fue que Mike mató directamente a ese tipo. Leo no supo hasta su muerte que el hombre que lo mató era en realidad un asesino. Por la descripción de Leo, el hombre supo que el asesino se dirigió directamente a su casa. Él estaba convencido de que su jefe era el cerebro detrás de todo, ya que solo él conocía su dirección. Además, el hombre había fracasado en su misión unos días antes y supuso que su jefe temía que se descubriera el secreto y quería eliminar a Mike. Sin embargo, su esposa resultó gravemente herida. El hombre era de los que no perdonan, así que inmediatamente hizo las maletas y se dirigió al aeropuerto para vengarse De su jefe

Para capturar a este monstruo, los soldados se habían estado preparando durante días. Instalaron ballestas pesadas y enterraron toneladas de explosivos en la entrada de la cueva de la bestia. Si lograban atraerlo al campo minado, podían matarlo de un solo golpe. Cuando todo estuvo listo, tres hombres se acercaron con cautela a la cueva y gritaron con fuerza para provocarlo. Pocos segundos después, el tiburón gigante detectó su olor y salió disparado de la cueva con un rugido. Todos dieron la vuelta y corrieron por sus vidas. El más lento fue tragado entero por el tiburón. Los soldados dispararon sus ballestas de inmediato, pero subestimaron la fuerza de la criatura. No podían controlarla en absoluto. En un instante, varios arqueros cayeron. Peor aún, este tiburón poseía una inteligencia aterradora. Al darse cuenta de que había caído en una trampa, retrocedió rápidamente hacia lo profundo de la cueva. Los aldeanos siguieron lanzando bombas intentando empujarlo hacia los explosivos. Este acto enfureció por completo a la bestia. Abrió sus fauces sedientas de sangre y roció ácido mortal. Varios no alcanzaron a esquivar. La escena fue espantosa. Después de varios ataques y emboscadas, finalmente obligaron al tiburón a entrar al campo minado. El comandante presionó el interruptor de inmediato y los explosivos estallaron con un estruendo ensordecedor. Todos pensaron que la misión había terminado. Cuando se acercaron para inspeccionar la presa, un rugido atronador resonó de repente. Desde la cima de la montaña

Cuando vio que un empleado entraba en la oficina, se puso los auriculares de inmediato para escuchar de qué hablaban. Sin embargo, lo que oyó lo llenó de rabia. La empleada kim era madre soltera y debido a la alta carga de trabajo no le quedaba tiempo para cuidar de su hija. Por eso pidió un día libre para pasar un fin de semana agradable con sus hijos. Pero incluso esa pequeña solicitud fue rechazada por el gerente. Esto enfureció a jeffrey, quien lo observaba todo a través de la pantalla. Cuando vio que el gerente introducía la contraseña, la memorizó rápidamente. Esa misma noche, se coló en la oficina, encendió la computadora del gerente y encontró el calendario laboral. Luego, a través del sistema, le asignó a kim un día de descanso. Era su séptimo día en el supermercado. Antes, la policía siempre publicaba noticias sobre él, pero ahora no había ningún reporte. Parecía que la policía había perdido interés en la persona desaparecida, lo que le dio alegría, pues ahora podía salir a la calle mientras la gente todavía dormía. Jeffrey salió en bicicleta y llamó a su amigo liv, quién podía ayudarlo con documentos falsos y un nuevo comienzo. Sin embargo, quien respondió fue la novia de lift, porque lift estaba en el extranjero y no regresaría hasta dentro De 6 meses. Luego volvió a llamar a su casa para hablar con su hija, pero descubrió que su esposa ya había encontrado un nuevo novio. En ese momento, jeffrey se sintió muy abatido, como una persona abandonada. Además, el gerente del supermercado notó cosas extrañas, muchos productos habían desaparecido misteriosamente. El gerente no sabía quién lo había hecho y culpó al empleado ion porque a él le encantaban los dulces. Momento crítico. Kim defendió a ion y luego sugirió al gerente donar los juguetes defectuosos a la iglesia para que llegaran a los niños que los necesitaban. El gerente estuvo de acuerdo al principio, pero al segundo siguiente tiró los folletos a la basura. Al ver esto, jeffrey decidió actuar. Recogió algunos juguetes y los llevó al lugar de la acción benéfica. Planeaba dejarlos y regresar al supermercado, pero los empleados lo vieron y lo invitaron al evento mismo. Cientos de personas cantaban en el escenario y el corazón de jeffrey latía con preocupación. Si alguien descubría que era un preso fugado, sería un desastre. Por suerte, vio a kim entre la multitud. Su seriedad en el escenario lo calmó de inmediato. Su sonrisa en el escenario le pareció enorme y brillante, y en ese momento sintió algo extraño en el corazón. Después de la actividad, los organizadores lo agradecieron por la donación y se lo presentaron a kim, aunque ya la había visto antes. La oportunidad de hablar con ella cara a cara le causó una emoción inusual Unos días después fueron juntos a una fiesta para solteros. El humor y las bromas de jeffrey crearon un ambiente cálido y amistoso. Kim también empezó a sentir simpatía por él y al final de la fiesta ella misma lo invitó a salir en una cita. Jeffrey ya sentía afecto por kim, así que no pudo rechazar la invitación. Pronto se convirtieron en pareja, pero kim no podía imaginar que el hombre frente a ella no era un funcionario público, sino un preso fugado

Ella apenas reaccionó. Luego sacó un encendedor. Auch, ¡oh my God! House dedujo de inmediato que la mujer no estaba realmente paralizada, solo fingía. Ella lo refutó al instante, pero house fingió no escucharla y ordenó a su asistente que la echara del hospital. Curiosamente, ella no se fue, sino que volvió a la habitación. Cuando el asistente le informó que tenía dificultad para respirar, house le pidió que se relajara, asegurándole que no usaría fuego esta vez. Al siguiente instante, sorprendido por la extraña reacción de la mujer, Jauja estaba preparado. Le levantó la jeringa de repente y notó que no sentía miedo alguno. Miró su cuello y vio que la arteria carótida estaba visiblemente hinchada. La empujó sobre la cama y clavó rápidamente la aguja en el pecho al extraer sangre oscura. Jau ya tenía su conclusión. Solo estaba confirmando esa mañana. Un hombre paralizado durante 8 años se había metido en la piscina en su silla de ruedas, intentando suicidarse, pero fue llevado a tiempo al hospital cuando su esposa intentaba llevárselo a casa. House apareció y dijo que su marido era una carga, aconsejando que lo dejaran ir pronto. Ella se negó, pero house no prestó atención, enfocándose en observar la reacción del hombre. El hombre no reaccionó en absoluto. House siguió inventando mentiras, diciendo que la esposa no quería cuidar a su marido, pero él Seguía inmóvil. La esposa, furiosa, se acercó a la cama para iniciar el alta. Entonces house notó un leve movimiento en los labios del hombre. Pidió a la mujer que soltara a su marido y al hombre que repitiera lo que había dicho. Se acercó a su oído y escuchó atentamente, aunque solo oyó un sonido de garganta. Era la respuesta que necesitaba. Pasó toda la noche revisando los registros de todos los pacientes paralizados del hospital, pidiendo a sus asistentes que analizaran y compararan los síntomas del hombre. Mientras los asistentes se quejaban. Organizando los datos, house dedujo que el paciente podría tener un quiste en el páncreas. Luego ordenó una broncoscopia. Los resultados mostraron que el páncreas estaba normal, pero al retirar el instrumento dañaron la tráquea, provocando dificultad respiratoria. Se vieron obligados a realizar una traqueotomía. House siguió insistiendo en que el problema estaba en el cerebro y solicitó una resonancia. Los escaneos repetidos mostraron que el cerebro estaba normal. La resonancia incluso causó sangrado en el oído. House no admitió su error, convencido de que la causa estaba en el cerebro, y pidió repetir la prueba. Esta vez, los asistentes se negaron por completo. Fue directamente con el director del hospital, pero fue rechazado y le informaron que el paciente debía ser dado de alta a las 7 de la mañana. Molesto, corrió 30km y se sumergió en la fuente del parque para refrescarse. Ese acto le dio una idea y fue inmediatamente a la casa Del director explicó que el hombre tenía disfunción hipotalámica, causando un aumento de temperatura. Su salto a la piscina no fue un intento de suicidio, sino un intento de enfriarse. Solo necesitaba una inyección de cortisona para recuperar la salud. El director se negó a permitir que house continuara con la prueba, rechazando el plan en ese momento. Sin embargo, al ver a la familia en apuros debido a la parálisis, se dio cuenta y permitió que se le administrara la cortisona preparada. Al no observar cambios inmediatos, el director se dio la vuelta decepcionado. Pero cuando la enfermera estaba a punto de llevarse al hombre, su mano se movió y su garganta comenzó a moverse. Más sorprendente aún, se soltó del cinturón por sí mismo. El hombre, paralizado durante 8 años, se levantó de la silla de ruedas. Fue entonces cuando el director comprendió que el tratamiento de house había sido completamente correcto

Al contrario, se dirigió a un gran supermercado lleno de gente. Obviamente, no iba a hacer compras. Primero caminó un poco por el supermercado, luego se coló discretamente al baño. Allí había una entrada a la azotea. Jeffrey, con 46 episodios de robos a sus espaldas, conocía muy bien el plano del edificio. Sin dificultad, subió a la azotea. En la azotea había suficiente espacio. Era un lugar perfecto para esconderse. Nadie pensaría que podría ocultarse allí. Primero se orientó por una rejilla de ventilación, luego encontró la oficina del gerente. Después de que todos los empleados se fueran a casa, se coló en la oficina y bajó desde el techo. Aunque sus movimientos eran limitados, había una gran ventaja, la comida y otros productos estaban en abundancia. El problema era que las cámaras de seguridad cubrían todas las áreas del supermercado. Evitar ser captado por las cámaras era muy complicado. A pesar de sus esfuerzos, no pudo evitar el sistema de seguridad. Al final, solo pudo comer latas de comida para bebé para calmar el hambre. Mientras tanto, en la televisión comenzaron a dar noticias sobre su fuga. Obviamente, su desaparición causó un gran impacto público. Nadie sabía cómo había logrado escapar. Ni siquiera la policía encontraba solución. Algunos comenzaron a mitificarlo, llamándolo un criminal genial. Pero solo Jeffrey sabía que necesitaba paciencia y mantenerse escondido en la Calle ya lo esperaban cientos de policías, así que regresó a la azotea y permaneció allí todo el día. A la noche siguiente, comenzó a preocuparse por la comida. La comida para bebé no era muy sabrosa y los snacks deliciosos estaban al alcance, solo que bajo la vigilancia de las cámaras. En ese momento, su atención fue atraída por el manual de instrucciones del sistema de videovigilancia. Decidió probar las acciones descritas en el manual y, para su sorpresa, logró apagar el sistema de grabación. Corrió con alegría hacia la estantería de snacks. Ahora no necesitaba preocuparse por las cámaras. En ese momento, todo el supermercado parecía solo suyo. Además, paseando, encontró otro excelente escondite detrás de la estantería de bicicletas.

De repente apareció un pie terrible. Esta escena inesperada la hizo abrir los ojos con sorpresa instantáneamente. Inmediatamente después entró una mujer que parecía haber salido directamente de un cementerio. La chica se encogió en un rincón de inmediato, pero la mujer no presionó el botón del ascensor, sino que la siguió hasta su piso. Solo cuando la mujer se alejó lo suficiente, la chica se atrevió a salir del ascensor, pero apenas entró en el pasillo, notó repentinamente que la mujer estaba golpeando la puerta de su vecino. Aunque la chica estaba terriblemente asustada. Para volver a casa lo antes posible, tuvo que fingir calma y caminar rápidamente hacia adelante. Después de entrar en casa, la chica suspiró con alivio, pero justo cuando se preparaba para llamar a la policía, los golpes en la puerta de fuera cesaron repentinamente. Impulsada por la curiosidad, la chica abrió la puerta queriendo ver qué pasaba afuera, pero descubrió que el pasillo estaba vacío. La mujer también había desaparecido. La chica pensó que la otra había entrado en su casa, así que no le dio importancia a este asunto. Pero lo que no esperaba fue que la noche siguiente después del trabajo, justo cuando llegó a su piso, oyó golpes apresurados. Se asomó con precaución para ver y descubrió que la mujer de la noche anterior había aparecido de nuevo y estaba golpeando violentamente la puerta del vecino. Esta escena la dejó aterrorizada, pero antes de Que pudiera reaccionar. Los golpes cesaron repentinamente. La chica revisó inmediatamente, resultando que en el pasillo ya no había rastro de la mujer. Parecía que la mujer había desaparecido en el aire. Cuanto más pensaba, más asustada se ponía, así que corrió a casa apresuradamente, pero justo cuando quería beber un vaso de agua para calmar su tensión, una figura terrible se arrastró por la ventana de su balcón. La chica sintió que algo andaba mal. Se acercó con precaución para ver, pero cuando abrió la cortina no encontró ninguna anomalía. Justo cuando pensaba que estaba teniendo alucinaciones, en la ventana de fuera quedó una huella de mano negra. Obviamente fue dejada por esa mujer. Sin embargo, las cosas terribles estaban lejos de terminar. No se sabe cuánto tiempo pasó, comenzaron a escucharse sonidos de golpes y gritos, así como súplicas de auxilio de un hombre desde la habitación del vecino. La chica no pudo dormir ni un momento durante toda la noche. Después de esa noche, la chica estuvo en estado de tensión todos los días, pero lo extraño es que durante varios días seguidos la mujer no apareció de nuevo. Justo cuando suspiró con alivio, descubrió repentinamente un sobre debajo de la puerta. Lo abrió y encontró un montón de dinero en efectivo y un papelito. En el papelito estaba escrito que si a 11:50 de la noche de hoy ella podía ir al vecindario y cerrar la caja fuerte y abrirla después de la una de la Madrugada, entonces todo el dinero en el sobre sería suyo. Obviamente, este sobre fue dejado por el hombre del vecino. Aunque no sabía el propósito del hombre, bajo la tentación del dinero, la chica decidió intentarlo con valentía. Llegó a la puerta del vecino, abrió la puerta con precaución y al entrar en la habitación, la chica fue atacada por un olor terrible. Pero esto no le hizo olvidar el propósito de su visita. Pronto vio una caja de hierro cubierta de amuletos amarillos extraños
