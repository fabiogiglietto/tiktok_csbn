In Florida, a man witnessed something unbelievable. While withdrawing cash from an ATM, the machine suddenly malfunctioned and started spitting out money non stop, with a total of $1.2 million flooding out. At first, the man was stunned by what he saw, but once he realized something was seriously wrong, he immediately called the police and notified the bank staff. However, when the bank employees arrived and counted the cash, they confirmed the ATM had dispensed $1.2 million, but after double checking, they discovered $500 was missing. The bank believes the man may have hidden the missing $500 during the chaos and is demanding that he return the money and also cover the cost of repairing the ATM and the staff's lost work time, totaling $10,000. According to the bank's lawsuit, the man's actions constitute illegal possession, taking extra money without any legal right to it. But the man insists he never intentionally took any extra cash. He says the whole situation was caused by the ATM malfunction and he reported it to authorities as quickly as possible. Do you think the man should be held responsible for the costs?

I have a treat for you, folks. Buckle up. So last week, Cody's on a work trip to Nashville, Tennessee. He's never been there before. Um, and during the day, they're doing training, and at night time, they get to go out and do whatever they wanna do, have a great time. So what does Cody do? He runs a scooter. Not a moped. Like, an electric scooter. Keep in mind that he's not a little person. He's a bigger. He's a bigger guy. He's a big dude. Okay. Why his big ass is on that little buddy scooter, I do not know. But he was having a great time cruising around, like, turns off on a wrong street and turns, like, into traffic. Like I said, he's never been to Nashville before, doesn't know where the hell he's going, and so happens to be where there's construction. So he hits something in the road and flies off the scooter. He manages to regain his balance, does two, like, two kind of step things, and then tux and rolls. According to him, this is what happened. Tux and rolls, lands on his knee, lands on his shoulder, is in pain, manages to crawl out of the street in the middle of, uh, traffic in Nashville, Tennessee. Okay. And decides, I'm fine. I'm gonna get back to the car, uh, and I'm just gonna go to the hotel. And go to bed. Well, the next morning, he calls me at 6:00am. I'm already up getting the kids ready for school. And he's like, hey, where's my insurance card? I'm like, first of all, it's in your wallet, if you would look for it. Anyway, he looks for his insurance card, finally goes to the emergency room. They do X rays on him. And what does this man do? What had he done to himself, you might ask? He dislocated his shoulder. He fractured his kneecap. He tore his meniscus, his L C L, and his P C L. Tendons or ligaments. Not complete tears. Not completely torn, but tears. Pretty severe tears in them. Okay, how do you fracture a kneecap? Q King George from Hamilton. I wasn't aware that was something a person could do. But he did it. All of this while we're trying to move into our house next week? Yes, we move into my house Friday. Next Friday on the 15th. Um, so he's just hopping around on a little crutch. On a little crutch. Got a little knee brace going on.

But I didn't cry. Instead, I put on my apron and began my suffocating daily routine. I had to prepare breakfast for the whole family before my husband left the bathroom. Even when I tried my hardest to be the perfect wife, he always found reasons to blame me. My daughter watched silently, her eyes filled with pain. But she was powerless. Her own life was a cage, too. My husband forced her to drop out of school for odd jobs. Only our son was allowed to attend school. After my husband finished breakfast, my household chores weren't over. I still had to tend to my paralyzed father in law. But when I helped him pull the curtains, his hand reached out toward me. I was startled, but could only swallow my anger. After finishing all this, I'd rushed to my first job, cleaning the homes of the wealthy. But even here, women weren't free. When the mistress spoke, her husband would rage at her and tell her not to interrupt him. Even in that affluent household, I realized women still held no real standing. My second job was at an umbrella shop. I had to train a new apprentice, but he barely knew what he was doing. Then I discovered his pay was double mine. When I asked why, the boss simply said it was because he was a man. My third, Job was in a hotel laundry room. I couldn't use the elevator. Forced to haul soaked sheets barehanded because guests shouldn't be disturbed by maids presence. That night, walking home, I counted the few coins I'd earned, tucking them into my blouse, saving for my daughter's wedding dress. Since I couldn't change my own fate, maybe I could change my daughter's. Compared to my miserable marriage, my best friend's life seemed happier. We were both poor women, but she had a rare, good husband. A husband who didn't beat her. When she invited me to help make jam, I told her I had to ask my husband first. Even for such a small matter, I had no say over my own life. Just as I reached home, my neighbor called out to me and said there was mail for me. Usually the mail was addressed to my husband, but this time my name was on the envelope. I froze, staring at it for a long time. Before taking it upstairs. I opened the letter carefully. As I read its contents, my eyes widened in shock.

As the treasure shifted and slid, a massive dragon's eye suddenly appeared before me. I was absolutely terrified and immediately ducked behind a stone pillar. But the second I steadied myself, the gold on the other side started moving, too. Now I was really panicking. I'd heard legends about this dragon, but I never imagined he'd be this enormous. All I wanted was to get out of there. But after just a few steps, the dragon's head above me twitched slightly. I froze in place, silently praying it was just him stirring in his sleep. The next second, the dragon's eyes snapped wide open. I scrambled desperately into the shadows and fumbled the one ring out of my pocket, slipping it on. Instantly, I vanished into thin air. But this dragon wasn't so easily fooled. Even though he couldn't see me, he could smell something unfamiliar, and he could clearly hear my ragged breathing. Watching that massive creature inch closer, I couldn't hold back any longer. I turned and ran. But I didn't get far before the dragon caught up. Even invisible, whenever I met those dragon eyes, my head felt like it was splitting open. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I pulled off the ring and revealed myself. Thinking fast to save my skin, I started flattering the dragon. I'm no thief. I just wanted to see the legendary magnificence. Of the great dragon. With my own eyes, I clearly pleased him. He puffed up his chest proudly showing off his mountain sized body. I kept it going. The stories don't do you justice. You're even more magnificent in person. Face with this smooth talking little creature. The dragon gradually let his guard down and even started chatting with me. That's when I spotted it. The Arkenstone I've been searching for, lying quietly just a short distance away. I kept the dragon talking while slowly inching toward the gem. But suddenly his tone shifted and that terrifying face returned. He caught the scent of dwarves in the air. In the chaos, his tail swept across and sent the Arkenstone flying. I lunged for the stone without thinking. But no matter how fast I ran, I couldn't escape those deadly claws and flames. The dragon quickly caught up with me again. But as I hit the ground, I noticed something crucial. There was a missing scale on his chest. So the legend about the black arrow wounding the dragon was true. This time the dragon showed no mercy. Jaw snapping straight at me at the last possible second. I barely dodged. Furious, the dragon unleashed his rage as fire, blasting flames in every direction.

It was driving me crazy. I raised my hand to SWAT it, but right then I noticed something. One corner of the wallpaper was peeling and it looked like something was hidden underneath. I leaned in a little closer to tear it open and take a look, but suddenly there was a sound from outside the window. My first reaction was that someone had broken in. So I rushed downstairs to check. But it turned out it was just the window I had forgotten to close. I shut it, turned to leave, but the window opened again by itself. I froze for a few seconds, then closed it again. And what happened in the very next second completely stunned me. Oh, my god. My little sister was standing outside the window. So who was the one standing in the living room right now? I walked over and asked her when she had come in, and she said she had been here the whole time. My heart stopped for a moment and before I could figure it out, I saw someone in my brother's room again. My brother is in a vegetative state. He can't walk at all. So whoever was inside could not possibly be him. The room was dead silent. My brother was lying on the bed and no one else there. I let out a long breath, turned around and started to take my Sister upstairs. And just then the alarm suddenly went off. My mom rushed in. My brother's heart rate was dropping fast. She hurried to give him an injection and even started CPR, but his heart still stopped. I tried to comfort her. It's what god would want. And she slapped me across the face. The sound was loud and my cheek went numb with pain. But what happened next completely shocked me. The moment that slap landed, the monitor started beeping again. His heart began to beat once more as if he had woken up just to take the pain for me. My mom clung to him sobbing and I quietly went upstairs. My sister walked over to my brother. She just wanted to give him a hug. But as soon as she got close, my brother opened his eyes. I was completely stunned. My mom was overjoyed. She thought my brother had finally woken up. And I saw hope, too. We thought everything was going to be okay. But the next morning, I looked at him in the mirror.

My parents were stunned and had no choice but to move me to a remote village. They covered my face with gauze, glasses and a hat. But I wasn't happy. I confided in a psychiatrist, but he insisted on seeing my face. As expected, he paid for it with his life. I hated this handsome face. I just wanted to be a normal person. I looked at a brick on the ground and suddenly came up with a good idea. I went to my friend and asked him to damage my face, but he was too busy texting his girlfriend. I got angry and slapped the phone out of his hand. He hit me out of frustration, but my face wasn't harmed at all. So I locked myself in my room. After hearing about this, my friend introduced me to a girl. But just as we sat down, her ex boyfriend showed up. He mocked me, saying I was too ugly to show my face. I didn't want to explain, but he arrogantly pushed me onto the table. I didn't fight back until the waiter pulled him off me. The girl called me a coward and walked away without looking back. Heartbroken, I went to the Riverside, planning to completely destroy my face. Just then, a girl suddenly appeared and talked me out of making a terrible decision. When I looked at her, I felt like I was seeing an angel. We later became good friends. I planned to confess my feelings to her, but then I noticed she was wearing a heart rate monitor. She had a heart condition. I didn't dare confess anymore. She noticed my disappointment and took me to the school dance. But I ran into the guy who had attacked me before. He recognized me and ripped off my mask. The people around us stared wide eyed and she collapsed onto the floor. When the police arrived, I was the only one left at what became a murder scene. I was sent to prison, but I saw her being taken away in an ambulance. By the time I was released, she was already in critical condition. Before she died, she wanted to see me one last time. I took off my glasses and removed the gauze. Lying down beside her. She opened her eyes and just like that, I lost the woman I love.

Mary told him that she would be his roommate. Mike was terrified, but Mary just happened to have $1 million in cash. Then three more girls appeared in his life. Mike only knew that they had all received an invitation from an unknown person. And no one knew the truth behind the message. So the six of them have lived together like this for half a year now.

You're probably thinking, page, of course you have. You're a nurse. Like, you see swayners all the time. Well, what if I told you that most of my nursing career was spent working on the postpartum unit with people that have just had babies or you shouldn't be seeing Sweeners. You might ask yourself, page, why? Why would you be seeing Sweeners on that unit? I asked myself that same question most nights. See, I would have to round on my patients every two hours to make sure that they were still breathing. You know, cause when you're in the hospital, you wanna make sure your patient is alive. So I would sneak in that room quiet as a church mouse on my tippy toes, like I was sneaking downstairs stealing cookies again when I was five, because I didn't want to scare my patients.

But do you know what I would see? Like, way too often? The partner on the couch diddling himself. Shoo her out. Sometimes the new mom would be breastfeeding that baby in the bed, brother. Ugh. Is that the same? I don't know. I think I'm too old to say that kind of thing. But anyways, Is this normal? I've never been in a relationship with a man, nor have I ever had a baby, so I don't know if this is a normal occurrence, but is it not possible to just wait a couple of days and not do that while you're in the hospital with your partner who's just had a baby? And do you know what the worst thing was that I would see on a actual schmecks? We're talking people that have just had an infant Newborn child either come out of their vagina or be surgically removed from their abdomen, and they're doing the nasty. No. Absolutely not.

Suddenly, a huge hand slammed down. Get them out! Before I even had a chance to see what was inside the tank, I was dragged out of the lab. Mary and I were just janitors here. All we were supposed to do was the usual cleaning. But that day, I heard blood curdling screams echo through the lab. We followed the sound. We saw the officer stumbling out in agony, collapsing to his knees in a puddle of his own blood. Help! He's losing blood! Mary grabbed me in a panic, and we bolted out of there. But even as janitors, we were ordered back by the supervisor to clean up the mess. Standing there, staring at blood everywhere on the floor, Mary urged me to finish quickly. She didn't want to stay one second longer in that haunted place. Then I dumped a bucket of water down. To my horror, two severed fingers washed out. I stayed calm and silently picked them up. Oh, it's a finger. It's two fingers! Okay, okay, okay. Put them away. And Mary ran screaming out to call for help, while I spotted something unfamiliar in the water tank. Its abdomen was still oozing fresh blood. Clearly, this creature had been through horrific torture. The next day, curiosity got the better of me, so I sneaked back into the lab. I tapped an egg against the water with a spoon, and immediately, The water reacted. The fish person seemed to sense my goodwill. It swam over, then slowly rose to stand beside me. Even though the fish person suddenly glanced at me warily, I didn't flinch. I gently placed the egg down and used hand signals to explain what it was. The fish person seemed to understand, kind of. It accepted my little greeting, then turned and swam away. This encounter built a fragile trust between me and that fish person.

Upon seeing this, the staff immediately activated the ultraviolet Protection measures, as this was the only thing trolls feared. However, someone deliberately spilled coffee at that moment, causing the equipment to short circuit and the UV lights that had just turned on went dark as well. When the troll discovered his hands were bound by iron chains, a surge of rage instantly welled up inside him. Seeing the massive creature, the laboratory workers scattered in all directions, yet by then it was already too late to run. One unfortunate worker was just a second too slow and ended up being stomped into a pulp under the trolls foot. In the chaos, I let everyone out through the back door of the laboratory, but just as we reached the exit, we saw the troll squeezing out of the passage as well. With just a slight shake of its body, the troll destroyed the hydroelectric stations pipelines. Fortunately, the troll didn't continue its rampage. It simply turned and walked into the distant forest. Soon, the troll arrived at a bar. It lifted off the roof and curiously surveyed the crowd inside. The foolish humans, completely oblivious to the danger, all pulled out their phones to take pictures and show off. It wasn't until the troll reached out its massive palm toward the crowd that everyone finally realized something was Terribly wrong and began fleeing in every direction. But the troll, having starved for 2,000 years, had switched into buffet mode. He tossed one lucky soul right into his mouth. The troll's actions thoroughly alarmed the military. To eliminate this monster, soldiers activated the ultraviolet lighting devices on their aircraft. The instant the light hit it, burn marks appeared on the troll's body. Seeing that ultraviolet light was effective, the soldiers prepared to continue their attack. What they didn't expect, however, was that the troll grabbed a nearby utility pole and hurled it straight at the helicopter. Watching his comrades aircraft crash, soldier was furious and prepared to charge directly at the troll. Fortunately, I stopped him in time, which allowed the soldier to calm down. The troll, meanwhile, flashed a mocking expression before swaggering away. Through these two experiences, I realized that humans alone could never defeat the troll. Only magic could defeat magic. I LED them to a mysterious cave. In its deepest recesses, I gently tapped the ground with a stone as if it were some kind of signal. After waiting a moment, a violent rumbling sound came from deep within the cave, and a colossal creature rapidly approached us.

But the pants were too small, so I had to tie them with a woman's hairband. I had to leave before she woke up. I'm not actually a jerk. The truth is, I have a strange condition. Every time I wake up, I become a different person. That day I went on a date with my girlfriend. I only took a nap in the car, but when I woke up, I had turned into a bald middle aged man. I went to the place we were supposed to meet. My girlfriend was right in front of me, but I didn't dare admit who I was. She called me, but I didn't dare answer, thinking I was busy with something. She had no choice but to go to work. I followed her to the furniture store and pretended to be a customer shopping for a table. I looked at her with reluctance. In my heart, I felt like this should come to an end. I was about to delete her contact information when she suddenly texted me. 아직 나를 기다리는데 이대로 사라지고 싶진 않다 I designed a table she loved that day I had turned into a woman I pretended to be an intern and went to her company to work I found a chance to tell her the truth I brought her home she walked in and saw the house filled with furniture all the people she had sold I opened my laptop to show her recordings and told her that all those people were me. Every time I woke up, my appearance changed. She couldn't believe it, so I showed her our matching promise rings. She looked at the one on her own finger, but she still couldn't accept the truth and left. However, after getting home, she couldn't stop thinking about me. The next stay, she saw the table I designed, and after thinking for a long time, she decided to come find me. This time I had turned into a short haired woman. She asked me, Toyota, if she could see me transform with her own eyes. The next morning, she woke up early. She saw my wardrobe filled with clothes and shoes in every possible size. Just then, I walked out as a young man. She finally believed everything. We began a happy relationship. Sometimes I turned into a tattoo gangster and we went to get tattoos together. Sometimes I became an older man, and this time I had turned into a child. She took me out to eat. 아 반말하지 말라니까 내가 왜 반말하지 말아 줄래 싫은데 이거 자 아들이에요 아 친구 아들이에요 ㅎㅎ

People on Night Shift are like the rock stars of the corporate world. Maturity level peaks somewhere between middle school and high school, so our ability to talk to each other and only movie quotes are in your windows is legendary. Can legitimately answer a question with the phrase that's what she said and our co workers will 100% understand what we're talking about. Inappropriate comments and innuendos have become our coping mechanism for our poor life choices. Corporate doesn't really come and mess with the people on night shift cause most of us are bilingual. We speak sarcasm and real talk and corporate hadn't figured out how to translate yet. B S. Levels are usually through the roof everything that you complain about being able to do on a full night's sleep we functionarily do with three day walkers. Can get off work and maybe go have themselves a little libation to wind down and nobody says anything. We stop to get a cold beverage after work and we get looked at like we're about to get tied cast for the next episode of the first 48. Cause of the hours we keep. We're about three weeks behind on current events. If we do finally get a day off, it's a dice roll if we're gonna sleep for 24 hours or stay up for 24 hours. If we sleep for 24 hours, we'll waste that day away. If we stay up for 24 hours, we're Gonna say something a little bit hateful because we're quote unquote being grumpy. Either way, our friends and family are gonna be concerned by our choices. Most of us are the reasons for OSHA and H R. Violations. Look, if you're not gonna be here at 3 o'clock in the morning, don't ask how we got it done at 3 o'clock in the morning. This. This describes night shift. This right here. Bonus points if you know what that is. Speaking of rock stars, most of us are like a corporate version of Keith Richards. We know what you're testing for, so we know what we can get away with. And when our loved ones require that we actually be a part of their life, you know, school events, baseball games, doctor's appointments. We're like high functioning narcoleptics. You give us a couple minutes to sleep, we'll find somewhere to sleep. Real talk, we are cool and you guys know it. Cause most of the people who went to day shift were just the people who weren't cool enough to make it on nights. What is my day off? As you guys can see. But I'm still running on nicotine, caffeine, hopes and dreams. So we're gonna try to function like real people tonight and go to sleep by 10.

The sail behind me slammed into my back. The hit almost launched me off the yacht. I reacted fast. Both hands locked on the railing. The yacht kept rushing forward. The wind pushed me side to side. If I loosen my grip, I was done. I forced myself to calm down, took a deep breath, used every bit of strength to move toward the deck. I planted my feet before slipping. The moment I stood firm, my heart finally dropped back in place. After catching some strength, I slid back inside through the railing. But I had no time for relief. That strong urge to pee hit me again. I didn't dare pee over the ocean anymore. I rushed into the bathroom. I was halfway done. The door shut behind me. I glanced back, thought it was just the wind, didn't care. But when I finished, the door wouldn't open no matter how hard I twisted. I froze, squatted down to check the angle, tried the other direction. Left, right, push, pull. The door didn't move at all. That's when something felt wrong. I shot up, reached along the door crack, trying to pry it. The crack was too small. I couldn't use any force. Panic hit me. I needed to get out fast. I opened the mirror cabinet, found a pair of Scissors. I thought of a way. I split the Scissors, aimed the tip at the screws on the Handle. The size was perfect, but no matter how I turned, the screws didn't budge. That idea was useless. I opened the vent window above me, tried squeezing through that tiny gap. No matter how I pushed, I was stuck. Was losing my mind. Right then, the young man yacht suddenly sped up. To stop it from drifting off course, I reached to hand out the vent, grabbed a rope. After making sure one end was fixed, I tied a dead knot on the other, threw it hard into the ocean. I hoped the current would drag it into the propeller, slow the yacht down. But the propeller spun too fast. The rope tightened instantly, then snapped back around my neck. I had no time to react. It choked me on the spot. I couldn't breathe at all. I clattered around the deck blindly. My hand hit a hook. I pushed the rope open with everything I had.

This time, he turned out a soap girl. Her special trait is that she loves cleanliness, and she immediately starts scrubbing Jack, not caring at all whether he's wearing clothes. Jack, feeling shy, pushes the soap girl away. By the time Jack finishes his shower, the room is already completely refreshed. The soap girl's only flaw is that she's a bit fat and she often pushes Jack to the floor. This makes Jack feel very uncomfortable, so he decides to break up with her. At this point, a friend tells him soap is a consumable. The more you wash, the thinner she gets. Hearing this, Jack immediately takes the Soap Girl home to shower. The Soap Girl is so happy to hear that and ends up washing him for a full 3 hours. During dinner, Jack deliberately gets his clothes dirty just to take another shower. He even rubs himself on the court to make it happen. This makes the Soap Girl panic Jack. Jack suggests going home to shower, but unexpectedly the Soap Girl takes him to a public restroom instead. Soon, Jack's skin starts to peel off from the overwashing. But luckily, the Soap Girl has slimmed down her perfect figure, instantly mesmerizes Jack. To help the Soap Girl keep her current figure, Jack starts refusing to shower, but soon he starts to smell really bad. Reluctantly, Jack secretly buys some shower Gel and takes a shower. However, the soap girl soon discovers what he did. The soap girl instantly breaks down crying and then runs off angrily. It's raining heavily outside. When Jack catches up with her, the soap girl has turned into a bubble. Do you want to wear this ring?

Most of us parents either avoid them or drum fear into our kids. But fear is an emotion and experience that teenagers love to test. So if fear won't keep your kid away from these things, pride will. Don't only teach your kid to say no because they're scared. Teach them to say no because they're proud. Proud of their strength, their clarity, their self control. Here's how you build that. Give them real responsibility. Make them earn their comforts. Show them what addiction actually looks like. And most importantly, model the standard yourself. Because you can't raise a kid who doesn't need substances. If you need substances, the teenager who's proud of who they are doesn't reach for things that pull them away from that. This is what I teach inside what they're not saying. Teens how to build a kid who never needs to escape their own life. Click the link if you want to future proof your child.

My daughter is beach water. Every day different. Some days calm and clear, some days churning, boiling, crashing. The only constant for a girl is change. The tides pulling her in directions she never chose. Everyone judges the beach against their expectations. Too rough, too calm, too cold. Not what they wanted. Today everyone needs something from the water. Comfort, beauty, peace. But no one asks what the beach needs. Her mother, she's the ocean water. She knows those shallow tides because she lived em. But now she faces currents our daughter can't even see yet. Storms that would terrify the beach. Still, she is expected to be beautiful, bountiful, providing everything without receiving. Sometimes they clash. Beach meeting ocean creates massive riptides. Mother and daughter, both water pulling in different directions, both changing, both under pressure, both exhausted from being everything to everyone. And me, I'm the harbour wall. I don't understand water. I'm stoned. I can't feel the tides. I can't change with the currents. I don't know what it's like to be pulled by the moon. To change without choosing, to be needed by everyone while drowning. But I don't need to understand. I need to be the one thing that doesn't change. The fixed point they can crash against without breaking me. The shelter that's always there. No matter how far they sail or how wild the storm. When my daughter storms against me, I absorb it. When my wife's Ocean rage needs somewhere to break. She can flood into my harbor, and my depths can absorb the chaos, returning it to stillness. Not with solutions. With unshakeable presence. I'm not trying to control the water. I'm giving it a container of safety if they need it. They don't need me to become water, too. They need me to be the harbour. Fast, immovable, always there. That's what fathers and husbands are for. To be the one unchanging thing in a world of constant change.

It was clear from her actions that this wasn't the first time. As a mortician, she lived a solitary life and rarely had anyone truly understand her. Years of emotional repression had LED her to develop unusual habits as a coping mechanism. Just as she was lost in her moment, something strange suddenly happened. She froze, alarmed and quickly fled the room, heart racing with fear. Could he have come back to life? She tried to convince herself it was just her imagination. But when she returned to the room, she was horrified to find the man's body missing. Realising something was terribly wrong, she ran outside in a panic, only to find the man standing behind her. That's when the truth became clear. The man had taken a drug that mimic death and the scar in his abdomen was just makeup. He wasn't a corpse at all, but a local journalist. After hearing rumors about the woman's secret behavior, he devised a plan to investigate it firsthand. Once he confirmed the truth, he exposed her actions in a public report. The woman had no idea he had gone back on his promise to keep things confidential. It wasn't until her wedding day that she discovered he had betrayed her trust.

Before she could react, he tackled her to the ground, instantly cutting off her breath. A passerby tried to intervene, but he was no match for the man. The girl scrambled under her car for cover, only for the man to crawl under after her. To survive, she dashed into a convenience store, but the man showed no intention of letting it go. Like a ninja, he burst through the door. As if driven by a personal vendetta, the woman fled for her life, only to find the back door locked tight. Where could she possibly escape to? Fortunately, a man appeared just in time. Seizing the moment, the woman scrambled into her car. But the man caught up quickly, smashing the window with a single punch. In the nick of time, she started the car, barely escaping with her life. Even then, the man refused to let her go, reaching out with both hands to grab her from behind. The next second, an accident happened. But why was this woman being hunted down? The story began a few days earlier. On a quiet morning. Julie, a teacher, went about her routine as usual. Only one student, Alex, showed up, because at 2:00am the previous night, all 17 students in her class had risen. Simultaneously, they emerged in an eerie formation, as if driven by a shared purpose, dashing relentlessly in the Same direction they ran until they vanished from the surveillance feed, disappearing without a trace. Police scoured every corner of the town, but found nothing. As the teacher of that class, Julie was the first person the police sought out. They suspected she was responsible, but Julie looked utterly innocent because she truly knew nothing. And precisely because of this, Julie became a pariah, frequently receiving abusive calls from parents. Even her car was vandalized with spray paint to clear her name. Julie resolved to investigate personally. She went to Alex's house, hoping to find clues, but upon arrival, she found the front door locked tight, as if no one lived there at all. Feeling puzzled, Julie peered inside. She was instantly startled by what she saw. Alex's parents sat rigidly on the sofa, motionless, as if possessed. To gather clues, Julie quickly sought out her ex boyfriend. Since he was a police officer, she hoped he could assist her, but because they had broken up, he didn't want any trouble. Julie had no choice but to investigate secretly. Soon, however, she fell into a weary sleep. Unbeknownst to her, after she fell asleep, the door to Alex's house slowly opened. Alex's mother emerged holding Scissors. She didn't intend to harm Julie, but instead climbed into the back seat of the car and cut off a lock of her hair. Julie remained completely unaware. The next day, Julie arrived at a gas station when a parent approached her. Since his Child had run away. He'd been checking nearby neighbor's surveillance footage and reached a startling conclusion. The children all ran toward the same location after vanishing. The parent shared this clue with Julie, hoping she could help find a solution. But unexpectedly, at that very moment, the creature suddenly charged toward her. And this person was no stranger to Julie. It was the highly respected principal of the. But why had the principal become this monster? It turned out that just the day before, a woman with bright red hair had approached the principal. She claimed to be Alex's nanny and wanted to learn more about the boy. The principal insisted only the parents could discuss such matters. At first, the principal paid little attention to the incident. But the next day, during the weekend break, the lady came to visit the principal. Out of kindness, the principal invited her inside for a drink of water. The woman insisted on drinking from a bowl. Before the principal could react, she produced a strange object, slashed her own palm, and plunged it into the water. The principal's friend, convinced she was insane, shoved her out the door. But in the next instant, the woman seized his hair and wrapped it around a branch. Terrified, the principal dialed 9 1 1. The woman suddenly produced a belt. The next moment, the principal seemed possessed, his body moving uncontrollably. While his friend stood frozen in shock. The woman tied his hair to the Strange object. As she snapped it off, the principal threw his friend to the ground and killed him. Seeing his friend lifeless, the woman finally retrieved the hair. With satisfaction, she then wrapped Julie's hair around it. Clearly, this was a terrifying form of witchcraft. Next, Julie became the target. The witch assumed Julie would die, but though the spell was sinister, the possessed person's intelligence was gone. While chasing Julie, the principal was struck and killed by a car after running a red light.

Just now, Jenny is because summer is coming to an end, so I was going to take the dogs to play in the water for one last time. Unexpectedly, Danny the dog actually pounced on Jenny to the ground.

Peter wants to run away, but she was controlled by Jenny. Peter lay on Jenny's chest in fear. The entire body remains motionless. In order to enable Peter to learn to swim, Jenny pulled Peter around, but Peter didn't want to be at Jenny's mercy. He swam desperately towards the shore, but it searched for a long time. Nor could I find a way out. Danny also came to the middle of the swimming pool. At this moment, Peter wants to send Danny out. Unfortunately, Danny is not up to the task. He jumped towards Jenny.

Angry, Peter took revenge on Jenny. He was desperately pulling at Jenny's swimsuit.

As he was puzzled, his eyes fell on a photograph. In the photo, he was surrounded by flowers. Only then did he realize that he had already died. Confused, he wandered onto the street. A boy riding a bike suddenly collided with him. To his shock, the boy could actually see him. When he told the boy, I'm a ghost, the child was so scared he turned and ran. The boy hurriedly jumped onto a bus, but the man didn't let him go because he was the only one who could interact with him. He tried to pull the boy off the bus, but he was powerless, so he followed the boy all the way home. After repeatedly assuring the boy he wouldn't harm him, the man finally explained his purpose. He needed the boy's help to sell an airplane he had spent 10 years designing. At first, the boy hesitated, but eventually agreed. The man began teaching him step by step how to operate the airplane. Months later, the boy had become very skilled at flying it. Under the man's guidance, he successfully completed an airshow flight and even landed safely on the runway. The audience was amazed. If even a child could handle it with ease, this plane was bound for great success. In the end, thanks to the boy's impressive performance, the man's design became famous overnight.

But what they didn't know was that my real identity was a Navy seal operator, and the class I was assigned to was the most infamous one in the whole school. They had already scared away 20 teachers before me, but I believed I could get them back on track. The next day, I walked straight into the classroom. Good morning. This time, the students seemed a bit calmer, but during class, they still ignored me completely. Some were eating, some were sleeping, and some were even playing video games. I introduced myself first, but no one cared. They thought I was just as weak as the teachers before me. But what they didn't know was that I had prepared a surprise for them. I picked up a rubber band and a piece of chalk from the desk. In an instant, all of them were soaked, while I stood under an umbrella with a satisfied smile. Go, Ethel Hall. Welcome to my class. Even though I gave them a good lesson, they still had no interest in studying. To change them, I first allowed them to smoke in class and announced that whoever correctly answered three of my questions could leave immediately. I asked one student to hand me a pack of cigarettes, then asked them what ingredients cigarettes were made of. Tommy answered all the questions correctly and walked Out under the jealous eyes of everyone else, everyone got excited. They all wanted to be the next one to leave. But that scene was noticed by the principal in the distance, and he clearly wasn't happy about it. But I didn't care at all. I kept teaching with my open and free methods and continued explaining the components and dangers of tobacco. Gradually, the students began to enjoy my class. The next day, the student who loved smoking suddenly disappeared. I Learned he had been working for a gang. So I went to get my student back, but they were extremely violent fighters. And when they saw I wasn't tall, they told me to get out. But when I heard my student crying for help inside and saw how terrified he was, I didn't hesitate for a second.

To catch the killer as soon as possible, Anna went to the chief to request a forensic expert. But unexpectedly, the chief assigned her own former brother in law as the forensic doctor. Anna, who had just divorced her ex husband, felt extremely awkward, but Anna feared the killer would strike again, so she forced herself to work with him. Jack, the forensic doctor, immediately began his investigation at the place where the girl was dumped. He found the drain opening was very low. A normal adult could not fit through it. And the body was tossed beside the trash pile, not into the pile. At this moment, Jack concluded the killer was very likely a child under 1 m. 5 in height.

The noise not only disturbs them, but can also be heard by everyone in the whole building. To improve their married life, the next day, while her husband is out, Mary goes to her male neighbor, who works as a clown in a circus, and asked him to crawl under the bed to repair the springs. But with the bed stationary, the clown can't figure out what's wrong. So he asked Mary to sit on the bed and keep shaking her body to make the springs move. Soon, the bed starts shaking, but the clown still can't spot the problem. Mary thinks maybe her weight isn't enough, as the springs only make noise when her husband is on top of her. She invites the clown to sit on the bed with her and shake it together to better figure out the issue. The clown doesn't think twice and sits beside Mary. They start shaking the bed in sync, and this feeling makes Mary feel something strange. Her body starts to heat up inexplicably. Sure enough, after they shake the bed for a while, the clown quickly finds the problem based on the different rhythms. He takes out an oil can, pour some oil on the springs and fixes the issue. Mary's very grateful to him. However, just as the clown is about to leave Mary Sees that the children from the upstairs neighbor's house have used a hook to snatch the clothes she hung out to dry and are playing with them. Then they casually throw the clothes and they happen to get caught on the street light in front. Mary gets very angry and starts scolding the two kids. Unexpectedly.

Seeing that the clown has helped her again, Mary develops a strong liking for this man. Even the way she looks at him becomes full of longing.

She says if she waters it 20,000 times, the stone will grant her any wish. But I never believed her. I grabbed a crowbar and knocked the stone over. Then I picked it up and carried it away. The villagers quickly put their hands together and prayed devoutly. But to their surprise, I carried the stone straight under the waterfall. Then I told my mother, this way we could water it 50,000 times at once. But soon, something strange happened. A mask suddenly fell to my feet. From that day on, I couldn't stop staring at it. Until one day, I accidentally traced the outline of the face on the mask. I slowly drew out the person's features. Somehow, I felt my heart race, so I ran toward the top of the waterfall. When I reached the source, I saw a fairy covered in colorful butterflies. I leaped toward her with all my strength. But just as I grabbed a branch, she vanished. Following her guidance, I climbed through the waterfall for three days and nights. Finally, I made a bow and arrow from branches. I jumped and fired an arrow. The sword pierced through a tall tree and got stuck at the top. I finally made it to the summit. The fairy was right in front of me. Just as I reached out to touch her, Annie turned into a butterfly and flew away. I searched the forest for her traces. Suddenly, I heard a scream. I ran to check it out. I saw Annie running out of the woods with soldiers chasing behind her. It was clear she was being hunted. To protect her, I followed them closely. When the soldiers were about to catch her, Annie shouted a mysterious spell. A sword flew through the air. He turned around and the blade pierced through the soldier's body. Then the rest of the soldiers fell one by one. Turns out archers were hidden among the trees. Annie killed every soldier below without a single drop of blood on her. In that moment, I was completely captivated. So to catch her, I set a trap to lure her in. Soon she fell right into it. I happily came to take a look, but suddenly a sword pressed against my back. She had somehow gotten behind me and her sword pierced into my body. I told her I'd already fallen in love with her. Then I held her tightly in my arms. Unfortunately, we rolled down the snowy mountain together. Annie was furious. She tried to strike me down, but I flipped backward and tore off her sleeve. Then I turned and pulled off her coat, lifted her long hair and washed her under the waterfall. Crushed berries to draw eyeliner and lipstick on her face. She turned around and saw me holding the mask she had lost. Then she realized I had come for her. She was touched and hugged me tightly. But she still had to rescue the princess, so she knocked me out and left alone. Not long after she left, an accident happened. A soldier threw a fishing net over her, catching her alive. When they tried to harm her, I showed up just in time. As the soldiers got closer, I pushed down a huge boulder. It stopped the pursuers, but unexpectedly, the impact triggered a landslide. I quickly grabbed some tree bark and slid down the slope with Annie. Just as the snow was about to bury us alive, a cliff appeared ahead. I leapt forward with her, and we both survived. Soon I arrived at the palace, where workers were raising a giant statue of the king. But suddenly, a slave slipped, triggering a chain reaction.

She didn't show her intentions directly, just quietly wrote down my employee number and left with a faint, mysterious smile on her lips. Not long after, the head of security called my name and assigned me to serve a VIP named Annie. The one I was supposed to look after wasn't Annie herself. It was a bottle of wine marked with her personal number, and that number was bottle No.. 9. The rules were crystal clear. If anything happened to that bottle, my job would end right there. I had no idea what Annie was planning, but since the rules were set, I had to play by them. Guarding a bottle of wine didn't sound that hard. Anyway. When I followed the team into the private room, the scene in front of me was surprising. Several middle aged ladies were playing games with handsome young men, while Annie sat alone in the corner talking on the phone. All the wine bottles were frozen inside clear blocks of ice. I quietly stood next to bottle No. 9 and watched things unfold. Suddenly, the deputy team leader called me outside and accused me of being unprofessional. He claimed he had never served Annie, so how could a rookie like me get the job? As he spoke, he yanked off my No.. 9 badge and pinned it on himself. Honestly, that worked perfectly for me. I Had been wondering how to get out of this mess, but when Annie noticed that the person guarding Bottle 9 had changed, she slowly walked up to the deputy. She gently tapped the number on his badge, and the deputy thought she was showing interest in him, completely unaware that Annie was already angry. She picked up the bottle he was supposed to protect, check the number, and said coldly that maybe she had misread it. Before anyone could react, the priceless wine was smashed onto the floor. Just as she grabbed a second bottle, the floor leader, who once set me up, suddenly appeared to stop her. Trying to win Annie's favor, he suggested playing a bottle choosing game with the loser fulfilling one wish of the winner. Annie picked out two bottles, but the floor leader chose one more, saying he'd take on all three at once. His bold proposal only made Annie more excited to pump up the guards. The floor leader pulled out a thick stack of cash as a reward. The guards were fired up, confident that the skinny floor leader didn't stand a chance. But they had no idea who they were dealing with. He took them down with ease, pinning one guard onto the table while casually popping open a bottle of wine. Even faced with such a scene, Annie wasn't afraid at all. In fact, her eyes lit up with excitement. The guards, unwilling to accept defeat, charged again. But they were Knocked down a second time, each ending up with a broken arm, Annie watched everything unfold, and a look of pure fascination slowly spread across her face.

Then he knocked out all my teeth. After that, he pushed me into a large oven with a car. Once I was neatly placed inside, he slowly closed the oven door. Then he used a key to turn on the oven switch. Next, he set the temperature to 200 degrees. After 30 minutes, he opened the oven. This process could shrink a normal human being by 2,000 times in an instant. To solve the issue of overpopulation on earth, the doctor developed a shrinking technology. It could shrink a normal person down to only 10 cm. This would greatly alleviate the problem of overpopulation. These people would produce less trash in four years than a normal human does in one day. The most important thing was in this world, $1,000 was worth $10 million. A 1,000 square meter villa could be bought for only $99. I, being poor, was very tempted by this. So the next day, I took my wife to visit the miniature world and we plan to undergo the shrinking procedure. But before shrinking, we had to shave off all our body hair. Then we had to knock out all our teeth, because teeth don't shrink. If we didn't remove them, they would explode our brains. And we were pushed into the large oven. Thirty minutes later, a group of nurses came in pushing small carts. They carefully used small shovels to lift us up and slowly placed us On tiny beds. When I woke up, I quickly threw off the blanket. Seeing that my body was normal, I relaxed. But then my wife called. She had changed her mind while shaving her eyebrows. She didn't undergo the shrinking procedure. Hearing this, I was devastated because the shrinking procedure is irreversible. So I went to the miniature world alone, heartbroken. It was exactly like the outside world. I then went to my villa, but not long after, I received a delivery. It was a 50 karat diamond ring from my wife, along with a divorce agreement the size of the house for me to sign. At that moment, I realized I could never satisfy her again. So I signed it. Abandoned by my wife, I decided to find a new wife in the miniature world.

Nothing red is allowed here. Not even a single red flower can stay. It must be picked immediately or it'll bring death. Because a bloodthirsty monster lives outside the village, red is its forbidden colour. If it sees red, it kills everyone in sight. Villagers can't leave the gate either. Step past the border and the monster tears you to pieces. But Eddie didn't believe the rumours. He not only left the village, he picked a bunch of red flowers in the forest. That very night, strange things happened. A night watchman saw a red draped monster charge into the village. He yanked the alarm bell. Hearing the bell, the villagers bolted for home. They hid in the cellars they'd prepared. Their faces showed exactly how terrifying the monster was. Right then, Eddie's girlfriend waited at the door, frantic. The monster was about to swallow her whole. Eddie arrived in time and yanked her inside. He slammed the door shut and rushed her into the cellar to hide. But the next day, the monster left a Mark on Eddie's door that meant its revenge wasn't over. To appease the monster, the villagers offered sacrifices at once, hoping to earn its forgiveness. Sure enough, the monster didn't show up that night. The village returned to a brief calm.

He immediately grabbed his tools and rushed out of the room. Soon Eddie was showing god his daily tasks. First, he made an artificial snow mountain out of flour, then started observing the Amazon rainforest. Whenever the big tree grew taller, he would go and trim it. It turned out that Eddie's job was to be God's gardener. However, while he was adjusting the water level of the Pacific Ocean, he saw something strange. A group of natives had surrounded him, each of them holding a weapon and their leader was glaring at Eddie with fierce eyes. It turned out that Eddie had accidentally pushed their boat away and now these savages had surrounded him demanding an explanation. Eddie immediately apologized to them. Hello. Uh, I'm sorry, but ready yet? Do you think you could wait here a moment? But even after his apology, the natives anger didn't subside. They tightly gripped their weapons and Eddie was frozen in fear by their intense presence. But this wasn't entirely the natives fault. Even though Eddie was just doing his job, every action he took could have a massive impact on the natives. And in a way, this was disrupting the ecological balance. This incident made Eddie realise something important and he decisively handed in his resignation to god, deciding to never again disturb the native's Way of life. The natives were ecstatic when they heard the news, and under the chief's lead, they knelt down to thank Eddie. Eddie accepted their gratitude and soon happily left their homeland of wildlife.

Parecía que estaba a punto de romper la red en cualquier momento. Unos chillidos inquietantes salían de su interior. No era un sonido que pudiera hacer un pez. Me di cuenta de que algo no iba bien. Rápidamente pedí una escopeta de caza y de pronto, con ese disparo, comenzó una guerra épica entre la humanidad y el océano. Un equipo especial de inteligencia británica recibió el informe y bloqueó cientos de kilómetros de zona marítima. Al principio todos pensaron que era una broma, hasta que vieron el reflejo de aquel cadáver. El general dijo que en los mitos eran conocidos como monstruos marinos. Su estructura corporal era muy similar a la humana, coincidía con rasgos humanos. Los biólogos afirmaron que hasta ahora no existía registro alguno de semejante criatura en la tierra. Sí que su sexo no podía determinarse. Además, llevaba en el cuello una perla muy extraña. Los biólogos, en una evaluación inicial, determinaron que funcionaba como una especie de identificación capaz de ocultar información biológica. Pero con la tecnología científica actual, solo era posible detectar carbonato de calcio. Debido a la posibilidad de una civilización submarina. Y para evitar un conflicto, el general ordenó devolver la perla a su lugar y suspender la investigación por el momento. Aún así, se formó de inmediato un grupo de investigación para escanear toda la zona portuaria cercana. Necesitábamos pistas sobre lo que dale había descubierto y efectivamente, había una anomalía en el área. Dos años Antes, un tsunami había destruido todos los cables de comunicación. Cada intento de repararlos había coincidido con incidentes extraños. Ahora parecía claro que todo era obra de ellos. Además, basándonos en sus órganos de sonido, se creó un dispositivo avanzado de traducción que envió señales al fondo del Mar. El mensaje de saludo fue transmitido con éxito. Solo quedaba esperar una respuesta, pero nadie sabía que la crisis ya estaba en camino. Esa misma noche, un soldado que vigilaba el castillo estaba sirviéndose agua. Cuando notó que el suelo bajo sus pies estaba mojado, pensó que era una simple fuga en la habitación. Su compañera se levantó para revisarlo un segundo. Después cayó al suelo. El hombre corrió hacia ella para ayudarla, pero ya era demasiado tarde. La mujer desapareció de inmediato y después él también. Cuando ambos llegaron al agua bajo el suelo, la habitación quedó en silencio. Otro ser acuático emergió del piso y se llevó los cuerpos. De pronto sonaron las alarmas. Los soldados corrieron hasta la sala del incidente, pero extrañamente, aparte de los cuerpos y de los soldados desaparecidos, la habitación estaba completamente vacía. El general trató de contactar a los desaparecidos, pero descubrió horrorizado que bajo el suelo de la sala se oían chillidos por el transmisor. El general tuvo una sospecha terrible. Se agachó de inmediato para inspeccionar de nuevo

Kenton Scott, Mr. THORSON's assistant. Uh, no. I mean, yes, but he's only supposed to be assisting me when I'm working on the show. And right now, I'm at my real job, and I'm still on probation, so I need you to go now, okay? No. What? What do you mean, no? You work for me. Technically, I work for your mother. And she scares the hell out of me. In the best way. She's amazing. I love her. But if I make a mistake, she'll catapult me to the sun. So I'm here for you 24 7. So should I ride with you or just follow in my car? Probably my car, so I can run errands if you. Ken, Ken, Ken, take a breath. Okay. Uh, assistants get lunch, right? Yes, absolutely. Okay. I'm having this wild pregnancy craving for some, uh, bulgogi tacos. Great. I'm sure I can find that around. but not just any bulgogi tacos. They have to be from Apollo Yang's food truck, which is parked at a different location every day. And the only way to obtain that location is to text a secret password to a specific shortcode, which I don't have on it. Bulgogi tacos. I don't know what style you like, so I got two of each. Ken, how did you find these? Captain's the LA assistant hive mind. The truck was on location in Santa Clarita serving the movie crew. I drove over, put on My headset. Walk right up like I was part of the crew. your tacos are courtesy of the director of Murder Dance Party Part 3. Damn, you are good. No, I'm the best. Oh, cocky too. Alright, I like that. But what I have for you now is. It's next level. Are you up for it? Bring a detective. Alright. Um. I have been looking for this doll that I had when I was a little girl to give to my daughter, but I can't remember what it was called and I haven't been able to find it anywhere. But she was the first doll that I ever saw that had hair and skin tone. It was just like mine. She had this, um, French sounding name. Like a pink parasol. Or was it yellow? I'm on it. Watch me do my thing. What? Here, I. I can't have these. No way. Told you I was no joke. What? I've not seen one of these since I was 10. Where did you find this? You can get anything on the dark web. Wow, thank you. You really are the best assistant ever. But you don't lose him. Actually, I have to tender my resignation. Hulu just bought my pilot. What? That's great. Congratulations. Thanks. Guess I need my own assistant now. Good luck with the show and your baby. Thank you.

That moment lit a fire in my creative soul. I knew I had to capture the scene. Even after the model left, I couldn't shake that feeling. Even though I was working my ass off, my art just lacked that spark. This really let Amy down. Even the teacher thought I wasn't cut out for this. Meanwhile, my classmate Jimmy came from money, which gave him a huge advantage. Got praised to the skies for some kindergarten level painting. I thought it was totally unfair. In class, I openly mocked Jimmy in front of everyone. The two of us started going at it, but I didn't care about any of that. I put all my energy into chasing Amy, trying every trick in the book to win her over. But Amy wasn't interested in me at all. She was into the ambitious Jimmy instead. This made me question everything about my life. Then a serial killer showed up at our school. Seeing teachers and classmates get brutally murdered unleashed my artistic genius. I painted it all down, even submitted them to the school exhibition. The cops investigating the case saw my paintings and immediately suspected I was the killer. But I didn't defend myself. Once word got out, me and my work instantly blew up. In the end, I was living it up in prison.

We were actually having a great time. The next morning before work, my wife stopped me, wanting me to stay and chat, but I told her to wait at home for me to come back. Suddenly, Mia heard me cry out in pain. She rushed to help me, but I felt dizzy and weak. The next day, I went to see my doctor friend for a checkup. When the doctor saw my beautiful wife, he immediately figured out what was wrong. After the examination, he told me my body was too weak and warned me to stay away from my wife or my condition would only get worse. But I refused. I loved her too much. After I left, the doctor secretly approached Mia, saying he could keep her company now and this would help my recovery, too. That night, the doctor tried to check Mia's heartbeat, but just as she was undressing, he suddenly had a heart attack and died on the spot. Terrified, Mia called me. I rushed over and took him to the hospital, but it was too late. After attending my friend's funeral, I became quiet and withdrawn. To cheer me up, Mia planned a surprise. Soon, our lives slowly got back on track, happier than ever before.

Apparently our social media intern posted that it was parking ticket Amnesty day. Just bring in your ticket and all will be forgiven. We have a social media intern. Not for long because I'm going to kill her. Okay, everybody listen up. If you are here because of the Amnesty post, it's an April Fool's joke. Okay? You still have to pay your tickets. Now the good news is you're in the right place to get that done. Really? Thanks. But a whole new line is going to start up again as long as that post is up. Are you the social media intern? If you're looking for help setting up a TikTok account? It's not my job. Definitely not. Look, social media is the worst of us. I, I'm here because you posted that it was parking ticket amnesty day on the LAPD account. Fire, right? No, not fire unless it's the kind you have to put out. Who approved this? Hmm. Captain, give me a long leash to increase our social following. Ergo. Ergo. You made a promise we can't keep. Look, once parking tickets are issued, they're in the system. They can't legally be waved, which means you pissed off a bunch of people who are taking it out on us. Okay. Can I offer a suggestion? No. Your whole vibe needs work. Yeah, there's like an art to giving criticism. I like to start with a compliment, then gently deliver the note and Then end it with a compliment like a little feel good sandwich. Delete the tweet now. Oh, no, no, no, no. A dirty delete will get us canceled. But I can issue an apology statement with something cute. Fine. Get on it. Could have put an email. My god, what's going on? He's not honoring our get out of jail free cards. That's not a thing. Then why is it on the LAPD social media account? What? What the hell were you thinking? Raising your voice in the workplace is a sign of weakness, not strength. You posted get out of jail free cards. Oh, I couldn't just delete the parking ticket tweet. I mean, that's scream scandal. So I retracted it with something that is clearly a joke. Not to the growing number of criminals in holding demanding we release them. This is not funny. No. How dumb people are is always funny. It's clear on the post. It's an April Fool's joke. See, it says April Fool's. This is not redeemable. Tiny print. No one can read. Okay, Boomer, go find our glasses. I'm sorry, Boomer. This is not my fault. Mr Lulu's didn't even scan the QR code. If they had, they would have seen this. Okay. You know what? Your reckless behavior has cost US Department time and resources. The fact that you keep making excuses lets me know that you don't see why that's a problem. You're fired. Uh, you can't fire me. I'm a civilian employee. You're right. You've been fired by the office of Support Services and they were happy to let me be the one to tell you. So pack up your stuff and be grateful you're not leaving this room in handcuffs. You don't have to be so mean about it. Uh oh. What social media intern I just fired posted this, city of Los Angeles, for the next 3 hours, all crime is legal. Go nuts and don't call us.

Then she asked her sculptor friend to make a statue of her husband and used that statue to unlock his computer. She transferred all the money from his accounts and deleted all the secrets in his computer. But this also made the sculptor suspicious of her. A billionaire jumping to his death just didn't sound believable at all. That night, the sculptor opened a recording from 30 years ago. But what he never expected was that the tape hit a terrifying truth. He discovered that before the actor drowned in the water tank, Lisa had intentionally turned off the alarm light beside him. A chill instantly ran down his spine. He never imagined that the actor's death had nothing to do with him and was actually engineered by Lisa. Later, he brought the tape to Lisa's place to ask her about what happened 30 years ago. Unexpectedly, Lisa admitted it right away. But she claimed she never meant for the actor to die. She explained that everything was for creating the most perfect film possible and insisted it was just an accident. The sculptor then got straight to the point, asking whether her husband knew the truth. Faced with such a piercing question, Lisa's answer became vague and evasive. The next second, she changed the subject completely. At that moment, the sculptor seemed to realize everything, so he angrily threw the tape into the fire. And walked away without looking back. However, when Lisa thought that all the evidence had been destroyed, she suddenly noticed signs that the tape had been tampered with, and the part showing her turning off the light was missing. Clearly, that portion had been taken by the sculptor. But Lisa didn't panic at all, because just 6 7 minutes earlier, the sculptor had drunk the poison tea she gave him. He was probably already dead on the way home. Sure enough, the sculptor began losing consciousness while driving. But he still forced himself to make it home. By the time his apprentice found him lying on the ground, he had already drawn his last breath. When the news of the sculptor's death reached Lisa, she felt a surge of joy. Because next, all she needed to do was buy the sculptor's workshop and retrieve the missing part of the tape. And the truth from 30 years ago would be buried forever.

Then I smeared her body with lard. I wrapped her tightly in layers of gauze. By the next morning, I gently unwrapped the cloth and scraped the lard off. Her skin, bit by bit, was soaked with her scent, slowly seeping into the fat. I placed it into a pot to distill a bottle of perfume. So simple, yet so perfect. But that wasn't enough. I knew only by collecting 13 different body scents could I create the one truly perfect perfume. This perfume would be unlike anything the world had ever known. In the days that followed, young girls in the town kept turning up dead. My work had only just begun. The town's people's fear spread like smoke. They locked up their daughters at night. But those locks meant nothing to me. They couldn't stop me because I knew their scent. And I knew how to move without a sound. Soon I had gathered 12 bottles of scent. And the last one, I saved it for the princess. One day, I caught a whiff of something unique in the air. A noble fragrance, crisp, refined and delicate. This was the scent I had been searching for. But the string of murders in the town made the king fear for his daughter's life. He ordered his men to take her away. But they were wrong. I wasn't searching with my eyes. I was following with my nose. Her Scent slowly faded from the town, so I followed it quietly. When I reached her in, there were guard dogs stationed there, but the dogs sensed nothing. Strange because I had no scent of my own. The next day, when the king called for his daughter to leave, she was already dead. With the final bottle of scent secured, I could no longer hold back my desire. I mixed the 12 other scents together, and in that moment, the most unique, the most perfect perfume in the world was born.

Cuando salí al balcón para ver qué había pasado, vi un helicóptero militar estrellarse contra el edificio de al lado. Me asusté mucho antes de que pudiera reaccionar. Un grito estridente y rugidos llegaron desde abajo. Me asomé con cuidado y vi que todos corrían aterrados. ¿Qué estaba pasando? En medio de la multitud, vi a mi novia. Grité para que volviera a la casa, pero al siguiente segundo, ella se lanzó hacia un anciano y comenzó a morderlo frenéticamente. Me asusté mucho. Corrí de vuelta a la casa, pero en ese momento un hombre irrumpió en mi hogar. Era mi vecino. Dijo que su esposa había enloquecido y me rogó que lo dejara esconderse antes de que pudiera reaccionar. Se tapó el cuello y corrió hacia el baño. Noté que tenía una mordedura clara en el cuello. Tuve un mal presentimiento. Rápidamente tomé un cuchillo para defenderme. En ese momento, la televisión transmitió una noticia de emergencia diciendo que una nueva variante del virus COVID se había propagado por la ciudad. Los infectados se convertían en monstruos violentos sedientos de sangre. Cualquiera que fuera mordido se convertiría en un zombi. Después de ver las noticias, mi vecino rápidamente dijo que estaba bien, pero justo en ese momento, sus ojos comenzaron a sangrar. Su cuerpo empezó a deformarse. Aún no había perdido completamente la razón y bajo la amenaza de mi cuchillo, salió corriendo aterrorizado. Inmediatamente cerré la puerta con llave, pero luego escuché Un terrible grito. Miré por la mirilla y vi a mi vecino desgarrado por los infectados. Realmente me asusté mucho. Supe que afuera los infectados ya habían tomado el control. Lo primero que pensé fue en mis padres. Afortunadamente, mi padre me envió un mensaje diciendo que estaban seguros y me advirtió que me quedara en casa. Me di cuenta de que mi supervivencia dependía completamente de mí mismo y debía evitar que los infectados entraran rápidamente. Empujé el refrigerador hasta la puerta. Luego cubrí las ventanas con papel para que los infectados afuera no me pudieran ver. Después moví la cama a la sala para que pudiera vigilar la puerta en todo momento. Cada día dibujaba una línea en el espejo para recordarme que debía sobrevivir. Pero esa noche, cuando estaba a punto de dormir, escuché ruidos provenientes del baño. Sentí una mala premonición. Tomé un bate de béisbol. Me acerqué sigilosamente. Para mi sorpresa, un infectado estaba saliendo por el conducto de ventilación del baño. Me oculté detrás del sofá y observé el infectado caminaba lentamente, acercándose hacia mí

I possess the power of teleportation. As long as I have a clear image in my mind, I can jump anywhere in the world. I can also bring along anyone or anything I touch. This ability makes me far stronger than Nightcrawler from the X Men. But like all teleporters, I share a dangerous weakness. I cannot teleport into solid objects. We jumpers are the natural enemies of the Paladins. The Paladins are a highly disciplined organization. They see jumpers as unnatural, a threat to order itself. Roland, their leader, considers hunting jumpers a righteous duty. It wasn't long before I caught his attention. One day, after a casual jump, I returned to find my room disturbed. Upstairs stood a man with pure white hair. It was Roland. He told me my power was not allowed in this world. He pulled out a specialized stun weapon designed for people like me. Instinctively, I tried to jump away. But Rowland struck me just as I tried to escape. My mind scrambled and I couldn't stabilize my teleport. In that moment, he mercilessly tormented me. Rowland had been hunting me for years. I had used my powers in ways I shouldn't have. I knew if I didn't jump now, he would kill me. Summoning all my focus, I managed to teleport to another room. Then I jumped again, fleeing the place. I never imagined Rowland could be so cold. He killed those around me without hesitation. I was Filled with hatred for him, I embarked on a path of vengeance. Later, I met another jumper named Griffin. His teleportation skills were unmatched. He knew the Paladins better than anyone. His goal was to eliminate every Paladin. We became allies in the fight against them. With his guidance, I Learned to fight using teleportation. I also Learned to safely carry objects and people while jumping. Then I received news that Rollin was targeting my girlfriend. I immediately teleported to her house. Rowland was already outside. I revealed my identity to her. Rowland was hunting me and everyone nearby. To protect her, I teleported us away. We arrived at Griffin's hideout. Griffin exploded in anger when he saw me. Rowland could track teleportation traces through technology. He would soon find our hideout. Roland used modern tech to teleport right to us. Griffin and Roland had a long standing feud. Roland had killed Griffin's mother when they were children. Griffin had been waiting for years to take revenge. This time, he used everything he had to end Roland. He teleported through Tokyo using a bus as a weapon. Roland barely dodged. Griffin sent Rowland back to his teleport starting point. He planted explosives and returned to finish the job. At the crucial moment, a rope pulled my girlfriend to safety. Griffin was ready to detonate the explosives. To protect her, I snatched the detonator from him. Griffin and I engaged in a continuous teleport battle. I eventually trapped him on a Power tower. I ran to my girlfriend's house to face the Paladins alone. Roland and his allies were lying in ambush. I was restrained by electric cords. To save my girlfriend, I teleported half the house into the sea. Then I jumped to a library. Rowland still refused to let us go. Finally, I LED Rowland to a deserted island. I let him face hunger and despair and isolation. I returned to my girlfriend and continued living in peace.

Facing my anger, my son said he genuinely love this job and he even wanted to open his own restaurant through hard work. I felt completely helpless hearing that. Then I told him to get away from this table immediately because I was about to discuss a big contract with a client here and I didn't want the client to know I had such a disappointing son. My son said nothing and walked away. Soon, the client arrived at the restaurant. I warmly invited him to sit down. A waiter handed us the menus. Client was unhappy with the waiter's attitude. He immediately called for the restaurant manager and demanded a more polite waiter. My worst fear came true. The manager actually asked my son to serve us. The moment I heard my son's voice, my heart filled with panic. Have you already made his choices? Have we met somewhere before? You look familiar to me. Maybe you've been here before.

I'm sorry, sir, but I really don't understand you. I'm Gonna share a little secret with you, okay? People go to restaurants because they wanna drink, but also because they wanna eat. Do you understand this? Or you're some kind of an idiot? I'm sorry. Have you already made your selections? Well done. Steak with the chef sauce and bring another one for my colleague. Then my son brought out the steak, but the client angrily claimed it wasn't cooked at all and deliberately dumped the steak onto his own foot. What are you doing? I seem to have spilled grease on my shoes. I'm gonna need you to clean it up for me. Facing the client's unreasonable demands on my son, I chose to tolerate it. But to keep my business deal from being affected, my son actually humbled himself and wiped the client's shoes. But the client got even worse. He yelled at my son for wiping the wrong way, then pushed him straight to the floor. At that moment, I couldn't hold back anymore. You're fired. Ha! How you like that, huh? You happy? Cause you're trash and you're finished. Shut up, George. What did you say? That's my son and you're not gonna talk to him that way. A little waiter boy. Yeah, the waiter's my son, but don't judge him for it. I might have to rethink the deal then. No, George, there's no deal. You're abusive and you humiliate normal people and you're not any better. After that, I turned around and left with My son. The client's behavior made me realize my own problems and made me understand how much my past actions had wronged my son. I then took the initiative to apologize to him. But just then, the client started applauding as he walked toward us. I've been waiting so long for you to stand up for your son. What? You know, this is my restaurant and I knew your boy was working here. It's really important that the people I do business with, that they value their family.

Sure enough, with her help, they wrapped up the task in no time. James had originally traveled here with his wife. But not only did they run into one of her die hard fans, they even ended up in hot water. Luckily, though, the laws around here were anything but ordinary. They bought a clone to take the fall for them. Then came the twist. That night, Jenny suddenly dragged him to a party. Every single person there had broken the law at some point. Before long, they pulled off a reckless stunt. And just like that, they got arrested again. What's worse, the sheriff told them they weren't allowed to buy another clone to bail them out. But here's the kicker. That warning was only for the clone to hear. By this point, James had practically slipped into the chaos of this lawless world. When he brought the second jar of ashes back to the hotel room, his wife froze in terror. She made up her mind right then and there. She wasn't waiting for her husband any longer. She fled the place, leaving him behind for good. Little did she know, her departure was a gift to James and Jenny. From that day on, they dived headfirst into a life with zero rules, zero limits. And then they hatched a new scheme. They decided to kidnap the sheriff. The plan went off Without a hitch, James was spiraling into full blown madness, high on the thrill of it all. But the second Jenny pulled off her mask, James's blood ran cold. He stared at her in utter, bone chilling shock.

Then I brought her back to life because yesterday was her birthday, so I played hide and seek with her. She hid by the roadside, saw her cat run into the street. She wanted to grab it, but she didn't see a truck approaching from behind. My son saw his older sister run away, so he wanted to run over to find his older sister. I spotted him heading for the road, got there just in time to pull him back, although the driver immediately adjusted the steering wheel but still collided toward my daughter. When I walked over, nothing left but her cold body. After she passed away, my wife and I arranged a funeral for her. My wife completely broke down. She took our son back to her parents place. I can only drown my sorrows with my neighbors. Over drinks, he told me about a burial ground in the back hills. Bury the dead there and they come back, but it will turn into a monster. He warned me not to do it, but I just couldn't listen to it. I just wanted her alive. After he fell asleep, I headed to that cemetery with the shovel, dug her out of the ground, looked at her face. My mind was made up. I carried her to the place the neighbor mentioned. Monster on the road tried to block my way. I didn't care. Kept walking, then holding her in My arms. I finally made it to that place. Then I put her inside. Back home, I lay in bed waiting for her. Sound broke the silence. I walked to the door and found no one there. When I turned around, I saw the footprints on the ground. I thought she was back. I followed them to the basement. Finally, I came to a curtain. I pulled it aside to find only a mask. My heart sank. Then she appeared behind me. Daddy. I turned around and saw her standing there. I can't describe what I felt. I can only take her to get a bath first. While combing her hair, I noticed her scalp had been stitched. After seeing it, I didn't think much of it. I just changed her into fresh clothes and let her rest. The next day, she put on dirty clothes again. I was just about to walk up and ask her. She snapped, started smashing everything. I had to yell at her to stop. Just then, my wife suddenly called. I didn't want her to know, hung up right away, but she sent the neighbor to check. He knocked on my door and I didn't let him in, made up an excuse, sent him away. He knew something was off, turned back, saw my daughter staring at him from the window. He panicked, ran home and locked the door. A little later, he heard strange sounds from upstairs, so I went upstairs to take A look, found nothing and was about to turn and leave. Just then, my daughter suddenly appeared. She grabbed a knife and stabbed him over and over. And I finally realized my daughter was gone and went to look for her. That's when my wife came back with her son. She saw MUD all over my feet. She wanted to know what I've been doing. I was about to explain. My daughter walked in. My wife froze when she saw her. I told her everything. My daughter hugged her right away, but she couldn't accept it. The wife pushed her away and carried her son upstairs. I tried to get my wife to accept our daughter, but she knew this daughter was no longer who she used to be. I was just about to speak. She noticed our daughter standing at the door listening. I knew she was angry, ran after her right away. Thought she went to the neighbors. The moment I left, she picked up a kitchen knife. My wife is about to rest. When I arrived at my neighbor's house, I discovered he had already passed away. Only now do I realize that what I resurrected was a monster. I rushed home, saw my wife screaming for me to catch our son. I grabbed him. My daughter stabbed her mother again. I put my son in the car. By the time I got upstairs, my wife was barely breathing. Just then, my daughter suddenly appeared behind me. And knocked me out cold. When I woke, my wife had vanished. To find my wife, I went to the burial ground again. Suddenly, my daughter appeared behind me and stabbed me. I dropped to my knees, but she was still just a kid. I overpowered her fast. Just as I was about to end it, a metal rod pierced through my body. The one who killed me was my wife. My daughter buried her there and brought her back to life. They dragged my body, intending to place me in that grave as well. Finally, the three of us walked together toward our son sitting in the car.

Whenever I go outside, I tie a hemp rope around myself. The rope is just long enough to reach from my house to the edge of the woods where a figure often appears. Even though I was born blind, my mother forced me to go out hunting every day. Cans hanging from trees served as markers with animal traps set beneath them. Whenever I caught something, my mother would have me keep half for ourselves and throw the other half into the woods. I never understood why, but I always did as she asked. One day, while checking the traps, as usual, I felt a rusted iron chain. My mother immediately called out to me. Someone out there not to go too far. What are you doing? I was trying to find big ones here. I'm sorry. Seemed anxious about something and rushed me back home right away. That night, after putting me to sleep, my mother opened the door and walked outside. She never came back. Fast forward over 10 years, I grew up with only a cassette tape my mother left behind and an old goat for company. On the tape, my mother emphasized three survival rules. First, always throw half of whatever I catch into the woods. Second, sing the hymn she taught me whenever I feel desperate. Third, and most important, never go outside without tying the rope around myself. Then one day, a sound from the woods shattered my quiet Existence. I slowly moved toward it, but the rope held me back. Sometimes I wondered why my mother left me here and why the rope only reached to the edge of the woods. These thoughts kept me up at night. Then I heard bleeding from the woods. I quickly tied on my rope and felt my way toward the sound. The rope soon ran out to find out what was happening. I crouched down and reached out, only to touch the goat's head covered in blood. Just as I was trying to make sense of it, something dragged the goat away. I lost my only friend, Billy. The weather grew colder and my food supply dwindled. Just when I didn't know what to do, I heard a gunshot nearby. I felt my way toward the sound and found a deer lying on the ground. Then a man approached from behind. When I came to, the man apologized profusely. He'd mistaken me for trying to steal his kill and knocked me out. To make up for it, he offered to share his catch with me. Late that night, as we slept, strange sounds came from the woods again. The hell was that? You know what that was? No, you just stay here. I'll be right back. I begged him not to go out there, but he went anyway.

Then I cut wire and piece the scattered bones back together one by one. Soon a complete skeleton is finished, and that is the gift I give my daughter. But my daughter isn't scared. She excitedly runs to Skeleton Grandpa for a hug. Actually, the little girl is a skeleton, too. Even the girl's mother is a skeleton. I am a terrifying murderer, and I suffer from severe dissociative identity disorder. I've been single for many years, so I've always fantasized about having a whole family. So I turn the people I catch into members of my family. One day when I went out to get the mail, I found a young couple had moved in across the street. I took a liking to the woman across the way. After greeting them, I started plotting how to make my move. That night, when they were about to drive home, they accidentally knocked over the mailbox in front of my house. And I wanted to go apologize, but she found no one answering inside. So Jack left a note explaining why. Little did they know I was hiding in a corner and saw everything. Luckily, they didn't notice the skull inside the mailbox. That was my first wife. Early the next morning, the couple was shocked to discover the mailbox that had been knocked over last night was now perfectly intact. Out of politeness, They still decided to come over and apologize. Seeing the prey come to my door, I hurriedly and warmly invited them inside. From our chat, I Learned they just moved here for work and they had no friends in the area, which for me made them perfect prey. But then my fantasy kicked in again. I saw Anna constantly winking at me and saying I was her ideal type. I'm a little deaf in this year. I was just saying how sorry we are about your mailbox. You have been so nice about it. I generously told her it was fine and that no compensation was necessary. So they invited me over for dinner that night. Facing the praise invitation, I was more than willing. That evening, I arrived at their house on time. The moment I walked in, I asked to see the basement because to me it's a great place to kill. But Jack said the basement light wasn't installed yet. You couldn't see a thing. So I snuck out to the backyard to look for another spot. But I unexpectedly saw something unusual. The couple seemed to be arguing about something and they had no idea I was hiding in the dark watching them.

After that, they pushed me into a giant oven, laid me down neatly inside, then slowly close the oven door, turn the key to start the switch and set the temperature to 200 degrees. After 30 minutes, they opened it again. This can shrink a normal human to thousand times smaller in an instant. To solve the problem of overpopulation, a scientist developed a shrinking technology that can shrink a person down to just 10 centimeters tall. They eat less and live in tiny houses. The trash they produce in four years is less than what normal people throw away in a day. And the best part, $10,000 in the real world equals 10 million here. A huge mansion of 10,000 square meters only cost 99 bucks. As a poor man, I was tempted. The next day, my wife and I came to visit the miniature world for the procedure. But before shrinking, they had to shave off all our hair, then knock out all our teeth, because teeth can't shrink. If not removed, they would crush our heads. Then we were pushed into the giant oven. 30 minutes later, a group of nurses came in with small carts. They carefully scooped us up with tiny shovels and gently placed us on little beds. When I woke up, I quickly lifted the blanket, seeing my little buddy still there. I sighed in relief. But then My wife called. She changed her mind while shaving her eyebrows. She didn't go through with the shrinking procedure. Hearing that, I completely broke down because the process is irreversible. I went alone to the miniature world, heartbroken. Everything there looked just like the real world. Then I arrived at my giant mansion. But soon I received a delivery. It was a 50 carat diamond ring for my wife and a divorce paper as big as my house asking me to sign it. That's when I knew I could never satisfy her again. So I climbed up and signed it. Abandoned by my wife, I decided to find a new one in the tiny world.

I didn't want to make a fuss, but he struck first, claiming I was targeting him. The flight attendant nearby didn't ask why and just told me to give him more space. Her words instantly made me uncomfortable. So I pointed out that the airline made the seats this tight just to make more money. Other passengers agreed, but the chief attendant clearly disliked people like me, poor, sitting in economy, saying if I had money, I should fly first class. How much is it? Beg your pardon? How much for the damn cocoon? Turns out spending more really does change everything. Not only was I served with great food and drinks, even the crew's attitude completely shifted. But no one expected that this wild spending would completely change my life. When I walked out of the airport, I saw a big ad on the wall. On a whim, I rented a private jet. That feeling for someone like me who came from the bottom was thrilling. The snowy mountain stretched as far as I could see. Half an hour later, the plane landed right on the rooftop of a five star hotel. Almost every guest here was a high profile figure. My dramatic arrival made them curious about who I was. Who is that? All I know, senator, is that the last time someone arrived by helicopter, it was Elton John, see Elton John? Wow. But the moment I walked into the lobby, I was still stunned by what I saw. Oil tycoons from the Middle East, elite leaders from every field and even my company's chairman vacationing with his secretary and me, just an ordinary kitchenware salesman. My sales were always on top, but my salary hadn't gone up in 10 years. Face with the bosses, empty promises, I never dared to hope. I live month to month on a fixed paycheck, cutting cost, using coupons, all to save enough for the dreams on my bucket list. But then the doctor told me I had a terminal illness. Just to be sure, I went through another test and even brought in specialist. The results were the same. I had less than 3 weeks left. What? I got three weeks to live? Are you shitting me 4 on the outside? I'm sorry. You sorry? Well, I'm sorry. I can't accept that. To make it worse, my insurance didn't apply, which meant I'd have to cover millions in treatment costs by myself. The news hit me like a hammer, breaking me completely. I had saved my whole life, yet hadn't done a single thing on my list. I've never been to the places I wanted, never eaten my favourite foods, and even my wedding photo was photoshopped by myself. So right there, I quit my exploitative boss and decided to give myself one last vacation. I decided to take out my life. Savings just to experience being rich for once. You sure you want to liquidate the entire I r. A? Yep. And the bonds my mama left? Well, I'm sure a disciplined woman such as yourself has a very useful purpose for this money. Yes, I do. I'm just gonna blow it.

Then his teammate released the skateboard's connector, sending it sliding rapidly beneath the passenger filled bus behind them. Because terrorists had planted multiple bombs under the bus, if the speed dropped below 50, the bombs would detonate. So the police could only use this method to send bomb disposal expert Jimmy under the bus. With the bus driver's cooperation, he successfully reached the bomb's location. Drawing on years of bomb disposal experience, Jimmy quickly found the bomb's control wire. But just as he was about to cut it, the high speed skateboard suddenly hit a piece of rubber on the road. It instantly lost control. Even the safety rope up front couldn't hold it back. In the critical moment, Jimmy grabbed onto the bus chassis in time, avoiding being crushed by the spinning wheels. But the danger wasn't over. If this continued, his strength would soon run out. Worse still, the massive pulling force had snapped the safety rope connecting the skateboard. By now, no matter how strong Jimmy's arms were, he could no longer stop the skateboard from sliding backward. Watching death draw closer and closer, Jimmy directly jammed the screwdriver into the fuel tank to use as a handhold. With his other hand, he grabbed an iron frame on the chassis. This finally freed his entire body from the skateboard. Passengers on the bus quickly opened the floor and pulled Jimmy up together. But this wasn't the time. To celebrate. Yet the fuel tank had been punctured and was now leaking continuously. In less than 10 minutes, the bus would stop and everyone would be killed in the explosion. Since they couldn't defuse the bomb, the police brought in a flatbed truck to drive alongside the bus, hoping to rescue the passengers this way. Only the first passenger was lucky. When it was the second passenger's turn, the bomber suddenly triggered a bomb under the door. The step was instantly blown open with a hole, and the woman fell from the bus and lost her life. Jimmy felt very guilty about this, but it also made him realize there must be a surveillance camera installed in the bus. That's how the bomber knew their every move. Sure enough, after some searching, he found a pinhole camera lens in a corner above the door. After learning this, the captain quickly had the radio station intercept transmission signals in the area and replace them with footage of the current bus, then loop it. They hoped to fool the bomber. In reality, they had already started the rescue operation. With the efforts of the police and Jimmy, all passengers were soon transferred to the bus on the other side. The bomber didn't notice anything unusual. Now only the driver and Jimmy remained on the bus. To escape alive, Jimmy used a metal rod to hold down the gas pedal, then tied one end of a rope to the steering wheel and The other end to an iron plate

I thought I would lose it all, but I hit the Jackpot. $17. After that, every number I chose was always right. I knew I was dying, but fate still played this cruel trick on me. Now you changed my life for the better. Yet deep inside, I felt a strange kind of peace. The senators who followed my bets all made a fortune. Only the tycoon who fought against me had to carry all the losses alone. I won $2 million in chips by myself. The tycoon was furious. When I returned to the banquet, he stood up again. He used his company to dig into my past. And in front of everyone, he exposed me as nothing more than a cookware sales clerk earning only 10,000 a year. I didn't hide. I stood up calmly and admitted it. I really was just a small employee in his company. The head chef tried to defend me, but the tycoon cut him off. He forced me to explain everything. That moment, I finally had the chance to tell the secret I had buried for so long. I'm just a sales associate in one of his stores. I didn't come here to give anybody the wrong impression about me. I just came here to blow every last cent of my money. I'm gonna die, Georgia, please. It's okay. It's okay. I had the same reaction when I found out I only had three weeks to live. I mean, I tried to keep it to myself for exactly this reason. It's a party killer. I told them about my illness and why I came here. I didn't say it earlier because I didn't want to ruin their joy. I raised my glass, wish them well, and turned to leave. The tycoon's ugly face was fully revealed. Even the senators at the table looked at him with contempt. Even his favorite secretary finally woke up and chose to walk away from him. Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia, and then I'm gonna go back to school, and I'm gonna get my business degree. And then one day, when your wife finally decides to divorce you and takes half of everything you have, I'll only be too happy to help her figure out exactly how much that should be. Only then did he realize he had humiliated someone who was already at death's door. Ashamed to live, he went to the hotel rooftop alone, drowning himself in alcohol. When I heard about it, I rushed there in fear and sat beside him. I begged him not to give up his life. He had both money and time, yet he wanted to end it all while I was the one dying. Still thinking how short life was and how regret was the true tragedy. What are you gonna do? Nothing big by your standards, but I was gonna open up a little restaurant. After hearing this, he let go of the thought of death. He even joked with me, asking who my boyfriend was. I gave a bitter smile and said it was one of his employees. But I had never confessed to Sean. Just then, a voice called out from the square. It was Sean. At first, I thought I was hallucinating, that my illness had gotten worse. Until the tycoon reminded me. And I saw him clearly downstairs. He had crossed mountains and storms. Even the avalanche couldn't stop him. The driver tried to stop him, but he still climbed the snowy peaks alone just to find me. I couldn't stop asking questions. And he finally spoke the truth from his heart. What will make you do something like that? I didn't feel like I had a future there. Besides, after you quit. I have feelings for you, Georgia Bird. I want to be with you. Whether it's for five minutes here on this ledge, 50 years. I like this guy. Me too. His confession hit me deeply. But then the bitterness returned. Because I was still running out of time. Heaven was too unfair. At that moment, the butler climbed in through the window. She brought a FAX from the doctor. I was never sick. The machine had failed. Anyone who took the test would be misdiagnosed. I'm gonna leave. Yes, I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna leave everybody. Fate had played a cruel trick. But at the Last moment. It gave my life back and sent me the one I love most. This dream journey made me the biggest winner. Later, Sean and I went back to the city and opened our own restaurant. On the opening day, the head chef came in person. Friends came to celebrate with us. Even though I had once been told I was terminally ill, I didn't give up. I lived every moment like it was my last. My optimism inspired everyone around me, and it brought me true love. And this was only the beginning of my new life.

His blood started dripping into the water. He was doing all this so that he could call the shark to the shore with the smell of blood. His intention was to kill the shark and humiliate his enemy. He immediately moved to the edge of the water with a sharp spear. As soon as he saw the black shadow of the shark inside the water, he quickly hit the spear on its head. The water turned red the next moment. The man became very happy after killing the shark. He started teasing his rival proudly. But he had not even imagined that the real shark was much bigger and more dangerous than him. It was a huge shark with six heads. Suddenly, that shark caught the old man. Jack saw this scene and was shocked. The shark caught the man with its two mouths and tore him into two parts. The head which the man had attacked, the shark easily tore it off. It was the world's first shark with six heads, a tail and a special fin. Jack immediately ran away from there and went to the other side of the reef. There he saw that his boat was stuck in the reef and some of his companions were still trapped on the boat. Jack immediately reached the boat and shouted to everyone to get out of here quickly. That giant shark could attack at any time. Everyone started Swimming out of the water. But unfortunately, the shark was right behind them. At the last moment before the shark attacked them, they all reached the shore. Everyone was now planning to escape, when suddenly the sky was filled with thick, dark clouds. This meant that another danger was coming. Lisa knew that sea rain meant the whole island could sink. To escape the storm, everyone went to an old lab, which had been closed like this for many years. But they did not know that the real danger was hiding right below them. Inside the lab, they found the skeleton of a strange animal. They were all consoling each other when suddenly strong winds started blowing. When a shark pulled Lisa from a big hole below, it pulled her boyfriend along with her with beer. Both of them did not get a chance to breathe, and both became the shark's prey. When the shark was about to attack again, Jack immediately attacked it with a spear and asked everyone else to run away. Everyone swam out of there, but Jack remained trapped there. Now the question is, will Jack be able to survive?

That day, just like any other, I went to play the piano for the wife of a wealthy man. When she opened the door, I could feel that she didn't want me to come in. But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, I smelled something strange. Following the scent, I found a dead body in the living room. Then I finally understood why she hadn't wanted to let me in. At first, I pretended to stay calm and casually said I needed to use the bathroom. As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person. Once I entered the bathroom, I realised the killer was right behind me, holding a gun. I held my breath and tried not to make any movement that could expose me. Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me. I forced myself to stay calm and went back to the piano to continue playing. After leaving her house, I hesitated about whether I should call the police. The man had been known for his generosity and always Tipped me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man, and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself. As soon as we arrived, he noticed a newspaper on my table. I said it was there to line the trash bin. But he obviously didn't believe me. He kept testing me. At one point, he even threw a small knife near my head. I didn't move. Fortunately, he didn't see through my act. The next day, the rich man's body was found floating by the river. His wife cried bitterly during the interview. Later, the police chief blamed the murder on a young man. I was called in to give a statement and had to listen to them fabricating the entire report. My palms were sweating. I wanted to stand up and tell the truth. But that was just a fantasy. I knew that if I spoke up, I would end up like that rich man, dead. I Thought everything was over. But then a twist appeared. At the funeral, the man's wife kept talking about what had happened before his death, unaware that during the murder she and the chief had overlooked someone. The old lady next door. After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapse.

Sin embargo, el fondo de la piscina estaba cubierto de baldosas lisas y él estaba sentado justo encima, sin poder usar las extremidades para impulsarse. El hombre se asustó al sentir que la succión del desagüe aumentaba y que su aguante bajo el agua llegaba a su límite. Levantó la mirada hacia arriba, intentando hacer ruido para llamar la atención de los demás, pero aunque había mucha gente alrededor, nadie se dio cuenta. En ese momento crítico, entendió que solo podía contar consigo mismo. Luchó de nuevo con todas sus fuerzas, pero entonces la presión de la tubería aumentó rápidamente. Su trasero bloqueaba por completo el desagüe. Sin ayuda externa, no podía escapar. Lo más doloroso era que ya estaba al límite. La sensación de asfixia llegó de golpe y el medidor de presión superó instantáneamente la línea roja. El cuerpo del hombre mostró una hendidura evidente, y si no encontraba una forma de escapar, pronto sus órganos podrían ser succionados.

When the SWAT team stormed in, I stripped off every piece of clothing. As a top lawyer, I knew they would see I carried no weapon so they would not fire. Without restraint. I was locked up. My first request was a Simmons mattress. The bunk bed was too hard to endure. Detective Durant mocked me. Then his daughter received a videotape. Tape showed the attack. But I wore a mask so no one could prove it was me. Durant rushed in to argue with me. I gave him one condition. He gave me the mattress. I told the judge the truth. A luxury mattress arrived in my cell. The other inmates were furious with jealousy. Nice bed. Thank you. This is single. At my trial, I broke my promise. I did not confess. I recited a similar case word for word. The evidence was not enough. The judge suggested releasing me on the spot. I put on a cold smile. Thank you. Excuse me. No, I don't think I will excuse you. You see, this is what I'm talking about. You were about to let me go. Are you kidding me? This is why we're here in the first place. Then I accused her. She let a killer walk free 10 years ago. She cleared the man who ended my wife's life. Everything I did was for revenge. They sent me back to my cell to calm down. I told Durant. I had a hostage. It was the lawyer who defended my enemy. Durant checked. The lawyer had gone missing three days earlier. I wanted a premium steak would trade it for the hostages location. He had no choice and agreed. The prison erupted in protest. Oh, excuse me, waiter. You might want to put 30% down for yourself, my man. So I suppose if I don't share this with you, get the fuck up. I'm gonna cock back my right hand and I'm gonna split your whole fucking skull into. How about that? Come on over here, join me. There's plenty to go around. Enjoy. What about some steak? Like steak. There you go. Durant found the missing lawyer inside the prison. I hit a fork in my hand. I struck an inmate without warning. Then I lay back on my bunk as if nothing had happened. They locked me in the dark. I felt no fear. Shouted threats at the prosecutor. I said more people would die. Durant knew what I could do. He begged the judge to keep me locked up longer. The judge laughed and said she would handle it. She picked up her phone, the phone exploded. She was gone. I was still in my cell. No one understood how the device was triggered. Durant reached a conclusion. I must have help on the outside could make it look like I killed remotely. He asked me what I wanted. I answered calmly, release me by 6 Tomorrow or more people would die. They refused. They tightened security and watched me every second. Even if someone helped me, I could not reach them. Everyone stared at the clock in fear. Six hours passed. Nothing happened. They relaxed and went home. Then in a single moment, every car in the parking lot exploded. Every prosecutor was gone except Duran.

Tras estirarlo con todas sus fuerzas, dobló uno de los extremos hasta darle forma de un pequeño gancho. Ana empezó entonces a mover poco a poco sus pies temblorosos mientras se aferraba de forma extremadamente peligrosa a la pared vertical de roca. A continuación, extendió el alambre que había preparado e intentó enganchar con él la cuerda de escalada que colgaba a cierta distancia. En ese momento, sabía que si cometía el más mínimo error, caería irremediablemente al abismo interminable bajo sus pies. Por suerte, su esfuerzo no fue en vano y el alambre logró enganchar la cuerda con precisión. Ana retiró el alambre con muchísimo cuidado y por fin consiguió sujetar con firmeza la cuerda que podía salvarle la vida. Luego empezó a balancear su cuerpo, aprovechando la inercia para lanzarse hacia el otro lado del acantilado. Ana logró alcanzar un nuevo punto de apoyo, pero al mirar el precipicio sin fin y ver más arriba una tienda que algún escalador había dejado tiempo atrás, se le ocurrió una idea. Empezó a acercarse lentamente a la tienda suspendida, apoyándose a la vez en brazos y piernas. Finalmente consiguió afirmarse sobre una roca saliente, pero justo entonces los otros tres asesinos ya habían llegado a la parte superior, donde ella se encontraba.

Ana también escuchó los ruidos que venían de arriba y dejó de seguir escalando. Sin embargo, los hombres no se rindieron. Uno gritó que si entregaba la cámara con las pruebas de su crimen, le perdonarían la vida. Después lanzaron una cuerda hacia abajo, pero Ana conocía demasiado bien la crueldad de esos hombres y sabía que si entregaba la cámara perdería cualquier posibilidad de sobrevivir. Poco después, al notar movimiento debajo, los asesinos tiraron con fuerza de la cuerda y cuando vieron que en el extremo solo había una nota escrita por Ana, uno la tomó instintivamente para leerla. Al oír desde abajo los gritos furiosos de los hombres, Ana esposó una sonrisa triunfante. Luego comenzó a observar detenidamente el entorno y enseguida colocó un mosquetón en una grieta de la roca sobre su cabeza. Después levantó la tienda abandonada y la enganchó al mosquetón. Con la llegada de la noche, Ana reunió valor y se metió en la tienda para descansar un momento. Por suerte, aún era lo bastante resistente y estable, pero justo cuando pensaba que podría dormir un rato, de pronto la tienda recibió un golpe y empezó a sacudirse violentamente

When she heard about his dream, she didn't stop him. Instead, she handed him an old iron box and said, keep your medals in here. But as he walked away, she shook her head gently, like she already knew this path wouldn't be easy. At the bus stop, the boy found his father waiting. Without a word, his dad pulled him back home. Time passed and his injured leg healed. He picked up his dream again, trying out different sports. He tried weightlifting, but dropped the bar with a loud crash.

One day, while throwing a javelin, he smashed a neighbor's window. His father exploded in anger and crushed his dream on the spot. The next day, his dad dragged him to a construction site. This is your job. Carry bricks, he said. But near that very site was a ski resort. The boy made a new promise to himself. I'll compete in the Winter Olympics, put on skis, and began training. Slowly he started winning small competitions. The trophies piled up. Twelve years passed. The boy had now grown into a Young man still chasing his dream, he went for the national team trials. But in front of the media, he bumped into others and they all fell. As a result, his selection was canceled. The coach told him, the Olympics are not for you. Another dream shattered. Forced again, he returned to laboring with his father. At home, he pulled down his poster from the wall and folded it away. But the very next day, he saw Olympic ski jumping on TV. The fire inside him reignited. He packed his bag and left without a word. At the same bus stop from his child childhood, his father was waiting again. But this time he didn't stop him. He simply nodded as if to say, don't give up. This time the boy reached Norway, where fate introduced him to a great coach. After hearing his story, the coach agreed to train him. He Learned everything. How to sprint into the jump, balance in the air, and bend his knees on landing. Finally, the big day came. Wearing the national team uniform, he carried that same iron box his mother once gave him. Standing on the Olympic Hill, he took a deep breath. He slid down the ramp and soared into the air. This time he didn't let his dream vanish into thin air. This time, he lived it.

But instead of being frightened, the woman leaned in and kissed it. Caught up in the moment, she pressed herself against the wall. After the kiss, she lay down on the floor and fell asleep. When she woke up, she noticed the hole had gotten bigger and some kind of yellow liquid was oozing out of it. The sight made her feel strangely nauseous, so she grabbed a toothbrush and started scrubbing at the spot frantically. That night, when everything was quiet, she still couldn't stop thinking about the tongue in the wall. It was keeping her up. Unable to resist, she returned to the wall, but this time the tongue was gone. Instead, a few strands of hair were sticking out from the hole. Disturbed, she immediately contacted her therapist, asking what it could possibly mean. But the therapist dismissed it as nothing more than a hallucination, telling her she just needed to get out more and spend some time outside. As it turns out, the woman had been suffering from severe social anxiety for over 30 years. She hadn't stepped outside her home, let alone gone on a date. Just when she finally mustered the courage to go out, the tongue reappeared once again. She couldn't resist getting closer, but this time she realized something had to change. If this kept up, she would spiral even further. So she grabbed a hammer and slammed it hard into The wall then just as she was about to crawl through the hole to see what was on the other side.

She took off her high heels and started shaking the coffee. Then she served that same coffee to a female passenger. But that passenger turned out to be even anger. She shoved the cup away, spilling the coffee straight onto the attendant. The attendant screamed, burned and humiliated. She walked out in pain. But what could she do? That woman wasn't just any passenger. She was the princess of the country and she had booked the entire plane. A few moments later, the attendant came back with another cup of coffee. But this time something else happened. The princess's eyes fell on her finger. The attendant was wearing the same, same ring the princess had. The princess laughed and said, a ring this expensive on a poor girl like you? Then she threw it on the floor and crushed it under her heel. The attendant's heart shattered. She had reached her breaking point. Shaking with rage, she walked back to the galley. That's when she remembered the princess was allergic to shrimp. She opened a box of seafood noodles. She took the shrimp out, but on purpose served those same noodles for lunch. The princess began eating with without hesitation. But within moments, the sound of coughing echoed through the cabin.

And because she belonged to the royal family, her body had to be flown back immediately. The princess herself had left a note that the same flight attendant would accompany her body alone.

One day, he noticed that the second floor of the office was entirely made of glass. And that's when an idea hit him. If that glass were to break, the boss would fall straight down. He also realized something else. Even though his boss looked slim, he was actually pretty heavy. Every step the boss took made the glass creek ominously. To make this plan work, he spent the whole night calculating exactly how much force would be needed to break the glass class. But he got so lost in his work, he didn't notice his boss was standing right behind him. When the boss asked what he was doing, he quickly blurted out that it was just a new game he was designing. It was a random excuse, but surprisingly, the boss liked the idea. The very next day, the boss tried it out and turned it into the company's annual project. His strange reaction only made the guy even more suspicious. Following a trail of clues, he ended up at a jewelry shop. But the moment he mentioned his boss's name, the shopkeeper's face went cold. He immediately pulled down the shutter and reached under the counter for a gun. That name clearly terrified him. The guy quickly explained that he wasn't one of the boss's men. Only then did the shopkeeper be begin to open up. A few years ago, a woman had come to him with a Design and asked for a custom jewelry piece. At first, everything seemed normal. He completed the order carefully. But then more and more people started coming in with strange designs. Similar in pattern, odd in style. The shopkeeper didn't understand what they were for. But the money was good, so he didn't ask questions. Over time, the pieces got bigger and heavier. And on the 206th day, he was asked to craft a golden human head. That's when it hit him. He had unknowingly built an entire entire human body out of gold, piece by piece. And every single payment slip had the same name. His boss. This man had spent over 250 million rupees building a full body gold replica. Could that be the reason why he was so heavy? After learning all this, the guy decided to head back to the office to tell his colleague Simmie. But just as he stepped outside, a group of masked people blocked his path, wearing strange animal masks. Knocked him to the ground as if settling some old score. That's when the shopkeeper pulled out his gun and took them all down. Moments later, the boss arrived, too, armed. Back at the office, the guy picked. He picked up a hammer and walked straight to his boss. Before the boss could say a word, he struck hard. The boss crashed through the glass floor and fell to the first level. But before the guy could make sense of it all, the boss, Had vanished. Though he did leave something behind. A severed toe. He took it home, boiled it, trying to confirm his suspicion. Once the skin peeled off. Inside was a perfectly crafted golden toe. So now the real question is, this man, Viking. Was he ever even human? See you next time.

The husband planned to renovate the interior. But one swing of the hammer brought them a lifetime of terror. Is there a hazmat suit anywhere around here? Local police immediately arrived to investigate. But their police dogs suddenly became anxious and agitated. It ran around frantically like a headless fly. The chief thought the dog had lost its edge, unable to locate where the body was. But the experienced Rossi said it wasn't that the dog couldn't find it. It was that there were too many bodies and it didn't know where to start. Sure enough, there wasn't just one body in the wall. There were bodies in the floor, too. Every corner of the entire house had them. In the end, officers discovered five female remains throughout the house. Soon, the FBI's analysis team got involved in the investigation. The local chief said this house was built in the 1960s. The previous owners were an elderly couple. The husband had passed away a few years ago. The wife suffered from alzheimer's disease. She now lived in a nursing home. Based on the timeline of the case, the primary suspects had to be the previous homeowners. They had lived in this house for half a century. They barely interacted with the outside world. If one of them committed the crimes, the other couldn't possibly be unaware. Based on experience with similar cases in the past, when couples commit crimes together, the Wife typically assists the husband. The key question was why the bodies were mummified after the killings. If it was just to interfere with the investigation, simply dumping the bodies in the nearby swamp would obviously be more convenient. Currently, the only person who might provide answers was the wife living in the nursing home. Reid and Lewis immediately went to the nursing home to visit her. The nursing staff warned that the woman was often disoriented and not to expect much. She completely ignored the visitors. She just kept her head down, doing needlework, as if this was the only way she could escape reality. But she clearly had some awareness of what happened in the house. When she heard the word body, she accidentally pricked her finger. Yet she remained silent. In the end, police found a total of seven bodies. Because the crime scene was in a remote small town, the local police station had limited resources. They rarely even handled missing persons cases. Even the medical examiner didn't know how to handle such a situation. The analysis team had no choice but to request emergency support from the Forensic Research Institute. The forensic examiner determined these weren't mummies in the strict sense. The internal organs were all intact. They had just been wrapped and dehydrated. Based on the condition of the teeth, the deceased were likely drug addicts. These types of people were high risk individuals. Few people cared about their whereabouts. They could go missing. For decades without anyone knowing. But two of the bodies were clearly different from the other five. They had died less than a year ago. This happened after the husband died and the woman moved into the nursing home. This meant that if the elderly couple were the killers, they had a successor. However, faced with this question, the woman still refused to respond. She just kept repeating, what's the use? And it's completely different. What exactly was different? What was the relationship between the new killer and the elderly couple? After detailed examination, the medical examiner suggested the analysis team investigate these two types of cases separately, because besides the different times of the crimes, there were many other differences between the old and new remains. The five victims were all young women in their teens and 20s. There were no signs of sexual assault or abuse on their bodies. The cause of death was poisoning. The two bodies discovered later were both middle aged women in their forties. They had been abused before death. The fatal injuries came from blows to the head. What was outrageous was that these two were mummified while still alive. Overall, this new criminal was copying the former's methods. He was likely closely related to the homeowner's family, but he had his own needs and was even more brutal. Reid continued trying to communicate with the woman. When he asked again what she meant by different, the woman suddenly asked back, did I Say that she seemed to have no memory of saying that at all. But after recalling it, she suddenly grabbed a fork and stabbed herself viciously in the carotid artery. The woman died on the way to the hospital. All the secrets she knew died with her. But why did she do this? Could it be out of intense guilt? Reid believed that no matter how much a person forgets, their habits are hard to change. For example, the homeowner couple had a habit of hiding things inside walls. The two carefully searched the room where the woman had lived. Sure enough, they found a stack of letters hidden in a compartment in the wall. Based on the content, these letters were likely written by the victims. The elderly couple allowed the victims to write letters to their families. Although these letters were never sent. They would create the illusion of being in a safe environment. This made it easier to control them psychologically. But from a criminal psychology analysis perspective, this behavior showed that the elderly couple were different from typical serial killers. They didn't have antisocial personality disorder. People with antisocial personalities lack emotional empathy with humans. They completely fail to understand the importance of family. But the elderly couple clearly understood this well. Therefore, the analysis team deduced they should have had experience raising children. But the local chief insisted they never had children. At Emily's prompting, the chief realized this was just his subjective impression. Over The years because he often drove past here and never saw any children coming or going. He just assumed they had no kids. Soon the medical examiner confirmed the woman had indeed given birth. And the new case occurred shortly after the homeowner died. The victims were all brown haired women. So could the killer be their unknown son? Could the woman have reacted that way to protect the son?

Sin embargo, jack lo vio todo de inmediato. Dijo que no le diría nada a mi esposo. Después de que hizo esa promesa, dejé de fingir. Tomé el pescado y empecé a comerlo. Creí que podía ocultarlo para siempre, pero pronto cometí un error. Mi esposo tomó en secreto la máscara de buceo de jack. Cuando se la devolvió, jack, que normalmente no se llevaba bien con él, no se enfadó en absoluto. Incluso parecía contento. Eso hizo que mi esposo sospechara. Me preguntó de inmediato qué había pasado. Yo no oculté nada y confesé todo. Él estalló en furia, me agarró del cabello y me arrojó frente a jack. Pensó que le suplicaría perdón, pero en lugar de eso elegí quedarme con jack. Nuestro comportamiento demasiado íntimo lo enfureció hasta casi hacerlo perder la razón. Un día, en el fondo del mar, descubrió un barco hundido, pero al darle la vuelta encontró un agujero enorme, el casco, imposible de reparar. Aún así, trató de arrastrarlo hacia la superficie, pero pronto se quedó sin fuerzas y tuvo que abandonar el casco para regresar a la superficie. Después de recuperar el aliento, volvió a sumergirse varias horas de esfuerzo. Finalmente logró llevar el barco hasta la orilla. Jack y yo corrimos a ayudarlo, pero mi esposo ya nos odiaba profundamente. Nos Gritó que nos largáramos. Al día siguiente empezó a reparar el barco y unos días después realmente lo había arreglado. Jack entró en pánico al instante porque antes de quedar atrapados en la isla, él no era más que el sirviente de mi esposo. Mi esposo escapaba de la isla, seguramente volvería para vengarse de jack. Así que mientras mi esposo salía a pescar, jack y yo trabajamos juntos. Empujamos el barco al mar en secreto. Cuando mi esposo lo descubrió, ya era demasiado tarde, pero lo extraño fue que no se enfadó, sino que sonrió. Poco después notamos que el agua empezaba a filtrarse rápidamente por la parte inferior del barco. En ese momento entendimos que habíamos caído en su trampa. El barco se hundió enseguida y solo pudimos nadar con todas nuestras fuerzas. De regreso a la orilla horas después, finalmente llegué a la playa. Mi esposo preguntó primero por jack, mirando alrededor con cautela. De repente vio a jack no muy lejos. Tomó su arpón y se acercó. Jack, demasiado agotado para nadar hasta la playa, solo pudo intentar huir. Mi esposo lanzó el arpón que atravesó el cuerpo de jack. Jack murió en el acto. Esa noche mi esposo me ató a un poste y me castigó brutalmente, pero al final me perdonó porque no quería quedarse solo en la isla. Nuestra vida volvió a la aparente calma, pero 6 meses después un barco pesquero se acercó a la isla. Jamás imaginé que sería rescatada. Estaba Tan emocionada que casi no podía hablar. Al subir a bordo, devoré el pan desesperadamente. Los pescadores, al verme tan hambrienta, sintieron compasión por mí. Mientras tanto, mis pozo que estaba pescando me vio siendo rescatada y me saludó con entusiasmo. Pero yo miré a los pescadores y al confirmar que nadie podía oírnos, volví la mirada hacia mi esposo, fría como el hielo, y luego me alejé sola, sin volver la vista atrás

Do you see what's off here? The person filming seems normal, but everyone around him is walking backward. It looks like he's living in a flipped reality, totally out of place with everyone else. So how's this even possible? Some think he hired actors for this. But look closely. Even the dog in the video is walking backward. How do you explain that? Well, here's the answer. He's actually the one walking backward. In real life, he recorded himself moving in reverse, then played the whole clip backward in editing. That's what makes everyone else appear to be walking backward. Sounds simple, but to make it look natural takes a lot of practice. You can try it yourself at home. It's not as easy as it looks. To get it that smooth, he actually practiced a special walking style just for this. So even when the video is reversed, it still looks like he's walking forward, completely natural and fluid.

He quickly covered his mouth, but the leaves kept falling. Suddenly, he woke up in shock. It was just a dream. But when he reached home, he was surprised to see a tree had only grown in the yard. And as soon as he spoke, leaves started falling from it. He didn't understand what was happening, so he called a wise man. The man looked at the tree and said, your life is now tied to this tree. The more you speak, the more leaves will fall. The day all the leaves are gone, you will be gone too. The man didn't believe it. He grabbed a mic and rapped loudly, and leaves kept falling. Scared, he took an axe and hit the tree. As soon as it hit, a deep Mark appeared on his stomach, and now he was sure that this tree was connected to his life. He stopped speak king and started communicating with gestures. But even when he angrily pointed a finger, leaves kept falling. Things became harder. One day, he went to a parent class with his son. All the parents were singing, but he stood silently. The teacher asked him to sing alone. As soon as he started singing, leaves started falling again and his heart broke. He Learned to communicate with his eyes, but one day, his boss Said, entertain the client. He barely agreed. When the gardener at home started watering the tree, his face drenched in sweat. While sitting at the restaurant, the client got scared and left. His boss scolded him but gave one last chance. When he met the client again, the gardener sprayed pesticide on the tree and the man began to feel dizzy. He stumbled and accidentally poked chopsticks into his boss's nose. He lost his job. Hoping good deeds could break the curse. He fed bread to hungry people and even donated his Rolex watch to a nun. But nothing changed. Now only a few leaves were left on the tree. He knew his end was near. He went to his wife and spoke from the heart. I love you very much. Leaves fell again. Then he went to his father's grave. Only three leaves were left. He cried out, dad, I love you. Suddenly, thunder roared, lightning struck. And as the last three leaves fell, he collapsed to the ground. But then his phone rang. He woke up. It was the wise man on the call. He said, your tree is full of leaves again. How? Why? Maybe because 100 words cannot match the power of one true word, love.

Ruby, how did that happen? I fell. Can you tell me who you were with, sweetie? The monster. What did the monster do? The monster pushed me, and then the monster told me shut up. Because Ruby was extremely afraid of the monster, she refused to reveal its identity when the police asked her parents. They also didn't know who Ruby meant. Until Ruby's older brother finally revealed the truth. Arena made her mad face and pushed Ruby down the stairs. Are you sure that's what you saw him? Or maybe it was an accident. No, I wasn't. Arena told Ruby to shut up, and then she pushed her, saying, shut up is not nice. However, when the police questioned the nanny, Arena, she angrily denied everything. Upon learning that it was Henry who had reported her, the nanny immediately exposed the real nature of the little boy. He's a mean little boy. Ruby calls him the monster. Through the investigation, the detectives found that Ruby had visited the emergency room four times just in the past year alone for injuries including a concussion from a fall, a finger crushed in a door, and two head burns, strongly suggesting she had been subjected to long term abuse. Since Arena had only started working as the family's nanny five months earlier, she was likely not responsible. So the detectives turned back to Henry for questioning. You mean you think I'm a liar? Under their careful probing, Henry Realizing he could no longer hide the truth, straightforwardly admitted everything he had done. It was an experiment. What do you mean? I want to see if she roll all the way down or just stop. She rolled most of the way, head over legs. She was on an ankle, so she hit the landing and stopped. This was clearly not the mindset of a normal child. So the detectives immediately called in Doctor Wang for a diagnosis. But as Doctor Wang tried to engage Henry in deeper communication, Henry unexpectedly displayed an extreme violent side. Now he's dead. He can't do anything I don't like anymore. His gaze alone was enough to make even the battle hardened Doctor Shiver. This was a textbook case of a psychopathic personality. In terms of emotional coldness and lack of empathy, he was far beyond normal ranges, two levels above the usual. He could neither perceive others feelings nor empathize with them. The only solution was a specialized expert consultation to develop a targeted treatment plan. Yet Henry's parents refused, and the situation reached a stalemate. Then one day, Benson received a call from Henry. My dad's at work, and I locked my mom in the laundry room. She yelled at me to call 9 1 1. But I wanna tell you we gotta go now. Fortunately, the police arrived in time to prevent another tragedy. But Henry disappeared. When the detectives eventually found him, he had taken a child hostage. Can I Hold your gun! The detective suggested letting the child go, promising Henry that he would get what he wanted. What would you do if I shot you right now? You don't need to do that. Would your brains come out of your forehead? I'm gonna show you my gun now. But when the detective handed over his gun, Henry fired unexpectedly. Luckily, the detective was wearing a bulletproof vest, which allowed them to finally subdue him. Due to the severity of his actions, the court mandated treatment for Henry, despite his parents continued refusal. After several years of therapy, Henry showed significant behavioral improvement. His therapist even believed he was fully cured. Following an evaluation, they decided to release him. However, when the detectives returned to Henry's home, they were confronted with the grim sight of several corpses. So is the father. I'll call the morgue. I got another body downstairs. A kid. Multiple stab wounds. He had a little sister. Her name is Ruby. She would have been 13. It's a little boy. He looks maybe five. Fortunately, Ruby had been at a classmate's house, which saved her from the same fate.

I look in the mirror and see my spine beginning to protrude. I slam myself against the wall, desperate to return to normal, but it's useless. I break down, grabbing the hose to douse my body, trying to stop the mutation. But father discovered the fur and claws. He instantly realized I was turning into an animal. When I returned home, father confronted me. Seeing the evidence in his hands, I turned and fled in terror, only to be caught. Father brought me inside, examined my body closely and decided to conceal my condition. He instructed me to wear earplugs to muffle my heightened hearing. He also ordered me to shave off my fur and pull out my wolf claws to avoid detection. But I couldn't control myself and began attacking my father. He stopped me, took my hand and helped pull out my claws. As tears fell from his eyes, I avoided his gaze and left. But then my classmate suddenly played low frequency sound waves. I was affected, unable to suppress my beastly instincts any longer. By the time I regained control, my classmate was injured. My secret could no longer be hidden. After a gunshot rang out, I was apprehended by the police and taken to the station. I had become unable to even write. I looked at my father, tears streaming down. My cheeks. Yet the next moment, I bared my fangs and snarled at the officers. The police sensed something was wrong. My father swiftly tackled him to the ground, then turned to me, fabricating evidence to deceive the officers. Outside, we got into the car and sped deep into the mountains. Perhaps this was our last moment of happiness.

The boy explained that whoever uses these drops becomes impossible to ignore. Everyone feels like they have to look at you. But the drops don't affect those who have used them themselves. The girl was shocked. The boy said the effect only lasts for three hours and then everything goes back to normal. Then he added, The truth is, no one's actually staring. It's all in our minds. Suddenly, his alarm rang and he put in the drops again. The girl asked, if you know all this, why do you still use them? He smiled and said, because I like being seen. I want to be a singer, but no one notices me. So before going on stage, I use the drops. It gives me confidence. Then he asked her, don't you wanna be seen? That question hit her deeply. She always wished her mom would notice her. As a kid, her mom only paid attention to her talented older sister. The sister was good at everything. She always felt invisible.

The first time he tested it, the result was strange. There was only a small hole in the concrete wall, but the back of the wall split as if a storm had passed the walls. Temperature rose to about 1,000 degrees and nearby buildings shook. To make the rifle more powerful, Tom added a special power battery pack and told his friend Jerry to record everything on camera. When he fired again, a steel bridge standing far away collapsed within seconds. They were both thrilled and decided to show the video to the military office so they could sell it for big money. But Colonel Sam, who was an army officer, watch the video and said it was fake. Tom smiled and said, I'll show you it's real. He took a rifle from his bag that looked like a cartoon. Sam laughed. It looked like a toy. Tom aimed at an armored tank without saying anything and pulled the trigger. The next moment, the tank's metal armor melted. There was such a violent blast that everyone fell to the ground. Colonel Sam was shocked. He immediately asked how much for this weapon and its blueprints. Tom said calmly, $1 billion. Sam agreed without hesitation, but planned a scheme in his mind. He ordered his men find everything about Tom's family, friends and weaknesses. Three days later, on the day of the deal, Tom arrived. Carefully, he had already given the real rifle to his trusted partner, Jake. As soon as he reached the place, he was surrounded by guns and betrayal. Instead of money, his family was also taken hostage. First, Tom ordered his team to hand over the weapon and the data. Sam kept his promise and released Tom and his family. But Tom still wanted revenge. He had hidden a tracker chip inside the rifle. That night, Tom activated a signal booster and traced the location of Sam's convoy. Then he took out his second generation super rifle, which looked like a toy from the outside but was even more dangerous than the first. Tom aimed and pulled the trigger. The bullet tore through an armored vehicle like paper. One explosion after another followed the. The whole convoy was engulfed in flames. Within seconds, the data and weapons Sam had stolen were all turned to ash. When the police arrived, Inspector Matt was surprised to see Tom's rifle looked like a toy. Tom walked away calmly with his family, leaving smoke and ashes behind.

Initially, the scientist lied that this was a vaccine to protect against snake venom, and the assistant did not understand anything at first. During dinner, the assistant suddenly started feeling very sleepy. When he woke up, he saw that the skin on his face was falling off. He thought that maybe he had eaten something spicy, that's why it happened. Because of this, he did not pay much attention. But the next morning, the skin on his back also started falling off. The scientist tried to pull out a piece of skin with tweezers, but as soon as he pulled it, the skin on the assistant's entire back fell off. So that the assistant does not get suspicious, the scientist again lied that this is a temporary side effect of the vaccine and everything will be fine in 3 days. The assistant still did not have any doubts. Rather, he asked the scientist to give him another injection. He did not know that this decision would become the biggest regret of his life. The next day, when he went to the amusement park, he saw a strange creature, half human and half snake. People were scared of seeing it, but the assistant started feeling a strange attachment to the creature as if it was his own. As soon as he came out, he saw some goons harassing his girlfriend. He suddenly pounced like a Cobra and attacked Them. He bit the neck of one of the goons, just like a poisonous snake bites at night. He saw that snake like flaky skin had grown on his face. He thought that maybe he had fallen ill or it was an illusion. But actually his body was changing completely. He panicked and went to the scientist and wanted to know the truth. But the scientist lied again. He said, get one last injection, everything will be fine. Without thinking, the assistant said yes. But after this injection, his body changed completely. Snake like scales appeared on his hands and feet too. Then the scientist tied the assistant tightly and gave him the last injection so that his transformation could happen quickly. After this, the assistant's entire body started changing. Both his legs joined together to form the tail of a huge python. In just three minutes, his upper body also completely became like a snake. The scientist was happy and started cleaning the poisonous snake made from a man. Then he took it to the garden. His plan was to make it a pet because he thought that it would be more loyal. But as soon as he went closer, the snake suddenly pounced on him and bit him.

Instead, the dolphin gave the fish back to him. The boy showed the dolphin how to eat it. Then the dolphin nodded and opened its big mouth. It actually wanted the boy to feed it directly. The boy got a little scared, but carefully reached out his hand. After eating the fish, the dolphin happily sprayed water. The boy then tried to touch the dolphin's nose. Usually Moody, the dolphin came closer on its own. As the boy was about to leave, the dolphin started following him. Suddenly, it turned and showed its belly. When the boy waved goodbye, the dolphin raised its fin in return. Then it started dancing, just like the boy. A trainer saw this moment and offered the boy a chance to become the dolphin's trainer. The dolphin started looking happier around the boy. They became good friends. One day, the owner came to see the dolphin's training. He was very impressed with how well the boy and the dolphin work together. So he planned a big show. But on the show today, kids kept banging on the glass. The loud noise scared the dolphin. They tried hard to call her back. The dolphin made a sad sound, as if begging the boy to stop the show. But the boy still went ahead. The dolphin nodded in agreement. But when she went into the water, the kids hit the glass even louder. Angry, the dolphin slammed into the glass. The crowd panicked and ran. The owner sent his assistant to check. They found that one of the screws was loose. But instead of fixing it, the owner came up with a clever plan. That night, the dolphin cried out in pain. The boy climbed the tower and saw that the dolphin was calling out for her family. Boy got emotional. Suddenly, sparks appeared in the pool. He rushed down and saw some people removing screws. After they left, the boy went to the basement. Water was flowing fast. He knocked on the guards window, but the sound of water was too loud. It was clear that someone wanted to harm the dolphin because if anything happened to her, the owner would get a huge insurance amount. The boy suggested releasing the dolphin back into the sea. The trainer also came and helped because she didn't want the dolphin to be hurt either. The next day, they put the dolphin on a trailer and took her to the sea. Then they let her go. Everyone was smiling. In the end, the boy stood on the shore and waved goodbye to the dolphin. He hoped she would find her family. If you also love your family, don't forget to comment.

Get out of the bed, idiot! I carefully cleaned up the scene, then followed the trail of rose petals. I opened the door and saw my boyfriend setting up a surprise. I was going to surprise you, but it didn't work out. It turned out Mike had planned a proposal for me. I pretended not to notice the decorations in the bedroom, then put on the dress he had prepared and walked in. I slipped on the engagement ring, trying hard to calm myself. Ah! What? What? What? Yes! Yes! Oh, my god! This is the best day of my life! I made up an excuse to get Mike out of the room, but he stopped me. He pulled out champagne from under the bed, but all I wanted was to leave quickly. Mike said there was another surprise. I recorded everything. Um. It's a keepsake. You forgot it. What? He couldn't wait to watch the video. I panicked, trying to stop him, suggesting we wait until the wedding to watch it together. We agreed and left the room. And cut! We reshot the proposal scene from that day. The fake video looked perfect to me, but Sam said something was awful. What? Don't. Don. What? There was a vase here yesterday. My husband's favorite vase was missing. I immediately called to ask, only to learn Mike had broken it that morning. I froze, not knowing what to do. I just found the same vase. There's a Spot across the town. We need the exact same vase. We heard there was a vase just like it. We were overjoyed, but someone else had already claimed it. I need this vase. Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm buying it. Well, you can choose another one. But I don't need another one. I need this one. No matter how I tried to persuade her, the old lady refused to give up the vase. Then I came up with an idea. I paid to buy it and then rented it back at a high price. But the old lady still wasn't at ease. I have one condition. I go with you and make sure my vase stay safe. So the three of us went to the bedroom to film. I finally got the perfect video. Soon it was our engagement day. But I saw someone I didn't expect. The old lady from before was there, too. And she actually knew Mike. I want you to meet my Aunt Louise. She has a very bad memory. Don't forget who you are in an hour. Nice to meet you. Then everyone headed to the banquet hall. Mike was about to play his proposal video. Was it good? My aunt doesn't have the best memory, but she remembers my apartment perfectly.

Because every hostage had a red blindfold tied on his eyes, they were not able to see anything. The criminals stole 30 billion rupees in cash, and just as they were about to go out, suddenly someone rang the alarm. One man secretly removed his blindfold and found out that the criminals themselves had run the alarm. Then one of the criminals came to that man, move the blindfold from his eyes and said, now see as much as you want. Out of fear, the man closed his eyes tightly and started begging for his life, because seeing the face of the criminals was like inviting death. But these criminals did the opposite. They removed the blindfolds of all the hostages and did not hurt anyone because their leader, professor, had a clear intention that no one should die in this mission. Meanwhile, the police reached the spot. The criminals fired some bullets in the air and threw smoke bombs. There was police all around. There was no way to escape. But this was the real plan of the criminals. Police sent negotiation expert Lassie for talks. Lassie asked the first question how many helicopters do you want? This question seemed like help, but in reality it was a trick to know the number of criminals because only four people can sit in a helicopter. The professor replied, only one will be enough. Hearing this, the commander was shocked. It means that there are four or less criminals. They can now enter and catch them. But lossy got suspicious. She thought this could be a trap. She protested, but the commander gave the order. The special force reached the main gate. They inserted a camera inside from under the door. Everyone was stunned to see what they saw. At least 30 people were standing inside with weapons. The commander was thinking. Then a soldier gave new information. The criminals have put the video of this entire incident on the internet. When the police saw that video, the truth came out. All the hostages were also dressed like criminals. Now it had become impossible to differentiate between real and fake. In fact, the aim of these criminals was not the 30 billion rupees that they had looted. Their real plan was something else. To capture the government note printing place called Mint and take control of the employees there and directly print new notes. That too without any tracking system.

Whoever tells me which animal's skin this is, I will marry my daughter to him. First a man came. He looked at the skin carefully, then pulled out a hair from it and said with great confidence, this is the height of the soul. The king shook his head and said, wrong answer. Princess breathed the sigh of relief. The second man came, an educated, very smart looking man. He did not answer immediately, but took out a small good spectacle from his pocket and started looking at the skin carefully. After looking for a long time, he said hesitantly, maybe this. But the king interrupted and said no. The princess breathed a sigh of relief again. Now the prince of the neighboring country came third. Not only was he very handsome, but his mannerisms also reflected royal style. The princess fell in love with him. She thought, I wish he gives the right answer. She tried to know the correct answer from her father so that she could tell the prince secretly. But the king was honest. He refused outright. After thinking for a while, the prince said, this is the skin of a giant water creature. The princess looked at her father with hopeful eyes, but the king said no. The princess heart broke. Such a handsome boy, yet the answer was wrong. But the story did not end here. Suddenly, a strange man came to the palace. He looked like he Lived in the forest, ugly, dirty and untidy. The soldiers tried to stop him, but the king said, I had called the whole country. Anyone can participate in this competition. And he let the man in. Little did anyone know that this wild man who grew up in the mountains was an expert in recognizing animals. He just sniffed the skin and said, this is the skin of a flea. The king's face hardened because the answer was absolutely correct. But now the question was, where did such a big flea come from? Actually, a few months ago, at a court concert, when the princess was playing the harp, a flea jumped out of the king's sleeve. The king liked the flea so much that he left his daughter's concert incomplete and went straight to the palace and started raising it. Every day, the king would prick his finger with a needle and extract a little blood and feed it to the flea. In a few days, the flea grew as big as a grain. But little did the king know that one day that very flea would decide the fate of his daughter's marriage.

So show me your hands! Now! This black guy was just walking and listening to music, but my coworker Doug suddenly tackled him to the ground. Even though Jack was desperately trying to explain, Doug still slapped cuffs on him. I could only tell them it was just a routine check. the boys mom showed up and saw her son getting arrested for no reason, so she lost it and tried to stop us. But what I didn't expect was Doug reporting that someone had attacked an officer. No! Everybody on the ground! Then Doug actually told me to arrest all of them. I'm just a trainee cop, but even I couldn't stand it anymore. Officer Murray, who was patrolling nearby, came over to ask what happened. That's when we found out. Doug thought Jack's clothes looked like the suspects, so he arrested him. But Murray said the real suspect had already been caught two minutes ago, and it was announced on the radio. Doug instantly felt embarrassed, so he wanted to charge Jack and his whole family with attacking an officer and resisting arrest. Murray reminded him that the crowd had recorded everything. So even though Doug was furious, he could only leave in humiliation. After that, Murray told me to apologize to the family. Fusion, you just cuffed my grandbaby and pointed guns at my entire family. And we're very sorry, ma'am, but ma'am, we. We're looking for a suspect that fit The description of your grandson. Oh, yeah. Young and black. You need to speak to your sergeant. Thankfully, Murray stepped up again to apologize, and that finally ended the mess. But when we got back to the station, Doug yelled at me for not following orders. Blame me for calling Murray over, saying I made him look bad. But this wasn't the first time something like this had happened. That day, just because a black woman was driving, Doug forced her to show her ID, but Emma was extremely nervous. They're in my bag. Is it okay if I reach in and grab them? Slowly? Doug noticed how tense she was, so he asked if she had anything illegal in the car. Emma quickly said no, but that was exactly what Doug was waiting for, so he immediately demanded to search the vehicle. Emma hesitated. Uh, yeah, yeah, I guess so. But there are guns in the trunk. Hands where I can see him. Emma hurried to explain that she was in the middle of a divorce, and because she worried her husband might snap, she took his gun to turn it in at the station. But Doug wouldn't listen to a single word. He cuffed her on the spot and slapped her with charges like burglary, possession, stolen goods, and illegal transport of a firearm. That was when I finally couldn't take it anymore. Look, do we really need to take her in? Let's just book the guns and Write it up for DA review. Come on, man, what do you say? First of all, never speak to me like that again. Come on, man. I'm your superior officer, not one of your homeboys, sir. Secondly, that woman just admitted to three felonies. She says she's turning in the weapon, but who's to say she wasn't on her way to blast her ex husband's brains out? Watching Emma breaking down in tears, I just couldn't stand Doug's behavior any longer. So I decided to talk to our boss, gray, and tell him that Doug had serious problems with how he handled cases, especially his attitude toward black people. While we were talking, Murray came in. He backed up everything I said, but gray was the boss, after all, so he kicked us out immediately. The next day, I went running to blow off some steam. Suddenly, a patrol car pulled up beside me. But even as a cop, I raised my hands without thinking. When I saw it was gray getting out, I awkwardly said, hi. Why are you here, sir? You were right. Benching Officer Stan isn't enough. He's a disgrace to the badge. He has to go. So I've crossed paths with 100 cops like Stan. The kind that dip their toes over the line constantly. But nothing egregious, nothing flagrant, nothing actionable. He knows what he can get away with. Chronic. Every offense, big or small. If we're lucky, the accumulation of infractions will be enough.

The three of them hurried toward the door, greedily breathing in the cold air outside. It turned out these three people were trapped in a sauna room. The temperature inside the room was as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit. A wooden ladder was propped against the door, making it impossible to open from the inside. They shouted for help through that small window, but got no response at all. The fireplace in the sauna was still heating continuously.

Before long, his arms ached from the effort, but the wooden ladder didn't move an inch. After getting the towel back, Jenna wanted to smash the temperature sensor on the wall. Renee stopped her immediately, warning that if this device was damaged, the heater's temperature might soar to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. They couldn't take that risk. The two argued over this. At this moment, Mike noticed the wall lamp on the wall. He took off the lamp shade and suggested short circuiting the wall. Lamp. He thought the wall lamp and the heater might share the same circuit, and blowing the fuse might cut off the power to the entire room and stop the heater. He asked Jennifer a towel and wrapped it around his hand. First, he took out the light bulb, then picked up a bucket of water. Next, he wrapped the handle of a spoon with the towel, soaked it, and then reached it toward the lamp socket. The next second, the room suddenly fell into darkness. Mike was struck by an electric current and fell heavily to the ground. After a while, luckily, Mike wasn't seriously injured. Moreover, he had successfully cut off the power. The heater had stopped working. However, they still couldn't get out. Mike's physical condition was getting worse and worse at the same time. Their friends outside had forgotten that the three were in the sauna. They even set off fireworks not far away because of this. The dog had already noticed the three calling for help. But their friends couldn't hear their cries for help because the fireworks were too loud.

My entire body floated in the air. My husband brought two friends to our home. But even when they strained with all their might, they couldn't pull me down. My husband watched me with deep sorrow. Four hours passed with no effect. The doctor measured my distance from the floor. I'd risen several more inches. My husband held my hand, pleading with the doctor to help me. But the doctor was helpless too, only able to comfort us patiently. He drew my blood and said he'd call in a specialist. The doctor urged me to stay optimistic. But alone, I could do nothing. I ate and even slept in the bathroom. By the next day, my head touched the ceiling. Gradually, fear and unease crept in. The specialist finally arrived. She measured my distance from the floor. She stated that within 10 weeks, I would rise to 11,000 feet. And three months later, I would cross the common line into outer space. Meaning I would die. That night, my husband smashed through the second floor ceiling. I felt myself rising again, but the ceiling above pressed down on me. My daughter turned the faucet on full blast to drown out my cries. She refused to face what was happening to me. That night, she stayed up very late. Through the hole my husband smashed for me. I watched her silently. By morning, my body had climbed to the second floor. My daughter wanted to Join me, begging for my permission. But I held back tears and told her she mustn't abandon her studies. After school, she returned home to my agonized moans. She saw a rope tightly banded round my ankles. My husband tried to stop me from drifting away. My body was already in unbearable pain. My daughter ran to the kitchen for a knife. My husband tried to stop her from cutting the rope. In their struggle, my ankle snapped. My daughter pushed my husband aside and cut the rope for me. No one could stop what was happening. The next day, I reached the rooftop. My family sent up my clothes, water, food, phone, an empty three player via the elevator. Before the elevator descended, my daughter strapped a five kilogram weight to my back to slow my fall. My silent husband suddenly embraced me tightly. We both knew this might be our last moment together. Soon I hovered above the city. I gazed down at the dense buildings and people as tiny as ants. The air grew thin at this height. The cold wind stung my skin. My food was nearly gone, but my heart remained with my family. I asked my daughter about her studies over the phone. I reminded her to eat warm meals. My words broke her, yet she forced calmness, unwilling to burden me with worry. After hanging up with my daughter, I felt hollow inside. I listen to the song she prepared for me on My MP three player. But the next second it slips from my grasp by screaming agony. Yet I cannot move, kicking helplessly at the air. Thousands of birds gather in the sky. Watching them, I forget to cry. They circle around me and I forget my fear, shouting with childlike joy. At night, torrential rain poured down. I remained alone in the sky, surrounded by thunder and lightning. Before long, I passed through the storm. Finally free from fear, I took off my mask and called my husband. We haven't spoken in so long. My daughter heard and ran over, too. I told her not to be discouraged by failure. I entrusted her to take care of her father. I told her I would always love her. My husband begged me to put my mask back on, lest I lose consciousness from oxygen deprivation. The sun rose slowly and my body climbed faster and faster. In my final moment, I told him I love him. Then I threw my phone away. I crossed the common line and kept ascending into the unknown.

You might be wondering, how could such a tiny bit of ink actually help? Well, that's only because the squid has already been pulled out of the water. When it's still in the ocean, the ink spreads rapidly and can turn a small patch of seawater completely black. And here's the thing, these little guys aren't just good at squirting ink. Got seriously impressive aim. Almost every single time they managed to nail you right around the eyes. Just look at these fishermen pulling squid out of the water. Not a single one of them escapes without getting a face full of ink. The experienced ones know better than to rush. They let the squid empty out all its ink while still in the water before bringing it up. A lot of people are curious about what squid ink actually tastes like. First off, it comes from the squid's ink sack, so it's not some kind of waste product. It has a slightly fishy flavor with a hint of bitterness. Apparently, when it's used in cooking, it becomes incredibly savory and flavorful. Also, since squid ink is a natural dye, it instantly stains whatever it touches black and it's pretty much impossible to wash off. There's this guy named Mike who didn't believe it. He carefully smeared the ink all over his arms, covering every inch of skin until both hands Were completely coated in black. By the time he tried to wash it off, it was too late. Days later, Mike posted another video update and his hands were still black.

The news said that on November 10th at 1 p. M. There would be heavy rain. Checked her digital watch, it showed November 11th, three PM the girl was confused. Was her watch showing the wrong date? The sky was completely clear and there was no sign of rain. The news reporter continued, along with the rain, there will be large hailstones. The girl got scared. If the news was true, where could she hide from the hail? Just then, a car approached. She waved her hand for a lift. The car stopped, but she hesitated. She didn't even know where she wanted to go. A couple sitting in the car asked, do you need a lift? The girl paused for a second, then said yes and got in. Two kids were sitting in the back seat. On the way, the wife asked, why were you alone on the highway? The girl replied, I don't remember how I got here. The wife found her answer strange. Then the husband asked, where are you going? The girl said, I don't know. Now both of them found her even stranger, but they didn't ask any more questions. After a while, the girl last, what's today's date? The husband replied, it's November 10th. Now the girl was sure her watch was wrong. An hour later, the car reached Echo Valley, but the sky was still clear. The girl was getting annoyed by the man's habit of whistling. She put her headphones back on. The news report started again. It said that due to heavy rain in Echo Valley, a flash flood had hit. Five people sitting in a car had died after being buried under debris. The girl was shocked. It hadn't even started raining yet. So how could there be a flash flood? And was the news talking about the same car she was in right now? Her body froze just then. Lightning struck in the distance. She quickly told the man to stop the car, but he said there's a service area ahead and it's safer there. When he didn't stop, the girl panicked and screamed loudly. Everyone got scared. The man had no choice but to stop the car. The wife got angry and called the girl crazy. She yelled at her and told her to get out. As soon as the girl stepped out, all the dark clouds in the sky suddenly vanished. By evening, the girl was walking alone on the highway again. She put on her headphones. The news report played again. It said that police had found the body of a girl on the way to Deep Valley. She was wearing a Red Jacket and headphones. The investigation revealed her name was Hester Black. Hearing this, the girl felt the ground slip from under her feet because that was her own name.

Her parents would send her food every day inside that capsule because she had a rare disease that didn't allow her to breathe the outside air. Everything was going on as usual, until one day, loud shouting and scared voices could be heard outside. When the woman looked out the window, she saw yellow gas spreading on the streets. It was poisonous and anyone who came near it was falling unconscious. Panic spread everywhere. Seeing this, a man who was the girl's father rushed back toward his home. But on the way, he saw the gas quickly moving in his direction. He somehow found a safer path and reached home in a hurry. He decided to leave the place with his wife. But they left their daughter behind because she was safer inside the capsule. Without wasting time, they stepped outside. As soon as they did, they saw the gas rising upward, so they began running to higher floors. They reached the top most room where an old man lived with his wife. To understand what was happening, they stepped onto the balcony and were shocked by the terrifying scene below. Then the man climbed to the roof and saw the entire city covered in a poisonous mist. It looked beautiful from above, but underneath it there were hundreds of dead bodies. The girl's mother kept checking on her daughter and trying to understand the situation. When they Learned that the capsule's battery was about to run out, the man decided he would go down and change the battery. But it would take more than 10 minutes and he couldn't survive that long in the toxic air without breathing. At that moment, he remembered that the old man downstairs always kept an oxygen cylinder to save his daughter. He took the risk and climbed down using a pipe. As he moved toward the poisonous air, he took a deep breath and quickly reached that floor. He broke the window and entered the old man's home. Inside, he found the old man already dead. Without stopping, he started looking for the oxygen cylinder, but it wasn't visible. In panic, he took out his flashlight and searched carefully. Soon he saw the cylinder lying in a corner. He quickly wore a mask and turned it on. Then he returned home and changed the battery in the capsule. After that, he packed some important items and started going down. But as soon as he reached the ground, he saw something terrifying. Everything was silent and dead bodies were lying across the streets. Now the biggest question is where did this poisonous gas come from? Will it wipe out all of humanity? Or is there still some hope left?

The reason was clear. Mister Han wasn't some creep. He was actually searching for a hidden camera. After checking carefully, he discovered that the camera had been placed there by the art teacher. Mister Han went to confront him, but just then, loud screams came from inside. Mister Han was never the type to care about consequence. In the past, he had broken three ribs of his own boss during an argument. That fight cost him his job as a boxing coach. And later, he became the school's P E. Teacher. On his very first day, he clashed with some students. Two girls kept staring at him, whispering that his strong build made him look more like a gangster than a teacher. They rejected Mister Han's apology and instead admired the charming art teacher. On paper, Han was a P E. Teacher, but secretly he was hired to collect debts. Still, he never raised his hand against young students. He decided to start with the smallest debt, which belonged to a girl named Elena. Soon after, he saw Elena climbing over the school wall to escape. He followed her and was shocked when she entered a nightclub. Inside, someone tried to harass her. Han pushed the guy aside and grabbed Elena's hand to pull her out. A dangerous thug appeared, but even he went silent. After seeing Han's intimidating presence outside the club, Han finally Learned The truth, Elena was looking for her missing best friend. After her parents passed away, the friend was forced to work in that same club, and then she disappeared. That night, Han dropped Elena home, promised to help find her friend, and warned her never to go to such places again. Just as they were near the house, car slowly passed by. The strange shadow of its headlights looked suspicious. Elena ignored it. But when the car stopped, she felt something was wrong. Meanwhile, Han noticed Elena's phone had fallen in the car. He turned back to return it. But at the bridge, he saw a man in black clothes carrying Elena away. The kidnapper escaped, but Han rushed Elena straight to the hospital. Later, he grew angry at the careless police investigation. As he thought deeply, one detail clicked. This smell of cigarettes had been coming from the school restroom. Furious, he stormed inside and caught three delinquent girls. They denied smoking, but Han checked every stall. That's when the shocking truth appeared again. A hidden camera was installed inside the bathroom.

As soon as you step inside the school gate, it seems as if all the colors are slowly vanishing from the body. The rules here were so strict that if anyone is found with any colored thing, the consequences can be very bad. Today was Nandita's first day, and she did not know anything. But then her lipstick slipped from her hand and fell on the ground. Thankfully, her benchmate showed quickness and hid the lipstick. Otherwise, the matter could have worsened. Just then, the discipline head came into the class in order to check the bags of all the children. Nandita protested and said, this is my personal privacy. But this had no effect on the head. She forcefully snatched Nandita's bag, dropped all the stuff on the ground and said angrily, now tell me, will you agree or not? Nandita remained silent. The head moved forward in anger, but as soon as she left, Nandita sat in front and applied bright red lipstick. The benchmate immediately warned, the teachers here are very dangerous. A few days ago, a girl protested and was beaten so hard with a blackboard duster that she started bleeding. A boy tried to make a video of the incident, but he was also caught. Both of them were locked in the school's blackroom. Till now, no one knows if they are alive or not. But instead of getting scared, Nandita became more curious. About the black room. Just then, the discipline head came to the class again. She saw Nandita's red lipstick and went mad with anger. Actually, she herself wanted to wear the same lipstick, so she punished Nandita in anger and made her stand in the school ground and asked her to memorize all the rules. But while reading the rules, Nandita started laughing. The other children thought that maybe she has gone mad. The head also found something strange and came to her. Then Nandita did something that no one had expected. She he burned the school rule book with a lighter and said, I have read 427 rules. None of these apply to me. On hearing this, she was taken to the police station. Then she was locked in the same black room where the two children were already imprisoned. Their begging voices could be heard from inside. After much torture, both of them had become quiet and completely obedient. Now it was Nandita's turn. The actual punishment was that a speaker was placed in her ears and the school rules were repeated loudly again and again without stopping. But Nandita did not care.

The girl angrily told him not to touch her. The boy thought that maybe the girl was stuck in the wall. He started thinking that maybe the rest of the girl's body was in the neighbor's room. So he immediately ran to the neighbor's house so that he could save the girl. But when he told the neighbor, the neighbor said, you are talking like a mad person. There is nothing in my room.

But the Boy did not care about her pain. His his intention was clear. Today he will definitely get the girl out of the wall. He started breaking the wall with a can like mad. When that did not work, he brought a hammer and started banging the wall. The neighbor was also shocked to hear the sound of the wall breaking. The boy kept breaking the wall and in a short time a big hole was formed in it. But when the entire wall fell down, the boy was stunned. Only the girl's head was hanging on the other side of the wall. The rest of the body was nowhere to be seen. Seeing this, all his dirty thoughts ended. The neighbor also started trembling with fear. The boy saw that the girl's neck was broken. He got scared, but still he put his hand inside her neck and then tried to pull her head. But the head was stuck somewhere and was not coming out. Just then, the other neighbors came inside. The boy quickly put a cloth on the girl's head and started hiding it. But by then it was too late. The neighbor had seen the girl's head. Soon the police came and took the boy to the police station. There a psychiatrist was called to check his mental condition. After the examination, when the matter became a little clear, the boy returned to his home. But when he came back, he saw the wall was now perfect. And the girl's head was also missing. He again ran to the police and asked, where did that girl go? The police told him she was not a real girl. She was an experiment of a scientist. They said she was just a test model whom you mistook for a human being. The boy went into shock after hearing this because he had assumed that girl to be his girlfriend.

But to his shock, after hearing the whole story, his father in law simply told him to suck it up. Mike lost his temper and lashed out, calling his wife shameless. She's my daughter before your wife. His father in law got right in his face and warned him to watch his mouth. As if Mike were the problem, not his wife. Everyone around them was just waiting to see him humiliated. Faced with this disgrace, Mike had no choice but to swallow his anger. After all, his father in law was the local crime boss, known for his ruthlessness. Definitely not someone Mike could afford to cross. just when he thought he could write it out by keeping his head down, his wife took things even further. She brought that man home. And all Mike could do was sit in the corner watching as she eventually walked the guy out. When she came back inside, Mike flicked on the lights. What the fuck? He wanted her to know that he was fully aware of everything she'd been doing. He'd just been saving her face. But instead of showing any remorse, she claimed they'd only been eating KFC in the bedroom and nothing had actually happened. Mike said nothing. He just walked upstairs. Their marriage had been dead for a long time. The only thing he still cared, About was his son, but his wife beat him to the punch. Through her father, she tracked Mike down and pressured him to initiate the breakup. Mike didn't feel a thing when he heard this. He was desperate to get rid of her. But what his father in law said next was something he couldn't accept. Not only was Mike being kicked out of the house, but his son would be staying behind. Mike's rage exploded. He could give up anything, but never his son. Without hesitation, he stood up and walked out. The next day, the crime boss sent two of his men over, claiming they wanted to take Mike and his boy to an amusement park. Mike wanted to refuse, but he was in no position to fight back. The two thugs drove them to the park, where the boss was already waiting. He let the kid run off and play while he pulled Mike aside for a private conversation. Eventually, the two of them got on the Ferris wheel together. When the ride reached the top, Mike spotted his wife down below and watched as she put his son in a car and drove off. It had all been a setup. The boss had lured Mike onto the Ferris wheel just to steal his child. Mike tried to stop it, but a gun was pressed against his chest. He was powerless. Boss clearly had no intention of letting him go. Mike was thrown into the trunk of A car and taken to a rundown trailer in the middle of nowhere. The thugs forced an entire bottle of liquor down his throat, then doused the inside of the trailer with gasoline, planning to set it ablaze once he passed out, making it look like an accident. Flames roared to life as Mike writhed in agony while his wife and son watched helplessly from outside. Finally, one of the men fired two shots, ending Mike's life for good. But you think that's the end of the story? Not even close. The real storm was just beginning. Ten years later, a man tracked down one of the killers from that night and shot him dead on the spot. Word quickly reached the crime boss, but since it was just some low level nobody, he didn't think much of it. Next day, however, his right hand man, John, was found dead in the street. That's when the boss realized these killings might be connected to what happened a decade ago. His mind immediately went to Mike's elderly mother. Still alive. She was in her 80s, but if someone was out for revenge, she was the only one left to tie up loose ends. The boss went to her home himself and killed her before leaving. But things didn't go the way he expected. Shortly after he left, a familiar figure appeared inside the house. It was Mike. The boss never imagined Mike had survived, let alone spent all these years planning His revenge. Standing over his mother's body, Mike's fury burned white hot. But 10 years of hardship had sharpened him. He stayed calm and began hunting down the boss and his ex wife. Since she had become a drug addict, it didn't take long to get her address from a dealer. By now, his ex wife was so strung out, she could barely think straight. When Mike suddenly appeared in her room, she was absolutely terrified. She had watched him get shot and collapse with her own eyes. How could he possibly still be alive? Mike told her to lure her father to the house, then hid behind a wall and waited. The moment the boss stepped through the door, Mike lunged out and drove a knife deep into his leg. The man screamed and crumbled to the floor. Without hesitation, Mike grabbed a pillow, pressed it over the boss's face, and sat down on top of him. He was going to end this man's life right in front of his ex wife. But first, Mike needed to find out where his son was. Because of his ex wife's addiction, his son had ended up hooked on drugs, too. When he Learned the boy had been living on the streets, curled up under an overpass, Mike didn't hesitate. He pulled the trigger and wiped out the father and daughter who had destroyed his life. Then he rushed to the overpass and found his son barely conscious. By now, the boy Had grown from a small child into a teenager. Mike put him in the car and drove to a church, where he got him settled. Only then did he feel at ease enough to leave. In the end Mike walked alone into an empty field. His eyes were filled with darkness, as if hinting that this, perhaps, was the true reason he had been reborn.

At that moment, Jack reached out, hold him in and shut the gate to block the tentacles. They flew the ship back to their base. But when they reached the base, the president appeared. Then they discovered he was behind all of this. He locked the kids in a room and took a glass of water from Ojo. Without water, her powers would not work. Lisa said, now there is no hope. Earth is going to end. All the kids started crying. Then Ojo got an idea. She collected everyone's tears and made a key from water. The kids used it to open the lock. They escaped and saved the earth.

Because there was no vehicle on the road and there was no speed limit. Still, the truck was moving very slowly. She wanted to reach home quickly. So without thinking much, she overtook the truck.

When he saw his fellow disciples practicing foot techniques, he picked up up a bamboo stick and began to imitate them. But as he practiced, his bamboo was about to fall. Luckily, his arm had gained more strength. If that hadn't happened, the master would have expelled him from the Shaolin temple. Because the bamboo structure was still incomplete, the master wouldn't allow him to go down to the courtyard. He now had only one option keep building the bamboo structure and secretly learning Kung fu. One day, he saw the other disciples practicing on wooden training dummies, so he made his own dummy from bamboo sticks. But as he tried to spin the dummy, he fell down. At the last moment, he grabbed the dummy with both hands. The master saw this and threatened to throw him out immediately. But the boy argued, I haven't even touched the ground. The master angrily kicked the dummy and it began spinning wildly. The master said, if you have the courage, stop it. The boy saw his chance and climbed back onto the roof. When he finally built a bamboo structure around the entire temple, the master ordered, now break it completely and get out of the temple. The boy thought the master was joking, so he stood upright on the bamboo poles. The master tried To shake the bamboo with force. But the boy held on to the wall with both hands. When the master applied force again, the boy easily maintained his balance on the poles and returned to the roof. He then jumped straight into the courtyard, where he was never allowed to go. He went straight into the training area with heavy iron weights, but the master blocked his way. The boy pushed away the master's hand and began practicing. The master attacked him several times, but the boy kept his balance, dodging each blow. The master was shocked. He launched another attack to see how much Kung fu the boy had Learned. The boy dodged each of the master's attacks with great skill. He even broke the training sticks. The master then struck with a powerful blow, and the boy fell straight into the most dangerous part of agility training. But using the footwork he had Learned, he easily overcame all the obstacles. Still, the master said, you cannot stay in the Shaolin Temple because your temperament is not right for this place. The boy didn't know that the master had deliberately given him this task so that he could secretly learn martial arts. And now that he had completely mastered Kung fu, it was time to say goodbye to the temple.

In the chaos, the two were separated. The boy hid in the wardrobe and Emily ran to the adjacent room. At this time, the drone tracked the boy's movement and detected his hiding place. He was terrified. Although the wardrobe was bulletproof, it was eventually blown up. At this critical moment, Emily appeared with a slingshot. The drone's wing was hit, causing it to lose balance and crash to the ground. Emily quickly grabbed a nearby chair and smashed it with all her might, but the boy was frozen in fear. After Emily's repeated calls, the boy came to his senses. The two then walked out of the room carrying a metal shield. But another drone approached from the front. The strong impact bounced them out several meters. Just as they thought they were about to die, a woman appeared outside. The woman used jamming equipment to disable all the drones. Obviously, the woman came to protect Emily. But as soon as she entered the room, she was targeted by a sniper. The woman quickly kicked Emily away, but she was shot herself and dropped her weapon on the ground. As Emily tried to retrieve the gun from the ground, she remember remembered her uncle's words, every space in the room has dead angles, the blind spots of the sniper. Thinking of this, she picked up the broken lens on the ground and wrapped it tightly on A broom with tape.

At first, the items inside seemed useless, but each one gave him another reason to keep living. The blade of an ice skate could slice cloth, crack open coconuts, and the laces could even be used to wrap wounds. He spread out empty bags to make a bed and even turned the leopard print dress into a fishing net. But the fish he caught were too small and foul smelling to eat, so he tried crabs, only to find their meat watery and tasteless. That's when it hit him. Without fire, nothing would ever feel right. He tried rubbing sticks together, convincing himself that if early humans could do it, so could he. He added scraps of dry paper, working through days and nights until his hands were covered in blisters. Still not a single spark. Frustrated, he smacked a volleyball hard. The red Mark on his palm calmed him a little. With sweat dripping, he drew a smiling face on the ball and named it Wilson. Keeping it close, he returned to rubbing sticks, often glancing at his new friend. Somehow it helped. This time, smoke rose, but when he lifted the stick, the flame died. He adjusted his method, digging a small trench in the ground, letting air flow in and placing the wood there. Smoke began to rise. He blew gently and finally fire came to life. Overjoyed like a child, he had found hope again. That night, he lit a fire by the shore and celebrated by cooking crabs for the first time. They tasted delicious. What he didn't know was that he remained trapped there for four long years. By then, he was thin, worn down and hardened by survival. One day while hunting at sea, he found a large piece of plastic drifting in the wind. It could be a sail. Gathering wood, he began building a raft, rope. He stripped bark from trees, weaving it together with resin. Even after using everything, it wasn't enough. Then he remembered the rope he once made to hang himself. Now that same rope could save his life. The raft was ready. Before leaving, he took two things, the pocket watch from his girlfriend and the parcel with golden winds. He tied Wilson securely, carved 15 days into a rock, untied the rope and put the raft into the water. Looking back, he saw the island that had been his prison for four years. The journey was brutal, drinking rainwater, eating raw fish, fighting exhaustion. A violent storm struck, washing away the Golden Wing parcel. Soon after, Wilson drifted away, too, carried by the waves. Desperate, he jumped into the sea to save him, but the rope tethered to the raft held him back. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't reach his only companion. Broken, he climbed back onto the raft, threw away the oars and collapsed in grief, didn't even realize a ship. Was passing by. By sheer luck, the waves stirred enough to wake him and the crew had already spotted him. He was saved. Back home, he saw his old girlfriend again, but she was married now to the dentist who once fixed his tooth. In the end, he delivered that last undelivered parcel, writing a small note of gratitude on.

The angel's beauty left the boy momentarily stunned. He quickly waved for the coach to come over and urgently indicated. However, when the coach turned back to look carefully, he found nothing. The boy, however, was convinced he didn't see wrongly. Despite the coach's doubts, he thought for a moment that sometimes kids can see extraordinary things. And since there was no chance of winning this game anyway, he decided to let it go. Taking a gamble, he directly substituted the highest scoring player in the game and put the inexperienced rookie on the court. The teammates were infuriated by the coach's decision and even the commentator didn't know how to explain it to the audience, which immediately LED to booing from the stands. As expected, after the rookie player went on the field, the opposing team easily scored two points and the game seemed lost. At this crucial moment, the boy noticed an angel suddenly grabbing a high speed, flying the baseball, then the base. All was slowed down by hundreds of times and was easily caught by the rookie player and hit out. As the baseball kept bouncing around the field, the opposing players immediately surrounded it, but the baseball moved flexibly like a snake and by the players full efforts to catch it, they could never touch it. The scene instantly turned into a chaotic mess. The rookie sees The opportunity to run to the finish line. And by the time the opposing players caught the baseball, he had easily scored a point. The spectators in the stands immediately erupted into cheers, but at this moment, they were still behind in score. At this moment, the boy scans again and sees the angel who just intervened appear behind another player. He immediately waves his arms vigorously to call the coach over and tells him to have the injured teammate on the sidelines at this moment. With previous experience, the coach could only fully follow the boy's advice and decisively let the injured player take the field. This time, the angel unexpectedly descended. The player made a gentle toss and the baseball shot out like the speed of light. The opposing batter barely had time to react, although his arm had been injured before. With the angel assisting behind him, he easily struck out the opponent with each pit until he had thrown all 10 baseballs. The opposing batters couldn't catch a single one. In this way, the rookie team miraculously won the game, and the boy was regarded as the team's mascot by the coach, insisted to be present at every match.

After that, they pushed me into a giant oven, laid me down neatly inside, then slowly close the oven door, turn the key to start the switch, and set the temperature to 200 degrees. After 30 minutes, they opened it again. This can shrink a normal human to thousand times smaller in an instant. To solve the problem of overpopulation, a scientist developed a shrinking technology that can shrink a person down to just 10 centimeters tall. They eat less and live in tiny houses. The trash they produce in four years is less than what normal people throw away in a day. And the best part? Ten thousand dollars in the real world equals 10 million. Here, a huge mansion of 10,000 square meters only cost 99 bucks. As a poor man, I was tempted. The next day, my wife and I came to visit the miniature world for the procedure. But before shrinking, they had to shave off all our hair, then knock out all our teeth. Because teeth can't shrink. If not removed, they would crush our heads. Then we were pushed into the giant oven. Thirty minutes later, a group of nurses came in with small carts. They carefully scooped us up with tiny shovels and gently placed us on little beds. When I woke up, I quickly lifted the blanket. Seeing my little buddy still there, I sighed in relief. But then my wife called. She changed her mind while shaving her eyebrows. She didn't go through with the shrinking procedure. Hearing that, I completely broke down. Because the process is irreversible. I went alone to the miniature world, heartbroken. Everything there looked just like the real world. Then I arrived at my giant mansion. But soon I received a delivery. It was a 50 carat diamond ring for my wife and a divorce paper as big as my house, asking me to sign it. That's when I knew I could never satisfy her again. So I climbed up and signed it. Abandoned by my wife, I decided to find a new one in the tiny world.

Then he hung a death count down around my neck and snapped a steel ring onto my arm. He quickly opened a small window on the train and shoved my arm right through it. I screamed in agony instantly. Three seconds later, I went silent because it was minus 100 degrees outside. My arm froze solid in seconds and the guards giant hammer was ready. When the countdown finally hit zero, they pulled my arm back into the car. After making sure it was completely frozen, the guard raised his massive hammer without hesitation. But seeing all this happen, the poor passengers didn't dare to protest because earth had already entered a new ice age. 99% of humanity had frozen to death and the remaining 1% lived on a train that had been running non stop for 17 years. But unfortunately, there was still a strict class system on this train. The rich lived in the front first class cars enjoying a life of luxury every day while the poor were crammed into the filthy tail section surviving only on some kind of black protein bars. And not just that, the rich would even take children from the tail section. I casually complained for just a second and they punished me with brutal torture. But today the poor had finally had enough. When the guard opened the tail door, a bold man decided to start a Rebellion because after more than 10 years of watching, he realized the guards guns might not have bullets. To test his theory, Nick pushed through the crowd without hesitation and pointed the guards gun at himself, then pulled the trigger. Once they knew for sure, they lifted a metal pole they had prepared and rushed toward the closing door, blocking it just in time. Then everyone hurried to the trains prison section and rescued a father and daughter trapped inside. These two were vital to reaching the front cars. The man was a master locksmith and his daughter had a special ability. She could hear what was happening behind the doors.

Seeing that, grandma threw the doll on the floor in anger, but she had no idea that our whole family was about to face a disaster because this doll we bought from a street stall wasn't normal. There's an evil spirit living inside her. Five years went by. My daughter had grown into a big girl. Everyone had forgotten that creepy doll in the cabinet. But that day, one of her marbles suddenly rolled into the storage room and that's how my daughter brought the doll out again. The strange thing was, five years ago, the doll's hair was short. Now it had grown long. Even its nails had grown longer. Seeing my daughter play so happily, I didn't think too much about it. But after that, she carried the doll around every day. But that night when we went to sleep, a figure slowly walked into the room and slipped right under my blanket. When I turned on the light to check, I nearly jumped out of my skin. After that, I started to feel something was wrong with the doll. To keep it from scaring me again while my daughter was at school, I stuffed the doll into a trash bag and tossed it downstairs. Without hesitation, I thought that would be the end of it. But right when I. Got home, there was a knock at the door. I walked over confused and I saw the doll was back again. I was furious when I saw it, but after I was exhausted, I saw the doll sitting on my daughter's bed. That's when I realized I had been hitting my own daughter just now. I froze in terror. Luckily, it was only a nightmare. But the next second, that same knocking came again. I opened the door to check and the doll was really back at the door. Turned out I didn't sort the trash properly, so the sanitation workers returned it. When I saw them still dealing with the trash, I ran over and handed the doll to them. I thought this time it wouldn't come back. But less than 10 minutes later, a loud Siren came from downstairs. I knew something was wrong. When I ran out to check, I saw the garbage truck had malfunctioned and trapped one worker's leg inside. While I was too scared to look up, my daughter walked out from behind the curtain holding the doll. Looks like I can never get rid of this evil doll. The next day, my daughter begged me to play hide and seek. I had no choice. I walked around the house impatiently looking for her. When I reached the laundry room, I saw a pair of tiny hands on top of the washing machine.

She was suffocating, desperately tugging at the rope, she tried to haul the iron block up with it, but to no avail. She accidentally grabbed the iron mesh and the metal snapped due to decay. Finding hope, she severed the mesh just before her consciousness faded. Successfully surfacing, she gasped greedily for air, yet felt no joy, for the maintenance room door was locked. She pounded on the door with her bare hands. After it buckled, she wedged her fingers into the crack and tore at the door panel with all her strength. But inside there was nothing. Refusing to give up, she opened the last fire cabinet and finally found a complete Protective suit, but no helmet. Exhausted, she swam back to where she started, only to see Sora abruptly turn and leave, returning to his own safe house. She continued searching the Silo for ways to repair the suit, though she found repair schematics and parts. A photograph nearby sparked her suspicion. If the man in the photo was the real sorrow, then who was the bearded man in the safehouse claiming to be him? But now she had no time for such questions because a mutiny had erupted in the Silo she'd come from and everyone was desperate to reach the inhabitable surface. She had to hurry back to save them. She casually dismissed a red cloth in the room, noticing an undamaged helmet beneath the bed. Just as she reached for it, darkness engulfed her vision and she collapsed unconscious.

Knowing human vision spans only 180 degrees, he believed staying out of sight would grant him complete invisibility. Yet when the guard entered the cell, he spotted Tae Soo in the corner at once. Though this earned him a slap across the face, a triumphant smile spread across his face. This proved his theory correct. He then began practicing free climbing. The next day, when the guard returned for inspection, Tasuk vanished from the cell again. Only after the guard turned away did he realize Tasuk had scaled the wall. This moment enraged the guard, resulting in another brutal beating. Yet Tasuk refused to give up. Theoretically, achieving invisibility required perfecting his footwork to the extreme, allowing him to vanish from the guard's sight. So when the guard returned for the next inspection, Tasuk grew clever. He followed the guard's footsteps precisely. Unexpectedly, this tactic worked. The guard searched for minutes without finding Tasuk. But just as he believed his invisibility had succeeded, the sunlight cast a shadow that betrayed his position. The next second, something terrifying happened. 좀 더 연습해야 되겠네 의림자도 신경 쓰고 사람의 신입까지 얘들아 was precisely the guard words that instantly awaken Taysuk after the guard left the cell thru an eye on his hand imag인 someone always standing before him thi had come to understand that to achieve true invisible one must learn to anticipate the target's actions and Thoughts. Finally, after repeated practice, his invisibility technique reached the Pinnacle of mastery. His figure vanished completely from the cell. When the guard made his next rounds, tasuuk knocked him to the ground in one swift move, then tossed him out. The guard dared not provoke Te Suk again and hastily slammed the cell door shut. Clearly, Te Suk's invisibility had been perfected. Months later, Te Suk was released from prison. His first act upon leaving the facility was to seek vengeance against the guard who had beaten him. So on the day the guard finished his shift, Te Suk activated his invisibility and appeared behind him, beating the man with a baseball bat until he lay motionless on the ground. Only then did Te Sok depart satisfied. Next, Te Sok used his invisibility again to visit the home of the boxer who had beaten him before. Unexpectedly, the boxer sensed something amiss. Facing an invisible enemy, he searched his house thoroughly, but found no one yet. Strangely, white stickers had been placed over his photos. Soon, the wealthy man received news of Taysuc's release. But upon hearing this, the tycoon grew excited. He was certain the kid would come back to his house. Then he could teach him a proper lesson. Sure enough, by midnight, Teeso quietly slipped into the tycoon's home. The tycoon sensed someone had entered his house. He grabbed his baseball bat and went outside to search. But he searched every corner of the house and Couldn't find the uninvited guest. Just then, sunwha suddenly noticed a figured darting passed outside. She instantly realized it was Tae Suk. So when the wealthy man finally fell into a deep sleep, she quietly slipped into the living room to investigate. Though she didn't see Tae suk's form, she knew he must be hiding somewhere. Sure enough, when she approached the mirror, that familiar silhouette appeared once more. Sunwuah's face broke into an excited smile. But just then, the tycoon abruptly opened the door. When he looked toward the living room, teasuk had vanished once more. Facing the tycoon's questioning gaze, Sunwuah offered no explanation, nor did the tycoon dwell on it, simply pulling Sun Wau into his embrace. Yet at that very moment, Sun Wau reached her other hand toward Te Sok. Ever since Te Sok came into her home, Sun Wau's disposition had grown remarkably open hearted. Every day she radiated a happy smile, always preparing a table overflowing with delicious dishes. After the wealthy man left for work, Teasook would slowly turn on the stereo, but he didn't rush to reveal himself. Instead, he playfully walked behind Sunwoo. Sensing Teasook's intent, Sunwha cooperatively spread her arms wide and slowly backed away until she had cornered Tasuk against the wall. Yet strangely, though they were clearly standing, on the bathroom scale, the needle remained fixed at zero. And so the film ended.

Luckily, her parents were busy discussing something else and hadn't noticed a thing about her. But Jenny didn't have time to clean up the stains before rushing off to school.

She thrashed around wildly, begging him to leave, but he only grew more aggressive. The man's younger brother also had feelings for her. Watching everything unfold on the security camera, he was on the verge of falling apart. In the end, the woman was forced to submit. In the days that followed, the woman played along with the two Twisted Brothers. This made the older brother drop his guard around her. He even started bringing her food and talking to her like they were close. The woman knew the younger brother liked her, too, so she'd subtly flirt with the older brother whenever he brought her meals. But the look on her face when she glanced back at the security camera told a different story. Things were far from what they seemed that night. As the woman lay asleep, the older brother snuck into her room again, but this time was different. The woman went along with it, even joking around with him casually. The man was so caught off guard that he ended up leaving the room in a hurry. The next day, when the younger brother brought the woman water for a bath, she quietly took off her clothes. As he helped wash her, she reached out, took his hand and pulled him close, asking him to hold her. The man panicked, flustered beyond belief. After that, the woman even offered to help treat him.

The governor's wife loved the tattoo, so she wanted the governor to take the girl home as a pet. The governor shot his man a quick glance, and the man understood right away. He pulled two coins from his pocket and tossed them on the ground. Girl's mother thought it was just a tip for her daughter's singing, so she picked up the coins and thanked them humbly. But she had no idea this was actually the money the British paid to buy her daughter. It wasn't until her daughter was taken to the carriage that she realized what was happening. She rushed over, kneeling in front of the carriage, begging them to let her daughter go. The soldier pulled out his gun, ready to shoot her on the spot. Thankfully, the governor stopped him. The soldier didn't fire, but the governor wasn't trying to save her. He just didn't want to waste a bullet. The soldier put away the gun, picked up a thick wooden stick from the side, walked over, and struck her on the head. The woman died instantly, and the little girl was taken away. But they didn't know the girl had an older brother. He poured chicken blood over his head, using himself as bait to draw in wild animals. Soon a wolf was lured by the smell of blood, but the man showed no fear. He turned and ran deep into the jungle because he needed to lead the wolf to a trap he set earlier. But as he was running, he suddenly spotted a huge footprint on the ground. Jack immediately became alert. He knew a big tiger had to be nearby. Sure enough, when he climbed a slope, a tiger hiding in the grass lunged at him. Jack dodged to the side, sending the tiger crashing right into the wolf. Then he fell down the slope. The tiger got up and scared the wolf away, then charged after Jack again. Jack slid forward and grabbed a tree stump from the ground. The tiger rammed straight into it, but it didn't hurt the tiger at all, and it kept chasing him. Just as the tiger was about to catch Jack, he suddenly dove forward and lay flat on the ground. The tiger stopped just a meter away because Jack had let it right into the trap. But a Wolf Trap couldn't hold a tiger. Tiger thrashed violently and quickly tore the wooden stakes free. Jack leapt up and grabbed the rope, using all his strength to pull the 1 2 60 kilogram tiger backward. He was about to hook the clamps together when the rope suddenly snapped under the massive force.

Thankfully, the house was full of cameras, so Jack could still guide them around the intruders. But then all signals inside the house went dead. The intruders had brought a signal jammer, cutting off all communications. They pulled out metal detectors, scanning the house as if searching for something specific. Soon, one of them approached the basement. Hearing the footsteps, Lisa shoved her son into the Vent and hid herself in the closet. The detector scanned over the vent, then along the wall and suddenly beeped loudly. He pulled out an axe and hacked into the wall. Inside he found two steel beams. The beams went straight up.

I fought through the pain, teleported again, barely escaping his grasp. To deal with this guy, I found my friend Mike, who also had powers, and decided to team up against Charlie. But before that, I had to learn a few things, because right now, my ability was way too weak. Mike showed me a few tricks that left me speechless, so I asked how he could teleport with a car, but Mike said that was just basic stuff. He once met someone who could teleport an entire building. I was completely blown away, so we spent the whole night driving like Maniacs just to make some noise and draw Charlie

While sorting through his belongings that day, she unexpectedly found a roll of 8 millimeters film. After watching the footage, she was utterly stunned. It contained the murder of a young girl. The camera angles made it clear this wasn't a movie at all, but rather a documentary style recording. The elderly woman couldn't fathom why her honest husband would possess such material. To resolve her inner turmoil, she spent a fortune hiring private investigator cage to uncover the truth. Yet when cage witnessed the tape's contents, his scalp suddenly prickled with horror. The footage was utterly brutal. Afterward, cage suggested handing the tape over to the police, but the old lady refused his advice. As a prominent local family, such an action would tarnish their reputation. She told cage that if he could uncover the truth behind it, she would pay whatever it took. it was precisely this case that LED cage to uncover a shocking secret. The next day, cage went to the Population Investigation Bureau. He knew that identifying the girl was the key to investigating the tape, but the staff told him hundreds of thousands go missing every year. Finding one person is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Cage had no choice but to randomly search through the records. After hours of fruitless searching, he turned his attention back to the tape, hoping to uncover clues within the Footage. Sure enough, upon careful examination, he discovered the tape had been made 20 years prior. Then cage noticed the tattoo on the killer's hand, a pentagonal design. After a month of relentless investigation, cage finally located the girl from the tape. Her name was Mary, and she had vanished at just 16. To piece together Mary's story, cage tracked down Mary's mother. Using the information the mother revealed, Mary frequently argued with her stepfather. On the day Mary vanished, he stormed out after a fight and never returned. Strangely, Mary hadn't taken any luggage with her. This made cage increasingly suspicious. He immediately searched Mary's room and soon made a major discovery. Inside the toilet tank, a sealed diary tucked inside the toilet tank. Inside was a note Mary had left for her mother, clearly stating the reason for her departure. It wasn't due to arguments with her stepfather, but because she had met a boyfriend. Her boyfriend had invited her to Hollywood to make movies. She planned to return home and tell her parents only after becoming a star. Yet after her departure, all contacts ceased. To spare her mother the shock, cage kept the secret from her. Instead, he noted down the name of Mary's boyfriend. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at the boy's home, the boy's father revealed his son was in prison. With no other choice, cage went to the prison to find him. Only then did cage learn the truth. It turned out Mary had Indeed, gone to Hollywood within years ago. But soon after, she fell for the director and he never saw her again. The man added that stardom wasn't easy. Only by taking the wrong path could one succeed. Realizing Mary had gone into adult films, cage rushed to the local adult bookstore. Suddenly, a mask had caught his eye, the same type worn by the killer back home. Cage rewatched the tape. Sure enough, the mask matched the killer's. The next day, he returned to the adult store. The owner LED him to an underground market. Here, the owner said, nothing is impossible to buy, only things beyond your imagination. Cage soon acquired two rare tapes. Their content, however, closely mirrored the details of Mary's murder. According to the shop owner, these girls all came from a shelter. Cage immediately went to this shelter and presented Mary's photo. The nun recognized the girl instantly upon seeing it, as Mary had been the most beautiful girl there back then, so her memory of her remained vivid. The nun then LED cage to a storage room and handed cage the luggage Mary had taken with her. Inside the trunk, cage made another discovery, a diary still tucked away. It contained the phone number of a film production company. Driven by his growing suspicions, cage took the photo to the company. The boss froze upon seeing it, then muttered he didn't recognize her and turned to leave. Cage instantly sensed something was off to Investigate the boss further. Cage entered the apartment building across from the boss's office. While the boss was away, he secretly planted a listening device in his room. At first, cage detected no unusual activity. But one day after receiving a phone call, the boss abruptly rushed out of his office. This sent cage into a frenzy. He swiftly followed from behind, trailing him all the way to a sprawling mansion in the suburbs. Clearly, this was where adult films were being shot. While cage searched for the boss's whereabouts, night security guard suddenly spotted him. Terrified, cage had no choice but to bolt. The next morning, cage called the boss, stating he now knew their secret and asked if they had murdered Mary 20 years ago. Initially, cage only intended to scare him. After hanging up, the boss instantly grew tense, immediately dialing another number to arrange for his henchmen to handle the company's affairs. Finally, he booked a flight abroad. Little did he know, cage had intercepted the entire conversation. Realizing the boss was undoubtedly connected to Mary's death, cage began investigating the man's background. It turned out the boss was a perverted director who would film anything as long as the money was right. To gain access, cage pretended he wanted to make a movie and had a friend arrange a meeting with the boss. That night, cage reviewed the purchased videotape. Unexpectedly, he made a major discovery. The tattoo on this masked man's hand matched the Tattoo of the masked man who killed Mary. Excited, he immediately called his friend. His friend revealed the man was a veteran actor at the company, nicknamed the machine for being a workaholic who filmed movies 365 days a year. The next day, his friend received a call from the boss. Thus, they returned to the underground market. They bluntly stated they wanted to shoot a perverted film, claiming money was no issue, but demanding one condition, machine must be cast. The manager agreed without hesitation, quickly escorting them to the production base. Only then did cage catch sight of the male lead. Yet cage noticed the female lead was absent. Just as cage grew suspicious, the manager raised a crossbow, aiming it at him. At that moment, a man in a suit approached. This man in a suit was the old woman's lawyer. Cage never imagined this lawyer was the real boss behind the scenes. He then forced cage to hand over the videotape. Cage had no choice but to go back for it. On the way, cage finally Learned the truth. The lawyer wasn't the real boss at all. The true boss was the old woman's husband. It turned out her husband, who seemed honest and decent, was actually a complete pervert.

Even turning off the lights at night cost money. Those without cash are destined for sleepless nights. However, in this appalling environment, there is a way to earn money by hand. Every day, the prison delivers a box, a large crochet hook, yarn and instructions. Jack spends a whole day figuring out how to use it. He makes his first knitted hat for the children, designed to protect their cold little heads. When he puts the hat out the window, he earns 20 cents. But that is far from enough. In the days to come, he needs to work even harder to earn $10,000 so he can afford a lawyer. But in this prison, income is accompanied by expenses. Electricity cost $1 a day and each meal costs $1. Saving money is virtually impossible under these circumstances. Three days pass and Jack's knitting skills have become increasingly refined. Now he can knit hats faster and in more variety. To save money, he sleeps with the lights on, eats only one meal a day, and even postpones using the bathroom because that costs 30 cents. Through his tireless work day and night, he finally scraped together $5. With this money, Jack could call his mother, hoping she could lend him money to hire a lawyer. After the call connected, the balance on the screen began to dwindle. When his mother saw her son's picture in prison, she was heartbroken. And confused, Jack told his mother he needed $10,000 to hire a defense lawyer. His mother was shocked as the family didn't have that much money. Just as Jack was about to explain in detail, the video call was abruptly cut off due to insufficient funds. He completely broke down screaming at the screen. All his efforts were in vain. The next day, Jack lost his only hope. He stopped trying and instead spent his days playing games to pass the time. That day, Jack he was working to earn money for food when the system suddenly notified him that his account had received $10,000. However, because he was lost in grief, he didn't notice that precious information. Soon the three month period ended and the system asked him again if he would plead guilty. Jack now faced two paths, either plead guilty and accept a 50 year sentence or immediately hire a lawyer to defend just like him. Feeling utterly hopeless, he suddenly noticed an unread text message on his screen. Confused, Jack clicked on it and saw a notification of a $10,000 transfer from his mother. His mother hadn't given up on him. After all, this money meant he had enough for legal fees. So he immediately hired a lawyer after deducting $10,000 from his account. The lawyer's photo appeared on the screen, but the lawyer coldly told him his case was complicated and he shouldn't have too much hope. He should plead guilty. Then he hung up. From beginning to end, Jack didn't know what crime he had committed that day. He had only rushed a few steps and been caught by a police drone. Now he had spent $10,000 but hadn't gained the freedom he craved. Jack lay on his bed completely devastated, losing interest in everything. Then the system suddenly announced his acquittal. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. He turned and saw the door was indeed open. The atmosphere of freedom healed his wounds. In that moment, all the unpleasant memories seemed to vanish. When he retrieved his belongings, it was as if nothing had happened.

When the SWAT team stormed in, I stripped off every piece of clothing. As a top lawyer, I knew they would see I carried no weapon so they would not fire. Without restraint. I was locked up. My first request was a Simmons mattress. The bunk bed was too hard to endure. Detective Durant mocked me. Then his daughter received a video tape. The tape showed the attack, but I wore a mask so no one could prove it was me. Durant rushed in to argue with me. I gave him one condition. He gave me the mattress. I told the judge the truth. A luxury mattress arrived in my cell. The other inmates were furious with jealousy. Nice bed. Thank you. It's a single. At my trial, I broke my promise. I did not confess. I recited a similar case word for word. The evidence was not enough. The judge suggested releasing me on the spot. I put on a cold smile. Thank you. Excuse me. No, I don't think I will. Excuse you. You see, this is what I'm talking about. You were about to let me go. Are you kidding me? This is why we're here in the first place. Then I accused her. She let a killer walk free. Ten years ago, she cleared the man who ended my wife's life. Everything I did was for revenge. They sent me back to myself to calm down. I told Durant, I had a hostage. It was the lawyer who defended my enemy. Durant checked. The lawyer had gone missing three days earlier. I wanted a premium steak would trade it for the hostages location. He had no choice and agreed. The prison erupted in protest. Oh, excuse me, waiter, you might want to put 30% down for yourself in the meantime. So I suppose if I don't share this with you, get the fuck up. I'm gonna cock back my right hand and I'm gonna split your whole fucking skull into. How about that? Come on over here, join me. There's plenty to go around. Enjoy. Have some positive good. What about some steak? You like steak? Hmm, big piece to go. Hey look, Durant found the missing lawyer inside the prison. I hit a fork in my hand. I struck an inmate without warning. Then I lay back on my bunk as if nothing had happened. They locked me in the dark. I felt no fear. Shouted threats at the prosecutor. I said more people would die. Durant knew what I could do. He begged the judge to keep me locked up longer. The judge laughed and said she would handle it. She picked up her phone, the phone exploded. She was gone. I was still in my cell. No one understood how the device was triggered. Durant reached a conclusion. I must have help on the outside. Could make it look like I killed remotely. They asked Me what I wanted. I answered calmly. Release me by 6 tomorrow or more people would die. They refused. They tightened security and watched me every second. Even if someone helped me, I could not reach them. Everyone stared at the clock in fear. Six hours passed. Nothing happened. They relaxed and went home. Then in a single moment, every car in the parking lot exploded. Every prosecutor was gone except Durant. They were all tied to the case from 10 years ago. They all understood Durant would be my next target.

The old man tied up and hung the female thief. Then he cut open her pants. Next, he pulled out a tube of his own semen from the refrigerator. Slowly approaching the woman, the woman seemed to realize what the old man was up to, so she struggled desperately. But the old man didn't budge, grabbing the struggling woman in one swift move. And I will give you your life. Then he aimed the syringe at her body. At that moment, the woman felt utter despair. She had originally been a thief with two highly intelligent accomplices. By chance, she Learned that the elderly hermit had a substantial pension, whose daughter had died in a car accident and received 500,000 yuan in compensation. More importantly, he was a blind man living alone. They went to the old man's house that same night. They sedated the vicious dog with sausage. Then they sneaked in through the window. But just as Paul made his way to the old man's bedroom, preparing to use a sedative, knock the old man out completely, to his surprise, the old man suddenly sat up in bed. Paul froze in fear, but the old man only turned off the TV, not noticing Paul in front of him. When Paul saw the old man lie down, he slowly placed the sedative on the floor, then quickly closed the door and left. After that, they began ransacking the place. Having searched the Entire house, they couldn't find where the US dollars were hidden, so they set their sights on a tightly shut door. Paul couldn't wait to pull out a crowbar, hoping to pry open the door in front of him. Yet for all its shabbiness, he couldn't get the wooden door open no matter what. But finally, growing desperate, Paul pulled out a gun and shot directly at the door lock. Parker couldn't understand Paul's actions, choosing to leave right away. But the next second, the old man appeared right at the door. Paul was extremely confused, but the situation was urgent. We quickly lied about being drunk and walking into the wrong house, but the old man just stepped on the doorbell he had just removed. Realizing he'd been found out, Paul raised his gun and aimed it at the old man, forcing him to hand over the money. Then the old man raised his hands and slowly walked toward Paul. In a sudden burst of speed, he lunged forward and grab the unsuspecting Paul. The next second, a gunshot rang out through the entire room and Paul fell to the ground. Anna standing nearby was completely stunned by the scene, quickly hiding in a nearby wardrobe, holding her breath and not daring to make a sound. But luckily, the old man didn't detect Anna's presence. Meanwhile, Parker heard the gunshot and came to check, unexpectedly running straight into the old man. Fortunately, the old man didn't notice him, but Was distracted by the glass shards on the floor. Realizing the thieves had broken in through the window, he immediately boarded up the window with planks. At that moment, Anna sent Parker an update on the situation. But just after sending it, the old man suddenly appeared there. Fortunately, the old man didn't notice her, but opened a hidden safe to confirm the cash hadn't been stolen and finally let out a sigh of relief. Little did he know Anna had seen everything.

And I brushed for a full 30 minutes. I didn't stop until my whole mouth was bleeding. I hated my father because he never taught me how to brush my teeth. And I hated him for letting me grow up poor. But even after I became a servant in a rich family, I still lived in a basement crawling with roaches. But once I saw how the wealthy lived, I started to resent how dark a poor person's life really is. To please my employers, I dressed up like some cartoon genie to celebrate their birthday. After the lady of the house got drunk and wild, they still wanted to go out racing, but tragedy hit fast. A man suddenly appeared on the road and was hit and killed instantly. They wanted to call the police and an ambulance. I told them to leave right away because no one is out on the roads that late and there are barely any cameras in India. So I cleaned up the blood and covered their tracks. I thought I was doing my duty as a loyal servant, but I never expected I wasn't saving them. I was ruining myself. The next day, the whole family showed up, acting unusually kind to me, even calling me family. Then they handed me a confession letter. I was stunned when I read it. I never thought they'd sell me out, not even A penny in compensation. Just like that, I became their scapegoat. I wandered the streets in a daze, feeling like I was worth less than the monkeys on the power lines. Servants of a low cast have no choices, only fate. I waited in that dark room for the police to come, but days passed and no one came. Turns out the man who died was low cast, too. No one even bothered to report it, so I didn't need to take the blame after all. I thanked the landlord excitedly, but he kicked me away. Seeing how I was treated, Anna and Jack got into a huge fight. Because she'd been educated, Anna cared about human rights and freedom. She couldn't stand the cast system anymore or this family's obsession with status. So she came to me secretly late at night, asking me to take her to the airport before flying back to America. She gave me some money, saying it was her way of making things right. When Jack found out she left, he was furious and took all his anger out on me. Trying to comfort him, I took him to eat street food and even took him to pray, telling him that if he prayed sincerely, Anna would come back. But all he got was divorce papers. I became his punching bag again. As a servant, I was always loyal to Jack. But if he no longer saw me as a human being, then I decided I had no reason to stay loyal either.

The driver, focused on helping her, didn't notice the boy standing in the middle of the road. In a panic, he swore to avoid him, but the bus lost control and crashed off the highway. By nightfall, the girl crawled up from the cliff and walked home along the road. Claire heard noise upstairs and came down to find a girl rummaging through the fridge. When the girl turned around, Claire froze. Wasn't this her daughter, Kamaya? But Kamaya had died in a car accident four years ago. Don't get mad at me. It's not my fault. Something really weird happened. Kamaya seemed unaware, her memories only stretching back an hour. Not realizing she had been dead for four years, Claire slowly moved closer to Kamaya, trying to see better. Kamaya stared blankly, confused. After eating, she went upstairs to take a shower, and Claire quietly followed. Just as she was about to open the bathroom door, Kamaya suddenly pulled it open. Can you bring me my bathroom, please? Claire's heart raced. She quickly turned and entered Kamiya's room, hurriedly putting everything back in place, afraid Kamiya would notice something was off. After handing Kamiya her bathroom, thank you, Claire quietly went downstairs. Her mind was still in turmoil, filled with doubt and anxiety, so she quickly called her ex husband. At first, he didn't believe her, thinking she was just missing Kamaya too much and losing Her mind. But when he reached the bathroom and heard the water running, he opened the door to find someone inside. What are you doing? Get out! Both of them stood there stunned, unable to explain what was happening. When Peter got home, Claire immediately told him that Kamiya had returned. Peter was stunned, looking at her ex husband with a mixture of emotions he couldn't express. Claire introduced Peter as a doctor and he wanted to ask about the accident, but Kamiya couldn't remember anything. She said she had no recollection of that time and woke up with no idea where she was. Kamaya said she was tired and asked him to leave. Later that night, Rena came home and suddenly heard knocking from the wall. She stopped and listened closely, and then heard two more knocks, making her jump. She carefully approached and pressed her ear against the wall, responding with two knocks. Soon she heard an echo from the other side. Just then, Rena's door opened and she saw Kamaya, causing her to stumble back in shock. Kamaya seemed confused too, feeling that the girl in front of her looked too much like her deceased sister. Rena couldn't understand it. She was the twin sister, so why had Kamaya suddenly grown so much? But this was just the beginning of the strange events.

There was the original flight itinerary, time stamped 8:00am sent to me two months ago. Then a corrected version showing 10:00am sent from my mother's email the day before departure. She'd literally edited the confirmation and resent it. I opened my banking app. Cancel automatic transfer to parents account, cancel daycare payments for Emily's son, cancel Netflix and Spotify subscriptions under my name. Report Emily's card charges as unauthorized. How about six flags this weekend, I asked Olivia. Her eyes lit up. Really? Really? My phone started vibrating. Mom, Dad, Emily. I didn't answer. By evening, my family chat exploded. Mom, Jake, there's a problem with this month's transfer. Dad, call me. It's urgent. Emily, the daycare said the payment didn't go through. What are you doing? I typed one message. I'm done being your ATM. Emily called screaming, you're punishing my son over your issues. I'm not responsible for your child's expenses. You've been doing it for years. That was my choice. Now I'm choosing to stop. My father called next. Jake, listen, you can't abandon your family like this. Funny, you abandoned me at an airport with my daughter. That was a misunderstanding. No, it was a choice. Just like this is mine. Silence. Don't ever call us again, he finally said. Best thing you've ever said to me. Two days later, my mother was waiting outside my apartment. My father stood beside her, arms crossed. We need to talk, she said. We have nothing to talk about. We can't pay the mortgage, my father admitted. I laughed. Where were you when my wife died? When I worked until dawn, then woke up three hours later to take care of Olivia alone when I was drowning. Silence. Family doesn't use their children as ATMs. I said, sell the new car. You don't need it. I shut the door. A week later, Olivia and I were at the airport again. This time, no one was leaving us behind. As we boarded the plane, Olivia grabbed my face with her tiny hands. I love you, daddy. My throat tightened. I love you, too, sweetheart. We took off, leaving my family behind in the city in the past, in the life I'd finally outgrown. For the first time in years, I was free.

Where are you? I asked from the airport. Oh, sweetheart, we're already at the hotel, she replied. The departure board at Dallas Fort Worth said closed. My eight year old daughter Olivia squeezed my hand. Her unicorn backpacks flipping off one shoulder. Dad, why won't they let us on the plane? Her voice cracked. I called my mother. Waves crashing in the background, laughter, music. Where are you? I asked, already knowing, oh, we just arrived at the hotel. Such a shame you didn't make it this morning. You told me the flight was at 10. A pause, then a chuckle. Sweetheart, you must have misunderstood. We left at 8. I hadn't misunderstood. I pulled up the family WhatsApp. There they were. My parents, my sister Emily, her son playing in the sand laughing. Mom, are you telling me you left me out of the trip I paid $7,500 for? She sighed. Don't be dramatic, Jake, Olivia whispered. Dad, did they leave us because they don't love us? That's when something inside me turned to ice. I scrolled through our message history. One month ago, don't worry, we'll handle everything. Just send the money. Two weeks ago, don't forget Olivia's details for the tickets. You already have them. Oh, right. Haha. 3 days ago. What time is the flight? 10:00am. Then I found something else, a deleted message I'd never noticed before. Emily to mom, did You change his flight confirmation email. He checks everything. Mom's reply already done. He'll never know they hadn't just lied, they'd actively sabotaged me. At a diner near the airport, I kept digging. My banking app showed something I'd missed. Emily had been using my credit card for emergencies without asking. 24 hundred dollars in charges over three months, designer purses, restaurant bills, a weekend spa trip. Then I saw it, a hotel booking in Miami, five rooms. They booked my room, too, then cancelled it three days before departure. The refund went to my mother's account. I looked at Olivia stirring her hot chocolate and a memory hit me. Last year when my wife Rachel died, I'd asked my parents to watch Olivia during the funeral. They said they couldn't. Emily had a prior engagement. The engagement was a Vegas trip. I saw the photos later.

He opened his mouth three times before words finally came out. I didn't know. I swear I didn't know. Nobody cared. Phones were already out, people searching. Someone found the article in under a minute. It's real. His dad's name is right here. Vehicular manslaughter. The victim was Darnell. My brother's name echoed through the cafeteria, said by a stranger, read off a screen. I felt my chest tighten. Someone shoved their phone in Connor's face. Your dad killed his brother and you've been bullying him for two years. Connor pushed the phone away. I didn't know. How was I supposed to know? You knew your dad killed someone, a girl shouted from the back. The crowd was turning fast. Same people who laughed at me every day were now looking at Connor like he was the monster. He was surrounded, alone, exactly how I'd felt for two years. I pushed through the crowd. Everyone went quiet. They thought this was it, the fight everyone had been waiting for, two years of pain about to explode. I stopped in front of Connor. He looked at me, terrified, waiting for the hit. I didn't raise my fist. I just spoke. I never blamed you. Your dad made his choice, not you. Connor blinked, tears spilling over. I could have hurt you every single day, but I didn't because you're not your father. His face crumbled. The whole cafeteria watched the toughest kid in school break down crying. I didn't stick around. I turned and walked out the doors. The crowd split to let me through. Nobody said a word. I didn't go back to class that day. Didn't need to. Connor stopped bullying after that. Not just me, everyone. We don't talk, probably never will. But there's something there now, an understanding. I visited Darnell that weekend, sat with him for a while, told him what happened, told him I didn't throw a punch even when I wanted to. The wind picked up. Felt like he heard me.

Tessa made me an entire Pinterest board of actually cute names that aren't social suicide. Derek's aunt sent us a handwritten letter about how her friend's daughter was named prudence and struggled with it her entire childhood. My favorite was when Gloria ran into Derek at the grocery store and asked if I was okay mentally because pregnancy can cause unusual decision making. The best part was watching them try to convince themselves at a family dinner. I heard Derek's stepmom telling someone, Inglebert is very European. It could work. She sounded like she was trying to convince herself not to call child services. Derek was having the absolute time of his life. He'd randomly bring it up. Like, I saw the cutest little bow tie for Percival at the store today just to watch people's faces fall. Finally, at 39 weeks, we did one last family dinner. Everyone showed up like They were attending a funeral. Derek pulled out his phone to show the ultrasound and then goes, so we'd like to officially introduce everyone to our daughter, Mildred Prudence. I watched my mom's face drain of all color.

First message in 13 years. Hey, can we talk? I want to apologize. I ignored him. He kept texting. Then Dad's losing it. I think he's gonna do something crazy. I saw my opening. Pop ran into Dad's friend. Said Dad's been obsessing over who lied to him about something important. Kept mentioning the cards. Garrett panicked. Typing dots appeared and disappeared for two minutes. Then. Okay, look, that was me. I took the cards to sell them. Needed cash. Sold, too. But the 67 Mantle got damaged. I panicked and blamed you because you know how dad gets. But here's the thing. Dad's been psycho about this for years. He's the real problem. If we both talk to him together, maybe he'll let it go. Can you help me out here? I screenshot everything, sent it to dad, then I put my phone away. Two hours later, Garrett sent 15 messages. You sent it to him, didn't you? You piece of garbage. I trusted you. Dad called a family meeting. When I walked in, he had Garrett's confession on his laptop screen. Want to explain this? Dad's voice Was ice. Garrett tried lying. Dad slapped him across the face so hard, the sound echoed. You watched me throw out the wrong kid and let it happen. Dad turned to Kendra. And you backed his story for 13 years. Then he looked at me. I'm sorry I threw out the wrong kid. I didn't respond. Just stood there. You're both out. Dad told them out of my house, out of my life, out of my will. Go rebuild from nothing like he did. Garrett looked at me like I'd save him. I stared back, said nothing. They all tried crawling back. Showed up at my door. My work sent guilt trip texts. I ignored every single one. Mom mailed a Thanksgiving photo with an empty chair where I used to sit. We miss you. There's always a place for you here. I trashed it. They had 13 years to be family. They passed. Now they get the version of me that doesn't care.

I kept grinding, lived cheap, expanded the business. Regional contracts, solid reputation. The debt hit zero the month after my 23rd birthday. Six years of payments done. I started investing. Bought a duplex, fixed it up. At 25, I found a house on two acres and wrote a check. No mortgage. Then the invitation arrived. Dad's retirement party. Six years of zero contact and suddenly they wanted me there. Against every instinct, I went. The party was too expensive for a factory worker. I overheard conversations. Now that Vincent's back, Leonard's hoping for some help. Kids done well for himself. Four weeks later, a courier delivered papers. They were suing me for $150,000, plus 35% ownership of my company. Claiming my success was built on early family support. The retirement party was a setup. Gathering information before attacking through discovery, we found emails going back two years. They've been monitoring my business. Adrian had been messaging my clients, pretending to be a potential customer. Someone tried accessing my bank accounts using security questions only family would know. During depositions, their case collapsed. Asked about support they provided, dad claimed letting me use the basement was a significant contribution. After eight months, the judge dismissed the case entirely. Called their claims demonstrably false and potentially fraudulent. Ordered them to pay my legal fees. Enough to force them to sell their house. Outside the courthouse, Adrian approached me. We're family. Family doesn't commit identity theft. You're Really going to let them lose their house? They did this to themselves. But they weren't done. Adrian got hired by my biggest competitor and started calling my clients, using lawsuit discovery information to poach my business. His gambit failed. The business community spread word about his tactics. Clients became more loyal. His company fired him after six weeks. Two weeks later, an anonymous complaint hit the state licensing board alleging unsafe practices. Details only family would know. Dismissed as baseless within two weeks, by 30, I had 200+ clients across five states. I'd made my cousin Felix a partner, bought our building, got engaged. I'd tried reaching out once, wanting to reconcile. I told the messenger, not interested. Some bridges once burned should stay ash. They had 16 years to be family. They chose exploitation. Now they get nothing.

Then my parents sued me for taking the life my brother deserved and tried to sabotage what I built. I fought back and made sure they regret it. Growing up in a dying Ohio factory town, I Learned early that my family had two standards. One for my golden child, brother Adrian, and one for me. The accident. At 14, I fixed our neighbor's broken point of sale system. Word spread. Within months, I was making $400 a week repairing outdated equipment for small businesses. My parents reaction? Mom took half my earnings. Need to contribute to the household. I was 15. Meanwhile, Adrian got a new laptop, gas money, football equipment, all without question. My business was just a phase. By 16, Dad sat me down. Now that you're earning real money, you need to pay rent. $400 a month for a bedroom and a house they already owned. The pattern became clear. The more I made, the more they took. Adrian needs college books. That's coming from Vincent. Car needs tires. Vincent's got it covered. Then at 17, credit card statements arrived in my name. Three cards, all maxed out. $28,000 of debt I never authorized. I cornered them in the living room. Mom didn't even try to deny it. Adrian needed a car, and we needed to fix the roof. Your business gave us good credit. You stole my identity. Dad barely looked up. Don't be dramatic. It's family money. Anyway, I've been paying you $400 a month, and now you'll pay more. Your contribution to your brother's future. That night, Adrian walked past my room and smirked. Thanks for the car, little bro. I called a lawyer. She laid out my options. Press criminal charges or pursue legal emancipation. I couldn't send them to jail, but emancipation would cut their control forever. I documented everything. Unauthorized credit cards, bank statements showing income since 15. Recordings of them discussing using my earnings, every dollar I contributed. The judge reviewed the evidence and didn't hold back. The court clearly sees financial exploitation granted. At 17, I moved into a garage apartment, registered my business, officially opened accounts they couldn't touch. Reality hit hard. Almost every dollar went to minimum payments.

Keep your eyes forward no matter what you see or hear. For the next 50 minutes, do that and you pass. Leave your seat for any reason. You fail. Someone laughed. That's it. That's it. This was too easy. Mr Samuels hit play on his laptop. A horror clip started on the projector. Jump scares, dreaming Gore. Some people flinched. A few laughed nervously. Eyes forward, he reminded us. And the classroom door opened. A girl walked in, Sophie. She transferred in a few months ago, quiet, kept to herself, missed class a lot. You're late, Mr Samuel said. I'm sorry. My mom's car. I don't care about your excuses. I never have. His voice was different now, cold. Do you know what your problem is, Sophie? He said that completely unprompted. You think if you look sad enough, I will let you get away with not coming to class. Sophie's voice was small. That's not true. I've seen your transcripts, Samuels cut her off. These and F's everywhere. You're lazy, but boohoo, you cut yourself last year, so you expect the world to feel sorry for you? A kid named Jake leaned back in. His chair and whispered to his friend, dude, easiest a ever. We literally just have to watch. Sophie swallowed. I try really hard. You try really hard. Mr Samuels laughed. Is that what you tell your mother when she comes home exhausted from working 60 hour weeks because of you, Mr Samuels? Come on, Billy said from his seat. This is messed up. Then leave Billy doors right there. Of course you'll fail. Billy shifted in his seat, look down at his desk. Stayed. Sophie's eyes were wet. Now please stop. Stop. What? The truth that your father walked out when you were 12 because of you. Stop, Sophie begged. Please stop. You know what your mother told the school counselor last month? Samuels continued. She said she wishes she never had you. She wouldn't say that she did. I've seen the report. Jake nudged his friend again. Bro, she's actually crying. This is wild. No. Sophie's voice was barely a whisper. No, no, no. Brianna. The girl who sat front row every day and never missed an assignment kept her eyes locked straight ahead, hands folded, face blank, following the rules perfectly. You're a burden, Sophie, to your mother, to your brother, to everyone. Sophie backed into the wall. You're worthless. Completely worthless. She slid down to the floor, but Mr Samuels kept going. He walked over and started looming over her. He talked.

A B+ that I would have been proud of when I was his age. Brandon kept saying he would try harder, that he would study more, that he was sorry for being disappointing. When Nina finally left his room, I went in to check on Brandon. He was curled up in bed, still crying. Quietly sat down next to him and told him I was proud of him, that a B+ was a great grade, and that he wasn't disappointing anyone, but the damage was already done. He just looked at me with these sad eyes and asked if I thought he was stupid, too. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about all the times Nina had made comments about Brandon needing to do better, about how other kids his age were reading at higher levels or scoring better on tests. I realized this probably wasn't the first time she'd said things like this to him. The next morning, I called the restaurant and canceled the Mother's Day reservation. I called all the family members and friends who were supposed to come and told them the Celebration was off. I even canceled the photographer. When Nina asked me what was wrong, I told her exactly what I'd heard her say to Brandon. She got defensive immediately, saying she was just motivating him to do better and that I was being too sensitive. She claimed that pushing kids to excel was what good parents do. I told her that calling our eight year old son lazy and stupid wasn't motivation, it was emotional abuse. I said that if she thought it was okay to talk to Brandon like that, then she didn't deserve to be celebrated as a mother. Nina completely lost it. She started screaming about how I'd ruined her special day and embarrassed her in front of everyone. She said I was undermining her parenting and that Brandon needed tough love to succeed in life. But here's the thing that really got me. She never once apologized for what she said to Brandon. She never acknowledged that her words might have hurt him. She was only upset about the canceled Celebration.

So last month, I spent weeks planning this huge Mother's Day thing for my wife, Nina. I'm talking about renting out this private dining room at her favorite restaurant, inviting all her friends and family, hiring a photographer, the whole nine yards. I even took time off work to coordinate everything because I wanted it to be perfect. Nina has always been kind of intense about parenting. She reads all these books about raising successful kids and has these really high expectations for our eight year old son, Brandon. Sometimes I think she pushes him too hard. She always says she just wants him to reach his potential. The week before Mother's Day, Brandon came home from school looking upset. He's usually this happy kid who bounces around telling me about his day, but that afternoon, he just went straight to his room. When I asked him what was wrong, he said he didn't want to talk about it. Later that night, I heard Nina talking to Brandon in his room. I was walking past to grab something from our bedroom when I stopped outside his door. What I heard made my blood run cold. Brandon was crying, telling her he was sorry about getting a B+ on his math test. That's when Nina said the words that still make me sick to think about. She told him that maybe if he Wasn't so lazy and stupid he wouldn't disappoint everyone around him. Then she said that smart kids don't make excuses, they just do better. My eight year old son was sobbing, apologizing for not being good enough. Nina just kept going, telling him that she was embarrassed to be his mother when he brought home grades like that. She said all his friends parents probably thought she was a bad mom because she couldn't even raise a kid who could get straight A's. I stood there frozen, listening to my wife tear down our little boy's self esteem.

Ground breaking stuff. My interpreter starts noticing my coworker following us everywhere, to the bathroom, to the parking lot, to the coffee shop across the street. She's like a detective but with zero skills. My interpreter signs. I laugh, but my stomach feels like it's full of rocks. Then my coworker gets physical. I'm heading down the stairwell when she appears behind me and claps her hands next to my ear. I don't hear it, but I feel the air shift and her hand coming near my face. Out of the corner of my eye, I startle, grabbing the railing as my foot slips. I catch myself one step from tumbling down concrete stairs. She's standing there with her phone out recording. Gotcha, she says. I read her lips perfectly. My whole body is shaking, but I don't give her a reaction. I walk away. That night, I can't sleep. I keep seeing those stairs, feeling my foot slip. She could have killed me. The next morning, I walk into the HR rep's office with a folder of my own. Every incident dated, every witness listed, every photo and video my interpreter secretly took. I request a formal investigation and a security footage review. My co worker wants evidence. I'll give her evidence. Three months later, HR calls a meeting. My co worker walks in like she's about to accept an award, clutching her folder of proof. She spreads photos and videos across the table, narrating each one with the enthusiasm of a true crime podcaster. This proves she can hear, she concludes, crossing her arms triumphantly. The HR rep nods slowly, then looks directly at her and says, this meeting isn't about her. This is about you and your intolerable behaviour. He pulled up security footage on the conference room screen, months of it. They made a montage of my coworker dropping things behind me, filming me without consent, following me and my interpreter through the building, digging through my desk while I was in the bathroom. The stairwell incident has three angles, including the moment she almost sent me to the hospital. I t also flagged that you accessed confidential medical accommodation files. The HR rep says calmly, that's illegal, a federal violation. Actually, I watched my co workers confidence leave her body like a soul exiting in a cartoon. The HR rep continues, we also received 3 formal complaints from other employees with disabilities. The HR rep closes the folder. Your employment is terminated effective immediately. Security will escort you out. Our legal team will be in contact regarding the privacy violations. She kept saying I was just trying to help as security let her pass my desk. I didn't respond to that either.

She proved something just not what she expected. I've been deaf since I was four, which means I've had roughly 23 years of people deciding my disability is their personal mystery to solve. I'm at my desk three weeks into this new job while I watch as my coworker storms into HR with the confidence of some, someone who just cracked a cold case. She marches back out 20 minutes later, stops at my desk and announces loud enough for the whole floor to hear. I know what you're doing. My interpreter signs it to me, her face carefully blank. You responded when I dropped my coffee mug yesterday, my coworker continues, crossing her arms. You're faking being deaf or special treatment, the accommodations, the flexible hours, all of it. Just so you know, I reported you. She smiles like she's won something. I stare at her, my heart pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. If HR leaves her, I lose my accommodations. I could lose this job entirely. I've fought for years to get employers to take my needs seriously and this woman just lit a match under everything. My hands are shaking under my desk, but I keep my face neutral. I've Learned that showing fear is like leading in shark infested waters. The next few weeks, my coworker transforms into a scientist, except her hypothesis is stupid and her methods Are unhinged. She starts dropping things behind me like she's conducting experiments. Staplers finders. Once a pop potted plant that does not survive the fall. I feel the vibration sometimes with the potted plant. A chunk of the vase hit my shoe, so I turned to see what crashed. And she scribbles in a little notebook like she just discovered gravity. Then she recruits allies. Suddenly, half the office watches me like I'm a zoo exhibit. Someone plays a loud video behind me during lunch. I don't hear it, obviously, but I see other heads turning and making disgusted faces. So I know exactly what's happening. My face burns. I want to disappear into the floor, but instead I take a bite of my sandwich and stare straight ahead. I refuse to give them the show they want. HR opens a formal investigation based on her second complaint. She submitted video evidence of me turning around when she called my name across the room. It doesn't matter that you can clearly see my.

I asked what was wrong, and he said we needed to talk. I turned off the stove. He told me he'd been doing a lot of thinking, that we'd grown apart, that he didn't feel the same way anymore. I. I asked him if there was someone else, and he got quiet. Then he admitted it. Said he had feelings for ash. Said they'd gotten close again, and he realized she was who he wanted to be with. I just stared at him. Two years, and he was leaving me for someone he hadn't seen in five years. Until six. Months ago. I asked if they'd done anything, and he swore they hadn't. Said he wouldn't do that to me. Like breaking up with me for her was somehow more respectful. I told him to get out. He tried to say something about still caring about me, but I pointed at the door. He left. Took his stuff from my place over the next week while I was at work. So we wouldn't.

I tried to tell her. She said I was lying. She said I was trying to get attention. My phone buzzed again. I ignored it. Katie, I need to ask you something important. When I picked you up today, did you know I wasn't your dad? She nodded slowly. Why didn't you say anything? She picked up a thread on her sleeve. Wouldn't look at me, Katie. Because I prayed for someone to take me away. Her voice was barely a whisper. Every night I prayed and prayed. And then you came. And you called the wrong name. But I didn't care. She finally looked up. Her eyes were red and wet. I thought maybe god sent you. I couldn't speak. This little girl saw a stranger's mistake and decided it was her only chance to escape. Gambled everything on a man she'd never met because anyone was better than going home. My phone rang again. The school, probably the police. By now, I had two choices. Take her back and let the system figure it out. Or believe a six year old that no one else believed. I looked at the bruises on her arm, at the fear in her eyes. At this child who trusted me with her life. I picked up the phone, dialed 9 1 1. Two hours later, my living room was full of strangers. Police, social workers, people with clipboards asking questions. Katie sat on my couch the whole Time. She didn't cry anymore. She just answered everything calmly. Like she'd been waiting forever to finally tell the truth. They found Brady at a bar three blocks from Katie's apartment. He didn't even know she was gone yet. When they arrested him, he asked what he did wrong. I wasn't there, but the officer told me later. Said it took everything in him not to answer that question with his fists. Katie was placed in emergency foster care that night. I didn't see her again for two months. One Saturday morning, my doorbell rang. A woman I didn't recognize was standing on my porch. Next to her was Katie. Cleaned up, healthy, smiling. She asked to come see you. The woman said she wanted to say thank you in person. Katie looked up at me. I told you god sent you. I knelt down. She hugged me. And I understood something I hadn't before. I didn't accidentally take the wrong child that day. I took exactly the right one.

This morning, she came downstairs for breakfast and grabbed her phone. Like always, she opened the DNA app while eating cereal. I watched her scroll through it. My coffee mug was shaking in my hand.

Then they used pliers to break it into even smaller pieces. Seven or eight chunks total. My daughter said it felt really good to destroy it. She put all the pieces in her jewelry box as a reminder not to trust fake friends. But Iris kept asking every day this week, where's my necklace? I want my necklace. Finally, my daughter had enough. This morning, she put all the broken pieces in a little ziploc bag and brought them to school. At morning recess, she walked straight up to Iris in front of everyone. She opened the bag and dumped the pieces on the ground. Here's your necklace. You can have it if you like puzzles. You'll probably need glue, though. Iris's face turned bright red. She started screaming and ran to tell the teacher. Five minutes later, my daughter was in the principal's office. I looked at the principal. So let me get this straight. Iris wanted my daughter's necklace, the one we paid for, and my daughter gave it to her. He crossed his arms. She destroyed it first. It was her property. She can do whatever she wants with it. That's not the point. I pulled out my phone and showed him my order history from last year. Right there in black and White. Two necklaces paid for by me. She destroyed her own stuff. That's not vandalism. His face went red. He stared at the screen for, like, 30 seconds. Then he looked at my daughter. You're dismissed. Back to class. She grabbed her backpack and practically skipped out the door. I could hear her laughing all the way down the hallway.

When I walked into the principal's office, he was sitting in the chair grinning like she just won the lottery. That's when I knew something was up. The principal didn't even let me sit down before he started yelling. My daughter had deliberately destroyed another girl's necklace. It was vandalism. It was unacceptable. It was bullying. He went on for like 5 minutes straight without taking a breath. When he finally stopped, I looked at my kid. Your turn. She took a deep breath and started explaining. Last year she saved up 3 months of allowance to buy matching Best friend necklaces. I ordered them off this cheap website for her. They were these little half heart charms that said best and friends when you put them together. She gave 1/2 to this girl named Iris. Everything was fine until this year. Iris started acting weird. She'd tell my daughter to buy her stuff in some online game or she'd stop being her friend. she started telling other kids not to play with my daughter at lunch. My kid ended up eating alone for two weeks before I found out what was happening. Once I Knew. I told her to stop talking to Iris completely. She did. She made new friends. Everything seemed okay. But then Iris started bothering her again. Every single day she'd walk up to my daughter and demand the other half of the necklace. She wanted to give it to someone else. My daughter kept saying, no, it was her necklace. We bought both of them. Iris wouldn't stop asking every morning before class, every afternoon at lunch, give me the necklace, give me the necklace, over and over for two whole weeks. My older niece and nephew heard about this and got mad. They're both 18 and super.

And I'm terrified because she just got a DNA test for her birthday. I adopted Haley when she was 3 weeks old. Her birth mom was my coworker at the grocery store, and she knew she couldn't raise a kid at nineteen. She asked me if I wanted her baby, and I said yes immediately because I've been trying to get pregnant for six years with nothing working. The adoption was done privately through a lawyer, and everything was legal and closed. Birth mom moved to Arizona right after, and we never spoke again. I never told Haley because she was mine from day one. I was there for her first word. First steps first everything. My husband died when she was four, so it's been just us two ever since. Why would I tell her and risk her thinking I'm not really her mom? She's 17 now, and we're close. She tells me everything. Then two weeks ago, my parents decided to give her one of those DNA ancestry kits for her birthday. They thought it would be fun, since our family is supposedly part Irish and part German. I stood there holding the wrapped box, watching Haley rip off the paper, and I felt my stomach drop to the floor. She was so excited. She kept saying how cool it would be to see where she came from. I tried to talk her out of it. I said, those Tests aren't accurate and they sell your information to insurance companies. She just laughed and said I was being paranoid. She spit in the tube that same night and mailed it off the next morning before school. The kit said results take two to four weeks. That was 13 days ago. I've barely slept since. Every time my phone buzzes, I think it's going to be her asking why our DNA doesn't match. Every time she looks at her phone I wonder if the email came through.

When I returned, everyone looked at me like they knew something I didn't. I noticed it the second I walked through the front doors. Conversation stopped. People stared. A group of girls whispered, and one of them actually laughed. I told myself I was being paranoid. Maybe I still looked sick. I found my best friend, Adam, by his locker. Yo, what's up? He looked at me for half a second, then closed his locker and walked away. Didn't say a word. I stood there confused. We've been friends since middle school. I texted him. No reply. I went to find my girlfriend, Alicia. She was always by the vending machines before first period. She wasn't there. I found her in the hallway near her class. The second she saw me, her face changed. Disgust, hurt. She turned and walked the other direction. I called her name. She didn't stop. I checked my phone. She blocked me. Everyone I passed either avoided eye contact or stared too long. Something happened while I was gone. Something bad. And I was the only person who didn't know what it was. I spent the whole day trying to get answers. No one would talk to me. In third period, a guy I barely knew leaned over and said, you're sick, bro. Actually sick. Then turned back around. In the hallway, a girl bumped into me on purpose and called me disgusting. By lunch, I was losing my mind. I sat alone at a table in the corner, watched my friends sit on the other side of the cafeteria. Watched Alicia walk right past me without a glance. After school, I waited by Adam's car. He had to talk to me. Eventually, he saw me and stopped. Move! Not until you tell me what's going on. He looked around, made sure no one was watching. There's a video of you with some freshman girl. Everyone seen it. My heart stopped. What video? What freshman girl? Don't play dumb. It's everywhere. Adam, I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been in bed for a week. He studied my face for a long moment, then pulled out his phone. You really don't know? He showed me the screen. A video. Me in a bedroom I'd never been in with a girl I'd never met, doing something I never did. But it was my face, my voice. That's not me. It looks exactly like you. It's not me. I swear. Someone made this. Adam stared at the video, then at me. If that's true, you need to figure out who, because right now, the whole school thinks you're an EDP. I spent the next two days digging. Nobody wanted to help the guy everyone thought was an EDP. Finally, I found a kid in my computer science class who knew how to trace things.

Then he traced the original post anonymous account created three days before I got sick. But here's the thing, the account was made using the school Wi-Fi. Whoever did this was in the building. He pulled the metadata, narrowed down the time stamp, cross referenced it with who had access to the computer lab that day. One name came up. I didn't want to believe it. Adam, my best friend since sixth grade. I felt sick all over again. The next day I walked into the cafeteria at lunch and Adam sitting with my friends, the friends who wouldn't look at me anymore. I walked straight up to the table. Everyone went quiet. Why'd you do it? Adam looked up. What are you talking about? I showed him my phone, the metadata, the time stamp, the IP address traced back to his school account. You made the video. You posted it while I was home sick. You destroyed my life. His face went white. That's not, you can't prove. I just did. The whole cafeteria was watching. Now Adam stood up, looked around at everyone staring. You had everything, he said. His voice cracked. Alicia, the starting spot, the scholarship. You had everything and you didn't even appreciate it. I stared at my best friend, the person I trusted more than anyone. So you made a fake video to take it? All away. He didn't answer. He didn't have to. Everyone heard him. Everyone saw the truth. Adam grabbed his bag and walked out. No one followed him. Adam got expelled. Two days later, the police got involved. Turns out creating deep fakes of minors is a felony. The girl in the video didn't exist. Adam generated her face, too. But that didn't make the charges any lighter. Alicia apologized. So did my other friends. I forgave some of them, not all. 6 years of friendship. And Adam threw it away because he couldn't handle being second. I Learned something that week. It only takes one lie to destroy everything.

Before I called the police, my dad said, I'm not leaving without seeing my kids. Then I'm calling the cops. He started dialing. I back toward the door, my hands up, fine, I'm leaving. So I left. I got in my car and my phone buzzed a text from an unknown number. It was a video. It showed Eva in her bedroom. She had makeup in her hand. She carefully applied it to her upper arm and the exact pattern of the bruises I'd seen in the photos. She rubbed it, blended it, made it look like finger marks. Another text came through from the same number. Thought you should see this. Found it on Eva's computer when I was installing parental controls. It was Miguel, the it guy from my office. Your daughter accidentally uploaded this to the cloud when backing up her phone. The police pulled up. I got out of my car and walked toward the officers. Even with the video, even with proof that she'd take the bruises, the damage was done. The officer approached me. Sir, we got a call about a domestic disturbance. I held up my phone showing him the video. My daughter, she faked this whole thing. He watched the video. I'll need to take a copy of that, he said. But as I watched my parents come out of the house, Eva and Taylor close behind them, I knew the truth. It didn't matter what the Video showed it didn't matter that I was innocent because my 15 year old daughter had just taught me something I'd never forget. The accusation is the pun. And even when the truth came out, there would always be doubt, always that tiny voice asking what if? This was never about bruises or abuse. This was about a teenage girl who'd figured out the most powerful weapon in the world, the accusation itself. My father approached me. I have video evidence. I and quietly holding up my phone. Eva faked the bruises. She made the whole thing up. He looked at the phone and I saw a doubt flicker in his eyes, fear that he'd made a terrible mistake. We'll sort this out, he said, finally, but until we do, the kids stay with us. I watch them drive away. My phone buzzed, a text from Taylor. I'm sorry, Dad. Eva showed me the makeup after she made me lie. Said if I didn't back her up, she'd tell everyone I was the one who hurt her. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I texted Taylor back, it's okay, buddy. It's not your fault. But it wasn't okay. Nothing about this was okay.

I just roll my eyes and sign the paperwork while he sits in the plastic chair double tapping through Instagram, acting like wrapping my car around a Mercedes is just another Tuesday. The cop doesn't even need to ask my name anymore. He tries not to judge, but his eyes say what they always say. Why do you keep bailing him out? Once we get outside, I stand there waiting for an apology, an explanation, anything. But I got nothing. Same song, 19th year of the same damn chorus. Everything is always my fault. The scraped knees when he was 5, the bad grades in middle school, the shoplifting at 14 that his mother blamed on my toxic masculinity. When I threw him a 16th birthday party and spent $800 I didn't have, he spent the whole time telling his friends how much better his mom's party was last week. I basically threw him a little kids party because I didn't know what teenagers actually wanted, and his mother swallowed every lie like gospel truth. The gymnastics classes I paid for 60 bucks twice a week that I scraped together working extra shifts at the insurance office. But apparently I was sabotaging his future because I wouldn't shell out 12 a month for some Olympic training center where kids have personal coaches and Custom leotards. She'd forward me his complaints with this object line. This is what you've done to him. The therapist. I pay 120 an hour to watch him scroll Instagram. My son tells her I'm emotionally abusive. She suggests I take parenting classes. But I keep trying because I keep thinking next year will be different, that he'll grow out of it, that one day he'll see I've been trying all along until today. I don't bother saying anything and head straight to the the car. The whole drive home is silent except for his phone. Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok. Every 30 seconds, another ping like nothing happened. When we reach the driveway, he finally speaks, but I almost wish he hadn't. how long until you get the insurance money? He asks without looking up. I still need rides to work this week. Mom can't do mornings. My hands tighten on the steering wheel. He wants to know when he gets his transportation back. You need a ride? Yeah. He glances at me like I'm being slow. I can't exactly walk. You just stole my car and totaled it. He rolls his eyes and goes back to his phone. It was an accident, dad. That's literally what insurance is for. And just like that, I'm done. 19 years of trying to be the father he needed, and he thinks I'm the villain. Anyway, get out of the car. What? He looks up, confused. Pack your stuff. You're going to Your mother's? His eyes widen. You're kicking me out over this? Yes. I made one mistake. Get out! I walk toward the house without another word. Behind me, his car door slam so hard the frame shakes. Inside, I sit on the couch and listen to him upstairs. Drawers slamming, closet doors banging. The performance of someone who wants me to hear how angry he is. 20 minutes later, he comes.

Don't you dare sit there and act normal. We need to talk now! Everyone at the Thanksgiving table froze. My mother, my younger sister, Blair, and my two teenage kids, Eva and Taylor. All staring at me like I pulled out a weapon. Dad's face was red, his jaw clenched. And suddenly I realized this dinner was about to go very, very wrong. We went to the other room. You hit her, dad said. His voice was shaking. Don't even try to deny it. Hit who? I asked Jen, genuinely confused. Eva. Your daughter. He stepped closer, his hands balled into fists. She told your mother this morning. She said you've been hitting her. My stomach dropped. What? That's insane. I've never hit Eva. I've never hit either of my kids. She. He showed us the bruises. His voice cracked on her arms, her shoulder. She said you grabbed her, threw her against a wall when she didn't clean her room fast enough. Dad, that never happened. So my granddaughter is lying? I'm not hitting my kids, I said desperately. My mother and Blair came into the room. Eva's upstairs right now, terrified. She didn't even want to come today. But you forced her. I didn't force her. She said you threatened her. Said if she didn't act normal at dinner, there would be consequences. None of that is true. But I Could see it in their faces. The horror, the disgust, the absolute certainty that I was lying. Dad pulled out his phone. Your mother took photos of the bruises. Do you wanna see them? Do you wanna see what you did to your own daughter? Mom interrupted. She said it was Tuesday night. You two had a fight about her phone usage, and you lost your temper Tuesday night? I tried to remember. Ava and I had argued about being on her phone too much. But it hadn't been a fight. It had been a conversation. A little heated, maybe, but nothing physical. Never physical. We talked on Tuesday. I said we didn't fight, and I definitely didn't touch her. She says differently, dad said. And I believe my granddaughter. What about believing your son? I asked. Blair crossed her arms. Taylor saw it happen. He saw you grab her. Taylor! My heart stopped. Where is Taylor? I want to talk to him. He's upstairs with Eva. Blair said, this is crazy. Let me talk to my kids. No, dad said firmly. The kids are staying here tonight. You're going home. And tomorrow we're calling Child Protective Services. How could I prove I didn't do something? How could I prove that Tuesday night was just a conversation? Nothing more? Eva went to her school counselor yesterday, told her everything. They're opening an investigation. The room spun. An investigation for something I didn't do? I stood there watching my family look. At me like I was a monster. My own parents, my sister, all of them united against me. I think it

We put it at the end of the walkway, lit six candles inside. It glowed like a beacon. I put a small sign next to it. Please don't touch, in memory of Ethan. He died three days later. The funeral was packed. The whole neighborhood came. The Solomon sat in the back row. The kid wore a suit and stared at the floor. Two nights after we buried my son, I heard footsteps outside. I got to the window just in time to see the bat connect. The pumpkin exploded. Seeds and guts sprayed across the lawn. The candles scattered. The carved scene of father and son shattered into a hundred pieces. The Solomon kid was laughing. His father was filming from the sidewalk. My wife found me at 1 a m. Kneeling in the pumpkin remains, holding a piece of the carving. The father's hand still attached to the son's. She didn't say anything, just knelt beside me. The next morning, I drove to the same farm. Bought another 200 pound pumpkin. My daughter helped me carve it. Same design, same scene. Father and son holding hands. But this time, I did something different. After everyone went to sleep, I hollowed out the center and filled it with 60 pounds of concrete. Let it cure for three days. Then I sealed it up, repainted the orange skin. And placed it at the end of the walkway. From the outside, it looked exactly like before. Just A pumpkin. We waited. Eight days later, footsteps on the lawn, 2:00am. I watched from the window. The Solomon kid walked up with his bat wound up and swung as hard as he could. The sound was something I'll never forget. The bat stopped dead. His wrists snapped backward. He screamed and dropped to the ground, rolling around holding his arms. The bat had splintered into pieces. His father came running across the street, screaming that I tried to kill his son. The cops arrived 20 minutes later. Surveyed the scene, looked at the destroyed bat. Looked at my pumpkin still standing. Sir, your son smashed a pumpkin with a baseball bat. It's filled with concrete. He knew we were coming. We've been smashing his pumpkins for years. And this time he stopped. The officer raised an eyebrow. You've been doing this for years? I pulled out my phone. Four years of security footage. Every smashed pumpkin, every two a m. Attack. The officer watched the whole thing. Then he looked at the phone. Father, that pumpkin is on his property. Filling it with concrete isn't illegal. Destroying it is. They were both ordered to pay fines. The kid's wrists required surgery. His baseball scholarship vanished. The memorial wall is still up in the garage. 347 pumpkins. I added one more photo last fall. My son holding a pumpkin twice his size. The eulogy reads, Ethan was the bravest pumpkin of all. He's still glowing.

He wouldn't stop touching my arm, asking about my job, my hobbies, where I lived, what I did for fun. I told him multiple times I had a boyfriend. He asked for my number anyway. Said we could. We'll be friends. I gave him a fake one. He found me on Instagram, texted me for three straight weeks. I blocked him after he asked if my boyfriend would mind if we got coffee. She knew. She's known this entire time. She set this up six months ago, and I was too stupid to see it. I walk into the dressing room, rip off the bridesmaid dress. The zipper breaks. I Don't even care. I put my jeans back on, grab my purse, and walk out in my jeans and bra, holding the torn dress in my fist. My sister starts screaming, you just destroyed my wedding! That dress cost 340! You're paying for it! You're ruining everything! I throw it at her feet, tell her to send me the Bill, and lose my number. The brother tries to grab my arm, says we should talk about this like adults. I shove past him hard enough that he stumbles. My boyfriend's waiting in the parking, but exactly where I left him.

Then he says, so I'm guessing I'm not invited to the wedding anymore. I start laughing. Can't stop. I'm crying and laughing at the same time, and I can't breathe.

Can I just do this one thing for her? I hang up. My boyfriend asks, what? What's wrong? I tell him everything. He just stares at me for a solid 10 seconds and says, your sister's completely lost her mind. The next day, my mom calls. Extended family will talk if I'm not in the wedding party. Aunt Carol will ask questions. Grandma will be upset. It'll cause drama at Thanksgiving. I tell her I genuinely don't care what extended family think about anything. My dad calls an hour later. He's on my side, but wants me to just get through the wedding for family peace. Says my sister's always been dramatic and this will blow over. I feel like I'm going complete be insane. A week passes. My sister acts like nothing happened, sends me funny Tik Toks, asks about my work project, then casually texts saying we have a Dress fitting at two PM Saturday. I almost don't go, but my twin convinces me to at least try talking to her face to face. I show up at the bridal shop. My sister's already there with my twin and my mom.

My neighbor called the police and said I tried to murder his son. Every October, my son and I would carve pumpkins. Not one or two, but dozens. He'd sketch the faces in a notebook first. Each one different, each one named. Then we'd spend entire weekends bringing them to life. Spooky ones, silly ones, elaborate ones with scenes carved into the skin. We'd line them up along the front walkway, light candles inside each one. The whole street would slow down to look. He was 6 when the Solomon kid first smashed them. 16 years old. Baseball bat. Middle of the night, we woke up to orange carnage scattered across the lawn. Pumpkin got splattered on the driveway, seeds everywhere. Every single pumpkin destroyed. My son walked outside in his pajamas and just stood there. Didn't cry, didn't speak. Just stared at the man. I wanted to burn that kid's house down, but my wife stopped me at the door. He's watching you right now. Show him what kind of man handles this. So I walked outside and put my hand on his shoulder. You know what? Those pumpkins lived good lives. They deserve to be remembered. He looked up at. What do you mean? I walked him inside and grabbed a poster board from the closet. Every pumpkin we make from now on gets a spot on the wall. Name, photo, birthday. And when they die, we write them a Eulogy. He thought I was joking at first. I wasn't. We called it the memorial wall. Gerald, Sir Mashington the third. Princess Cordelia, Count Pumkala. Every single pumpkin got a name, a photograph and a death certificate. When the Solomon kid inevitably came swinging, the game wasn't about watching destruction. It was about honoring what we created. My son would write little eulogies in crayon. Gerald was a brave pumpkin. He had triangle eyes and a crooked smile. He lasted four days. We will miss him. We have mock funerals in the backyard. Lower pumpkin chunks into the compost bin with full ceremony. My son would give speeches. My wife would pretend to cry. It was ridiculous. It was morbid. It was ours. Four years of this. The memorial wall filled an entire garage wall. Hundreds of photos, hundreds of names. This Solomon kid would wave from his driveway the morning after each massacre. His parents never said a word. Then my son got sick. Tumor behind his eye. Inoperable. The doctors gave him until Thanksgiving. He had one request. Can we make one more pumpkin? The biggest one ever. I wanna carve it myself. We found a 200 pound giant at a farm three counties over. It took both of us to roll it into the truck. He was so weak by then. But he insisted on doing the carving himself. It took him a week. He could only work for 20 minutes at a time before he needed To rest. But he did it. A massive Jack o lantern with the most intricate face we'd ever made. A scene of a father and son holding hands.

Breaking up my marriage so I'd be desperate enough to give you whatever you wanted. His silence confirmed everything. Marcus had done his homework. Trevor's business was failed. Hannah had $30,000 in credit card debt. Mom was behind on her mortgage. We documented everything. Trevor's business irregularities, Hannah's hidden assets, Mom's refinancing issues. Sunday, I invited them to Mom's house. You try to destroy my marriage to make me desperate for money? I told them, here's what happens. You leave us alone, or Marcus files complaints with regulatory boards, credit companies. In the court, Trevor went pale. Hannah froze. Mom sank into the couch. You're blackmailing us, Trevor said. I'm setting boundaries. You wanted hardball. I sent the documentation to all three phones. You can be distant but civil, or we can be enemies. You decide. Six weeks later, Mom's in the hospital. Heart attack. At the hospital, Trevor blamed the stress on me. The best thing for her recovery is everyone respecting boundaries, I replied. When mom woke, she apologized. I was scared of losing you. I tried to control things and made everything worse. I don't know if I can forgive you yet, I said. Right now, I'm still angry. Three months later, we hosted Thanksgiving. They came with Wine and apologies. Ever admitted I should have asked for advice instead of money? Hannah confessed. I was jealous. I wanted to believe your life wasn't as good as it looked. Mom said I couldn't accept that. You're an adult with a separate life. Hannah stopped by weeks later. What I did was beyond wrong. Maybe we could try being sisters again. The kind who are careful but still care. Maybe. But it'll take time. The revenge we took wasn't flashy. We refused to be victims and protected what we built. Trust rebuilt slowly. Some wounds healed, some left scars. We were happy because we'd chosen each other and defended that choice when threatened. The greatest revenge is refusing to let other people's desperation become your emergency.

I hung up. Then last night I got a text from Noah. Hey, Aunt Cassandra. Mom's really mad at you. But honestly, I've been thinking about what you said. I actually do want to learn about money. Like how you bought your car and your apartment and stuff. Can you still teach me? I promise I'll actually listen. We met up Saturday morning. I took him to a coffee shop and we built his first budget together. He has a part time job at a movie theater making 12 hour. I showed him how to allocate his paychecks. 50% savings, 30% spending, 20% towards specific goal. His goal? That gaming chair. He did the math himself. 12 weeks of saving if he works 15 hours a week. He looked up at me and said, this is way cooler than just getting stuff handed to me. My sister in law texted yesterday. I hope you're happy. You've turned my son against his own mother. I checked Instagram this morning. She'd unfollowed me on everything. Noah just sent me his first savings update. $140 saved in two weeks.

A lot of it. Like probably three tablespoons of sugar and a generous pour of vanilla creamer. Then he made mine. Poured it black, picked it up, took a small sip. His face. Oh, my god, his face. He made this expression like he just bit into a lemon, like he was genuinely suffering. He dumped it out, made another cup, pure black again. Took another sip. Same awful face. Third cup. This time he stared at it for a few seconds before trying it. He took the smallest possible sip. His whole face scrunched up, and he set it down on the counter. He looked at it like it was his enemy. Then he nodded to himself like he'd finally gotten it right. That's when I walked in. How long have you been standing there? He asked, not even turning around. Long enough. Do you even like black coffee? He finally looked at me. His expression was somewhere between embarrassed and guilty. Not even a little bit, he admitted. I think it tastes like burnt tire water. Then why have you been drinking it for eight years? He picked up my mug and held it out to me. I'm not drinking it. You are. I just needed to know what it was supposed to taste like so I could make it perfect for. For you. I just stood there, completely frozen. Every morning, he continued, I make mine the way I actually Like it sweet, lots of cream. Then I make yours, and I taste it to make sure it's right. Usually takes me two or three tries. Sometimes four if I'm off that day. You've been doing this every single day? Well, yeah. You're always so happy when you take that first sip in the morning. You do this little satisfied, I'd sigh thing. I wanted to make sure you got that moment every day. I looked down at the mug in my hands. This coffee that I thought he just naturally knew how to make perfectly. He'd been forcing himself to taste something he absolutely hated multiple times every morning for years just to get it right for me. You could have just asked me how I like it, I said quietly. He smiled. Where's the romance in that? I kissed him and my coffee got cold. And for the first time in eight years, I didn't even care.

She actually tracks my Instagram stories to see what I buy, then send screenshots with captions like must be nice having no responsibilities or some of us have real priorities. It started small birthday gifts that got more expensive each year. Then Christmas list in July. Then random Tuesday texts. No one needs new cleats by Friday with a link and his size, not asking, telling. My brother never says anything. He just forwards her messages with sorry, you know how she is. Last month was the breaking point. She sent her 14 year old son to my apartment with a handwritten shopping list. I'm not kidding. College ruled paper. Her handwriting numbered items. Gaming chair, 400, 500 dollar range. Nike Air Max size 8.5, black, red colorway AirPods Pro, new iPhone phone. His current one is only 2 years old. Gaming headset. Noah handed it to me looking uncomfortable. Mom said you take me to the mall. I looked at this kid I genuinely love and asked, did your mom tell you what I do for work? He shrugged. Some business thing. I explained I'm a financial advisor who helps families create budgets and build savings. I told him instead of just buying everything, I teach him how to earn the money himself. His eyes actually lit up. He asked if I was serious. Thirty minutes later, my Phone exploded. My sister in law called screaming that I was traumatizing him by weaponizing capitalism against a child. She said I should just buy the stuff since I waste money on vacations and fancy dinners. Anyway, that's when I remembered something. She'd asked to borrow $3,000 last year for emergency car repairs. The text said I'd borrow. She promised to pay me back within two months. I'd seen her new Gucci bag three weeks after that conversation. So I made her an offer. I'll buy everything on that list right now if you pay back the $3,000 first. Dead silence. Then that was a gift. Family helps family. I said, no, you specifically said loan. I have the tech messages. I can read them to you if you want. She hung up. 20 minutes later, my brother called. Why are you destroying our family over money? Cassandra's crying. Noah thinks you hate him now. I asked him Point Blank, did she tell you she owes me three grand? That's different. You make way more than us, so I'm supposed to fund your lifestyle while you guys drive a newer car than me?

Every single morning since we got married, he's made me coffee, black coffee, no cream, no sugar, just the way I like it. Or at least that's what I thought. We've been together for eight years now, married for five. And every single morning, without fail, he wakes up 15 minutes before me just to have my coffee ready. When I come downstairs, it's sitting there on the counter in my favorite mug, still hot, perfectly brewed. I used to joke that it was his one talent in the kitchen. The man can barely make toast without setting off the smoke alarm. But somehow he makes the perfect cup of coffee every time. Last Tuesday, I woke up early for a work call. It was 6 a. M, which meant I beat him to the kitchen for the first time in years. I figured I'd just make my own coffee and let him sleep in for once. I went to grab the coffee grounds and noticed something weird in the trash can, an empty creamer bottle, the expensive vanilla kind that costs like $8. I stood there staring at it for a minute. We don't use creamer. I drink my coffee black. And he always said he did, too. I figured maybe he bought it for a recipe or something and threw it away. But then the next morning, there was another empty bottle in the trash, different flavor this time. Hazelnut. And the morning after that, another one, caramel. I started paying attention. Every single day there was a new empty creamer bottle in the trash some times. 2, Friday morning, I asked him about it casually like it was no big deal. Hey, babe, are you using those coffee creamers for something? He looked up from his phone and I swear I saw him tense for half a second. What? Oh, yeah. Ah, I've been trying different flavours, you know, just experimenting. But you hate flavoured coffee. You always said it's too sweet. He just shrugged. Thought I'd try something new. It was a perfectly reasonable answer, but something about it felt off. Yesterday morning I decided to test something. I set my alarm for 5:00am before his usual wake up time. When it went off, I silenced it immediately and pretended to stay asleep. At 6, catch am exactly, I heard him get up, heard his footsteps going downstairs. I waited two minutes, then quietly followed him. I stood in the hallway just out of sight from the kitchen and watched. He made two cups of coffee, both in the same size mugs. I watched.

I asked why he was telling me this and he couldn't even look at me. Because she's planning something worse for you, she told me. She's going to report you for plagiarism on your final paper. She's already written the report, she just hasn't submitted it yet. I couldn't breathe. He told me she barely reads his work and just gives him A's because he's family. Then he told me she brags about ruining students after class and pulls up the grade book to show him. He had seen my grades with his own eyes and they were marked failing before she even graded anything. Wesley knew 6 other students on financial aid that she was targeting, so we all met up. Wesley actually knew the material better than anyone. So if our answers matched his exactly, then she couldn't fail us without failing him too. He looked at all of us and said, she can't touch me, so she won't be able to touch any of you either. Final exam comes and Wesley sits in the front row while the seven of us spread out around the room. She hands out the tests and looks right at me with this little smile, good luck. My heart is pounding. The first question comes up and Wesley coughs once. So I circle a because that's the signal. He taps his pencil. So I circle C by question 30. Her head snaps toward Wesley and he coughs twice. Half the room circles B at the exact same time, and her face goes white. She stands up so fast, her chair scrapes the floor. What is going on here? Nobody answers. She walks straight to Wesley and stands over him. What are you doing? Wesley looks up at her and says the right thing. Her eyes go wide because her own nephew just turned on her in front of everyone. She looks around the room at all of us with matching answers, and her hands start shaking. If she accuses us of cheating, then she has to accuse her own family, too. Her face twists. She opens her mouth, but nothing comes out. She stands there frozen while we finish the exam in silence. Wesley smiled at me walking out. The plagiarism charge got dropped. She thought her own nephew would protect her. He didn't.

When I confronted them about it, Brooke rolled her eyes and said maybe Chloe posted them herself for attention. Madison just stood there smirking like it was all some big joke. That night, I told my wife we needed to put a lock on Chloe's door. She flipped out, saying I was being paranoid and that it would hurt Jake's feelings if we didn't trust his daughters. She said family doesn't lock doors against family, and I was overreacting to normal teenage drama. But I wasn't backing down. The next morning, I went to Home Depot and bought a doorknob with a key lock. I installed it myself while everyone was out of the house and gave Chloe the only two keys. When Jake saw it that evening, he lost his mind. He started yelling about how I was treating his daughters like criminals and how dare I make them feel unwelcome in our house. My wife was standing behind him, nodding along like I was the bad guy here. I looked him dead in the eye and said, the lock stays until you and your daughters find somewhere else to live. He asked what that was supposed to mean, and I told him exactly what I meant. His daughters have been stealing from Chloe, going through her private stuff, and now they're cyberbullying her online. The lock doesn't come Off until they're gone. My wife tried to jump in saying we never discussed kicking them out, but I was done discussing anything. I told her our 13 year old daughter shouldn't have to hide her own belongings in her own room because her teenage cousins can't respect basic boundaries. Jake started going off about how I was splitting up the family and his daughters were good kids who made mistakes. I cut him off and said, good kids don't steal money and post private photos to humiliate their younger cousin. Good kids apologize when they hurt someone instead of lying about it. The house has been tense as hell ever since. Brooke and Madison keep testing the door handle when they think no one is looking, and Jake keeps making passive aggressive comments about how some people don't understand family loyalty. My wife barely talks to me except to tell me I'm being unreasonable. But you know what? Chloe actually smiled at dinner last night for the first time in weeks. She knows her room is her safe space again and nobody can just walk in and take her stuff or invade her privacy.

So I made her star student, my accomplice. I needed Missus Holloway's class to graduate because it was the only section offered. On the first day, we had to introduce ourselves and say where we were from. When it was my turn, I mentioned I was on a scholarship and work two jobs to pay for my apartment. She looked at me and her whole face changed. I didn't realize it then, but that was the moment she marked me. She had this student named Wesley who sat in the front row and he was clearly her favorite. I found out later he was actually her nephew. She treated him like he could do no wrong and always brought up how refreshing it was to have students who came from good backgrounds. The rest of us who were on financial aid or came from working class families didn't even exist to her. I told myself I would just keep my head down and do the work because I had good grades in every other class. I figured if I earned the grade, she couldn't fail me. I was so wrong. My first paper came back with a 58, even though I spent two weeks on it and followed every single rule. I went to her office and asked what I did wrong, but she didn't even look up from her desk. Your analysis was weak. Try harder next time I asked for Specifics. And she finally lifted her head and looked at me like I was bothering her. I don't have time to explain basic concepts to students who don't put in effort. I left her office shaking and thinking, what am I even supposed to do here? I worked twice as hard on my second paper and got a 54 with one sentence at the top that said I still wasn't getting it. Then she started calling on me in class just to humiliate me. She would ask about stuff we never even covered, wait for me to sit there in silence, then sigh so loud the whole room could hear. This is exactly what I mean. Some students just don't try. Every single head in the room turned toward me and my face went so hot I wanted to disappear. Then it got worse. She started telling other students not to study with me because I would bring their grades down. People I had been friendly with stopped talking to me completely. My grade dropped to a 41 and I had never failed anything in my life. Wesley came up to me in the library and his voice was really quiet. Hey, I know what she's doing to you. He sat down.

My wife's brother Jake moved in with his two teenage daughters after his divorce last year. At first I was totally fine with it. Family helps family, and our spare bedroom was just sitting empty anyway. But within the first week I knew something was off about his girls. Brooke is 16 and Madison is 14 and they both have this weird habit of just walking into any room they want without knocking. I caught Brooke going through my daughter Chloe's dresser on day 3 and when I asked what she was doing she just shrugged and said she was looking for a phone charger. Madison got caught wearing Chloe's favorite hoodie to school and claimed she thought it was hers even though it had Chloe's name embroidered on it. My daughter Chloe is 13 and she's always been this really trusting kid who wants everyone to like her. when her cousin started taking her stuff and going through her things, she didn't want to make waves. She just quietly started moving her favorite clothes to the bottom of her dresser and hiding her jewelry in weird places. That should have been my first clue to step in, but I thought maybe they just needed time to adjust. Things got worse when I noticed Chloe's birthday money from her grandma went missing. She had $200 in an envelope in her desk drawer, and suddenly it was gone. When I asked Brooke and Madison about it, they both acted shocked and suggested maybe Chloe lost it somewhere. Jake back them up, saying his girls would never steal, and maybe we should check if Chloe spent it and forgot. But I knew my daughter. She's been saving that money for months to buy this art tablet she wanted. She wouldn't just lose track of 200 bucks. Then last week, I came home early from work and heard crying coming from Chloe's room. I found her sitting on her bed holding her phone, and when I asked what was wrong, she showed me her Instagram. Someone had posted a bunch of photos from her account to some group chat, making fun of her braces and calling her weird. The photos were ones she had never posted publicly. They were selfies she kept private on her phone. I immediately knew it had

Wasn't glaring at me like everyone else. He was watching. Waiting. And when our eyes met, he smiled. Not a friendly smile, a satisfied one. Like he was enjoying this. Fifteen years of rage hit me all at once. I started walking toward him. The crowd parted. Yakub smile faded. He started backing toward the door. It was you, I said.

He slipped out the back while everyone was still processing what just happened. Molly collapsed into a chair. Her brother stood beside her, staring at nothing. People started walking toward me. Nate, Jezebel, others I hadn't spoken to in 15 years, all of them with apologies on their faces. I didn't want to hear it. I turned and walked toward the exit, didn't look back. Jezebel caught up to me in the parking lot. Where are you going? I stopped, looked back at the building. The reunion I've been excited about for months. The friends I wanted to reconnect with. The memories I wanted to revisit. Home. I said I got what I came for. She tilted her head. What's That I opened my car door closure. I drove off before she could respond.

What happened next was basically a massacre. Mom laid into him about respect and communication and how a marriage is a partnership. She brought up examples from their failed marriage with my dad and started psychoanalyzing Jake's relationship with his mother. She even mentioned how his ex girlfriend had complained about the same stuff when they were together. Mother, which honestly I didn't even know mom knew about. Jake just sat there getting redder and redder. When mom finally finished her speech, he looked at me and said, are you serious right now? You called your mommy because we disagreed about furniture. The way he said Mommy made my stomach drop. I realized how this looked from his perspective and felt like I was gonna throw up. After mom left, Jake and I had the worst fight we'd ever had. He said he felt ambushed and humiliated. He asked if I was going to run to my mom every time we had a disagreement. He said he felt like he was married to both of us instead of just me. The worst part was he wasn't totally wrong. We ended up not talking for three days. I slept on the couch, which was ironic since that's what started this whole mess.

What happened next was basically a massacre. Mom laid into him about respect and communication and how a marriage is a partnership. She brought up examples from their failed marriage with my dad and started psychoanalyzing Jake's relationship with his mother. She even mentioned how his ex girlfriend had complained about the same stuff when they were together. Mother, which honestly I didn't even know mom knew about. Jake just sat there getting redder and redder. When mom finally finished her speech, he looked at me and said, are you serious right now? You called your mommy because we disagreed about furniture. The way he said Mommy made my stomach drop. I realized how this looked from his perspective and felt like I was gonna throw up. After mom left, Jake and I had the worst fight we'd ever had. He said he felt ambushed and humiliated. He asked if I was going to run to my mom every time we had a disagreement. He said he felt like he was married to both of us instead of just me. The worst part was he wasn't totally wrong. We ended up not talking for three days. I slept on the couch, which was ironic since that's what started this whole mess.

Small issue becomes huge. Fight becomes threat. I drove to 3 stores for your brand and gave up. Like always. You know what? I could leave you anytime. Remember that? There it was.

I could be with any of them tomorrow. Okay? You just let me go. You said you could leave anytime. I'm acknowledging that. She stomped to the bedroom, slammed the door. Usually I'd apologize within an hour. Not today. I finished the dishes, made coffee with the wrong oat milk, called my friend. Hey, Rashid, you still looking for a roommate? Valerie had been threatening to leave for two years, but she couldn't afford to. Her influencer income barely covered her car payment. I paid rent, utilities, groceries, streaming. What if I made it easy for her? Day one, Valerie emerged, expect acting the usual apology. So anything to say? Good morning. No. Apology. You could leave anytime. Remember? Day 2, I found her a studio apartment, $650 a month center the listing. What's this affordable option for when you leave? This place is a dump. It's your budget, right? You know, I can't afford my own place. And stop threatening to leave. Day 5, she made breakfast for the first time in a year. Maybe we could spend the day together. Can't helping Rashid move. Since when are you friends? Since he might need a roommate. Her face went pale. You're moving in with Rashid? Not me. But I know someone who might need a place. Someone who could leave anytime.

So my sister Tara has three kids. Three boys. And look, I love my nephews. They're good kids. But here's the thing about Tara. She thinks everybody on this planet wants photos of her children plastered on every surface of their home. Every single Christmas, birthday, any gift giving occasion, really. I get the same type of gift. Blanket with her kids faces on it, a mug with her kids faces, a mouse pad, a phone case, magnets, picture frames, calendars. You name it, she's put her children's faces on it and handed it to me wrapped in a bow. I'm not talking about small stuff, either. One year, she got me this massive tapestry blanket thing with all three of her boys on it. Like, their faces were blown up huge, and the whole thing was about six feet tall. She told me I could hang it on my wall. I just nodded and smiled and said thank you, because what else was I supposed to do? That thing went straight into my closet. Still there to this day, folded up behind some old winter coats. Another year, she got me a pillow. A giant square pillow with her middle son's face stretched across it. His face was slightly distorted from how they printed it, so he looked a little off. I put that in the closet, too. My mom kept asking me why I never displayed any of my gifts. I always just said I was still figuring out where to put everything, but honestly, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with 17 items featuring my nephew's faces. I don't have a shrine dedicated to children that aren't mine. I see them at family gatherings. That's enough. The thing is, I never said anything to Tara. I didn't want to hurt her feelings or cause drama. So every year I just accepted the gifts, thanked her, and quietly stored them away. But this year I finally snapped. We were doing Christmas Eve at my parents house because I was spending actual Christmas Day with my girlfriend's family. So we did the whole gift exchange early. Tara handed me my present first. I could tell by the shape it was a picture frame. I unwrapped it and yep, another framed photo of her kids. This time they were all dressed in matching Christmas sweaters sitting in front of a fireplace. Professionally done. She probably spent like 80 bucks on the photo shoot alone. I smiled and said thank you, same as always. But then it was my turn to give her my gift now. I should mention I have a dog named Chester.

Cost me 180 bucks. I know that sounds stupid, but it's the softest thing I've ever owned and it's got this perfect weight to it. I'm working on this stupid photosynthesis diagram when this kid plops down in the chair across from me. He's maybe 12 or 13, has down syndrome, and he's just staring at my hoodie with the biggest smile. Hi, he says. That's really nice. Oh, thanks, man, I say, trying to be polite, but also like, I got work to do. Can I have it? I look up, he's still smiling, pointing at my hoodie. Uh, sorry, dude. I'm actually wearing it right now. I laugh a little thinking he's joking, but I really like it. Can I have it, please? Now I'm uncomfortable. I can't give you my hoodie. Sorry. This woman, who I'm guessing is his mom, comes over. She's got two drinks and she sets one down in front of him. Kevin, what are you doing? Leave this person alone. He has a really cool sweater. Kevin says to her, I asked if I could have it. I'm expecting her to be like, Kevin, that's not how we ask for things or whatever. Instead she looks at me and goes, would You mind? He really seems to like it. I literally stare at her for like 5 seconds. I'm sorry, what? The hoodie? Could you give it to him? He clearly loves it. Ma'am, this cost me $180. I'm wearing it. She makes this face like I just said something rude. It's just a sweatshirt. Kevin doesn't ask for much and he has down syndrome. Surely you can spare one piece of clothing. Kevin still smiling at me, completely unaware that this is weird as hell. I'm not giving you my hoodie, I say, trying to stay calm. You're really going to say no to a special needs child? She's getting louder now. What kind of person does that? A couple people are looking over. I'm 17 years old and this grown woman is trying to make me look like garbage in front of everyone. The kind of person who paid for their own clothes, I say back. She huffs and grabs Kevin's hand. Come on, honey. Some people are just selfish. We'll find you a nice sweatshirt somewhere else. Kevin looks.

He had weeks of pain ahead, and he didn't want to live through it. Did he actually ask you, or did you decide for him? He couldn't speak clearly anymore, but I knew what he wanted. Kevin was crying now. She told me after. Said dad wanted it. Made me promise not to tell anyone. But I couldn't stop thinking about whether it was true. My mom's voice came from the doorway.

From having three more months with his family. My hands shook as I called 9 1 1. Nicole didn't try to run. Just kept saying I helped him. Like she was trying to convince herself. Nicole was charged with second degree murder, and Kevin is in therapy, working through the guilt of keeping her secret and the fog she kept him in with medication he didn't need. I'm grateful.

Tuesday afternoon, I come home early from work because I forgot my laptop. There's a silver Subaru in my driveway I don't recognize. I walk in and Stephanie's introducing this woman named Savannah to our daughter via Facetime. Haley's crying happy tears saying she's so glad mom finally found someone who makes her happy. Savannah's moving into our guest room, not our house, the house I'm still paying the mortgage on, just typically into one of our four bedrooms. Like I'm supposed to be fine with this new roommate situation. I asked Stephanie if she was serious. She said Savannah doesn't have anywhere else to go right now and it's not like we're using that room anyway. I'm staying. At a La Quinta Inn near the airport, it smells like cigarettes and the Wi-Fi barely works. Haley texted me this morning asking when I'm coming home because this is ridiculous and embarrassing. She has friends asking why her dad moved out. The second her mom came out, Connor sent me a Bill split request on Venmo for his textbooks with the note, since you're not contributing to the household anymore, I paid for his entire college tuition, all four years up front. My wife moved her girlfriend into my house six days after ending our marriage at Olive Garden.

Just in case he needs a sign. I stood there in our kitchen, her phone in my hand, and I almost cried. She'd been sending me messages through my own Spotify account every morning for weeks, hoping I'd notice, hoping I'd understand. I put her phone back exactly where I found it. That night at dinner, she asked me what song I'd been listening to that morning before she kicked me off. I told her I couldn't remember. She smiled and said, well, I was listening to everywhere by Fleetwood Mac. You know that one? I nodded. I wanna be with you everywhere. Exactly, she said, not breaking eye contact. The next morning, I watched my Spotify even more carefully. She played Forever Like that by Ben writer. Thursday, Grow old with you from The Wedding Singer. Friday, I choose you by Sarah Bareilles. Saturday morning. Yesterday, she played the luckiest by Ben Folds. Each one felt like a nudge, like she was saying, I'm here. I'm ready whenever you are. I couldn't wait until next Saturday. This morning, Monday, when my music cut out at 7:00am, I didn't just open Spotify to see what she was playing. I opened it, waited for her song to start, Can't Help Falling in love by Elvis. And then I did something I'd never done before. I added one song to her queue. Marry you by Bruno Mars. Then I turned off my computer monitor and waited. My Phone buzz. Thirty seconds later, a text from her. Are you serious right now? Another buzz. Is this your way of asking another? Because if it is, you better come home. I grabbed my keys, didn't log out, didn't tell my boss. Just ran. When I got home twenty minutes later, she was standing in the living room in her pajamas, mascara running down her face, holding her phone. The Google Home was still playing marry you. I got down on one knee right there. No park, no photographer, no perfectly planned moment. Just us and Spotify. And four years of mornings where she kicked me off my account. She said yes before I even got the ring out of my pocket. We're getting married in the park next Saturday. Anyway, the photographer's still booked. But this morning, this was the real proposal. The one she'd been asking for in every song.

Finally he asked what happened. I told him. He was quiet for another minute, then said, sounds like you were defending someone you love, and that's not something to be ashamed of, even if you went about it wrong. That weekend he installed a heavy bag in the garage and taught me how to throw a proper punch. And three hours showing me footwork. He does weird stuff that annoys me. Sometimes he hugs me without asking, comes into my room without knocking, snores like a chainsaw. Vacuums at two in the morning when he can't sleep. Won't let me watch anything over PG thirteen unless he screams at first. But he also keeps orange juice in the fridge because I mentioned I like it once. Makes spaghetti every Thursday because it's my favourite. Bought me a giant box of Legos after he caught me playing with my uncle's old set. The expensive kind too, like $80. Two weeks ago I got the flu. Nothing serious, just felt like garbage. It was my night to do dishes but Gramps wouldn't let me. Kept bringing me water every hour, asking if I needed anything. Made me go to bed at eight and tucked me in like I was 5 years old. My mom never did that. Even when I actually was 5. She just tell me to take some Tylenol and stop being dramatic. Last night I couldn't sleep and went downstairs for water. Found him at the kitchen table at 2:00am reading my biology textbook. He saw me and got embarrassed. Said he was just trying to understand what I'm learning so he can help me study better. Started explaining cellular respiration to me, even though he had half of it wrong, he was trying so hard. That's when it actually hit me. My mom had 16 years to care about me and didn't. This man had three months and gave me everything she never could. I'm never going back.

You were Dad's favorite. Perfect grades, perfect life. I could never be enough because you existed. That wasn't about her, dad said firmly. That was about your choices, page. Every time you hurt your sister, you pushed me away. Raymond, that's enough, mom snapped. You're turning this family against each other over birthday presents. Stop making excuses for her. Dad's shout made everyone jump. Your granddaughter is crying surrounded by wreckage, and you're worried about Paige's feelings? He looked at Paige. You need professional help, but until you get it and make genuine amends, you're not welcome here anymore. Not at family gatherings, not at holidays. Claudia, we're leaving, dad said, slipping his ring back on. Are you coming? Mom looked between them. I need to check on page. Dad nodded slowly. I'll be at the Marriott on Fifth Street when you're ready to have an honest conversation. He left. Actually left. Three months later, I sat with my laptop open, staring at UCLA's graduate design program. Dad had set up an account, enough for the degree I should have gotten 12 years ago. I clicked submit application. Weeks later, the acceptance email arrived. This time no one could steal it. I texted dad. I got in. He called immediately crying. That night, I told Harper, Mommy's Going back to school, it'll be hard sometimes, but we'll be brave together. Will Grandpa help us? She asked. Maybe sometimes, but mostly it'll be you and me building something new. I looked at the framed photo from early in Harper's party before everything fell apart, her face glowing with joy. Mom texted, I'd like to see you and Harper sometime when you're ready. I stared at the message. Three months ago, I would have given in. Instead, I typed, maybe, but not yet. I wasn't playing small anymore.

I couldn't be happier. I leave for work at 5:00am while she's still asleep. By 6:30 I'm at my desk with headphones on, starting my day with music. The office is empty, the coffee is brewing, and I've got my playlist going. Then at 7:00am, like clockwork, my music stops. Notification pops up playing on living room speaker. She's awake. Most people would be annoyed. We share my premium account because she refuses to pay for her own. Says it's a waste of $11 a month when mine works fine, but I just smile and open Spotify to see what she's playing. It started as curiosity. What does she listen to when I'm not around? Monday was lover by Taylor Swift. Tuesday was at last by Eddie James. Wednesday she played Better Together by Jack Johnson three times in a row. This morning Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls. I keep a mental list. Sometimes I write them down in my notes app during my lunch break. At first I thought it was random, just her shuffling through her likes, but then I started noticing a pattern about three weeks ago. Every single song has one thing in common. They're all about commitment, forever staying together, finding the one. No breakup songs, no angry anthems. Not a single I'm independent and don't need anyone track. Just love the real deep, forever kind. See, I've been planning to propose for two months. Now I have the ring. A vintage sapphire her grandmother wore, which her mom gave me after I asked for her blessing. I have the date next Saturday at the park. Park where we first met four years ago. I even have the photographer hiding in the bushes at six PM. Everything's planned. Everything's perfect. But here's what she doesn't know. Last Tuesday, I came home early from work. She was in the shower, and her phone was on the counter, unlocked. Spotify was open. I wasn't trying to snoop, but I saw it. A playlist titled if he asks. It was set to private. I wasn't supposed to see it. My hand shook as I clicked it. Inside, 47 songs. All the ones she's been playing ever. Every morning. For the path, Rain amazed by Lone Star, all of me by John Legend, Thinking out loud by Ed Sheeran. And at the bottom of the playlist description, a note to herself. Songs to remind him.

The aftermath was predictable. Dad messaged the family group chat. Logan stole from his parents, locked us out of accounts. Mom added. He abandoned his family. Aunts and uncles piled on. A teacher shouldn't act like this. Family is family. I wrote individual responses. Ava was in ICU. I set boundaries. Message me about anything else and I'll mute you. Half stopped. I blocked the rest. A week later, a 900 dollar door dash charge hit my closed gas card, Amazon subscriptions. I didn't authorize. Chase thought wishing it open would open it. Fraud line called. I canceled everything. The rep took a breath, like she recognized the pattern. I've got you, she said. A month after the ICU, dad texted. We Miss Ava, let's talk. We met at a botanical garden. They brought a stuffed star. We walked, watched fish. They didn't mention money, but nudged. Maybe on your brother's next birthday. Stop. We're here for Ava. For one hour, we were a family in the ordinary way I'd always wanted. When we left, dad said, we want to do better. I'll respond to trying not to. Threats. He nodded. Once that night, I made a list.

Am I being immature? My husband and I have been together for four years. I love him even now. But three months ago, something happened that I can't get past. I surprised him at his office with lunch. That's when I met autumn, his colleague. They were laughing at his desk and when I walked in, there was this weird pop like I'd interrupted something. He introduced us, said they've been working together for five years. Five years. And I'd never heard her name, not once. On the drive home, I asked why he never mentioned her. He said, we rarely talk about work since I don't understand his field. That stuck with me, the way he said it. That night, I started paying attention. He was on his phone constantly smiling at texts, typing quick responses during dinner, during movies, even when we were in bed. A week later, I asked him directly, who are you texting so much? He didn't hesitate. He unlocked his phone and handed it to me. See for yourself. I scrolled through their messages. It was pages and pages of daily conversations, cute nicknames, inside jokes, her complaining about her husband, asking intimate questions about our relationship, about me. Then I found the one that made my stomach drop. My husband's birthday is June 14. I threw him a party, friends, family, everything. At nine forty seven PM that night, she texted, you must be Bored at your own party or you wouldn't be texting me. Instead of being with her, he was texting her at the party I spent two weeks planning for him. I looked up on the phone, this is inappropriate. This is alerting. He seemed genuinely surprised, said if it bothered me that much, he'd stop. For exactly four weeks, it stopped. Then it started again. Gradually, a text here and there. Then every evening again, I confronted him. This time, he came home the next day with her to clear the air. She sat on our couch marking, making jokes about how I must have trust issues, how if I felt threatened by their friendship, that was my problem, not hers. She even winked at him when she said it. The second she left, I told him I never wanted to see or hear about her again, that if he'd rather have her as a friend than me as a wife, he should just say it. He promised it was over, said he'd barely talk to her work. Only two weeks later, we left for our anniversary trip to Santorini. Three weeks just us. It was supposed to fix everything, except she texted him two to three times every single day. I'd see his phone light up. Autumn, autumn, autumn. He'd wait until I was in the shower.

The crowd parted. Yakub smile faded. He started backing toward the door. It was you, I said. My voice echoed through the silent room. You borrowed my jacket that weekend. You went to Darryl's party. You did this. Jacob laughed but sounded forced. You're delusional, man. Everyone knows it was you. I kept walking. I was six hours away watching my grandmother die.

You wore my jacket and you let me take the blame for 15 years. The room was dead silent. I turned to Molly. She was frozen, eyes wide. When he introduced himself to you that night, did you know him before that moment or did you just believe the name he gave you? Voice shook. I never met him before. He just walked up to me and said his name. My name. Yes. I turned back to Jacob. Show them your senior yearbook photo. Show them what you look like 15 years ago before the weight, before the hair loss. Jacob's mask finally cracked. You can't prove anything. I don't have to prove anything. You just did. Molly made a sound behind me, something between a gasp and a sob. I turned. She was staring at Jacob. Her whole body was shaking. It was you, she whispered the whole time. It was you. Nobody stopped Jacob from leaving, slipped out the back. While everyone was still processing what just happened, Molly collapsed into a chair. Her brother stood beside her, staring at nothing. People started walking toward me. Nate, Jezebel, others I hadn't spoken to in 15 years, all of them with apologies on their faces. I didn't want to hear it. I turned and walked toward the exit, didn't look back. Jezebel caught up to me in the parking lot. Where are you going? I stopped, looked back at the building, the reunion I've been excited about for months, the friends I wanted to reconnect with, the memories I wanted to revisit home. I said, I got what I came for. She tilted her head. What's that? I opened my car door. Closure. I drove off before she could respond.

You drafted it German only until eight quarter million for college. Bernie stared at her. The trust says we'll contribute to college for descendants who value German heritage. It says nothing about language isolation. But you told me. I told you it would be nice if the kids Learned German. Nothing more. Greta stepped forward. Let me get this straight. You've been terrorizing them with a fake legal requirement. Claudia's voice broke. I was preserving what our grandmother built. Our grandmother would be horrified.

Jake told me they just needed time. I believed him. The first six months of marriage were rough. Amy would roll her eyes whenever I spoke. Connor ignored every rule I set. Zoe would cry and say she wanted her real mom whenever I asked her to clean her room. Jake always said the same thing, they're adjusting, be patient. I was patient. I made their favorite meals.

Then it was about Amy's grades. Then it was about Connor's attitude. Then it was just random stuff about their day. Jake would laugh at his phone during dinner. The kids would ask what mom said. He'd tell them and they'd all laugh together. While I sat there eating my pasta, I told Jake it bothered me, said I was being insecure. Kelly was just the mother of his children. They had to communicate. I dropped it two weeks ago. Zoe had a school play. I took off work early to get there on time. I bought flowers. I sat in the auditorium and saved seats for Jake and the other kids. Kelly showed up and sat right next to me. Jake arrived and sat next to Kelly. Amy and Connor sat on her other side. I was on the end alone. After the play, we all went outside for pictures. The photographer kept trying to get family shots. Kelly would step in next to Jake with all three kids. I stood back. Jake never called me over, not once. When Zoe opened her flowers, she saw mine and said thanks. Then Kelly handed her a bigger bouquet and Zoe squealed and hugged her mom for like five minutes. We drove home separately. I didn't talk the whole night. Jake asked what was wrong. I said nothing. He went to bed. The next day, I heard Amy on the phone in her room.

My mom cut in and said, okay, everyone, let's just calm down. But my aunt was already grabbing her purse and Wesley's tablet. She said, we're leaving. You need to teach your daughter some respect. They left. My mom cut the cake and we ate it. But it was pretty awkward. My dad didn't say anything the whole time. After they left, he just told me I should probably apologize next time I see them. I haven't apologized. Wesley needed to hear it.

Then he said Whitney already sent save the dates to 200 people and canceling would humiliate her. The next family dinner got ugly. Dad said Austin needed to grow a spine. Mom said Whitney was being unreasonable. My aunt said this was a red flag. Austin defended Whitney saying she just wanted her dream wedding and didn't understand our family dynamics. Whitney showed up uninvited to that dinner. She walked in and announced that she'd compromise. The wedding would stay in Mexico on July 16th, but she'd live stream it so family members who couldn't attend could watch. Problem solved in her mind. Grandma spoke up for the first time. She said in her quiet voice that she'd attended every single family reunion since starting the tradition when my dad was born. She said she'd love to attend Austin's wedding, but traveling to Mexico wasn't possible at her age with her health issues. Actually rolled her eyes. She said that's exactly why the live stream was perfect. Grandma could watch from home and comfort. Then Whitney looked at Austin and said, see, babe, I fixed it. Austin stared at his plate, didn't say anything. I waited until Whitney left, then told Austin he had a choice to make. Choose the girl who made him pick between her and his family or choose the family who'd always put him first. He called off the engagement. Three days later, Whitney Blasted him on social media, calling him a mama's boy who couldn't cut the cord. She kept the ring.

Your honor, can I show you something my mommy doesn't know about? Rick jumped up. This is inappropriate. Sit down, Mister Carson. The judge. Judge looked at Zariah gently. What do you want to show me, sweetheart? Zariah held up her old cracked tablet. There's a video. I recorded it when daddy didn't know. The clerk connected it to the courtroom monitor. Zariah pressed play. The video showed our living room from behind a plant. Rick and Doctor Valencia entered. He wrapped his arms around her, kissing her neck. The courtroom gasped. Their voices came through clearly. Valencia, are you sure your plan will work? Laughing. She's too stupid to figure it out. All the money is transferred to your account. Baby Valencia in custody. Rick, once I get the verdict, we'll sell the house and move to Switzerland. Give the kid a new tablet and she'll forget her mother. You'll be her new mom, smarter, prettier. He kissed her passionately. Valencia, what about my testimony? Rick smirking. I provoked her until she cried. Got it on video. I'll do it again at trial. She'll scream in front of the judge. Your testimony will look perfect. They toasted, laughing. The video ended silent. Turn it off. It's fake. Rick screamed, lunging toward the clerk. Security tackled him. Valencia ran for the exit and officer stopped her. The judge's face was crimson with rage. Arrest both of them. Conspiracy, see, fraud, perjury, theft. He looked at me. Missus nala, I'm granting you full custody immediately. We'll address property division in emergency proceedings. He turned to Rick and Valencia. You'll both face criminal charges. Rick was dragged out in handcuffs. Valencia collapsed screaming. Soraya ran to me. I held her tight. Why did you record it? I whispered, because daddy said you shouldn't know. She said, he told that lady you were stupid and wouldn't find out. But I knew they were bad. I wanted the judge to see. Three months later, Rick got eight years. Valencia got five and lost her license. All the money was returned. Now we live in a cozy apartment. I run a catering business. We're happy.

My brother Austin proposed to his girlfriend Whitney last March. She said yes and immediately took over planning everything. The wedding date she picked was July 16th. That's the exact same day our family has held our annual reunion for the past 23 years. Every single July 16th, everyone shows up at grandma's lake house. No exceptions. I texted Austin asking if he knew about the date conflict. He said Whitney wanted a summer wedding and picked the date before asking him. I told him to talk to her about changing it. He said he would try. Two weeks later, nothing changed. Whitney posted pictures on Instagram of her venue, a beach resort in Mexico, deposits already paid. Austin called me saying Whitney refused to move the date because the venue had limited availability and she got a discount for booking that specific weekend. I asked if he told her about the family reunion. He said yes, but Whitney told him his family could just skip one year. Our grandmother is 86. We don't know how many more reunions will get with her. Mom called Whitney directly to explain the situation. Whitney responded by saying family traditions can be flexible and this was her special day. She added that anyone who truly cared about Austin would make his wedding the priority. Mom stayed calm, but I could tell she was pissed. Austin called me crying. Whitney gave him an ultimatum, either the wedding stays. On July 16th, with his family attending in Mexico or she's calling off the engagement. She said if his family can't support their marriage from day one, then she doesn't want to marry into a family that won't put her first. I drove to Austin's apartment. He looked terrible. I asked what he wanted to do.

German only. We'll homeschool her to make sure. My water glass slipped from my hand. 8 years old, homeschooled. My male Claudia beams like she just offered me a gift. The Albert children speak only German until third grade. Then they transition to English. My grandmother did it. My mother, me, all the boys. My husband jumped in. Mom already found us a German tutor. We'll homeschool our girl until she's eight, so she's not exposed to English at school. The baby kicked like it was rebelling. This was the first I heard of any German only plan. She can't go eight years without English, I said. That's insane. What about other kids, friends, the outside world? She'll have German play groups. Claudia said firmly. We'll make sure everyone around her speaks German. Then at eight, she learns English. That's how you preserve a language. That night I cornered my husband. I can't homeschool for eight years in a language I barely speak. His expression went cold. My family did this for generations. It's non negotiable. I know maybe 50 German words. Then you'll learn. Mom will be there every day anyway. She'll handle most of it. My chest tightened. Your mother will be here every day for eight years. He pulled up a contract on his phone. An actual legal document. Aunt Greta's Education Trust. $250,000 for college. But only if the Child speaks fluent German as their first language. It specifies eight years minimum of German immersion. The number made my vision blur. We'd emptied our savings on IVF. His business was failing. Quarter million dollars. There's more, he said quietly. The contract says any family member who speaks English to the child before age 8 forfeits their inheritance. Mom had Uncle Werner's lawyer distracted. You're telling me if my own mother speaks English to her grandchild, she loses money? The family takes this seriously. Claudia started her assault immediately. Posted in family group chats that anyone speaking English around baby Albert would be cut off. Sent my mother a formal letter explaining the rules. Started a German nursery in our future daughter's room. Only German books, German songs playing on repeat. My own mom called, crying. She sent me a seasoned diss letter. At my next prenatal appointment, a child development specialist sat me down. Your OB flagged your chart. This German only plan, it's potentially abusive. She pulled out research papers. Eight years of language isolation from the dominant culture. Sure. No school, no peers, no outside contact. That's not education, that's imprisonment. Children need socialization. They need their primary caregivers. Native language. This could cause severe developmental delays. Isolation, psychological trauma. My hands shook reading the studies. Kids raised in language isolation showed symptoms similar to cult survivors. I confronted my husband that night. He actually hesitated. What if we compromise? German at home, English outside. Claudia appeared. From no

Even after I showed the camera footage, my brother and sister in law defended him. The next morning my dad taught them a lesson they will never forget. I was in the middle of fixing a critical work issue when I heard it, the fizzing sound of soda hitting my keyboard. I looked up to see my nephew Levi standing over my Dell XPS, an empty Coke can in his hand, grinning as he watched the liquid seep between the keys. Screen flickered once, then went black. What the hell are you doing? I shouted. Levi stared at me, no guilt, no fear. He stuck out his tongue, raised his middle finger and walked out of my office like he owned the place. He was 9 years old. My brother Michael and his wife Andrea had moved back from overseas three months ago, staying at our dad's house temporarily after a failed business venture. Their son Levi had no boundaries. Every time I told him my office was off limits, Andrea would laugh and say, don't be so serious, Uncle William. He's just energetic. I walked downstairs keeping my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest. Levi needs to apologize for what he just did. He hid behind Andrea. I didn't do anything wrong. I explained what happened, soda, the middle finger, everything. Andrea frowned, her voice sharp. You're saying Levi did that? I don't believe it. Michael just stared at me, silent. I pulled out my phone and showed them the security footage from my office. Still clear, Levi pouring soda, sticking out his tongue, flipping me off. Andrea watched it, her face flickering with discomfort, then shrugged. He probably picked that up somewhere. It was just an accident. Michael leaned back. Don't make a big deal out of this. You're the adult here. That's when I lost it. That's what you call an accident. You saw the video. Are you all blind? The room went silent. My dad, sitting at the end of the table, said nothing, but his jaw was tight. Michael slammed his hand on the table. What the hell did you just say? Hey, William, Levi would never do that. Before I could respond, my dad's voice cut through everyone. Sit down now. The room froze. Dad stood up, looked at Levi and said firmly, Levi, what you did was wrong. Apologize to your uncle, William. Levi said nothing. Andrea leaned down and whispered, it's okay, sweetheart. We're right here. Dad's hands curled into fists. The next morning, dad.

I knew the routine better than my own homework. Chest physiotherapy twice a day to loosen the mucus, nebulizer treatments morning and night, enzyme pills with every meal, and always watch for signs of infection. Parents went to Grandma's 90th birthday two hours away, and I told them I could handle it because I've done it 100 times before. The storm hit harder than expected, and the power went out around six PM, but Danny had already done his evening nebulizer, so we just lit some candles and played cards and listened to the ice hitting the windows. Around eight PM, he started coughing more than usual. I did chest percussion like they taught me, pounding on his back to loosen everything up, and he coughed a bunch of stuff up and seemed better. By nine PM, the coughing was worse, deep and wet, and Danny said his chest felt tight. I gave him his rescue inhaler, two puffs like the doctor showed us, and waited. He still couldn't catch his breath between coughing fits. I tried to call our parents, but my cell was dead. Towers overloaded from the storm. I tried 9 1 1 and got nothing but static. The landline was out because ice took Down the lines, Danny. His breathing was getting faster and shallower and his nostrils were flaring with each breath. I recognised this from hospital trips. Respiratory distress. I did more chest therapy and tried the inhaler again and nothing worked. Danny's lips were turning blue at the edges. He was using muscles in his neck and stomach just to breathe. His whole body working for every bit of air. He looked at me with scared eyes and said, I can't get air. I tried every phone again and got nothing. I ran outside and banged on neighbour's doors, but no one was home or they couldn't help. Danny was sitting straight up because he couldn't breathe, lying down, wheezing with every exhale. His fingernails were turning blue. He was too tired to cough anymore, which was worse. He said, am I gonna die? And I told him no, I wasn't going to let that happen. I looked out the window at Mister Leroy's truck with chains on the tires just sitting in his driveway. Mister Leroy was at his daughter's house riding out the storm. I wrapped Danny in a blanket and carried him outside. He weighed almost nothing because C F. Always kept him.

His head lolled to the side and the Whistling sound he made with each breath was and quieter. Keys in the visor, like always. I'd never driven, but I'd watched my parents a thousand times. I turned the key and stalled. It started again. Stalled again. Third time. I gave it more gas and the truck lurched backward and I slammed the brakes and we skidded sideways across the driveway. I got it into drive and the back end fishtailed so hard I thought we were going in the ditch. Truck shot forward, tyres spinning on ice before they caught. I couldn't see through the freezing rain, so I hunched over the wheel and squinted at the road. The truck slid through the first intersection and I just held on and prayed. Danny's breathing was barely audible now. I pushed the gas harder. We hit black ice on Miller Road and spun completely around. I was screaming as the world whipped past the windows, headlights swinging across trees and mailboxes. When we stopped, we were somehow still on the road, facing the right direction. I kept driving.

I was 12 years old and home alone with my little brother during the worst ice storm in 20 years. Danny was 7 and had cystic fibrosis, been managing it his whole life. I knew the routine better than my own homework. Chest physiotherapy twice a day to loosen the mucus, nebulizer treatments morning and night, enzyme pills with every meal, and always watch for signs of infection. Parents went to Grandma's 90th birthday two hours away, and I told them I could handle it because I've done it 100 times before. The storm hit harder than expected, and the power went out around six PM, but Danny had already done his evening nebulizer, so we just lit some candles and played cards and listened to the ice hitting the windows. Around eight PM, he started coughing more than usual. I did chest percussion like they taught me, pounding on his back to loosen everything up, and he coughed a bunch of stuff up and seemed better. By nine PM, the coughing was worse, deep and wet, and Danny said his chest felt tight. I gave him his rescue inhaler, two puffs like the doctor showed us, and waited. He still couldn't catch his breath between coughing fits. I tried to call our parents, but my cell was dead. Towers overloaded from the storm. I tried 9 1 1 and got nothing but static. The landline was out because ice took Down the lines, Danny. His breathing was getting faster and shallower and his nostrils were flaring with each breath. I recognised this from hospital trips. Respiratory distress. I did more chest therapy and tried the inhaler again and nothing worked. Danny's lips were turning blue at the edges. He was using muscles in his neck and stomach just to breathe. His whole body working for every bit of air. He looked at me with scared eyes and said, I can't get air. I tried every phone again and got nothing. I ran outside and banged on neighbour's doors, but no one was home or they couldn't help. Danny was sitting straight up because he couldn't breathe, lying down, wheezing with every exhale. His fingernails were turning blue. He was too tired to cough anymore, which was worse. He said, am I gonna die? And I told him no, I wasn't going to let that happen. I looked out the window at Mister Leroy's truck with chains on the tires just sitting in his driveway. Mister Leroy was at his daughter's house riding out the storm. I wrapped Danny in a blanket and carried him outside. He weighed almost nothing because C F. Always kept him small. My feet slipped on the icy steps and I went down hard on one knee. But I didn't drop him. The truck door was unlocked and I put Danny in the passenger seat and buckled him in. His head lolled to the side and The whistling sound he made with each breath was get and quieter. Keys in the visor, like always. I'd never driven, but I'd watched my parents a thousand times. I turned the key and stalled. It started again. Stalled again. Third time. I gave it more gas and the truck lurched backward and I slammed the brakes and we skidded sideways across the driveway. I got it into drive and the back end fishtailed so hard I thought we were going in the ditch. Truck shot forward, tyres spinning on ice before they caught. I couldn't see through the freezing rain, so I hunched over the wheel and squinted at the road. The truck slid through the first intersection and I just held on and prayed. Danny's breathing was barely audible now. I pushed the gas harder. We hit black ice on Miller Road and spun completely around. I was screaming as the world whipped past the windows, headlights swinging across trees and mailboxes. When we stopped, we were somehow still on the road, facing the right direction. I kept driving. I blew through a red light because no one else was stupid enough to be out. The truck fishtailed on the hill by the church and sideswiped a parked car. I heard metal scraping and didn't stop. The hospital was 15 minutes away. In good weather, I made it in eight. I pulled up to the emergency entrance going way too fast and slammed the brakes and the truck Jumped a curb and stopped half on the sidewalk. I laid on the horn until people came running.

His head lolled to the side and The whistling sound he made with each breath was get and quieter. Keys in the visor, like always. I'd never driven, but I'd watched my parents a thousand times. I turned the key and stalled. It started again. Stalled again. Third time. I gave it more gas and the truck lurched backward and I slammed the brakes and we skidded sideways across the driveway. I got it into drive and the back end fishtailed so hard I thought we were going in the ditch. Truck shot forward, tyres spinning on ice before they caught. I couldn't see through the freezing rain, so I hunched over the wheel and squinted at the road. The truck slid through the first intersection and I just held on and prayed. Danny's breathing was barely audible now. I pushed the gas harder. We hit black ice on Miller Road and spun completely around. I was screaming as the world whipped past the windows, headlights swinging across trees and mailboxes. When we stopped, we were somehow still on the road, facing the right direction. I kept driving. I blew through a red light because no one else was stupid enough to be out. The truck fishtailed on the hill by the church and sideswiped a parked car. I heard metal scraping and didn't stop. The hospital was 15 minutes away. In good weather, I made it in eight. I pulled up to the emergency entrance going way too fast and slammed the brakes and the truck Jumped a curb and stopped half on the sidewalk. I laid on the horn until people came running. I was screaming that my brother had C F. And couldn't breathe. They put him on a stretcher, and someone put an oxygen mask on his face, and they ran him inside. A nurse found me on the waiting room floor in wet pajamas, no shoes, shaking so hard my teeth were chattering. She brought me a blanket and told me I did good. My parents arrived three hours later, hysterical. The doctor said Danny was stable. His oxygen levels were when he came in. And another hour could have caused organ damage or worse. A cop showed up the next day. About the stolen truck and the car I hit. I told him everything. Mister Leroy visited Danny in the hospital and heard the whole story. He shook my hand and told the cop there was nothing to press charges for. He said, that's not stealing. That's being a brother. Danny's 20 now and doing fine.

I've been pregnant for 41 weeks. The doctors kept saying, any day now for three weeks straight while I waddled around like a penguin. My husband works in the medical field, so I let him handle all the hospital stuff. So when he finally scheduled a date to get this baby out, I cried happy tears. My husband held my face and said, we're finally gonna meet our daughter. He's been reading parenting books. It's month two of this pregnancy, and recently took to practicing swaddling on our cat. I've never wanted anything more than to hold this baby, to finally meet the little person who's been kicking my ribs for months.

I told her. She sighed like I was ruining her day. You're early. I wasn't early. I was exactly on time. She pointed down the hall. Room 4. Change into the gown on the bed. Someone will deal with you. Eventually kept telling myself it was fine, that my husband would be here soon. I texted him, just got to my room. His response made my stomach drop. Don't freak out, but I got rear ended really bad on the highway. I'm fine, but the car is totaled. Coming as fast As I can. I stared at my phone, alone in that cold room, trying not to panic. A nurse came in without knocking. She grabbed my arm and started inserting an I V. Wait, I said. My husband isn't here yet. Can we just wait until he gets here before we start anything? She didn't even look at me. We're on a schedule. I watched her push something into the line. What is that? I asked. Pitocin. But I thought we were going to discuss the plan first. She glares at me and says, you want this baby out or not? She left before I could respond. Then my husband texted me. The police are making me stay until the tow truck clears the scene. It's going to be okay, though. I love you. Within 20 minutes, my contractions started hitting hard. I was gripping the bed rails, tears streaming down my face. I pressed the call button.

Another nurse. I asked for ice chips an hour ago, and I need to talk to someone about pain management. He rolled her eyes. There's water right there, and the doctor will be in when he's ready. The doctor finally appeared two hours later. He checked the monitors, checked his watch, and started toward the door. Wait. I said, crying now. I'm in so much pain. Can we please talk about an epidural or something? He barely turned around. You're only at six centimetres. This is normal. First time. Mothers always think they know better than the medical professionals. He left. I had never felt so alone. I kept texting my husband, but the last message he sent was, phone is at 1%. I will be there. You're so strong. So none of my messages were going through. The pressure became unbearable, so I screamed. The doctor rushed back in, barking orders. Nurses appeared from nowhere. Push, he commanded. But my husband. I say, I don't care. Push! I pushed until I saw stars. Until I heard a tiny cry that made everything else disappear. My husband burst through the door, somehow looking worse than me. His shirt was torn. Face panicked. I'm here! I'm here! Our daughter was in the doctor's arms. Perfect. Screaming, alive.

I was 12 years old and home alone with my little brother during the worst ice storm in 20 years. Danny was 7 and had cystic fibrosis, been managing it his whole life. I knew the routine better than my own homework. Chest physiotherapy twice a day to loosen the mucus, nebulizer treatments morning and night, enzyme pills with every meal, and always watch for signs of infection. Parents went to Grandma's 90th birthday two hours away, and I told them I could handle it because I've done it 100 times before. The storm hit harder than expected, and the power went out around six PM, but Danny had already done his evening nebulizer, so we just lit some candles and played cards and listened to the ice hitting the windows. Around eight PM, he started coughing more than usual. I did chest percussion like they taught me, pounding on his back to loosen everything up, and he coughed a bunch of stuff up and seemed better. By nine PM, the coughing was worse, deep and wet, and Danny said his chest felt tight. I gave him his rescue inhaler, two puffs like the doctor showed us, and waited. He still couldn't catch his breath between coughing fits. I tried to call our parents, but my cell was dead. Towers overloaded from the storm. I tried 9 1 1 and got nothing but static. The landline was out because ice took Down the lines, Danny. His breathing was getting faster and shallower and his nostrils were flaring with each breath. I recognised this from hospital trips. Respiratory distress. I did more chest therapy and tried the inhaler again and nothing worked. Danny's lips were turning blue at the edges. He was using muscles in his neck and stomach just to breathe. His whole body working for every bit of air. He looked at me with scared eyes and said, I can't get air. I tried every phone again and got nothing. I ran outside and banged on neighbour's doors, but no one was home or they couldn't help. Danny was sitting straight up because he couldn't breathe, lying down, wheezing with every exhale. His fingernails were turning blue. He was too tired to cough anymore, which was worse. He said, am I gonna die? And I told him no, I wasn't going to let that happen. I looked out the window at Mister Leroy's truck with chains on the tires just sitting in his driveway. Mister Leroy was at his daughter's house riding out the storm. I wrapped Danny in a blanket and carried him outside. He weighed almost nothing because C F. Always kept him small. My feet slipped on the icy steps and I went down hard on one knee. But I didn't drop him. The truck door was unlocked and I put Danny in the passenger seat and buckled him in.

I've been pregnant for 41 weeks. The doctors kept saying, any day now for three weeks straight while I waddled around like a penguin. My husband works in the medical field, so I let him handle all the hospital stuff. So when he finally scheduled a date to get this baby out, I cried happy tears. My husband held my face and said, we're finally gonna meet our daughter. He's been reading parenting books. It's month two of this pregnancy, and recently took to practicing swaddling on our cat. I've never wanted anything more than to hold this baby, to finally meet the little person who's been kicking my ribs for months. The moment I walked into the section of the hospital titled Labour and delivery, something felt wrong. The intake nurse didn't even look up from her computer when I approached. Name. She snapped. I told her. She sighed like I was ruining her day. You're early. I wasn't early. I was exactly on time. She pointed down the hall. Room 4. Change into the gown on the bed. Someone will deal with you. Eventually kept telling myself it was fine, that my husband would be here soon. I texted him, just got to my room. His response made my stomach drop. Don't freak out, but I got rear ended really bad on the highway. I'm fine, but the car is totaled. Coming as fast As I can. I stared at my phone, alone in that cold room, trying not to panic. A nurse came in without knocking. She grabbed my arm and started inserting an I V. Wait, I said. My husband isn't here yet. Can we just wait until he gets here before we start anything? She didn't even look at me. We're on a schedule. I watched her push something into the line. What is that? I asked. Pitocin. But I thought we were going to discuss the plan first. She glares at me and says, you want this baby out or not? She left before I could respond. Then my husband texted me. The police are making me stay until the tow truck clears the scene. It's going to be okay, though. I love you. Within 20 minutes, my contractions started hitting hard. I was gripping the bed rails, tears streaming down my face. I pressed the call button. A different nurse appeared in the doorway. I need ice chips. I managed. Please. She glanced at her clipboard. I'll get to it. She never came back. An hour later, I pressed the button again. Another nurse. I asked for ice chips an hour ago, and I need to talk to someone about pain management. He rolled her eyes. There's water right there, and the doctor will be in when he's ready. The doctor finally appeared two hours later. He checked the monitors, checked his watch, and started toward the door. Wait. I said, crying now. I'm in so much pain. Can we please talk about an epidural or something? He barely turned around. You're only at six centimetres. This is normal. First time. Mothers always think they know better than the medical professionals. He left. I had never felt so alone. I kept texting my husband, but the last message he sent was, phone is at 1%. I will be there. You're so strong. So none of my messages were going through. The pressure became unbearable, so I screamed. The doctor rushed back in, barking orders. Nurses appeared from nowhere. Push, he commanded. But my husband. I say, I don't care. Push! I pushed until I saw stars. Until I heard a tiny cry that made everything else disappear. My husband burst through the door, somehow looking worse than me. His shirt was torn. Face panicked. I'm here! I'm here! Our daughter was in the doctor's arms. Perfect. Screaming, alive. I reached out, exhausted, sobbing. Please, please, I whispered. Can I hold my baby? The doctor didn't look at me. We need to run tests first. Please, just for one second. He finally turned irritation all over his face. Ma'am, shut up and let us do our jobs. The room went dead silent. My husband stepped forward with a look I'd never seen before. What did you just say to my wife? The doctor straightened. Sir, you need to calm down or I will have security remove you. My husband laughed. Coldly remove me. Do you have any idea who I am? He pulled out his hospital I D. Badge. I sit on this hospital's medical board. I review misconduct cases. I decide who keeps their job here. The doctor's face went white. The nurse, who rolled her eyes, physically stepped backward. The rest of you better hope you treated my wife with more compassion than the man who told my wife to shut up after she just gave birth to our child. He looked at each person in the room. Because by Monday morning, I will have every single person who mistreated my wife suspended. The doctor placed our baby in my arms so gently, you'd think she was made of glass. The nurse, who disappeared for an hour, suddenly appeared with warm blankets, ice chips and extra pillows for me. Is there anything else you need? The nurse asked me. I looked at my husband, then at our daughter's perfect face.

Mothers always think they know better than the medical professionals. He left. I had never felt so alone. I kept texting my husband, but the last message he sent was, phone is at 1%. I will be there. You're so strong. So none of my messages were going through. The pressure became unbearable, so I screamed. The doctor rushed back in, barking orders. Nurses appeared from nowhere. Push, he commanded. But my husband. I say, I don't care. Push! I pushed until I saw stars. Until I heard a tiny cry that made everything else disappear. My husband burst through the door, somehow looking worse than me. His shirt was torn. Face panicked. I'm here! I'm here! Our daughter was in the doctor's arms. Perfect. Screaming, alive. I reached out, exhausted, sobbing. Please, please, I whispered. Can I hold my baby? The doctor didn't look at me. We need to run tests first. Please, just for one second. He finally turned irritation all over his face. Ma'am, shut up and let us do our jobs. The room went dead silent. My husband stepped forward with a look I'd never seen before. What did you just say to my wife? The doctor straightened. Sir, you need to calm down or I will have security remove you. My husband laughed. Coldly remove me. Do you have any idea who I am? He pulled out his hospital I D. Badge. I sit on this hospital's medical board. I review misconduct cases. I decide who keeps their job here. The doctor's face went white. The nurse, who rolled her eyes, physically stepped backward. The rest of you better hope you treated my wife with more compassion than the man who told my wife to shut up after she just gave birth to our child. He looked at each person in the room. Because by Monday morning, I will have every single person who mistreated my wife suspended. The doctor placed our baby in my arms so gently, you'd think she was made of glass. The nurse, who disappeared for an hour, suddenly appeared with warm blankets, ice chips and extra pillows for me. Is there anything else you need? The nurse asked me. I looked at my husband, then at our daughter's perfect face. I told the nurse, yes, for you to get out.",https://www.tiktok.com/@as460743/video/7582269649622977805,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

He said, am I gonna die? And I told him no, I wasn't going to let that happen. I looked out the window at Mister Leroy's truck with chains on the tires just sitting in his driveway. Mister Leroy was at his daughter's house riding out the storm. I wrapped Danny in a blanket and carried him outside. He weighed almost nothing because C F. Always kept him small. My feet slipped on the icy steps and I went down hard on one knee. But I didn't drop him. The truck door was unlocked and I put Danny in the passenger seat and buckled him in. His head lolled to the side and The whistling sound he made with each breath was get and quieter. Keys in the visor, like always. I'd never driven, but I'd watched my parents a thousand times. I turned the key and stalled. It started again. Stalled again. Third time. I gave it more gas and the truck lurched backward and I slammed the brakes and we skidded sideways across the driveway. I got it into drive and the back end fishtailed so hard I thought we were going in the ditch. Truck shot forward, tyres spinning on ice before they caught. I couldn't see through the freezing rain, so I hunched over the wheel and squinted at the road. The truck slid through the first intersection and I just held on and prayed. Danny's breathing was barely audible now. I pushed the gas harder. We hit black ice on Miller Road and spun completely around. I was screaming as the world whipped past the windows, headlights swinging across trees and mailboxes. When we stopped, we were somehow still on the road, facing the right direction. I kept driving. I blew through a red light because no one else was stupid enough to be out. The truck fishtailed on the hill by the church and sideswiped a parked car. I heard metal scraping and didn't stop. The hospital was 15 minutes away. In good weather, I made it in eight. I pulled up to the emergency entrance going way too fast and slammed the brakes and the truck Jumped a curb and stopped half on the sidewalk. I laid on the horn until people came running. I was screaming that my brother had C F. And couldn't breathe. They put him on a stretcher, and someone put an oxygen mask on his face, and they ran him inside. A nurse found me on the waiting room floor in wet pajamas, no shoes, shaking so hard my teeth were chattering. She brought me a blanket and told me I did good. My parents arrived three hours later, hysterical. The doctor said Danny was stable. His oxygen levels were when he came in. And another hour could have caused organ damage or worse. A cop showed up the next day. About the stolen truck and the car I hit. I told him everything. Mister Leroy visited Danny in the hospital and heard the whole story. He shook my hand and told the cop there was nothing to press charges for. He said, that's not stealing. That's being a brother. Danny's 20 now and doing fine. Mister Leroy taught me to drive for real the summer I turned 15.",https://www.tiktok.com/@as357852/video/7582268168874347790,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

I was 12 years old and home alone with my little brother during the worst ice storm in 20 years. Danny was 7 and had cystic fibrosis, been managing it his whole life. I knew the routine better than my own homework. Chest physiotherapy twice a day to loosen the mucus, nebulizer treatments morning and night, enzyme pills with every meal, and always watch for signs of infection. Parents went to Grandma's 90th birthday two hours away, and I told them I could handle it because I've done it 100 times before. The storm hit harder than expected, and the power went out around six PM, but Danny had already done his evening nebulizer, so we just lit some candles and played cards and listened to the ice hitting the windows. Around eight PM, he started coughing more than usual. I did chest percussion like they taught me, pounding on his back to loosen everything up, and he coughed a bunch of stuff up and seemed better. By nine PM, the coughing was worse, deep and wet, and Danny said his chest felt tight. I gave him his rescue inhaler, two puffs like the doctor showed us, and waited. He still couldn't catch his breath between coughing fits. I tried to call our parents, but my cell was dead. Towers overloaded from the storm. I tried 9 1 1 and got nothing but static. The landline was out because ice took Down the lines, Danny. His breathing was getting faster and shallower and his nostrils were flaring with each breath. I recognised this from hospital trips. Respiratory distress. I did more chest therapy and tried the inhaler again and nothing worked. Danny's lips were turning blue at the edges. He was using muscles in his neck and stomach just to breathe. His whole body working for every bit of air. He looked at me with scared eyes and said, I can't get air. I tried every phone again and got nothing. I ran outside and banged on neighbour's doors, but no one was home or they couldn't help. Danny was sitting straight up because he couldn't breathe, lying down, wheezing with every exhale. His fingernails were turning blue. He was too tired to cough anymore, which was worse. He said, am I gonna die? And I told him no, I wasn't going to let that happen. I looked out the window at Mister Leroy's truck with chains on the tires just sitting in his driveway. Mister Leroy was at his daughter's house riding out the storm. I wrapped Danny in a blanket and carried him outside. He weighed almost nothing because C F. Always kept him small. My feet slipped on the icy steps and I went down hard on one knee. But I didn't drop him. The truck door was unlocked and I put Danny in the passenger seat and buckled him in. His head lolled to the side and The whistling sound he made with each breath was get and quieter. Keys in the visor, like always. I'd never driven, but I'd watched my parents a thousand times. I turned the key and stalled. It started again. Stalled again. Third time. I gave it more gas and the truck lurched backward and I slammed the brakes and we skidded sideways across the driveway. I got it into drive and the back end fishtailed so hard I thought we were going in the ditch. Truck shot forward, tyres spinning on ice before they caught. I couldn't see through the freezing rain, so I hunched over the wheel and squinted at the road. The truck slid through the first intersection and I just held on and prayed. Danny's breathing was barely audible now. I pushed the gas harder. We hit black ice on Miller Road and spun completely around. I was screaming as the world whipped past the windows, headlights swinging across trees and mailboxes. When we stopped, we were somehow still on the road, facing the right direction. I kept driving. I blew through a red light because no one else was stupid enough to be out. The truck fishtailed on the hill by the church and sideswiped a parked car. I heard metal scraping and didn't stop.

A nurse found me on the waiting room floor in wet pajamas, no shoes, shaking so hard my teeth were chattering. She brought me a blanket and told me I did good. My parents arrived three hours later, hysterical. The doctor said Danny was stable. His oxygen levels were when he came in. And another hour could have caused organ damage or worse. A cop showed up the next day. About the stolen truck and the car I hit. I told him everything. Mister Leroy visited Danny in the hospital and heard the whole story.

I've been pregnant for 41 weeks. The doctors kept saying, any day now for three weeks straight while I waddled around like a penguin. My husband works in the medical field, so I let him handle all the hospital stuff. So when he finally scheduled a date to get this baby out, I cried happy tears. My husband held my face and said, we're finally gonna meet our daughter. He's been reading parenting books. It's month two of this pregnancy, and recently took to practicing swaddling on our cat. I've never wanted anything more than to hold this baby, to finally meet the little person who's been kicking my ribs for months. The moment I walked into the section of the hospital titled Labour and delivery, something felt wrong. The intake nurse didn't even look up from her computer when I approached. Name. She snapped. I told her. She sighed like I was ruining her day. You're early. I wasn't early. I was exactly on time. She pointed down the hall. Room 4. Change into the gown on the bed. Someone will deal with you. Eventually kept telling myself it was fine, that my husband would be here soon. I texted him, just got to my room. His response made my stomach drop. Don't freak out, but I got rear ended really bad on the highway. I'm fine, but the car is totaled. Coming as fast As I can. I stared at my phone, alone in that cold room, trying not to panic. A nurse came in without knocking. She grabbed my arm and started inserting an I V. Wait, I said. My husband isn't here yet. Can we just wait until he gets here before we start anything? She didn't even look at me. We're on a schedule. I watched her push something into the line. What is that? I asked. Pitocin. But I thought we were going to discuss the plan first. She glares at me and says, you want this baby out or not? She left before I could respond. Then my husband texted me. The police are making me stay until the tow truck clears the scene. It's going to be okay, though. I love you. Within 20 minutes, my contractions started hitting hard. I was gripping the bed rails, tears streaming down my face. I pressed the call button. A different nurse appeared in the doorway. I need ice chips. I managed. Please. She glanced at her clipboard. I'll get to it. She never came back. An hour later, I pressed the button again. Another nurse. I asked for ice chips an hour ago, and I need to talk to someone about pain management. He rolled her eyes. There's water right there, and the doctor will be in when he's ready. The doctor finally appeared two hours later. He checked the monitors, checked his watch, and started toward the door. Wait. I said, crying now. I'm in so much pain. Can we please talk about an epidural or something? He barely turned around. You're only at six centimetres. This is normal. First time. Mothers always think they know better than the medical professionals. He left. I had never felt so alone. I kept texting my husband, but the last message he sent was, phone is at 1%. I will be there. You're so strong. So none of my messages were going through. The pressure became unbearable, so I screamed. The doctor rushed back in, barking orders. Nurses appeared from nowhere. Push, he commanded. But my husband. I say, I don't care. Push! I pushed until I saw stars. Until I heard a tiny cry that made everything else disappear. My husband burst through the door, somehow looking worse than me. His shirt was torn. Face panicked. I'm here! I'm here! Our daughter was in the doctor's arms. Perfect. Screaming, alive. I reached out, exhausted, sobbing. Please, please, I whispered. Can I hold my baby? The doctor didn't look at me. We need to run tests first. Please, just for one second. He finally turned irritation all over his face. Ma'am, shut up and let us do our jobs. The room went dead silent. My husband stepped forward with a look I'd never seen before. What did you just say to my wife? The doctor straightened. Sir, you need to calm down or I will have security remove you. My husband laughed. Coldly remove me. Do you have any idea who I am? He pulled out his hospital I D. Badge. I sit on this hospital's medical board. I review misconduct cases. I decide who keeps their job here. The doctor's face went white. The nurse, who rolled her eyes, physically stepped backward. The rest of you better hope you treated my wife with more compassion than the man who told my wife to shut up after she just gave birth to our child. He looked at each person in the room. Because by Monday morning, I will have every single person who mistreated my wife suspended. The doctor placed our baby in my arms so gently, you'd think she was made of glass. The nurse, who disappeared for an hour, suddenly appeared with warm blankets, ice chips and extra pillows for me. Is there anything else you need? The nurse asked me. I looked at my husband, then at our daughter's perfect face. I told the nurse, yes, for you to get out.",https://www.tiktok.com/@j17256pcl/video/7582266580331957559,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

I was screaming as the world whipped past the windows, headlights swinging across trees and mailboxes. When we stopped, we were somehow still on the road, facing the right direction. I kept driving. I blew through a red light because no one else was stupid enough to be out. The truck fishtailed on the hill by the church and sideswiped a parked car. I heard metal scraping and didn't stop. The hospital was 15 minutes away. In good weather, I made it in eight. I pulled up to the emergency entrance going way too fast and slammed the brakes and the truck Jumped a curb and stopped half on the sidewalk. I laid on the horn until people came running. I was screaming that my brother had C F. And couldn't breathe. They put him on a stretcher, and someone put an oxygen mask on his face, and they ran him inside. A nurse found me on the waiting room floor in wet pajamas, no shoes, shaking so hard my teeth were chattering. She brought me a blanket and told me I did good. My parents arrived three hours later, hysterical. The doctor said Danny was stable. His oxygen levels were when he came in. And another hour could have caused organ damage or worse. A cop showed up the next day. About the stolen truck and the car I hit. I told him everything. Mister Leroy visited Danny in the hospital and heard the whole story. He shook my hand and told the cop there was nothing to press charges for. He said, that's not stealing. That's being a brother. Danny's 20 now and doing fine. Mister Leroy taught me to drive for real the summer I turned 15.",https://www.tiktok.com/@as339552/video/7582266538888154399,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

was doing the wrong thing the right choice I was 12 years old and home alone with my little brother during the worst ice storm in 20 years Danny was 7 and had cystic fibrosis been managing it his whole life I knew the routine better than my own homework chest physiotherapy twice a day to loosen the mucus nebulizer treatments morning and night enzyme pills with every meal and always watch for signs of infection parents went to Grandma's 90th birthday two hours away and I told them I could handle it because I've done it 100 times before the storm hit harder than expected and the power went out around six PM but Danny had already done his evening nebulizer so we just lit some candles and played cards and listened to the ice hitting the windows around eight PM he started coughing more than usual I did chest percussion like they taught me pounding on his back to loosen everything up and he coughed a bunch of stuff up and seemed better by nine PM the coughing was worse deep and wet and Danny said his chest felt tight I gave him his rescue inhaler two puffs like the doctor showed us and waited he still couldn't catch his breath between coughing fits I tried to call our parents but my cell was dead towers overloaded from the storm I tried 9 1 1 and got nothing but static the landline was out because ice took down the lines Danny his breathing was getting faster and shallower and his nostrils were flaring with each breath I recognised this from hospital trips respiratory distress I did more chest therapy and tried the inhaler again and nothing worked Danny's lips were turning blue at the edges he was using muscles in his neck and stomach just to breathe his whole body working for every bit of air he looked at me with scared eyes and said I can't get air I tried every phone again and got nothing I ran outside and banged on neighbour's doors but no one was home or they couldn't help Danny was sitting straight up because he couldn't breathe lying down wheezing with every exhale his fingernails were turning blue he was too tired to cough anymore which was worse he said am I gonna die and I told him no I wasn't going to let that happen I looked out the window at Mister Leroy's truck with chains on the tires just sitting in his driveway Mister Leroy was at his daughter's house riding out the storm I wrapped Danny in a blanket and carried him outside he weighed almost nothing because C F always kept him small my feet slipped on the icy steps and I went down hard on one knee but I didn't drop him the truck door was unlocked and I put Danny in the passenger seat and buckled him in his head lolled to the side and the whistling sound he made with each breath was get and quieter keys in the visor like always I'd never driven but I'd watched my parents a thousand times I turned the key and stalled it started again stalled again third time I gave it more gas and the truck lurched backward and I slammed the brakes and we skidded sideways

So I announced her biggest secret. Me and my husband Oliver found out I was pregnant in early October after trying for two years. We were so excited, but also terrified because I'd had an early miscarriage the year before that devastated us. My doctor said everything looked good, but recommended waiting until after 12 weeks to tell people just to be safe. We decided Thanksgiving would be perfect since the whole family would be together and we'd be at 14 weeks by then. I only told my brother Leo and my cousin Amy because they both knew about the miscarriage and kept checking on me. They promised not to tell anyone and actually kept their word. My sister Gina is 34 and has four kids and thinks that makes her the pregnancy expert of the family. She called me the week before Thanksgiving asking if I had any news to share. I said no, just looking forward to seeing everyone. She said I seemed different lately and wondered if something was going on. I changed the subject to her kids, and she let it go, but I could tell she was suspicious. The thing about Gina is she literally cannot keep information to herself. When I got into my master's program, I told her first because I was so excited and Wanted to share with my sister. She called her mom an hour later and announced it before I could. When Oliver proposed, I called her, crying happy tears, and she immediately posted about it online, tagging our entire family before I could tell anyone myself. When I got promoted at work, she told everyone at Sunday dinner before I arrived. She. She always says she's just so excited for me, she can't help herself. But it's really about her being the one with information to share. So this time, Oliver and I agreed we wouldn't tell her until we told everyone. Thanksgiving came, and after dinner, I stood up and said we had an announcement. I told everyone we were expecting and due in may. Everyone started cheering and hugging us, except Gina, who just stared at me. Then she started crying. Not happy tears, but angry tears. She asked how long I'd known, and I said about six weeks. She lost it. She stood up and yelled that I was supposed to tell her first. She said she told me about all four of her pregnancies before anyone else, and I'd betrayed her by not doing the same. She said sisters were supposed to share everything, and I'd made her look stupid. My mom tried to calm her down, but Gina turned on her and asked if she knew. When my mom said no, Gina asked who did know. Amy and Leo stayed quiet, but Gina figured it out. And started screaming at them, too, for keeping secrets. She. She said the whole family was against her and treating her like she couldn't be trusted. My dad told her to calm down and be happy for me, but she said, how could she be happy when I deliberately excluded her from the most important news? She said I'd ruined our relationship and she'd never forgive me for making her the last to know. Then she went after Oliver, saying he turned me against my own sister. Oliver said we just wanted to wait until we were sure everything was okay. Gina said that was stupid because she would have supported me either way, and now she felt like I didn't consider her real family. She actually said the words, real family tells each other everything immediately. The irony was incredible, coming from someone who spoiled every important moment I'd ever had. My brother Leo finally spoke up and said, maybe if Gina could keep her mouth shut for once, people would tell her things. Gina threw her wine glass at the wall, and it shattered everywhere. My four year old nephew started crying. My mom started crying. Gina's husband Jake tried to get her to leave, but she refused. She said she wasn't going anywhere until I apologised for humiliating her. I said I wasn't apologizing for protecting my own announcement. She said I was a terrible sister and she was done with me. She told her kids to Get their coats and started packing up the dishes she brought. While she was dramatically shoving Tupperware into bags. I stood up and said, if we were sharing everything like real family, then everyone should know that Gina had been texting her ex boyfriend Ryan for the past six months. Jake froze. Gina went white.

My brother Perry has always collected things he couldn't take care of. Cars rusting in his yard, tools he never used. And for a few terrible years, animals. It started with a cat he saw at a shelter and just had to have. Then another cat, then a dog, then three more dogs. Then, for some reason, a goat. He'd get so excited bringing them home, posting pictures online, telling everyone what a great rescue dad he was. Then he'd get bored. The dogs ended up chained outside in all weather. The cats lived in filthy cages in his garage. I don't even know what happened to the goat. I begged him to let me help. I said I'd come over and feed them, walk them, anything. He told me to mind my own business. They're fine. Animals are tougher than you think. Animal control got called twice by his neighbours. Both times he cleaned up just enough to pass inspection, then went right back to neglecting them. I started sneaking over when he was at work, just to give them food and water. I'd sit with the dogs for a few minutes, let them remember what it felt like to be touched by someone who wasn't screaming at them. One winter, I came over and found a German Shepherd puppy shivering in a broken plastic crate with no food, no water, and sores all over her. Legs from lying in her own waste. She was maybe five months old, and she looked at me with these huge, huge, terrified eyes. And I just couldn't leave her there. I put her in my car and drove away. I called Perry from my driveway and told him I was keeping the dog and he could call the cops if he wanted. He laughed. Take her. She's defective anyway. Wouldn't stop crying. I took the other animals, too. Over the next few months. Every time I asked, he said yes because he was bored of them by then. I rehomed the cats and the other dogs to people I trusted. But I kept a German Shepherd. I named her fluffer nut because she had this ridiculous, fluffy tail that didn't match the rest of her body. She was terrified of everything at first. Loud noises, sudden movements, men, other dogs, the vacuum, the T V, her own shadow. I spent months just sitting on the floor with her, letting her come to me, teaching her that not every hand was going to hurt her. Slowly, she started to trust me. And once she did, I realised what an incredible dog she was. Smart, athletic, eager to learn, beautiful. A friend of mine who does dog shows watched her run in my backyard one day and said, you know she could compete, right? I laughed it off at first, but Fluffer Nut loved training. She loved having a job. So I started entering her in local shows just for fun. Fluffer Nut won best in show at nationals last month. 50 thousand dollar prize. It was the best day of my life. I was ugly, crying while they put the ribbon on her. And she just stood there looking perfect, tail wagging like she'd always known she would. The champion. The local news picked up the story, rescue dog wins big with a photo of me and fluffernut and her trophy. I didn't think anything of it until Perry showed up at my house the next day. He walked right up to my porch and said, that's my dog. I want the prize money. I laughed in his face. He didn't laugh back. I'm serious. I have the original adoption paperwork from the shelter. You stole my property, I said. You told me to take her. You called her defective. He shrugged. I was joking. I never officially signed her over to you. I said. You left her outside in December with no food. She had frostbite on her ears when I took her to the vet. I have the records, he said. That doesn't matter. Legally, she's still mine. I said. I have three years of vet bills, training receipts and registration papers in my name. You have a piece of paper from the shelter you probably can't even find. He stepped closer. I'll sue you. I smiled. Do it. I'd love to show a judge the photos. I Took when I rescued her. I documented everything, Perry. Every sore on her body, every rib showing through her skin. Every day she went without water. I have time stamps. He went quiet. I said, you threw her away like garbage. You didn't train her. You didn't love her. You didn't even feed her. I'm the one who turned her into a champion. You don't get to show up now and pretend you had anything to do with this. He said, you owe me. I'm the reason you even have that dog. I said, get off my property and don't ever contact me about my dog again. He stood there for a second like he was thinking about arguing, then turned and walked back to his car. Fluffer nut sat at my feet the whole time, calm as anything, watching him go. He tried to sue anyway.

My brother Perry has always collected things he couldn't take care of. Cars rusting in his yard, tools he never used. And for a few terrible years, animals. It started with a cat he saw at a shelter and just had to have. Then another cat, then a dog, then three more dogs. Then, for some reason, a goat. He'd get so excited bringing them home, posting pictures online, telling everyone what a great rescue dad he was. Then he'd get bored. The dogs ended up chained outside in all weather. The cats lived in filthy cages in his garage. I don't even know what happened to the goat. I begged him to let me help. I said I'd come over and feed them, walk them, anything. He told me to mind my own business. They're fine. Animals are tougher than you think. Animal control got called twice by his neighbours.

One winter, I came over and found a German Shepherd puppy shivering in a broken plastic crate with no food, no water, and sores all over her. Legs from lying in her own waste. She was maybe five months old, and she looked at me with these huge, huge, terrified eyes. And I just couldn't leave her there. I put her in my car and drove away. I called Perry from my driveway and told him I was keeping the dog and he could call the cops if he wanted. He laughed. Take her. She's defective anyway. Wouldn't stop crying. I took the other animals, too. Over the next few months. Every time I asked, he said yes because he was bored of them by then. I rehomed the cats and the other dogs to people I trusted. But I kept a German Shepherd. I named her fluffer nut because she had this ridiculous, fluffy tail that didn't match the rest of her body. She was terrified of everything at first. Loud noises, sudden movements, men, other dogs, the vacuum, the T V, her own shadow. I spent months just sitting on the floor with her, letting her come to me, teaching her that not every hand was going to hurt her. Slowly, she started to trust me. And once she did, I realised what an incredible dog she was. Smart, athletic, eager to learn, beautiful. A friend of mine who does dog shows watched her run in my backyard one day and said, you know she could compete, right? I laughed it off at first, but Fluffer Nut loved training. She loved having a job. So I started entering her in local shows just for fun. Fluffer Nut won best in show at nationals last month. 50 thousand dollar prize. It was the best day of my life. I was ugly, crying while they put the ribbon on her. And she just stood there looking perfect, tail wagging like she'd always known she would. The champion. The local news picked up the story, rescue dog wins big with a photo of me and fluffernut and her trophy. I didn't think anything of it until Perry showed up at my house the next day. He walked right up to my porch and said, that's my dog. I want the prize money. I laughed in his face. He didn't laugh back. I'm serious. I have the original adoption paperwork from the shelter. You stole my property, I said. You told me to take her. You called her defective. He shrugged. I was joking. I never officially signed her over to you. I said. You left her outside in December with no food. She had frostbite on her ears when I took her to the vet. I have the records, he said. That doesn't matter. Legally, she's still mine. I said. I have three years of vet bills, training receipts and registration papers in my name. You have a piece of paper from the shelter you probably can't even find. He stepped closer. I'll sue you. I smiled. Do it. I'd love to show a judge the photos. I Took when I rescued her. I documented everything, Perry. Every sore on her body, every rib showing through her skin. Every day she went without water. I have time stamps. He went quiet. I said, you threw her away like garbage. You didn't train her. You didn't love her. You didn't even feed her. I'm the one who turned her into a champion. You don't get to show up now and pretend you had anything to do with this. He said, you owe me. I'm the reason you even have that dog. I said, get off my property and don't ever contact me about my dog again. He stood there for a second like he was thinking about arguing, then turned and walked back to his car. Fluffer nut sat at my feet the whole time, calm as anything, watching him go. He tried to sue anyway. The judge dismissed it in 20 minutes.",https://www.tiktok.com/@as645384/video/7582231820238884151,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

My mother called me selfish for refusing to give both my kidneys to my brother Tyler. She stood in my living room crying fake tears, saying I was killing him by keeping organs I didn't deserve. You have two healthy kidneys and Tyler has none. You could save him today if you weren't so heartless. Tyler destroyed his kidneys drinking a bottle of vodka everyday for 15 years. Started at 16, never stopped. Mom bought him his first bottle. Said boys needed to learn to handle liquor. When doctors warned him at 25 that his kidneys were failing, mom said they were being dramatic. When he needed his first dialysis at 30, she blamed the doctors for not trying harder. Now, at 32, both kidneys were dead. He needed a transplant or he'd die within a year. Mom's kidney wasn't a match. Dad's wasn't either. But mine were perfect. One kidney. I told her the first time she asked. I'll give him one. One isn't enough, she said. His body is weak. He needs both to have a real chance. Then I'd need dialysis forever. I'm 28. That's 50 years of machines keeping me alive. You're stronger than Tyler. You can handle it. This was classic mom. Tyler was her golden boy since birth. He got a car at 16. I got nothing. He got college paid for, but dropped out. I got student loans. He got Bailed out of jail three times. I got kicked out at 18 for getting pregnant. That pregnancy ended in miscarriage, but mom said I deserved it for being irresponsible. I became a nurse anyway. Worked three jobs to pay for school. Built a life without any help from the family that forgot I existed. Until they needed something. For 10 years, mom never called. Neither did Tyler. I found out about family events through Facebook. Wasn't invited to Tyler's wedding, Mom's 60th birthday, or Dad's retirement party. But now they needed my organs. So suddenly, I was family again. The harassment started after I said no. Mom called my work, told them I was having a mental breakdown. Called my landlord, said I was unstable. Called my boyfriend, told him I was a murderer who would let my own brother die. She showed up at my hospital during my shift. Everyone, look at the nurse who won't save her brother's life. She has two kidneys and won't share. Security escorted her out, but she came back the next day. And the next three weeks. She stalked me. Calling, texting, showing up everywhere. Tyler's dying because of you. You're selfish. What kind of sister watches her brother die? What she didn't know was that Tyler wasn't dying. Not really. He was on dialysis three times a week. Uncomfortable, but manageable. Could live for decades like that. I knew because I worked in the dialysis unit. Saw patients in their 70s who'd Been on machines for 20 years. Tyler just didn't want the inconvenience. Neither did mom. She wanted her perfect son back, not one attached to machines. So she decided I should be the one attached to machines instead. I finally called Tyler directly. Hadn't spoken to him in two years. Do you know Mom's demanding both kidneys? I asked. Yeah. He said so. So I'd be on dialysis forever. You understand that, right? You're younger. You'd adapt better. Plus, you don't have kids to worry about. Neither do you. But I might someday. You already tried and couldn't. He actually said that? Referenced my miscarriage like it was proof I didn't deserve working organs. That's when I decided to end this completely. I scheduled a meeting with Tyler's transplant team, told them about Mom's pressure, showed them her texts demanding both kidneys. The lead surgeon's face went dark. She wants you to donate both? That's not even legal. We'd never approve that. Turns out mom had been telling Tyler the team would do it if I agreed. Complete lie. The surgeon called mom and Tyler immediately.

We need to talk when I get home. Soul left my body. I had maybe 30 minutes before they got back. 30 minutes to save my entire life. So I did the dumbest, most unhinged thing I could think of. I went on Amazon, found the most expensive calculator I could spend. 60 of my own money. And bought it with same day shipping. When it arrived, I ripped open the box, tossed the packaging, and scratched it up a little so it looked used. Then I sat at the kitchen table doing homework, calculator out, looking like the most dedicated student in America. They walked in my mom's face, said she was ready to end me. I looked up, calm as anything. What's wrong? She crossed her arms. The calculator. Fee. Your teacher has no idea what I'm talking about. I pointed at the calculator. Yeah, this is it. Probably just forgot to send the email to parents. It was in the student portal, though. My dad looked at the calculator, then at my mom. See? He's got it right there. The school just didn't communicate. Well, my mom wasn't convinced. She stared at me like she was trying to read my thoughts, but she couldn't prove anything. Two days later, the universe handed me a miracle. The school sent out an email.",https://www.tiktok.com/@asd26493ntk/video/7582225412709797134,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

My mother called me selfish for refusing to give both my kidneys to my brother Tyler. She stood in my living room crying fake tears, saying I was killing him by keeping organs I didn't deserve. You have two healthy kidneys and Tyler has none. You could save him today if you weren't so heartless. Tyler destroyed his kidneys drinking a bottle of vodka everyday for 15 years. Started at 16, never stopped. Mom bought him his first bottle. Said boys needed to learn to handle liquor. When doctors warned him at 25 that his kidneys were failing, mom said they were being dramatic. When he needed his first dialysis at 30, she blamed the doctors for not trying harder. Now, at 32, both kidneys were dead. He needed a transplant or he'd die within a year. Mom's kidney wasn't a match. Dad's wasn't either. But mine were perfect. One kidney. I told her the first time she asked. I'll give him one. One isn't enough, she said. His body is weak. He needs both to have a real chance. Then I'd need dialysis forever. I'm 28. That's 50 years of machines keeping me alive. You're stronger than Tyler. You can handle it. This was classic mom. Tyler was her golden boy since birth. He got a car at 16. I got nothing. He got college paid for, but dropped out. I got student loans. He got Bailed out of jail three times. I got kicked out at 18 for getting pregnant. That pregnancy ended in miscarriage, but mom said I deserved it for being irresponsible. I became a nurse anyway. Worked three jobs to pay for school. Built a life without any help from the family that forgot I existed. Until they needed something. For 10 years, mom never called. Neither did Tyler. I found out about family events through Facebook. Wasn't invited to Tyler's wedding, Mom's 60th birthday, or Dad's retirement party. But now they needed my organs. So suddenly, I was family again. The harassment started after I said no. Mom called my work, told them I was having a mental breakdown. Called my landlord, said I was unstable. Called my boyfriend, told him I was a murderer who would let my own brother die. She showed up at my hospital during my shift. Everyone, look at the nurse who won't save her brother's life. She has two kidneys and won't share. Security escorted her out, but she came back the next day. And the next three weeks. She stalked me. Calling, texting, showing up everywhere. Tyler's dying because of you. You're selfish. What kind of sister watches her brother die? What she didn't know was that Tyler wasn't dying. Not really. He was on dialysis three times a week. Uncomfortable, but manageable. Could live for decades like that. I knew because I worked in the dialysis unit. Saw patients in their 70s who'd Been on machines for 20 years. Tyler just didn't want the inconvenience. Neither did mom. She wanted her perfect son back, not one attached to machines. So she decided I should be the one attached to machines instead. I finally called Tyler directly. Hadn't spoken to him in two years. Do you know Mom's demanding both kidneys? I asked. Yeah. He said so. So I'd be on dialysis forever. You understand that, right? You're younger. You'd adapt better. Plus, you don't have kids to worry about. Neither do you. But I might someday. You already tried and couldn't. He actually said that? Referenced my miscarriage like it was proof I didn't deserve working organs. That's when I decided to end this completely. I scheduled a meeting with Tyler's transplant team.

We were so excited, but also terrified because I'd had an early miscarriage the year before that devastated us. My doctor said everything looked good, but recommended waiting until after 12 weeks to tell people just to be safe. We decided Thanksgiving would be perfect since the whole family would be together and we'd be at 14 weeks by then. I only told my brother Leo and my cousin Amy because they both knew about the miscarriage and kept checking on me. They promised not to tell anyone and actually kept their word. My sister Gina is 34 and has four kids and thinks that makes her the pregnancy expert of the family. She called me the week before Thanksgiving asking if I had any news to share. I said no, just looking forward to seeing everyone. She said I seemed different lately and wondered if something was going on. I changed the subject to her kids, and she let it go, but I could tell she was suspicious. The thing about Gina is she literally cannot keep information to herself. When I got into my master's program, I told her first because I was so excited and Wanted to share with my sister. She called her mom an hour later and announced it before I could. When Oliver proposed, I called her, crying happy tears, and she immediately posted about it online, tagging our entire family before I could tell anyone myself. When I got promoted at work, she told everyone at Sunday dinner before I arrived. She. She always says she's just so excited for me, she can't help herself. But it's really about her being the one with information to share. So this time, Oliver and I agreed we wouldn't tell her until we told everyone. Thanksgiving came, and after dinner, I stood up and said we had an announcement. I told everyone we were expecting and due in may. Everyone started cheering and hugging us, except Gina, who just stared at me. Then she started crying. Not happy tears, but angry tears. She asked how long I'd known, and I said about six weeks. She lost it. She stood up and yelled that I was supposed to tell her first. She said she told me about all four of her pregnancies before anyone else, and I'd betrayed her by not doing the same. She said sisters were supposed to share everything, and I'd made her look stupid. My mom tried to calm her down, but Gina turned on her and asked if she knew. When my mom said no, Gina asked who did know. Amy and Leo stayed quiet, but Gina figured it out. And started screaming at them, too, for keeping secrets. She. She said the whole family was against her and treating her like she couldn't be trusted. My dad told her to calm down and be happy for me, but she said, how could she be happy when I deliberately excluded her from the most important news? She said I'd ruined our relationship and she'd never forgive me for making her the last to know. Then she went after Oliver, saying he turned me against my own sister. Oliver said we just wanted to wait until we were sure everything was okay. Gina said that was stupid because she would have supported me either way, and now she felt like I didn't consider her real family. She actually said the words, real family tells each other everything immediately. The irony was incredible, coming from someone who spoiled every important moment I'd ever had. My brother Leo finally spoke up and said, maybe if Gina could keep her mouth shut for once, people would tell her things. Gina threw her wine glass at the wall, and it shattered everywhere. My four year old nephew started crying. My mom started crying. Gina's husband Jake tried to get her to leave, but she refused. She said she wasn't going anywhere until I apologised for humiliating her. I said I wasn't apologizing for protecting my own announcement. She said I was a terrible sister and she was done with me. She told her kids to Get their coats and started packing up the dishes she brought. While she was dramatically shoving Tupperware into bags.

My mother called me selfish for refusing to give both my kidneys to my brother Tyler. She stood in my living room crying fake tears, saying I was killing him by keeping organs I didn't deserve. You have two healthy kidneys and Tyler has none. You could save him today if you weren't so heartless. Tyler destroyed his kidneys drinking a bottle of vodka everyday for 15 years. Started at 16, never stopped. Mom bought him his first bottle. Said boys needed to learn to handle liquor. When doctors warned him at 25 that his kidneys were failing, mom said they were being dramatic. When he needed his first dialysis at 30, she blamed the doctors for not trying harder. Now, at 32, both kidneys were dead. He needed a transplant or he'd die within a year. Mom's kidney wasn't a match. Dad's wasn't either. But mine were perfect. One kidney. I told her the first time she asked. I'll give him one. One isn't enough, she said. His body is weak. He needs both to have a real chance. Then I'd need dialysis forever. I'm 28. That's 50 years of machines keeping me alive. You're stronger than Tyler. You can handle it. This was classic mom. Tyler was her golden boy since birth. He got a car at 16. I got nothing. He got college paid for, but dropped out. I got student loans. He got Bailed out of jail three times. I got kicked out at 18 for getting pregnant. That pregnancy ended in miscarriage, but mom said I deserved it for being irresponsible. I became a nurse anyway. Worked three jobs to pay for school. Built a life without any help from the family that forgot I existed. Until they needed something. For 10 years, mom never called. Neither did Tyler. I found out about family events through Facebook. Wasn't invited to Tyler's wedding, Mom's 60th birthday, or Dad's retirement party. But now they needed my organs. So suddenly, I was family again. The harassment started after I said no. Mom called my work, told them I was having a mental breakdown. Called my landlord, said I was unstable. Called my boyfriend, told him I was a murderer who would let my own brother die. She showed up at my hospital during my shift. Everyone, look at the nurse who won't save her brother's life. She has two kidneys and won't share. Security escorted her out, but she came back the next day. And the next three weeks. She stalked me. Calling, texting, showing up everywhere. Tyler's dying because of you. You're selfish. What kind of sister watches her brother die? What she didn't know was that Tyler wasn't dying. Not really. He was on dialysis three times a week. Uncomfortable, but manageable. Could live for decades like that. I knew because I worked in the dialysis unit. Saw patients in their 70s who'd Been on machines for 20 years. Tyler just didn't want the inconvenience. Neither did mom. She wanted her perfect son back, not one attached to machines. So she decided I should be the one attached to machines instead. I finally called Tyler directly. Hadn't spoken to him in two years. Do you know Mom's demanding both kidneys? I asked. Yeah. He said so. So I'd be on dialysis forever. You understand that, right? You're younger. You'd adapt better. Plus, you don't have kids to worry about. Neither do you. But I might someday. You already tried and couldn't. He actually said that? Referenced my miscarriage like it was proof I didn't deserve working organs. That's when I decided to end this completely. I scheduled a meeting with Tyler's transplant team. Told I'm about Mom's pressure. Show them her texts demanding both kidneys. The lead surgeon's face went dark. She wants you to donate both. That's not even legal. We'd never approve that. Turns out mom had been telling Tyler the team would do it if I agreed. Complete lie. The surgeon called mom and Tyler immediately.

So I announced her biggest secret. Me and my husband Oliver found out I was pregnant in early October after trying for two years. We were so excited, but also terrified because I'd had an early miscarriage the year before that devastated us. My doctor said everything looked good, but recommended waiting until after 12 weeks to tell people just to be safe. We decided Thanksgiving would be perfect since the whole family would be together and we'd be at 14 weeks by then. I only told my brother Leo and my cousin Amy because they both knew about the miscarriage and kept checking on me. They promised not to tell anyone and actually kept their word. My sister Gina is 34 and has four kids and thinks that makes her the pregnancy expert of the family. She called me the week before Thanksgiving asking if I had any news to share. I said no, just looking forward to seeing everyone. She said I seemed different lately and wondered if something was going on. I changed the subject to her kids, and she let it go, but I could tell she was suspicious. The thing about Gina is she literally cannot keep information to herself. When I got into my master's program, I told her first because I was so excited and Wanted to share with my sister. She called her mom an hour later and announced it before I could. When Oliver proposed, I called her, crying happy tears, and she immediately posted about it online, tagging our entire family before I could tell anyone myself. When I got promoted at work, she told everyone at Sunday dinner before I arrived. She. She always says she's just so excited for me, she can't help herself. But it's really about her being the one with information to share. So this time, Oliver and I agreed we wouldn't tell her until we told everyone. Thanksgiving came, and after dinner, I stood up and said we had an announcement. I told everyone we were expecting and due in may. Everyone started cheering and hugging us, except Gina, who just stared at me. Then she started crying. Not happy tears, but angry tears. She asked how long I'd known, and I said about six weeks. She lost it. She stood up and yelled that I was supposed to tell her first. She said she told me about all four of her pregnancies before anyone else, and I'd betrayed her by not doing the same. She said sisters were supposed to share everything, and I'd made her look stupid. My mom tried to calm her down, but Gina turned on her and asked if she knew. When my mom said no, Gina asked who did know. Amy and Leo stayed quiet, but Gina figured it out. And started screaming at them, too, for keeping secrets. She. She said the whole family was against her and treating her like she couldn't be trusted. My dad told her to calm down and be happy for me, but she said, how could she be happy when I deliberately excluded her from the most important news? She said I'd ruined our relationship and she'd never forgive me for making her the last to know. Then she went after Oliver, saying he turned me against my own sister. Oliver said we just wanted to wait until we were sure everything was okay. Gina said that was stupid because she would have supported me either way, and now she felt like I didn't consider her real family. She actually said the words, real family tells each other everything immediately. The irony was incredible, coming from someone who spoiled every important moment I'd ever had. My brother Leo finally spoke up and said, maybe if Gina could keep her mouth shut for once, people would tell her things. Gina threw her wine glass at the wall, and it shattered everywhere. My four year old nephew started crying. My mom started crying. Gina's husband Jake tried to get her to leave, but she refused. She said she wasn't going anywhere until I apologised for humiliating her. I said I wasn't apologizing for protecting my own announcement. She said I was a terrible sister and she was done with me. She told her kids to Get their coats and started packing up the dishes she brought. While she was dramatically shoving Tupperware into bags. I stood up and said, if we were sharing everything like real family, then everyone should know that Gina had been texting her ex boyfriend Ryan for the past six months. Jake froze. Gina went white.

She married my ex fiance six months after I caught them in bed together. I was not gonna let this one slide. The wedding was in 48 hours when my mom called, frantic. Your sister collapsed at her dress fitting. They rushed her to the hospital. What happened? They don't know yet. She's getting tests. Can you come to the hospital right now? I dropped everything and drove straight there. My hands shook on the wheel. Rochelle and I hadn't spoken in 18 months. Not since I found her with Devon. But she was still my sister. I ran through the parking lot, called my dad while sprinting. What room? Fourth floor, 4:20. Hurry! The elevator took forever. I took the stairs two at a time, burst through the door, ran down the hallway. I pushed inside, breathing hard. Rochelle sat up in bed, pale. My parents flanked her. Devon held her hand. What happened? Is she okay? My mom's face crumpled. They found something. Thyroid cancer, Rochelle said quietly. Stage two. The room spun. I grabbed the door frame. They found it during blood work on her yearly check up. Dad explained. She's been tired, losing weight. We thought it was wedding stress. When did you find out? I asked. Four months ago, Rochelle whispered. I didn't want anyone to worry. I wanted one normal thing before everything became about being sick. Devon Squeezed her hand. That's why we moved the wedding up. She starts treatment next month. The doctors say with treatment she has good odds, mom added. But the next year will be brutal. Radiation, possible surgery. Rochelle looked at me. I'm sorry I uninvited you. I was scared you'd ruin your wedding. Yeah, I was planning to. My mom gasped. What? I called the venue pretending to be Rochelle and changed details. I told the caterer there were peanut allergy. I sent the bridesmaids the wrong dresses. I told Devon's groomsmen the wrong bachelor party location. Rochelle went white. No wonder everything's falling apart. Every vendor called this week and said confusion about Times, Menus, locations. I thought we were dealing with incompetent people. It was me. I said all of it. I wanted to destroy your wedding because I was angry. I couldn't finish. The weight crushed me. The caterer quit yesterday, mom said quietly. The photographer almost failed. Three bridesmaids bought the wrong dresses and can't get the right ones in time. Michelle started crying. I just want had one perfect day before my life becomes hospitals and chemo and maybe dying. You're not going to die, Devon said firmly. You don't know that. And now my wedding is ruined because my sister hates me. I don't hate you, I said, but my actions said otherwise. The wedding is in 48 hours, dad said, looking at me. Can you fix this? I spent the next 48 hours fixing Everything. Venue, caterer, dresses, photographer. By Saturday, it was perfect. The bridal suite. I told Rochelle. I fixed everything. Your wedding will be perfect. Why? She asked, after everything I did these past few months? Because I saw your medical records. You had a consultation six months ago before Devin. You already suspected something was wrong. She went. Still, he was cheating on you, she whispered. I found out six months ago. He wouldn't stop, so I slept with him to force you to leave. With my diagnosis, I figured I wouldn't be around long enough for you to hate me forever. But then you fell in love with him. I said, no. No, I'm marrying him because dying alone terrifies me. Devin appeared. It's your turn now. Tell her the truth, Rochelle said. He looked at the floor. I cheated on you more than 10 times. But when Rochelle got sick, I changed. I showed up to every appointment, every test. I actually fell in love with her. I didn't plan to fall in love, Rochelle cried. I just wanted to save you from making the biggest mistake of your life. My sister had betrayed me to save me. My ex had changed, and I'd almost destroyed their wedding out of spite. You're getting married today, I said. And, Rochelle, you're beating this cancer. I'm going to every single chemo appointment, whether do you want me or not. We hugged and cried. The makeup artist sighed. I need another 30 minutes. The wedding was perfect. When they asked if anyone objected, I stood. Everyone gasped. I, I object to how they got together, I said, but I support where they ended up. It got a laugh from everyone, even from them. Three years later, at her daughter Hope's baptism, Michelle pulled me aside. I left those medical records out on purpose. I knew you'd read them and figure it out. I was too scared to just tell you. She manipulated me into forgiving her. And it worked.",https://www.tiktok.com/@as83956/video/7582218992509603102,2025-12-16 05:46:38.066289,2025-12-16,reused_from_yesterday

Everyone started cheering and hugging us, except Gina, who just stared at me. Then she started crying. Not happy tears, but angry tears. She asked how long I'd known, and I said about six weeks. She lost it. She stood up and yelled that I was supposed to tell her first. She said she told me about all four of her pregnancies before anyone else, and I'd betrayed her by not doing the same.

My brother Perry has always collected things he couldn't take care of. Cars rusting in his yard, tools he never used. And for a few terrible years, animals. It started with a cat he saw at a shelter and just had to have. Then another cat, then a dog, then three more dogs. Then, for some reason, a goat. He'd get so excited bringing them home, posting pictures online, telling everyone what a great rescue dad he was. Then he'd get bored. The dogs ended up chained outside in all weather. The cats lived in filthy cages in his garage. I don't even know what happened to the goat. I begged him to let me help. I said I'd come over and feed them, walk them, anything. He told me to mind my own business. They're fine. Animals are tougher than you think. Animal control got called twice by his neighbours. Both times he cleaned up just enough to pass inspection, then went right back to neglecting them. I started sneaking over when he was at work, just to give them food and water. I'd sit with the dogs for a few minutes, let them remember what it felt like to be touched by someone who wasn't screaming at them. One winter, I came over and found a German Shepherd puppy shivering in a broken plastic crate with no food, no water, and sores all over her. Legs from lying in her own waste. She was maybe five months old, and she looked at me with these huge, huge, terrified eyes. And I just couldn't leave her there. I put her in my car and drove away. I called Perry from my driveway and told him I was keeping the dog and he could call the cops if he wanted. He laughed. Take her. She's defective anyway. Wouldn't stop crying. I took the other animals, too. Over the next few months. Every time I asked, he said yes because he was bored of them by then. I rehomed the cats and the other dogs to people I trusted. But I kept a German Shepherd. I named her fluffer nut because she had this ridiculous, fluffy tail that didn't match the rest of her body. She was terrified of everything at first. Loud noises, sudden movements, men, other dogs, the vacuum, the T V, her own shadow. I spent months just sitting on the floor with her, letting her come to me, teaching her that not every hand was going to hurt her. Slowly, she started to trust me. And once she did, I realised what an incredible dog she was. Smart, athletic, eager to learn, beautiful. A friend of mine who does dog shows watched her run in my backyard one day and said, you know she could compete, right? I laughed it off at first, but Fluffer Nut loved training. She loved having a job. So I started entering her in local shows just for fun. Fluffer Nut won best in show at nationals last month. 50 thousand dollar prize. It was the best day of my life. I was ugly, crying while they put the ribbon on her. And she just stood there looking perfect, tail wagging like she'd always known she would. The champion. The local news picked up the story, rescue dog wins big with a photo of me and fluffernut and her trophy. I didn't think anything of it until Perry showed up at my house the next day.

My brother Perry has always collected things he couldn't take care of. Cars rusting in his yard, tools he never used. And for a few terrible years, animals. It started with a cat he saw at a shelter and just had to have. Then another cat, then a dog. Then three more dogs. Then, for some reason, a goat. He'd get so excited bringing them home, posting pictures online, telling everyone what a great rescue dad he was. Then he'd get bored. The dogs ended up chained outside in all weather. The cats lived in filthy cages in his garage. I don't even know what happened to the goat. I begged him to let me help. I said I'd come over and feed them, walk them, anything. He told me to mind my own business. They're fine. Animals are tougher than you think. Animal control got called twice by his neighbors. Both times he cleaned up just enough to pass inspection, then went right back to neglecting them. I started sneaking over when he was at work, just to give them food and water. I'd sit with the dogs for a few minutes, let them remember what it felt like to be touched by someone who wasn't screaming at them. One winter, I came over and found a German Shepherd puppy shivering in a broken plastic crate with no food, no water, and sores all over her. Legs from lying in her own waste. She was maybe 5 months old, and she looked at me with these huge, huge, terrified eyes. And I just couldn't leave her there. I put her in my car and drove away. I called Perry from my driveway and told him I was keeping the dog and he could call the cops if he wanted. He laughed. Take her. She's defective anyway. Wouldn't stop crying. I took the other animals, too. Over the next few months, every time I asked, he said yes because he was bored of them by then. I rehomed the cats and the other dogs to people I trusted, but I kept the German Shepherd. I named her fluffer nut because she had this ridiculous, fluffy tail that didn't match the rest of her body. She was terrified of everything at first. Loud noises, sudden movements, men, other dogs, the vacuum, the TV, her own shadow. I spent months just sitting on the floor with her, letting her come to me, teaching her that not every hand was going to hurt her. Slowly, she started to trust me. And once she did, I realized what an incredible dog she was. Smart, athletic, eager to learn, beautiful. A friend of mine who does dog shows watched her run in my backyard one day and said, you know she could compete, right? I laughed it off at first, but Fluffer Nut loved training. She loved having a job. So I Started entering her in local shows just for fun. Fluffernut won best in show at nationals last month. 50 thousand dollar prize. It was the best day of my life. I was ugly crying while they put the ribbon on her. And she just stood there looking perfect, tail wagging like she don't always known she was a champion. The local news picked up the story, rescue dog wins big with a photo of me and fluffer nut and her trophy. I didn't think anything of it until Perry showed up at my house the next day.

So I announced her biggest secret. Me and my husband Oliver found out I was pregnant in early October after trying for two years. We were so excited, but also terrified because I'd had an early miscarriage the year before that devastated us. My doctor said everything looked good, but recommended waiting until after 12 weeks to tell people just to be safe. We decided Thanksgiving would be perfect since the whole family would be together and we'd be at 14 weeks by then. I only told my brother Leo and my cousin Amy because they both knew about the miscarriage and kept checking on me. They promised not to tell anyone and actually kept their word. My sister Gina is 34 and has four kids and thinks that makes her the pregnancy expert of the family. She called me the week before Thanksgiving asking if I had any news to share. I said no, just looking forward to seeing everyone. She said I seemed different lately and wondered if something was going on. I changed the subject to her kids, and she let it go, but I could tell she was suspicious. The thing about Gina is she literally cannot keep information to herself. When I got into my master's program, I told her first because I was so excited and Wanted to share with my sister. She called her mom an hour later and announced it before I could. When Oliver proposed, I called her, crying happy tears, and she immediately posted about it online, tagging our entire family before I could tell anyone myself. When I got promoted at work, she told everyone at Sunday dinner before I arrived. She. She always says she's just so excited for me, she can't help herself. But it's really about her being the one with information to share. So this time, Oliver and I agreed we wouldn't tell her until we told everyone. Thanksgiving came, and after dinner, I stood up and said we had an announcement. I told everyone we were expecting and due in may. Everyone started cheering and hugging us, except Gina, who just stared at me. Then she started crying. Not happy tears, but angry tears. She asked how long I'd known, and I said about six weeks. She lost it. She stood up and yelled that I was supposed to tell her first. She said she told me about all four of her pregnancies before anyone else, and I'd betrayed her by not doing the same. She said sisters were supposed to share everything, and I'd made her look stupid. My mom tried to calm her down, but Gina turned on her and asked if she knew. When my mom said no, Gina asked who did know. Amy and Leo stayed quiet, but Gina figured it out. And started screaming at them, too, for keeping secrets. She. She said the whole family was against her and treating her like she couldn't be trusted. My dad told her to calm down and be happy for me, but she said, how could she be happy when I deliberately excluded her from the most important news? She said I'd ruined our relationship and she'd never forgive me for making her the last to know. Then she went after Oliver, saying he turned me against my own sister. Oliver said we just wanted to wait until we were sure everything was okay. Gina said that was stupid because she would have supported me either way, and now she felt like I didn't consider her real family. She actually said the words, real family tells each other everything immediately. The irony was incredible, coming from someone who spoiled every important moment I'd ever had. My brother Leo finally spoke up and said, maybe if Gina could keep her mouth shut for once, people would tell her things. Gina threw her wine glass at the wall, and it shattered everywhere. My four year old nephew started crying. My mom started crying. Gina's husband Jake tried to get her to leave, but she refused. She said she wasn't going anywhere until I apologised for humiliating her. I said I wasn't apologizing for protecting my own announcement. She said I was a terrible sister and she was done with me. She told her kids to Get their coats and started packing up the dishes she brought. While she was dramatically shoving Tupperware into bags. I stood up and said, if we were sharing everything like real family, then everyone should know that Gina had been texting her ex boyfriend Ryan for the past six months. Jake froze. Gina went white.

She married my ex fiance six months after I caught them in bed together. I was not gonna let this one slide. The wedding was in 48 hours when my mom called, frantic. Your sister collapsed at her dress fitting. They rushed her to the hospital. What happened? They don't know yet. She's getting tests. Can you come to the hospital right now? I dropped everything and drove straight there. My hands shook on the wheel. Rochelle and I hadn't spoken in 18 months, not since I found her with Devon. But she was still my sister. I ran through the parking lot, called my dad while sprinting. What room? Fourth floor, 4:20. Hurry! The elevator took forever. I took the stairs two at a time, burst through the door, ran down the hallway. I pushed inside, breathing hard. Rochelle sat up in bed, pale. My parents flanked her. Devin held her hand. What happened? Is she okay? My mom's face crumpled. They found something. Thyroid cancer, Rochelle said quietly. Stage two. The room spun. I grabbed the door frame. They found it during blood work on her yearly checkup. Dad explained he's been tired, losing weight. We thought it was wedding stress. When did you find out? I asked. Four months ago, Rochelle whispered. I didn't want anyone to worry. I wanted one normal thing before everything became about being sick. Devin squeezed Her hand. That's why we moved the wedding up. She starts treatment next month. The doctors say with treatment, she has good odds, mom added. But the next year will be brutal. Radiation, possible surgery. Rochelle looked at me. I'm sorry I uninvited you. I was scared you'd ruin your wedding. Yeah, I was planning to. My mom gasped. What? I called the venue pretending to be Rochelle and change details. I told the caterer there were peanut allergies. I sent the bridesmaids the wrong dresses. I told Devon's groomsmen the wrong bachelor party location. Rochelle went white. No wonder everything's falling apart. Every vendor called this week, Devon said. Confusion about Times, Menus, locations. I thought we were dealing with incompetent people. It was me. I said all of it. I wanted to destroy your wedding because I was angry. I couldn't finish. The weight crushed me. The caterer quit yesterday, mom said quietly. The photographer almost bailed. Three bridesmaids bought the wrong dresses and can't get the right ones in time. Rochelle, I started crying. I just wanted one perfect day before my life becomes hospitals and chemo and maybe dying. You're not going to die, Devon said firmly. You don't know that. And now my wedding is ruined because my sister hates me. I don't hate you, I said, but my actions said otherwise. The wedding is in 48 hours, dad said, looking at me. Can you fix this? I spent the next 48 hours fixing everything. Venue, caterer, dresses, photographer. By Saturday, it was perfect. In the bridal suite, I told Rochelle, I fixed everything. Your wedding will be perfect. Why? She asked, after everything I did these past few months? Because I saw your medical records. You had a consultation six months ago before Devin. You already suspected something was wrong. She went. Still, he was cheating on you, she whispered. I found out six months ago. He wouldn't stop, so I slept with him to force you to leave. With my diagnosis, I figured I wouldn't be around long enough for you to hate me forever. Then you fell in love with him. I said, no. I'm marrying him because dying alone terrifies me. Devin appeared. It's your turn now. Tell her the truth, Rochelle said. He looked at the floor. I cheated on you more than 10 times. But when Rochelle got sick, I changed. I showed up to every appointment, every test. I actually fell in love with her. I didn't plan to fall in love, Rochelle cried. I just wanted to save you from making the biggest mistake of your life. My sister had betrayed me to save me. My ex had changed, and I'd almost destroyed their wedding out of spite. You're getting married today, I said. And, Rochelle, you're beating this cancer. I'm going to every single chemo appointment whether you want me or not. We hugged and cried. The makeup artist sighed. I need another 30 minutes. The Wedding was perfect. When they asked if anyone objected, I stood. Everyone gasped. I object to how they got together, I said, but I support where they ended up. It got a laugh from everyone, even from them. Three years later, at her daughter Hope's baptism, Michelle pulled me aside. I left those medical records out on purpose. I knew you'd read them and figure it out. I was too scared to just tell you. She manipulated me into forgiving her. And it worked.

If I win, he gives me 20 bucks. Bet you can guess what happened. So I take the test. The first couple minutes are light work, then it starts getting harder, but I'm still cooking. I finish, get my results 83. Now I've never been a bad student or anything, so I'm thinking, all right, 83 sounds pretty solid. Average has to be like 70 or something. So I send it to him all smug. And then I find out that 70 is considered a mental disability. My friend calls me dying of laughter and sends his score 115. That's like 40 points higher than mine!

Then when we get our results, they'll sigh all dramatic like, uh, I definitely bombed this one. Pull out a perfect score like it's nothing. At this point, I'm convinced they're not even human. They're running on cheat codes. Meanwhile, I'm over here treating a C plus like I just qualified for the Olympics. Subscribe.

So I moved all 12 cars to a secret location in the middle of the night. Today she texted me from her first apartment paid with her own paycheck. I've been obsessed with cars since I was 5. While other kids collected baseball car, I collected die cast models and worked every job I could find starting at 14. Every dollar went into my dream car's savings account. My parents thought it was cute until it wasn't. By 28, I owned 12 classic cars worth $1.8 million. Each one I personally restored. 1969 Dodge Charger, 1971 Plymouth Hemi Kuda, 1963 split window Corvette, hundreds of hours of my blood and sweat wet. I lived modestly, drove a ten year old civic and spent Saturdays in my garage bringing machines back to life. Then came Sunday dinner. You have all those cars just sitting in storage. My dad said if you sold even half, you could buy Emily a nice house. My 20 year old sister who'd graduated community college six months ago and hadn't looked for a single job. Those cars aren't things said. They're my business, my retirement. Your obsession. Dad interrupted. When are you going to grow up and think about someone other than yourself? That's when I realized they'd been researching, planning this ambush. Emily helped us look up the values online. Mom admitted you're sitting on nearly $2 million while your Sister can't afford rent. Emily lived at home rent free. I left that night and made a decision. Over the next week, I rented five storage units two towns over under an LLC name. Every night at 2:00am, I moved one or two cars. By Friday, my garage was empty. Saturday morning, three cars pulled into my driveway. My parents, Emily and my uncle, a real estate agent. They let themselves in with a spare key. Mom stopped dead seeing the empty garage. Where are they? I sold them. I lied. You moved them, Emily said coldly. You hid them from us. They're my cars. We're your family, mom screamed. My uncle tried reasoning. I found a beautiful three bedroom for Emily, only $350,000. That's maybe two of your cars, dad.

Last year, my son Ben started kindergarten. He was 5, tiny for his age, but sharp, the kind of kid who notices everything. We just moved to a new town and he was still adjusting, still nervous about making friends. I remember the night before his first field trip. He was so excited. He laid out his clothes on the floor like a paper doll, Spider Man shirt, blue jeans, his little Velcro sneakers. He kept asking me if I'd packed enough snacks. I must have kissed him 20 times before he went to bed. The field trip was to a local nature center only 30 minutes away. Ben's teacher, Miss Calloway, seemed strict but sweet kind of teacher who still wore sweaters with apples on them and wrote smiley faces in red pen. She said she was new to town, had just moved from out of state, and this was her first year teaching at our school. I didn't love that she never responded to emails and always seemed rushed during pickup up, but I chalked it up to being overwhelmed. That morning, something felt wrong. I couldn't explain it. I checked his backpack three times. I followed the bus with my eyes until it turned the corner. I even called the school to make sure they had my emergency contact info, which I'd already given them twice. Around one PM while I was at work, I got this sharp Feeling in my chest, like my stomach dropped, but I was still standing. I texted the school just to check in. No reply. I waited 10 minutes, still nothing. Then I did something I'd never done before. I left work, got in my car and drove to the nature center. I didn't call ahead. I just drove. When I got there, I didn't see the school bus in the lot. I ran inside. A woman at the front desk looked confused when I asked about the kindergarten field trip. They never checked in, she said. Are you sure they were supposed to come today? I called the school again. This time someone answered. It was the receptionist. They just realized the kids aren't back yet. She told me the bus was supposed to return over an hour ago. My heart dropped. I gave her the address to the nature center. She paused. That's not where they went. She said it was changed last minute to a park across town. Didn't Miss Calloway tell you? No, she did not. I got in my car and sped to the other park. When I got there, the bus was parked. Kids were scattered across the play. A few teachers sat on benches. But something was off. There were only two adults watching 20 kids. No sign of Miss Calloway. I scanned the playground. No Ben. I ran to one of the aides. Where is my son Ben? Tiny Spider Man shirt. She blinked. He went to the bathroom with Miss Calloway About 20 minutes ago. I didn't wait. I bolted toward the public bathrooms near the edge of the park. They were locked. Pounded on the door, no answer. I started screaming his name. A park employee heard me and came running with a key. When he opened the door, I rushed in. Ben was inside alone, crying. His pants were still around his ankles, red marks on his wrists. The look on his face, terror, betrayal. Miss Calloway was nowhere to be seen. We called the police. Turns out.

My daughter Ella is 8 months old and I was changing her diaper in the nursery when my sister Molly showed up. I just gotten Ella on the changing table when my phone started buzzing in my back pocket. I turned my head for literally two seconds to silence it and I heard this sickening thud. Ella had rolled right off the table onto the hardwood floor. She started screaming immediately. I dropped to my knees next to her and her little arms were reaching up for me, but I kept my hands hovering near her head without touching her. Molly's footsteps pounded down the hallway. What happened? I ran into the room and when she saw Ella on the floor, she lunged forward. I threw my arm out and blocked her. Don't touch her. Molly stared at me. What are you talking about? She's crying. She fell on her head. We can't move her. I already had my phone out and was dialing 9, 1, 1. Are you insane? Pick your baby up. No. Molly reached around me and I had to shift my whole body to block her. Move out of my way. Right now. Her hands were on my shoulders trying to push me aside, but I didn't budge. The 9, 1 1 operator answered and I started explaining what happened while Molly kept trying to get past me. This is Insane, just pick her up. I can't. It could make it worse. Ella's face was bright red and both her arms were stretched up toward me. Your daughter is screaming in pain and you're just kneeling there doing nothing. I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to do. This is so cruel. Molly's voice cracked. You're torturing her. She needs her mother. She needs her mother to protect her spine. The operator told me to keep Ella still and watch for any changes. Molly started pacing behind me. I can't watch you do this to her. This is sick. Ella kept crying and reaching, and I kept my hands near her without moving her. The paramedics finally showed up and came into the nursery. One of them knelt down next to me. Molly moved forward and the other paramedic held up his hand. Ma'am, step back, please. I'm her aunt and I think you need to know she left this baby on the floor for 15 minutes. Step back. He turned to me.

This all started when she got stuck in the washing machine. So like any normal 10 year old would, I gave her some dummy backshots for some background. Me and my stepsister and I have always had a friendly relationship. She's a few years older than me, and I can't deny that she's pretty attractive. She's got this long, wavy hair that frames her face perfectly. But most importantly, she got some humongous mommy milkers. Holy moly, I could water both them for hours. But anyways, I've never thought of her in that way, of course. But a few days ago, I was home alone, just chilling on the couch, when I heard some noise coming from the laundry room. I went to investigate and found my stepsister stuck in the washing machine. Her body was fully wedged in there. She must have been trying to reach something that had fallen behind the machine. Her behind was sticking out, facing me. I rushed towards her, panicking that she could be hurt. I grabbed her waist and started pulling, trying to get her unstuck. I honestly think she got stuck due to her mommy milkers being so huge. As I felt her soft skin and the curve of her body beneath my hands, I started to lose control. So I told her that I'd seen this before in a movie, and the only way to get her unstuck was by the power of Back shots. Surprisingly, she agreed and I started taking her to Pound Town. Holy guacamole, did she have a gorilla grip? I almost passed out. Sadly this didn't work. So like any ten year old, I turned on the washing machine and went back to watching TV.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2 to 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our eight year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I forgotten How to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids have been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. Transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and for being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. The court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex. I'm out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for school, family photos covering our refrigerator.

I was at a nail salon getting my French tips done when. Then the door gently opened and this huge guy walked in. Broad shoulders, full beard, construction boots, covered in dust. The kind of man who looks like he builds houses with his bare hands. He was holding hands with a little girl who couldn't have been older than six. They walked up to the counter. He cleared his throat. Two appointments, please. One for her, one for me. They sat down at the stations. The nail tech smiled at the little girl. What colour do you want, sweetie? She lit up like a Christmas tree. Sparkly pink. The tech turned to the dad. And for you, sir? His voice dropped, almost a whisper. Same colour we're matching today. The dad was nervous as soon as the nail tech started working. You could see it in everything he did. The way he kept his shoulders hunched, the way he kept glancing around to see if people were watching. They were. Everyone was, including me. We all had the same question. Why was he getting his nails done? His daughter noticed him tense up. She reached over and squeezed his big hand with her tiny fingers. It's okay, daddy. You're gonna look so pretty. He smiled at her, but his eyes were still darting around the room. For a few minutes, everything was fine. Just the sound of Nail files. Then a voice cut through the salon. I'm sorry, but is no one going to say anything? I turned around. Woman in her 50s getting acrylics done two chairs over. Designer bag, expensive highlights, face full of judgment. She was staring directly at the man. This is a women's safe space. The dad's whole body tensed up. He didn't respond, just stared down at his hands. His daughter stopped swinging her legs. She looked confused. You're making everyone in here uncomfortable. The woman continued, gesturing dramatically at the room. Isn't he making you all uncomfortable? Nobody answered. We were all too shocked to speak. She took our silence as agreement. See? They're all scared of you. They won't even say it out loud because they don't know what you'll do. The dad finally spoke. Voice low, calm. Ma'am, I'm just trying to be here for my daughter. Please leave us alone. She shot back. No, this is weird. This is creepy. Not going to pretend it's okay. The little girl's face was starting to crumble. Then the woman did something unforgivable. She leaned forward in her chair, looked directly at the little girl. Sweetie, do you think this is normal? Your daddy getting his nails done like a little girl? The dad shot to his feet. Do not talk to her! Oh, now he's getting aggressive. Everyone see that? She looked around the room. This is what I was worried about. Violent and creepy. Dad sat back down. His jaw was clenched, but the woman kept going. What kind of man comes into a nail salon and asks for sparkly pink polish? She laughed to herself. I'll tell you what kind. The kind who's looking for excuses to creep on women. The dad said nothing, just held his daughter's hand. The woman tilted her head. What does your wife think about you checking out other women, huh? Does she know you're here? The dad's whole body went rigid. His daughter looked up at him. Her eyes were filling with tears. He still didn't answer. The salon manager finally came out from the back room. Ma'am, I'm going to need you to lower your voice. Lower my

My Japanese grandmother called me bakachan from the day I was born. I thought it meant little treasure or precious jewel in Japanese. She would pat my head and say bakachan with such warmth in her voice. I felt like the most special grandchild in the world when she said it. In fourth grade, I did a family tree project explaining how bakachan was a sacred Japanese. It showed how much my grandmother cherished me above all her other grandchildren. My teacher, who I now realize spoke Japanese, kept making strangled noises and spilling her coffee. I thought she was just emotional about my beautiful cultural presentation. I begged my parents for a bakuchon themed birthday party. We had custom napkins printed with Bakuchon Sweet 16 in Japanese characters. The Japanese bakery tried to refuse our order three times, kept suggesting alternatives like birthday girl or literally anything else. My mom had to pay triple to convince them. For my 18th birthday, I got bakuchan tattooed on my wrist and beautiful Japanese characters. The tattoo artist, clearly Japanese, made me sign five different waivers. He kept muttering in Japanese and showing me pictures of butterflies and cherry blossoms instead. I insisted on bakuchan because I wanted authenticity. He photos of the consent forms while shaking his head. My college application essay centered around being called bakachan and what it meant to me. I wrote about How this precious nickname connected me to my Japanese heritage. I explained how it represented unconditional love and acceptance in Japanese culture. I got into several schools and was convinced my touching essay made the difference. Freshman year, I decorated my dorm room with a giant neon sign saying Wakachan's Palace in Japanese. My Korean roommate took one look and immediately requested a room transfer. When I explained the beautiful meaning, she just patted my shoulder sadly and doubled her transfer request. I assumed she was intimidated by my cultural authenticity. I joined the Asian Student Union and introduced myself as wakachan. At every event, the Japanese exchange students would freeze and then whisper frantically to each. One girl actually laughed out loud before her friend elbowed her hard. I thought they were impressed by how connected I was to Japanese traditions. My boyfriend got property of bakuchan printed on a hoodie for Valentine's Day. His Japanese roommate saw it and laughed so hard he needed his inhaler. When my boyfriend wore it to the International Student Mixer, the entire Japanese Student Association took group photos with him. I thought they were admiring our cross cultural romance. Junior year, I finally got to study abroad in Tokyo. At customs, I proudly declared Watashi wabakachandeisu. The officer dropped his stamp and called his supervisor over. They had a heated discussion in rapid Japanese while staring at my passport. I assumed they were impressed by my perfect pronunciation. I made friends with a Girl who seemed constantly on the edge of telling me something. She'd start sentences, then stop herself and shake her head. One day she asked.

I wished her luck, filed for divorce, and let her discover our prenup protected everything. I pull 140 K in software sales. Not rich, but comfortable. But then her college roommate married some hedge fund guy, and suddenly our life wasn't enough. Why can't we go to Bali like they did? Her ring is three carrots. Mine is barely one. The comparisons never stopped. Three weeks ago, I came home from a brutal client meeting. She was scrolling through vacation photos on her phone. We should go to the Maldives, she said without looking up. Maybe next year. I've got that commission coming in December. She finally looked at me. Next year? It's always next year with you. We just went to Mexico in March. Mexico? She said it with pure disgust. Her husband took her to Italy for two weeks. First class private tours. I sighed. I'm not a hedge fund manager. You knew that when you married me. That's when her expression changed. Cold, contemptuous. You know what? You're right. I did know that. And I'm tired of settling. Settling for your mediocre income and your mediocre ambitions. She's stood up. You can't afford what I want. Then stay out of my way. I'll find someone who can. The words hit like ice water. I just stared at her. Are you serious right now? Dead serious. I'm not spending the rest of My life pinching pennies while my friends live actual lives. Either step up or step aside. Something in me just clicked off. Pleading, the trying, the hoping. Gone. Good luck with that, I said calmly. She blinked, surprised. Probably expected me to beg or promise to work harder. What good luck finding someone who can afford your champagne taste. I walked to my office, pulled out the file folder I'd hoped I'd never need, and called my attorney. By morning, I handed her divorce papers with her coffee. We're done. My attorney will be in touch. Her face went through confusion, shock, and rage. You're divorcing me over one argument? No, I'm divorcing you because you told me I'm not enough and you're looking for someone richer. That's pretty clear. I was just upset you told me to step aside so you could find someone else. I'm stepping aside permanently. Here's what she didn't know. We had a prenup. A solid one. My lawyer uncle insisted on it before the wedding. She'd signed it without really reading it. Too excited about wedding planning. Before we met, I had inherited 280 K from my grandmother and invested it well. By the time we got married, it had grown to 420K. That money stayed separate. The prenup protected it entirely. Plus my startup equity from before we met. She'd been looking at our total net worth, around 700 to 80 k combined, thinking she'd walk away with half of everything she had. No idea. At mediation two weeks later, her lawyer started strong. My client is seeking a fifty 50 division of all marital assets, including investment accounts, retirement funds and home equity. Plus $3,000 monthly spousal support. My attorney slid a document across the table. Prenup agreement signed by both parties six years ago. Her lawyer started reading, then stopped. Read it again. His expression shifted. You signed this? He asked her. Yeah, like six years ago, before the wedding. It's just standard stuff, right? Did you read it? I mean, I

Eight year old Emma said it innocently at breakfast. Daddy, why does Mommy's belly get big when you go on work trips, but small when you come back? I laughed it off, but Emma was insistent. I measure with my hugs when you leave. My arms don't go all the way around when you come back. They do. Kids notice things adults miss. I traveled monthly for work, usually gone three to five days. Never paid attention to Laura's appearance changes. But Emma had been tracking it for years. That night, I watched Laura carefully. She looked normal. Same weight she'd been for years. But Emma showed me photos she'd taken. Look, daddy, Monday when you left, Laura's stomach slightly distended. And this morning? Flat. You're imagining things, sweetie, Laura said. But her voice was tight. I started paying attention. Next trip, I left a hidden camera. Not to spy, I just to understand what Emma was seeing. What I found was bizarre. Every night I was gone, Laura would go to the garage, returning looking six months pregnant, her belly massively distended, moving like something alive was inside. She's sleep like that, then return to the garage in the morning, coming back normal sized. The garage had a medical setup. IV stands, monitoring equipment, tanks of something. Laura was attaching something to herself, filling her abdomen with something that made her look pregnant. Came home a day early, Didn't tell her. Found her in the garage at midnight. Tubes connected to her stomach, fluid pumping into her distended belly. She screamed when she saw me. It's not what it looks like. But what did it look like? My wife inflating herself like a balloon every night I was gone. I can explain, she said, frantically disconnecting tubes. Saline solution. She'd been filling her abdomen with saline, litters of it, giving herself the appearance and weight of pregnancy. Why? Was all I could manage. She started crying. I lost the baby three years ago. The miscarriage when you were in Chicago. But I couldn't let it go. When you're gone, I pretend I'm still pregnant. Still carrying our son. We'd lost a pregnancy three years ago. I've been traveling. Came home to Laura in the hospital. We'd grieved, moved on. Or I thought we had. Every time you leave, I panic. Like you'll come back to loss again. So I recreate being pregnant. It calms me, makes me feel like he's still here. She'd Learned the technique from online forums. Women who'd lost pregnancies recreating the physical sensation. Saline injections that mimic the weight and movement of pregnancy. Temporary, reversible, deeply disturbing. It's safe. She assisted. Medical grade equipment. Sterile technique. The saline absorbs overnight. This isn't safe. This is mental illness. But to Laura, it was therapy. The weight in her belly made her feel complete. The movement of fluid mimicking baby kicks. She'd even bought a Doppler To play heartbeat sounds.

My wife and I were supposed to fly cross country to help our 21 year old daughter Jess move into her first apartment. It should have been a proud moment, a weekend of family Celebration and seeing our little girl start her next chapter. But anyone who's ever travelled with my wife knows it's never that simple. I'm the type who packs two days early, double checks every detail and gets to the airport at least two hours before boarding. My wife, she's the queen of chaos. Always late, always saying relax, we'll make it. Spoiler, we usually don't. Last year during Parents Weekend, I told her we needed to leave the house by 8:00am for our 10:00am flight. She didn't roll out of bed until 7:40. Then came the shower, breakfast and makeup routine as if she had all day. We didn't leave until 9, hit traffic and missed the flight by 15 minutes. I stood at the gate watching the plane pull away. We lost $800 rebooking and missed half the weekend with Jess. My wife's reaction, a shrug and, well, these things happen. So this time I swore I wouldn't let it happen again. I woke up at 6, packed everything, checked us in online, printed the boarding pass and made coffee. I shook her awake five separate times before she finally got out of bed groaning about how unreasonably early I was making her travel. By some miracle, we made it to the air airport with over an hour to spare. I was ecstatic. She, on the other hand, complained that we were way too early. Then she saw a Starbucks just before security. Oh, perfect, she said, veering toward it like a moth to a flame. I need coffee for the flight. I told her, absolutely not. Security lines were already forming and we didn't have time to waste. She rolled her eyes. Relax, it's just coffee. Five minutes. Against my better judgment, I let her. I told her I'd go ahead through security and wait at the gate. 15 minutes later, I was through and sitting at the gate. No texts, no calls. Boarding was in 25 minutes. I texted her asking where she was. No response. Ten minutes passed. I called. She finally answered, sounding annoyed that I'd interrupted her. The line's really long, but I'm almost up, she said. I told her to forget the coffee and get through security now. She scoffed, I've already waited this long. I'm not leaving now. Unbelievable. 10 minutes until boarding, no sign of her. I called again. She said she just got her drink and was heading to SEC security. I told her she needed to run. Security takes at least 15 minutes. She told me I was being dramatic. Five minutes to boarding, my phone buzzed again. Now she was mad. The lines way longer than I thought. Why didn't you warn me? I reminded her that I did warn her multiple times. She said, tell them to hold the plane. They don't hold planes for people ordering caramel macchiatos. Final boarding call. The gate agent picked up the mic. That practiced tone in her voice. Final call for flight 2, 68 to Boston. I stood up, scanning the hallway. Nothing. Just families and business travelers who'd somehow managed to arrive on time. My chest tightened. I pictured Jess waiting for us at her new apartment, excited to see her parents. I pictured missing that moment again because my wife couldn't skip her Starbucks. So I made a decision. I texted her, I'm boarding the plane. You'll have to catch the next one. I'm not missing this trip with Jess again. Then I walked up, scanned my boarding pass and stepped onto the jetway alone. My phone buzzed not non stop as I found my seat. Texts, missed calls, more texts. I switched to airplane mode and stared out the window as the plane taxied away. For the first time in years, I felt calm. When I landed three hours later, my phone blew up with six, 57 unread messages and 13 missed calls. The first few were furious. I can't believe you left me. You're unbelievable. You embarrassed me in front of everyone. Then they turned pitiful. I'm trying to get on the next flight. They're charging me extra. Can you help? Please call me by the Time I reached Jesse's place, my wife had finally landed. She walked through the door exhausted, holding yet another cup of Starbucks. Just ran up to hug her, asking what happened. My wife started spinning the story about how I'd abandoned her. I just looked at her and said quietly, no, I left for the flight on time. You missed it for coffee that's on. You just stared between us, speechless. My wife went silent. Later that night, Jess pulled me aside and whispered, I love mom, but I can't believe she almost ruined today for coffee. I nodded, yeah, me neither. My wife and I haven't talked much since. She's still upset I left her behind, but I'm done apologizing for her choices. I made my flight. I made it to Jess's big day. And for once, I didn't have to miss a single moment because someone couldn't get her caffeine fix in time.

They were planning a dinner party while I buried David, while their grandchildren watched their father's casket lowered into the ground. I didn't stop for pizza. I drove home in silence. My daughter Emma gripping my hand. My son Lucas crying himself into hiccups. My parents Lexus was blocking my garage. Through the window, I saw strangers drinking wine in my living room. My mother had rearranged my furniture. My father was making drinks at David's desk. Where's the pizza? Mom snapped. When I walked in. I stood in my funeral dress. Get out of my house. She laughed. Excuse me. My children are in the car crying because we just buried their father. Get out. Mom's hand connected with my cheek, a sharp slap that echoed through the silent room. One simple task and you couldn't even do that. Dad grabbed my arm and shoved me against the wall. Framed photo of David and the kids fell, glass shattering.

We've been together since high school. Eight years total. Started dating when she was 17 and I was 18. She was the one who asked me out, which surprised everyone, because she'd been crushing on me for months. I said yes immediately. Best decision I ever made. Or so I thought. From day one, she'd say things like, you're way out of my league. Or, I can't believe you're with someone like me. At first, I thought it was cute, kind of endearing. But after eight years, it started to bother me. I tell her constantly that I loved her, that looks don't matter, that she's the only person I wanted. She just smile and say, I know. But I could tell she didn't actually believe it. Our life together was solid, though. Both landed decent jobs after college. Me at 55 K doing IT work, and her at 48 K in marketing. Got a small house together 2 years ago. Nothing fancy, but it was ours. Started talking seriously about marriage, looking at rings online, discussing timelines. My mom loved her, her parents loved me. Everything was perfect. Except for that one insecurity that wouldn't die. Here's the thing about me. I'm not some player. I've got five best friends from childhood. All guys, zero female friends. I don't go to clubs or bars without her. Maybe twice a week I'd hit the gym with my buddies. After work, usually Home by eight PM. I'm active on Instagram, post pictures of us constantly, stories of our dates, the whole relationship, flex. And yeah, I'd get DMs from random girls, probably two or three a week. I'd either ignore them, tell them I have a girlfriend, or just block them. Never even entertained a conversation. She was the opposite. Went out with her girlfriends every weekend, came home around 3:00am most Saturdays. I never cared because I trusted her completely. I'm not a jealous person. If anything, I encouraged her to have her own life outside of us. Last Tuesday night I was at the gym with my boys. We did this brutal leg day and afterwards my friend Noah invited us back to his place to play video games and order pizza. I was exhausted and figured why not? Immediately texted my girlfriend at 9:47 p. M. Saying staying at Noah's tonight. Super tired. Sent my location and everything. She just read it. No response. So that was normal for her when she was out with friends. Next morning I had to be up at 4:00am for work. My alarm went off and I heard the front door open. Checked my phone.

Rule 2, breakfast for dinner is not a treat. It's a lifestyle. We're having pancakes at nine PM every Friday. If you complain, you're grounded, but still getting pancakes. Rule 3, candy tax doesn't exist. If I catch you hiding snacks, I'm giving you more for being smart and sneaky. That's strategy, not trouble. Rule 4, chores are games. Now whoever makes the funniest folding style does the least work. If you lose, sorry, you're vacuuming with sunglasses on. Rule 5, video games are unlimited. You're not wasting time. You're training for esports. Rule 6, no curfews. If you're out late, just text me. I'm alive with a random emoji. That's all I need. And for punishments, they make zero sense. Forget to take out the trash. Boom, no vegetables for a week. Talk back to me now. You have to stay up past midnight watching movies and eating popcorn with me because quality time is the real consequence. So yeah, if I was a parent, it'd be pure chaos, but fun chaos.

The winner's prize was 120 million. Here, a bottle of water cost 15. A sandwich cost 40. Everyone said I was doomed. They didn't know that I was a sophisticated dirt poor. The game was right up my alley. I would be the only player walking out of hell. Together with 99 other players, I transmogrified into a game world. A system's electronic voice sounded, welcome to the dirt poor game. Initial fun $50. Objective survive in the game for seven days. The winner receives a 120 million prize. Overspending death or leaving the game zone will be considered elimination, resulting in a 120 million debt. The voice paused, tinged with slinness. Now, any cowards want to quit? Quit? Are you kidding me? A young guy with bleached blonde hair scoffed, seven days I could survive just drinking water. A chubby kid nearby in a cheap T-shirt wiped his sweat. Yeah, yeah. 50 bucks for bagels and peanut butter. Stretching it should be enough. Fortune favors the bold. Only an idiot would quit. The crowd buzzed with blind excitement. Finally, not one of the 100 players quit. The system announced, game rules activated. Players cannot quit. 100 players deployed. Welcome to Airport Odyssey. May you survive. Well, there was a flash of white light, and I found myself in an airport. The airport was massive, stretching as far as one could see. People streamed past. I couldn't tell. If a person was a player or an NPC. I checked the interface. My game account held a quiet 50 dollar initial funds. There were 3 stats hunger, thirst, energy. All were currently full. I saw a convenience store across the way and walked over to check prices. As I reached the fridge, a tearful cry exploded. Holy shit! It was the chubby kid from before, staring horrified at the store's cooler. A bottle of water is $15! Highway robbery! I walked over, my eyes scanning the shelves, my heart sinking to the pit of my stomach. 50 for a cupcake, 40 for a sandwich. Bagels 10 for each. Even the cheapest pack of Graham crackers was 18. And just over seven dollars a day for us. Not even enough to pay for half a bottle of water. The kid looked at me, despair written all over his face. Player 66 sis, we're screwed! Fifty bucks are only enough for three bottles of water a week! We'll die! I sighed. The system isn't doing charity. I knew it wouldn't be that simple. Other players crowded the store, also showing shock and panic. The kid pulled me aside. Miss, I'm player 44. Buddy, let's team up. It'll be good to have company in the game. If anyone messes with you, I can handle them. He did a quick set of martial arts moves, fairly smooth, but not wanting to team up with anyone until I understood the game rules, I politely Declined, I left the convenience store alone. My priority was finding water. Free water

Categories for everything, looks, personality, cooking, loyalty. And the last column, performance in bed, scored 1 to 5. My name was at the bottom, dead last, 2.8 out of 5. The comments destroyed me. Talks too much, tries too hard to impress his friends. He could definitely upgrade. And next to my bedroom score, Lucas wrote four words, starfish just lays there.

Nicole was aiming into her pillow. Brianna just kept saying, I knew it. I knew something was off. Someone suggested we just dump them and move on, but that felt too easy. These guys thought they were untouchable. They needed to feel what we did. We compared notes, found more dirt. Jasmine's boyfriend had been texting his ex the whole time.

She was just the girl who couldn't cut it. But here's what none of them knew. Jade was brilliant. She taught herself how to fix machines. Started with computers at 14, moved on to industrial equipment, got certified, started her own repair company at 20. By 22, she had three employees and contracts with hospitals across the state, including mine. Last year she made $127,000. I keep a spreadsheet of her earnings because I'm proud and scrapbooking is my love language. Last Sunday, we had family dinner at my parents house. My brother was complaining about his hospital's MRI machine being down for over a month now. Nobody can figure out what's wrong, he said, having at his food. We've called everyone. My heart started pounding because I saw an opportunity. Jade could fix it, I said, keeping my voice calm. Jade's legs started bouncing under the table nervously. She's certified. She's done work on equipment like that. Before the table went quiet, my brother looked at me like I'd lost my mind. Jade, he laughed loud and ugly. The girl who puked all over the cardiac wing. You want her touching million dollar equipment? I watched Jade sink into her chair. Her fork stopped moving. She, she runs her own company now. I said, she's a professional. My brother snorted, come on, be realistic. She's a loser who couldn't hack it in the real world. So she plays with tools in your garage? That's not a Career? That's a hobby. The rest of the family laughed while Jade's face went completely blank. And 30 years of silence ended right there. I stood up slow since family no longer supports family. I said, I'm withdrawing my support for Frederick's internship. My brother's face went white. What? You heard me? I'm one of three votes on the panel. Without me, he's done. Frederick, who had been sitting at the end of the table rolling his phone, finally looked up. My brother started shouting. My father slammed his hand on the table and demanded I sit down. I let them scream for about 30 seconds, watching the chaos like it was happening to someone else. And I held up my hand. One more thing I said, almost enjoying this. Jade made more money than me last year, more than anyone at this table. She's easily the smartest person in this family. And you just called her a loser. I looked at Jade. Some tears were streaming down her face, but she was smiling. Jade and I walked out together.

By disrespecting my daughter, I ruined something bigger. My family is filled with doctors, nurses and surgeons. If you don't wear scrubs, you don't matter. I'm head surgeon at my hospital and I'm one of three people on the panel that decide hides who gets hired as an intern. Three votes gets you in, two votes you're out. Simple math. So when my brother pulled me aside at my parents house last month, I knew exactly what he wanted to talk about. His son Frederick's intern application is in your pile. He needs this, need to make sure he gets through. Frederick is a bright kid, sure, but his grades weren't great and his interview scores were average. There were better candidates. My brother knew that. He didn't care. He's not the strongest applicant. I said carefully, I'd be going out on a limb. My brother waved his hand like I was being dramatic. You're on the panel. Just vote. Yes. That's all I'm asking. Here's the thing about my brother. In the 30 years he's been alive, he has never once helped me with anything. Not once. When I needed a reference for my first job, he was too busy. When my husband left me, he didn't call. When I was raising my daughter alone, he never offered to babysit, never checked in, nothing. But now he needed something. However, I nodded anyway because that's what I always did. Fine. I said, I'll vote for Him, my brother grinned like he'd won something. Family supports family, right? I just stood there thinking about what he did to Jade and now had the nerve to come asking for this. My daughter Jade never inherited family's love of medicine. When she was 10, my parents decided she needed exposure to the hospital. They dragged her into the cardiac wing for a procedure observation. Within three minutes, Jade turned green. They had someone's chest cracked open on the monitor and she could see the heart still beating, wet and red and alive. She made it four steps toward the exit before she projectile vomited across a forty thousand dollar ultrasound machine. The technician screamed. My father went pale. My mother apologized to everyone in the room. For 20 minutes straight, I just stood there laughing because what else could I do? My kid had just destroyed the most expensive equipment in the wing with her lunch. After that, Jade refused to step up. In a hospital. She was now and forever a germaphobe, terrified of blood and completely uninterested in anything my family considered a real career. To them, she was a failure. To my.

A couple of people gave me sympathetic looks, but most just went back to their workouts. Five minutes later, I was mid rep when I heard it, this sharp hop sound followed by the loudest scream I've ever heard in a gym. She was on the ground clutching her left knee. The bar, still loaded with 185 pounds, crashed beside her. The weights had rolled across the floor. She was crying hysterically. Grant dropped his dumbbells and ran over. Sydney jumped off the. The gym manager Griffin came sprinting from his office. Call 9, 1 1, Griffin shouted. Don't move her. Through her tears, she pointed directly at me. He distracted me. This is his fault. He was harassing me and I lost focus and now my knee is destroyed. Everyone turned to look at me. I just stood there absolutely stunned. Griffin knelt beside her, trying to keep her calm while we waited for paramedics. But he kept screaming about how I caused this, how I should be arrested, how she was going to sue me in the gym. The ambulance arrived 12 minutes later. Two paramedics loaded her onto a stretcher while she continued yelling accusations at me between sobs. After they left, Griffin pulled me into his office. My heart was, was I about to get banned, sued? Listen, he said, pulling up the security footage on his computer. I need to see exactly what happened here. We watched it together. The time stamp showed me approaching her at 6:47 a. M, talking for maybe 20 seconds, then walking away. At six, 48 am the camera clearly showed her putting her earbud back in, loading more weight onto the bar, and her spotter, some guy I didn't recognize, trying to get her attention and point at her form. She waved him off. Then at 6:00am, she went down for the squat. Her knees buckled inward and she collapsed. Five full minutes after I'd walked away. Zero distraction, just bad form. Finally catching up to her, Griffin looked at me and let out a long breath. She tried to warn you, man, I heard the whole thing. You were being genuinely helpful, so I'm not in trouble. He shook his head, you're fine. But she's going to have a problem. We have a zero tolerance policy for false accusations. When she's recovered enough to come back, she's getting a permanent ban. Two weeks later, I saw her at the physical therapy clinic next door go to the gym. She was on crutches with a heavy knee brace. Our eyes met for a second. She looked away first. I still work out there every morning at 6 a. M. Haven't seen her since. But I'll never forget the lesson. Some people would rather get hurt and accept help.

Mister Miller stopped mid sentence and stared at me like I had just set the classroom on fire. Did you really just do that? He asked in this deadly quiet voice that made everyone turn around to look at me. I had no idea what he was talking about because all I did was yawn since I stayed up way too late the night before and his lecture about the Revolutionary War was putting me to sleep. Do what? I asked him, and he pointed at Leo, the developmentally disabled kid who sat two rows behind me and always wore headphones during class. You just mocked that poor boy's facial tic right in front of everyone and you're going to sit there and play dumb? Mister Miller shouted while his face turned bright red. Leo has this thing where he scrunches up his face sometimes, and I guess Mister Miller thought my yawn was me making fun of him, which was absolutely insane. I literally just yawned because I'm tired, I told him, but he was already storming toward my desk with his finger in my face. You may as well have just called him an idiot with what you did, and I will not tolerate that kind of hatred in my classroom! He screamed. I looked over at Leo to see if he even noticed what happened, but he was just vibing with his headphones on and Complete, completely zoned out. Mr. Miller called the office and demanded that someone come deal with me immediately because he had a student with special needs being openly harassed. Mrs. Carlton showed up looking like she was ready to drag me out by my collar. She asked me why I thought it was acceptable to mock a developmentally disabled student in front of his peers, and I tried to explain that it was literally just a yawn, but she cut me off and said that Mister Miller was a 15 year veteran teacher who would never make a false accusation. Do you have any idea how hard Leo works just to get through a normal school day? Missus Carlton asked while shaking her head at me like I was the biggest disappointment she had ever seen. They brought me to the main office and sat me in the conference room while they called my parents, who arrived looking absolutely gutted. My mom wouldn't even sit next to me because she was so disgusted by what she thought I did. My dad kept saying he didn't raise me to be this kind of person. Missus Carlton started talking about how she had spent three years building Leo's confidence and how one cruel moment from a bully like me could undo all of that progress. Principal mentioned mandatory sensitivity training and a two week suspension and possibly transferring me to another school because Leo deserved to feel safe in his learning environment. Everyone in that room was looking at me like I was the worst person on the planet, and nobody would let me get a single word in to defend myself. The door suddenly opened and Mister Briggs walked in with Leo, who looked confused about why he was there. We wanted Leo to be part of this conversation so he can express how your actions made him feel, missus Finley said in this gentle voice, like Leo was made of glass. Leo looked around the room at all the adults and then looked at me and asked, why does everyone look so serious right now? The principal leaned forward and said, Leo, we brought you here because this student was mocking your disability. And essentially

She came to me begging to plant it back because her electric Bill tripled. About five years ago, I planted a big oak tree in my front yard. It grew fast. Within a few years, it was huge and beautiful. Provided amazing shade for my house and kept my yard cool. In summer, the branches hung over slightly into my neighbor's yard, maybe three feet over the property line. My old neighbors never cared. They loved it because it gave them shade, too. We had a good relationship. Everything was fine. Then they moved and I met Hannah. Hannah bought the house last spring. She was nice at first. We did the whole welcome to the neighborhood thing. I even brought her cookies. Then summer hit and everything changed. One day, I'm pulling into my driveway, and Hannah storms over. She looks angry. Your tree is dropping leaves in my yard. She says I have to clean them up every single day. I apologized and said it's what trees do. She wasn't having it. The branches are hanging over my property line. That's illegal. You need to cut them back. I told her I'd trim them when I had time. She said I had two weeks or she'd call her lawyer. I thought she was kidding. She wasn't. Two weeks later, I get a letter from an actual lawyer. It says I'm violating property laws, and if I don't trim the tree immediately, they'll sue me for damages and trespassing. Trespassing from a tree? I called a tree service and asked what it would cost to trim it. They said about $400. Then I asked what it would cost to remove the whole thing. They said 800. I thought about it for 10 seconds. Remove it, I said. The crew showed up three days later. Hannah came outside when she heard the chainsaws. She stood on her porch with this satisfied smile, like she'd won. I waved at her. She waved back. They cut down the

I've been going to this gym for three years. Same time every morning at 6 a m. Small place, maybe 40 members total, so you get to know the regulars pretty well. There's grant, who only does bicep curls, Sydney, who runs on the treadmill for exactly 45 minutes. And this new girl who'd started showing up about two months ago. She seemed nice enough at first, kept to herself, always wore matching workout sets, had those expensive wireless earbuds. But I noticed something concerning during her third week there. She'd been doing heavy squats every single morning, and her form was dangerously wrong. Knees caving inward, back completely rounded, going way below parallel with no control. I've been lifting for eight years and watched my best friend tear his ACL doing the exact same thing. He needed surgery and couldn't walk right for six months. I didn't want to be that guy who gives unsolicited advice, so I waited. Maybe she'd figure it out. Maybe someone else would say something. But after watching her load 185 pounds on the bar one Tuesday morning, I couldn't stay quiet anymore. That's serious weight with terrible form. Someone was going to get hurt. So during her rest period, I walked over and quietly said, hey, I don't mean to bother you, but I noticed your form on those squats looks a bit off. Mind if I show you a safer way? I just Don't want you getting injured. She pulled out one earbud and looked at me like I just asked for her social security number. Then she rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might get, fuck you, I have a boyfriend! She said loud enough for half the gym to hear. Stop trying to talk to me. I was completely confused. What? No, I was just trying to help with your form. Because she cut me off, her voice getting even louder. This is so creepy. I see you staring at me every morning. You're obsessed or something. Now people were definitely watching. Grant had stopped mid curl. Sydney slowed her treadmill. I wasn't staring. I tried to explain. I was concerned about your safety because your squat form could cause a serious injury. But she was on a roll now, performing for her audience. Oh my god. You probably followed me here. This is harassment. I'm a strong, independent woman who doesn't need some random guy mansplaining fitness to me. I've been training for six months. I know exactly what I'm doing. I raised my hands and surrender. Alright, my bad. Just trying to help. I walked back to the

I did not realize how much I missed actual connection. Day 35, my boss called me into his office. Your work quality has doubled this month. What changed? I told him about the bet. He said, whatever you are doing, keep doing it. Day 40, Emma was getting nervous. She invited me to every family event trying to trigger me.

She came to me begging to plant it back because her electric Bill tripled. About five years ago, I planted a big oak tree in my front yard. It grew fast. Within a few years, it was huge and beautiful. Provided amazing shade for my house and kept my yard cool. In summer, the branches hung over slightly into my neighbor's yard, maybe three feet over the property line. My old neighbors never cared. They loved it because it gave them shade, too. We had a good relationship. Everything was fine. Then they moved and I met Hannah. Hannah bought the house last spring. She was nice at first. We did the whole welcome to the neighborhood thing. I even brought her cookies. Then summer hit and everything changed. One day, I'm pulling into my driveway, and Hannah storms over. She looks angry. Your tree is dropping leaves in my yard. She says I have to clean them up every single day. I apologized and said it's what trees do. She wasn't having it. The branches are hanging over my property line. That's illegal. You need to cut them back. I told her I'd trim them when I had time. She said I had two weeks or she'd call her lawyer. I thought she was kidding. She wasn't. Two weeks later, I get a letter from an actual lawyer. It says I'm violating property laws, and if I don't trim the tree immediately, they'll sue me for damages and trespassing. Trespassing from a tree? I called a tree service and asked what it would cost to trim it. They said about $400. Then I asked what it would cost to remove the whole thing. They said 800. I thought about it for 10 seconds. Remove it, I said. The crew showed up three days later. Hannah came outside when she heard the chainsaws. She stood on her porch with this satisfied smile, like she'd won. I waved at her. She waved back. They cut down the

He called my parents to pick me up immediately. In his office, with my parents and two police officers, I found out the truth. Three weeks ago, a woman had robbed the corner store on Maple Street. The elderly owner, Mister Lord, had a heart attack during the robbery and died. The security camera was broken, but a witness saw someone in a gray sweater running from the. We've been trying to identify who was there that morning, Officer Hull explained. The witness said they saw a middle school student walk by right before it happened. That student would be our only witness who could identify the robber. My mom grabbed my hand. You think the robber came to the school? The substitute teacher who was here today didn't work for the district. Used a fake ID to get in. We think she was trying to identify which student could recognize her. I thought back to that morning three weeks ago. I had walked past the corner store like always. I remembered seeing someone in gray come out counting money. But I didn't really pay attention. I was late and listening to music. Did you. You see anyone that morning? Officer Hull asked. I closed my eyes, trying to remember. There was someone in gray. They bumped into me coming out of the store. Would you recognize them? That's when it hit me. This substitute teacher hadn't just been wearing a gray sweater. She'd been wearing the exact same Gray sweater. The same one with a small coffee stain on the sleeve. I'd noticed it when she pointed at the board. It was her, I said. The substitute teacher was the person I saw leaving the store. The police showed me a security photo from our school's entrance that morning. Even with her fake glasses and her hair different, I could tell it was the same woman from the corner store she came to identify. Which could place her at the scene. Officer Hall said once she found you alone in that corner, she knew you were the witness. You're very lucky Principal Hilton checked on the classroom. When he did, they caught her two days later trying to leave the state. Her name was Harley Dunlap, and she'd been robbing small businesses for months. She thought if she could identify me, she could either intimidate me into staying quiet or convince people I was an unreliable witness. Since I hadn't come forward yet.

We all looked at each other confused, but about half the class got up and moved. I stayed on the right with the kids whose parents were still together. Now, everyone who has a dog, stay standing. Everyone else, sit down. Three kids sat down on the left side. This was getting weird, but we kept following along because what else were we supposed to do? Right side. Anyone who walks to school, move to the back of the room. Me and four other kids moved to the back. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. Why did she need to know this stuff? Back row. Anyone who stops at the corner store on Maple Street before school, stay standing. Just me and Kaylee were left standing. My heart started beating faster. Kaylee, sit down. If you go there on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Kaylee sat down. I was the only one left standing in the back corner of the room. The substitute teacher stared at me for a long moment, then smiled. Perfect. Everyone returned to your normal seats. We all moved back, confused and whispering to each other. She started teaching math like nothing happened, but I couldn't focus. Why did she need to know my exact routine? At lunch, I told my friends about how creepy it was. George said maybe she was just doing some weird icebreaker activity, but Emma pointed out She never even told us her name. When we got back from lunch, the substitute was gone. Principal Hilton was there and instead looking serious. Class, I need to ask you all some questions about this morning. He had us recreate exactly where we stood during each sorting. He wrote down everyone's positions and took photos with his phone. When he got to me standing alone in the back corner, his face went pale. Did she say anything to you specifically? He asked me. No. She just stared at me, then had everyone sit.

He walked over and started looming over her. He talked about her lack of friends, her future, how she'd end up like her mother, broken and alone and addicted to drugs. How nobody here even cared that he was doing this to her. Sophie had stopped responding. She was just crying, hyperventilating on the floor. Get up! Mister Samuels said. She couldn't. I said, get up! He grabbed her arm and yanked. Somebody should do something, Emma whispered through her tears, but she didn't move. Not me, Jake muttered. I need this grade. Kane kept his eyes forward. Brianna didn't even blink. Mister Samuels dropped Sophie back down. Then he walked to his desk, sat down, started grading papers like nothing was happening. Sophie stayed on the floor, alone. Her sobs echoed through the silent room. Then suddenly, Karina slammed her hands on the desk. What is wrong with all of you? She stood up, looked around at every one of us. She's on the floor, and you're all just sitting there. Jake rolled his eyes, but nobody answered. Karina walked to Sophie. She knelt down, wrapped her arms around her, and helped Sophie to her feet. Sophie could barely walk. You just failed my exam! Said yelled. Karina spun around. Her face was red and wet. Then fail me! You think a grade matters more than a person? She looked at us, at Jake, still leaning back in his Chair at Brianna with her hands still folded. You're all pathetic. Every one of you. The door slammed behind her. We sat in silence for the remaining 32 minutes. The bell rang. Nobody packed up. We just sat there. Mister Samuels walked to the front. You're all probably wondering the same thing. What the hell just happened? He cleared his throat. 20 years ago, I lived in an apartment in Bridgeport. Every night, I heard a man screaming at his son. I heard things breaking and the little boy crying. The room was silent. I told myself it wasn't my business. Told myself I didn't want to get involved. He paused. One night, the screaming stopped mid sentence. Next morning, an ambulance came. That little boy had been thrown into a wall. He survived, but he has severe brain damage. He's 28 now and will never speak again. His voice cracked. I heard it happening every night for six months. I could have done something, but I didn't want to get involved. He looked at us. Hey. A girl collapsed on this floor. Crying, hyperventilating, begging me to stop. And you watched? We thought it was fake. Billy said quietly. Did you? Or did you hope it was? Because that was easier. Jake wasn't leaning back anymore. Some of you told yourselves it wasn't real. Some of you told yourselves a grade mattered more. Some of you just enjoyed the show. He stared at Jake when he said that. Nobody Looked at him. Karina is the only one who passed. He walked toward the door. And Sophie is fine. She's a theater student. I paid to be here. She's been coming to class for three months. So you'd believe she was real.

That's when I stopped trying. I stayed in my room, ate dinner after they finished. Left for school early, came home late. Started working at McDonald's. Just to have somewhere to be. Mom never asked where I was. Never asked about my shifts or how work was going. I'd hear her in my siblings rooms every night, reading them stories. She'd walk right past my open door without looking in. Last month, my sister asked why I'm never in family photos anymore. Mom told her he doesn't like taking pictures. I was standing right there in the kitchen, making myself dinner. She said it like I was invisible. My brother asked me last week if I even lived here anymore. He's 6. He genuinely didn't know. Two weeks ago, I walked into a recruiting office downtown. The army recruiter asked about my family situation. I told him everything. The birthdays, the photos, the invisibility. He didn't look surprised. Just slid the papers across his desk. I signed them that afternoon. Leave for basic training in three weeks. Mom doesn't know. Nobody knows. Except the recruiter and my dad. I wrote him a letter in prison. Told him everything. He wrote back the next week. Four pages. First time he's ever told me he's proud of me. Said he wishes he could have been there. Yesterday I started. I have 30. Two hundred dollars saved from birthday checks mom gave me. Over the years, she'd hand me an envelope from my dad's parents without saying a word. They still send me money every year. Still think I'm part of the family. They live in Florida and have no idea what's happening in this house. I'm taking everything that matters. My laptop I bought myself with McDonald's money. Clothes I paid for. The photo of me and dad from before prison. My old baseball glove he gave me. That's it. Everything else can rot in this house. My sister asked me yesterday if I'm going to college next year. I told her I'm leaving soon and won't be back for a while. She started crying, asked if it was because of her, because of something she did. I hugged her and told her I love her, that this has nothing to do with her. She's 8. She doesn't understand that mom chose them and forgot she already had a kid. My brother overheard and asked if I'm running away. I told him I'm joining the army. He asked if that means I'm going to be like the soldiers on TV. Three weeks, then I'm gone. Mom will probably notice I'm missing when she needs someone to watch my siblings while they go on their next family vacation without me.

Is it yours or someone else's? Maybe even your parents? For the thousandth time, I don't have a dang weapon, I screamed, crying so hard my eyes hurt. Mr Walker stepped forward. Ruby's a good student. Maybe she was framed. The system tracked her every second. She acted alone, the lead officer stated. They brought in the guidance counselor, the vice principal, even the librarian who I'd volunteered with every day after school to convince me to give up the act. All you're doing is making it worse on yourself, the lead officer said. Lying is a serious offense on top of everything. I'm not lying, I sobbed. I didn't care. I was ugly crying. Why won't anyone believe me? Technology doesn't lie or make mistakes, Principal Andrews stated cold and firm. A pair of s, W. A. T. Officers returned from tracing my entire morning route through the school. We've got nothing, ma'am. The lead officer frowned. Parents Have been called, including mine, all arriving with demands for answers. Simple. Andrew's flashy new system was becoming a major fail. Fine, let's see that video, the lead officer finally said. The crowd followed as we went into the security office. The space was tight as we all crammed into it like sardines. The security specialist typed into the computer and pulled up the footage by the lockers. Here I was handing Marissa a tampon outside of my locker. Stop it right there, the lead officer ordered. Can you clear it up? The image zoomed in. At first it was blurry, but then it cleared up by the second. In my hand, a purple wrapper with the name Tampax written in white cursive. Everyone was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. The security officer pulled up the a I deduction screen in glowing red text but detected weapon barrel. Principal Andrews's face went through 50 shades of purple to deep pink to white. Even the lead officer looked embarrassed as she uncuffed me without a word. I looked back at the principal, at Mister Walker and every adult who'd refused to believe me. I then picked up my purse, reaching for a tampon and handed it to a very mortified Marissa.

Lily has fallen asleep in class every day this week. She seems undernourished. Please contact me. Finally, I marched over to confront them. Her mother, still in pajamas at three PM with some shirtless stranger behind her, brushed me off. The free babysitting is great, but how I raise her is my business. She actually tried shutting the door on me, but her father was worse. Drunk and dismissive. Kids are resilient. You're not her father. Mind your own business and stop filling her head with that car crap. I tried calling the school counselor, who said they were monitoring the situation, but couldn't do anything without more evidence. I offered to be her official after school caregiver, and they jumped at it. He started sleeping on my garage couch daily. One Saturday at 6:00am, mom didn't come home last night. Dad says it's not his day. My garage slowly became Lily's second home, with spare clothes hanging on hooks and her own tool chest drawer stuffed with granola bars and clean socks. Homework spread across the hood. I even kept lunch money in my pocket for. And her parents inevitably forgot. The breaking point came when Lily showed up with bruises on her arm, four finger marks purple against her small bicep. Mom's boyfriend grabbed me. When I asked him to turn the TV down so I could sleep, she said quietly, something snapped. I Called CPS immediately and spread everything across my workbench. Photos of Lily shivering without a coat last winter, receipts from every meal I bought her, the teacher's notes about her falling asleep. Screenshots of her mom's desperate 2:00am texts. Everything I've been documenting for weeks. The CPS worker arrived within two hours. They interviewed Lily gently while I showed them my documentation. Two weeks worth. Her mother came home drunk during the interview and started screaming at me for kidnapping her daughter, calling me a creep and threatening to call the cops. The father showed up and couldn't explain why his custody days showed Lily at my house for 80% of the time. He actually asked, can't she just keep staying with him? By that evening, Lily was placed in emergency temporary custody with me while they investigated. Two weeks later, the court granted me official foster placement of Lily with a path toward adoption if her parents didn't complete their required programs. Her mother lost custody after failing three drug tests and never showing up to a single parenting class. Her father gave up his rights rather than do the required therapy, saying it was probably for the best anyway. When the judge finalized the adoption, Lily hugged me so tight I couldn't breathe. Can I call you dad now? She whispered. That was three years ago. The 67 Mustang we rebuilt together sits ready in our garage, waiting for her 16th birthday.

Mr Samuels walked into our final of AP psychology with nothing in his hands. Put everything away, he instructed. We did as he asked. The instructions are simple. He started. Stay in your seat. Keep your eyes forward no matter what you see or hear. For the next 50 minutes, do that and you pass. Leave your seat for any reason. You fail. Someone laughed. That's it. That's it. This was too easy. Mr Samuels hit play on his laptop. A horror clip started on the projector. Jump scares, dreaming Gore. Some people flinched. A few laughed nervously. Eyes forward, he reminded us. And the classroom door opened. A girl walked in, Sophie. She transferred in a few months ago, quiet, kept to herself, missed class a lot. You're late, Mr Samuel said. I'm sorry. My mom's car. I don't care about your excuses. I never have. His voice was different now, cold. Do you know what your problem is, Sophie? He said that completely unprompted. You think if you look sad enough, I will let you get away with not coming to class. Sophie's voice was small. That's not true. I've seen your transcripts, Samuels cut her off. These and F's everywhere. You're lazy, but boohoo, you cut yourself last year, so you expect the world to feel sorry for you? A kid named Jake leaned back in. His chair and whispered to his friend, dude, easiest a ever. We literally just have to watch. Sophie swallowed. I try really hard. You try really hard. Mr Samuels laughed. Is that what you tell your mother when she comes home exhausted from working 60 hour weeks because of you, Mr Samuels? Come on, Billy said from his seat. This is messed up. Then leave Billy doors right there. Of course you'll fail. Billy shifted in his seat, look down at his desk, stayed. Sophie's eyes were wet. Now please stop. Stop. What? The truth that your father walked out when you were 12 because of you. Stop, Sophie begged. Please stop. You know what your mother told the school counselor last month? Samuels continued. She said she wishes she never had you. She wouldn't say that she did. Did. I've seen the report. Jake nudged his friend again. Bro, she's actually crying. This is wild. No. Sophie's voice was barely a whisper. No, no, no. Brianna. The girl who sat front row every day and never missed an assignment kept her eyes locked straight ahead, hands folded, face blank, following the rules perfectly. You're a burden, Sophie, to your mother, to your brother, to everyone. Sophie backed into the wall. You're worthless. Completely worthless. She.

So I decided to ditch her as well. I was born when mom was 17 and dad was 19. They never married. Dad went to prison when I was 3 for substance possession, non violent stuff, but he got 15 years. Mom raised me alone until I was 10. That's when she married my stepdad. He had money, a nice house and suddenly mom seemed happy again. And I thought maybe things would get better. I was wrong. She got pregnant with my sister when I was 11, then my brother when I was 13. That's when I stopped existing to her. It started small. She'd forget to pack my lunch but never forgot theirs. She'd buy them new shoes for school and tell me to make my old ones work another year. When I made honor roll in eighth grade, she said, that's nice, without looking up from feeding my brother. But I kept trying. I joined the soccer team thinking she'd come to games. She came to one, left at halftime because my sister had a recital the next morning. My sister was 5. It was Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Every family photo on the wall was the four of them, stepdad, mom, sister, brother, professional shots at sea. There's beach photos, Christmas cards they mailed to relatives. I took the pictures, every single one. The breaking point was my 16th birthday. I came home from school Excited because mom had actually acknowledged it that morning, said we do something special. The house was empty. No cake, no balloons, no note on the counter. Two hours later, my phone buzzed. Took the kids to six flags. There's pizza money on the counter. Sorry, forgot you had school today. I didn't have school. It was Saturday. She forgot my birthday. It was on a Saturday. The pizza money was $10. A large pizza cost $15. When they got home at nine PM, my little sister ran into my room, bouncing with excitement. She told me about every ride, every game, the funnel cake they shared. She showed me the stuffed animal stepdad won her. She asked why I didn't come. I looked at my mom standing in the doorway.

I screamed back, trying to explain, shaking like I was in an earthquake. I don't have anything! A week? The new A I. Run security cameras had been in place for a week. Principal Andrews had an assembly practically glowing with excitement and pride, explaining how the cameras worked and how they'd be the latest in keeping our school safe. They'd be able to detect threats, alert the police immediately, and in real time. We will be the first school in the state with these cameras and the safest. Promised. Now here I was, face down, smelling the bleach of the linoleum floor, with a knee in my back. I was put into handcuffs and yanked up. A female officer searched my pockets and any other possible hiding place. They found nothing. Then they dumped my purse and backpack. Makeup, a couple of tampons, pencils, crumpled papers, and my car keys clattered to the floor in a mess. Nothing more. Officers showed up, racing in with the S W A T. Team and tow keeping weapons on me. My locker was wrenched open with a man in full body gear like he was trying to diffuse a bomb. Where is it? The officer Holding my arm so tight I was going to bruise. Demanded in my face. What did you do with it? I've no idea what you're talking about. The cameras found a weapon. They don't lie.

When I found eight year old Lily sitting on my porch at nine PM in just a thin T-shirt in 40 degree weather, I knew something was seriously wrong. Her lips were blue, shivering, too hard to talk. Mom said to wait here for you, she whispered through chattering teeth. I wrapped her in my jacket and brought her into my garage, where I've been restoring my 67 Mustang. I checked my phone. No texts, no calls from her mother. Lily hadn't eaten since breakfast. Her stomach was growling so loud I could hear it over the space heater. When I asked where her parents were, she just shrugged and said, mom went out with her new friend. Dad's in the back bedroom sleeping. Mom says they're getting divorced. She said it like this was normal. I made her Mac and cheese while she warmed up, watching her eat like she hadn't seen food in days, carefully savoring each bite. She fell asleep on the old couch I kept in the garage, still wearing my jacket like a blanket. Mother finally showed up at eleven thirty PM, stumbling and smelling like cigarettes and cheap wine. Thanks for watching her. You're the best, she slurred, not even noticing Lily had been crying for hours. That's when I started paying closer attention. Over the next two weeks, Lily showed up at my garage after school with no lunch money three days straight Mom forgot to go to the ATM, she'd say, but I could see the shame in her eyes. She wore the same frozen T-shirt for four days because the washing machine is broken and mom forgot to go to the laundromat. When it was her dad's custody days, she knock on my door at 7:00am because he wouldn't wake up to make her breakfast before school. He works really hard, she'd defend him. I started keeping Pop Tarts and juice boxes by my door. But slowly I watched Lily come alive. She'd hand me tools, remembering their names. After I told her just once, Phillip's head screwdriver, she'd say proudly, her eyes lighting up. When I was working on the carburetor, she'd lean in close, asking why each part mattered. Why does the engine need to breathe? She asked one day. And I explained it just like my dad had explained to me. She soaked up every word. One afternoon, she helped me sand down a rust spot, her little hands steady as she worked. My hands are gonna get rough like yours, she announced proudly. When she got her first callus, I had to turn away. She'd taken to wearing my old shop sweater, the sleeves rolled up five times, safety glasses perched on her nose. I'm your assistant, right? She'd ask. The best one I've ever had, I'd tell her. And mean it. One evening she fell asleep under my workbench, and when I tried to wake her, She mumbled, five more minutes.

But they forgot to uninvite one guest, and things did not go well for my parents. So I'm turning 18 in two days, and my parents had planned this huge party. We're talking 50+ people, catered food. The worst. I was actually excited for once, because they've been treating my golden child sister Amber, like royalty my entire life. While I got the scraps, Amber was supposed to leave for NYC three days before my birthday with her sorority friends. Perfect timing. I could finally have my day without her making it about herself. But then massive storms hit the Midwest, and all flights got canceled. The morning of my birthday, I wake up to Amber screaming downstairs about her ruined trip. My parents are in full damage control mode, apologizing to their precious princess like the weather is somehow their fault. Around noon, Amber storms into the kitchen where I'm helping set up and declares, if I can't be happy, then nobody gets to be happy. Cancel the party. I laughed think thinking she was joking, but my parents exchanged this look, and my mom actually said, honey, maybe we should postpone until Amber feels better. I lost my mind. Are you serious? It's my 18th birthday day! But they'd already made up their minds. Dad started texting everyone that I'd suddenly fallen ill with A severe migraine and couldn't have visitors. They specifically told people not to contact me because the phone would make my headache worse. I spent the day locked in my room crying while Amber got pampered downstairs with her favorite takeout and a spa day mom organized to cheer her up. By seven PM, I'm sitting in the living room in my birthday dress, waiting for guests who will never come. That's when my parents finally told me what they'd done. The fight that followed was nuclear. I screamed about 18 years of favoritism. Every birthday they'd ruined, every achievement they'd ignored because Amber needed attention. Amber came downstairs and had the audacity to call me self fish and entitled. I snapped and grabbed her hair. We were on the floor throwing punches when the doorbell rang. My parents froze.

I'm a digital artist, been doing commissions online since I was 14. My Instagram has 40,000 followers. But Mrs. Fisher didn't know any of that because I kept my art life completely separate from school. The assignment was simple, create an original piece in any medium. No restrictions on style or subject matter. Just had to be our own work. I chose to paint my grandmother. She passed away last year and I had this photo of her from the 1970s that I loved. She's sitting in her garden laughing at something off camera. I spent two weeks on it, oil on canvas, 16 by 20 inches. I worked on it every night after homework, sometimes until 2:00am, getting every wrinkle right, every strand of silver hair. I probably did 30 layers on her face alone. When I turned it in, I felt proud. It was the best traditional work I'd ever done. Class critique day arrived and Missus Fisher held my painting up. First she stared at it with this weird expression. Then she spoke. This is a printed image probably generated by AI and transferred to canvas. The entire room went dead silent. I felt my stomach drop. What? No, I painted that. She cut me off. I've been teaching art for 25 years. I know real student work when I see it. She turned to address The class this, this is exactly what's wrong with your generation. You think you can use technology to fake talent and no one will notice. She said students like me were destroying artistic integrity, that she wouldn't tolerate cheating in her classroom. She wrote a zero in her grade book, academic dishonesty, said she'd be reporting it to the administration. I sat there stunned. My hands were shaking. A few classmates gave me sympathetic looks, but nobody said anything. Here's the thing though. I document everything. It's part of my process and it protects me when clients try to dispute work. For this painting, I had my phone set up on a tripod running a time lapse app that captured every single session. I didn't say anything for the rest of class, just packed up. When the bell rang, Missus Fisher stopped me at the door. I hope you understand this is a serious violation. You'll need to meet with your counselor about academic and integrity. I just nodded and left. But instead of going to my next class, I pulled out my phone in the hallway. 47 hours and 32 minutes of footage condensed into a 12 minute video showing the entire process from blank canvas to finished painting. I also pulled up my Instagram, my portfolio, website, screenshots of my commission queue, the gallery exhibition from last month. Then I walked straight to the principal's office. Missus Wallace, the principal knows me because I did a mural in The main hallway last year. She looked surprised when I came in without an appointment. I explained the situation, showed her the painting photo, then the time lapse. We watched about 15 minutes, watched me mix colors, build up layers on the canvas, reference the photo tape to my easel. Her expression got more serious with each minute. She picked up her desk phone and called Missus Fisher's classroom, asked her to come to the office immediately. Missus Fisher walked in. Ten minutes later, looking annoyed, Missus Wallace turned her computer monitor around. Missus Fisher, I need you.

Let me explain how insane this is. When my sister was 18, she got pregnant from some guy she met at a party. She didn't even know his last name. My parents are hardcore religious and told her abortion was a sin, so they forced her to carry to term the entire pregnancy. She complained about how this was ruining her life. When the baby was born, my sister refused to eat, even hold her. The nurses had to basically force her to try breastfeeding. She lasted two days in the hospital before she told my parents she was done and wanted to put the baby up for adoption. My parents refused. They said it would look bad to their church friends. So they brought the baby home and expected my sister to step up. She didn't. She'd leave the baby screaming in her crib for hours. Wouldn't change diapers. I came over one day and found my three week old niece sitting in a soiled diaper that had clearly been there for half a day. I was 22, in my last semester of college and never wanted kids, but I couldn't watch this baby suffer. I talked to my sister and asked if I could take her. She didn't even hesitate. She said yes immediately. Practically threw the diaper bag at me. I legally adopted my niece at 23, the day the papers were finalized, my boyfriend of three years gave me an ultimatum. He didn't want kids and couldn't believe I'd chosen to become a mother. I chose my daughter. He left. Those first two years were hell. I dropped out of college with one semester left to work full time at a call center, making $32,000 a year. I lived in a 400 square foot studio apartment. I had 847 in my bank account when I adopted her. I did every midnight feeding, every diaper change, every doctor's appointment alone, while my sister lived rent free with our parents and went clubbing four nights a week. My parents never offered to help, not once. They said I made my choice and needed to deal with it. But I did it. I went back and finished my degree online, got promoted three times. My daughter is now 8 years old and thriving. She's in advanced reading, play soccer, has friends. She's everything. Two months ago, I got offered a position in Singapore for. The salary is $110,000, compared to my current $58,000. The company is covering our relocation, housing for the first year and enrollment at an international school that lost $25,000 annually. It's a dream opportunity, I told my parents over Sunday dinner. I expected them to be happy for us. Instead, my mom started crying. My dad said I was being selfish. My sister went completely silent. The next day, my sister called me. She Said she'd been thinking about her daughter a lot lately and realized how much she missed her. I reminded her that she's my daughter, legally and emotionally. She said that's just paperwork and biology matters more. I laughed and told her she signed away her rights eight years ago. She said she was young and didn't understand what she was doing. I pointed out she was 26 now and still living with our parents without a job. That's when she threatened dork. She said she'd fight me for custody and no judge would let me take her daughter to another country.

Now they want to meet my daughter, but I drop a truth bomb that changes everything. When I was applying to colleges, I got into a prestigious university with a partial scholarship. I was so excited until my parents sat me down and said, we can't help you with tuition. Unexpected expenses came up. We just don't have the money. I was devastated, but determined. I took out 43,000 in student loans, worked as a tutor, a library assistant, even did night shifts at a 24 hour diner. During med school, there were nights I was so exhausted, I could barely stay awake in lectures. But I pushed through. Meanwhile, my younger brother Bobby was working at a local garage, spending his evenings at bars. Our parents never seemed worried. They just laugh and say, that's our Bobby. Always living in the moment. Fraught. And during my senior year, Bobby suddenly announced he was opening his own auto shop. I found out by accident when he posted grand opening photos on Facebook. Balloons everywhere. Our parents cutting a ribbon with giant Scissors. I called mom immediately, and she got quiet. I said, where did Bobby get the money for this? And after a long pause, she admitted they gave him their entire savings. $47,000. The money they told me didn't exist. I couldn't breathe. I said, you let me drown in debt while you had $47,000 saved up? And she said Bobby needed it more. He doesn't have a degree. You'll be fine. You're smart. You'll make good money as a doctor someday. I asked, what about all those nights I ate ramen because I couldn't afford real food? What about when I had to sell Grandma's laptop she gave me for graduation just to buy textbooks? And mom said, we knew you'd figure it out. You always do. That was eight years ago. I hung up and never called back. I finished med school, cut off almost all contact. Moved to Seattle with my wife Donna. Became a pediatrician. Two years ago, we had our daughter, Lily. Life was good. I built something they had no part of. Then last month, mom called for the first time in months. She was crying. Said Bobby's Auto Shop failed. He made bad decisions, got into debt with some shady people. Now he's moved back into their basement. She said they had to remortgage their house to cover his gambling debts. $23,000 gone, just like that. Then she said, we want to reconnect. We want to meet our granddaughter. Your father is so proud of you. He wants to make amends. I felt sick. They only want me now because Bobby disappointed them. I'm the backup plan. The son they can finally be proud of since their golden child crashed and burned. But part of me was curious. So I agreed to meet them at a cafe near my hospital. Just me. No Donna, no Lily. I wanted to hear what they had to say. I got there early and waited. When they walked in, they looked older. Mom's hair was completely gray now. Dad's shoulders were hunched. They used to seem so powerful to me. Now they just looked small. Mom rushed over and hugged me tight. I stood there stiff, not used to affection from her. We sat down and she started apologizing. Said they realized how unfair they've been. How proud they are of my accomplishments. Then came the truth. She admitted part of why they want back in is because of Bobby's situation. He didn't just fail. He got involved with gambling, lost everything. They had to sell their vacation home. The one they never let me use in high school. As she talked, I remembered asking to stay there with friends before college.

I told him, no problem, I'll be out. Then I reminded him about the illegal electrical work I'd photographed 6 months ago. I'd been renting this duplex for 3 years. Never late, always quiet. Fix things myself to avoid bothering him. The place wasn't fancy, but it was mine. Small kitchen, decent bedroom, a bathroom with tiles from the 1970s that I'd scrubbed until they almost look new. I kept the lawn mode, shoveled the walk in winter, even replaced the porch light when it burned out because I knew Victor would take weeks to do it. Last month my direct deposit glitched. Bank merger system update? Something technical the HR lady couldn't full. We explained my paycheck hit my account on the second instead of the first. Rent was due on the first, I noticed at the morning of the second. Immediately transferred the payment and even added the 50 dollar late fee from the lease. Sent Victor a text explaining what happened. He read it, didn't respond. That afternoon I came home from work to find an eviction notice taped to my door. Bright orange paper. Impossible to miss. 48 hour notice to vacate. Lease violation for nonpayment of rent. I stared at it for a full minute in my driveway. My neighbor Claudia was watering her flowers and looked away when I glanced over. She knew something I didn't. I went inside. And searched Craigslist. Found it in under five minutes. My apartment. Same address, same layout description, same photos I recognized from when I'd first toured it. Listed for $1,650. I was paying $850. The housing market had loaded in our area over the past year. New Tech Camp is going up two miles away. Coffee shops replacing auto repair shops. Victor saw an opportunity, and I was in the way. I didn't sleep that night. Just sat at my kitchen table drinking bad coffee and thinking about how I'd have to find a new place in 48 hours. Security deposits, application fees, first and last month's rent. I've been saving for a car. That money would disappear into moving costs. The next evening, I walked across the shared driveway to Victor's side of the duplex. He answered, wearing a golf polo and holding a beer, smiled at me like we were old friends. Started packing yet? He asked. Yeah. Just wanted to let you know I'll be out by tomorrow night, I said. He nodded, took a sip of his beer. Good. Nothing personal. You understand? Family needs the space, right? Your family? My cousin's moving back from Portland. Needs a place quick. I put pulled out my phone and opened my photos, started scrolling slowly. That's good. I'm sure your cousin will love it here. He will. Great neighborhood. Yeah. Hey, remember last summer when your brother did that electrical work? Victor's smile faltered slightly. What about it? I Was home that week, watched the whole thing. I turned my phone toward him. See, my bathroom lights kept flickering. So I went down to the basement to check the breaker. The photo showed the main electrical panel. Wires everywhere. Some stripped and twisted together with electrical tape, others just hanging loose. No junction boxes, no proper connections. Victor's brother had done everything cheap and fast. That's when I saw him working

You're telling me you weren't there? I work Monday through Friday, 9 to 5. I was at the clinic. She smirked. You think your face is gonna get you out of this? Pretty girls steal, too, sweetheart. I felt like I was going to throw up. They didn't believe me. They thought I was lying just because the woman in the video looked like me. They printed out screenshots from the footage and put them next to my driver's license photo. I had to admit, it looked bad. Same nose, same eyebrows, same everything. They locked me up. Actual jail. I got one phone call, and I used it to call my mom. She was hysterical. She kept asking what happened, and I didn't even know how to explain it. I spent three days in a holding cell with five other women. One of them asked what I was in for, and when I told her, she just laughed and said, sure, babe. The third day, my coworker Jamie finally got through to someone. She'd been trying to tell the police that I was at work during the robbery. She brought in the sign in logs, appointment records, everything. I checked in 14 patients that Wednesday afternoon. There was no way I could have been 80 miles away stealing purses. They finally let me go. No apology. Just, you're free to leave. But the damage was already done. Someone had leaked my Mugshot online. It was all over Facebook. Local pages were sharing it with captions like, even the hot ones are criminals and pretty face can't hide an ugly heart. People I went to high school with were commenting, laughing, making jokes. I went back to work the next Monday, and everyone was weird. Patients would stare at me in the waiting room and whisper to each other. One guy asked if I was the girl from the news. My boss called me into his office and said maybe I should take some time off until things cooled down. He said it was for my own good. I knew what that meant. I was fired. I deleted my dating apps because matches completely stopped. Guys who'd message me before were unmatched. I stopped going to the grocery store in town because people recognized me. My mom said I should sue somebody, but I didn't even know who. The police, the mall, Facebook. Four months later, my mom called me, freaking out. She'd seen an article online. The real thief had been caught. Her name was Angela Hayes. She was 28 and trying to be an actress. She'd been arrested trying to steal from another store in a different city.

I'm a digital artist. Been doing commissions online since I was fourteen. My Instagram has 40,000 followers. But Mrs. Fisher didn't know any of that because I kept my art life completely separate from school. The assignment was simple. Create an original piece in any medium. No restrictions on style or subject matter. Just had to be our own work. I chose to paint my grandmother. She passed away last year. And I had this photo of her from the 1970s that I loved. She's sitting in her garden laughing at something off camera. I spent two weeks on it. Oil on canvas, 16 by 20 inches. I worked on it every night after homework, sometimes until 2:00am. Getting every wrinkle right, every strand of silver hair. I probably did 30 layers on her face alone. When I turned it in, I felt proud. It was the best traditional work I'd ever done. Class critique day arrived, and missus Fisher held my painting up. First she stared at it with this weird expression. Then she spoke. This is a printed image, probably generated by A I. And transferred to canvas. The entire room went dead silent. I felt my stomach drop. What? No. I painted that. She cut me off. I've been teaching art for 25 years. I know real student work when I see it. She turned to Address the class. This. This is exactly what's wrong with your generation. You think you can use technology to fake talent and no one will notice. She said students like me were destroying artistic integrity, that she wouldn't tolerate cheating in her classroom. She wrote a zero in her grade book, academic dishonesty. Said she'd be reporting it to the administration. I sat there stunned. My hands were shaking. A few classmates gave me sympathetic looks, but nobody said anything. Here's the thing, though. I document everything. It's part of my process, and it protects me when clients try to dispute work. For this painting, I had my phone set up on a tripod, running a time lapse app that captured every single session. I didn't say anything for the rest of class, just packed up. When the bell rang, missus Fisher stopped me at the door. I hope you understand this is a serious violation. You'll need to meet with your counselor about academic and integrity. I just nodded and left. But instead of going to my next class, I pulled out my phone in the hallway. 47 hours and 32 minutes of footage condensed into a 12 minute video showing the entire process from blank canvas to finished painting. I also pulled up my Instagram, my portfolio website, screenshots of my commission queue, the gallery exhibition from last month. Then I walked straight to the principal's office. Missus Wallace. The principal knows me because I did a mural. In the main hallway last year. She looked surprised when I came in without an appointment. I explained the situation, showed her the painting photo, then the time lapse. We watched about 15 minutes. Watched me mix colors, build up layers on the canvas, reference the photo tape to my easel. Her expression got more serious with each minute. She picked up her desk phone and called missus fisher's classroom, asked her to come to the office immediately. Missus Fisher walked in 10 minutes later, looking annoyed. Missus Wallace turned her computer monitor around.

Another caught him scrolling his phone with this blank, vapid expression. These are. I started, then stopped. Honest. She finished. That's the point. I've been photographing what I actually see, not what I'm supposed to see. She clicked to another folder. Then there's this series. My breath caught. They were photos of me, dozens of them, taken candidly over the past three weeks. Me reading on the couch, making coffee in the morning, working at my desk with late afternoon light streaming through the window. Every shot was warm, intimate, beautiful. When did you. She looked at me directly. I've been watching you watch me pretend to be happy with him. Derek asked me out the day after. I told him about you. What? She smiled sadly. We matched, started talking and he mentioned his roommate who wouldn't shut up about this girl from photography class. Described you perfectly. Showed me your Instagram. I realized you've been talking about me. By then, I'd already agreed to meet him for coffee. He made it very clear at that first date that you'd be weird about us, that you had a history of getting jealous, that I shouldn't mention we'd met through him liking me. None of that sounded like you. So I said yes to a second date just to see what was really going on. and I've spent three weeks watching the guy who actually sees me hide. In his room while the guy who saw me as a prize parades me around. She closed her laptop. The project deadline is Friday. I'm calling it the space between what we say and what we mean. I need one more photo to complete it. What's that? You and me said quietly, actually looking at each other. No performance, no pretending. Derek came home 20 minutes later to find Mia's stuff gone and a note on the counter. We're done. Check your girlfriend's project folder. You're the before shots. He didn't understand until she posted the series online with his full name attached, every shot labeled with the date and his exact words from that day. The side by side contrast was devastating. The arrogance versus reality. It went viral in the photography community. Derek moved out two weeks later. Mia and I got coffee the day after her project won first place. No cameras, just us.

I told him, no problem, I'll be out. Then I reminded him about the illegal electrical work I'd photographed 6 months ago. I'd been renting this duplex for 3 years. Never late, always quiet. Fix things myself to avoid bothering him. The place wasn't fancy, but it was mine. Small kitchen, decent bedroom, a bathroom with tiles from the 1970s that I'd scrubbed until they almost look new. I kept the lawn mode, shoveled the walk in winter, even replaced the porch light when it burned out because I knew Victor would take weeks to do it. Last month my direct deposit glitched. Bank merger system update? Something technical the HR lady couldn't full. We explained my paycheck hit my account on the second instead of the first. Rent was due on the first, I noticed at the morning of the second. Immediately transferred the payment and even added the 50 dollar late fee from the lease. Sent Victor a text explaining what happened. He read it, didn't respond. That afternoon I came home from work to find an eviction notice taped to my door. Bright orange paper. Impossible to miss. 48 hour notice to vacate. Lease violation for nonpayment of rent. I stared at it for a full minute in my driveway. My neighbor Claudia was watering her flowers and looked away when I glanced over. She knew something I didn't. I went inside. And searched Craigslist. Found it in under five minutes. My apartment. Same address, same layout description, same photos I recognized from when I'd first toured it. Listed for $1,650. I was paying $850. The housing market had loaded in our area over the past year. New Tech Camp is going up two miles away. Coffee shops replacing auto repair shops. Victor saw an opportunity, and I was in the way. I didn't sleep that night. Just sat at my kitchen table drinking bad coffee and thinking about how I'd have to find a new place in 48 hours. Security deposits, application fees, first and last month's rent.

What's the worst thing you've experienced due to your looks? I was 24 and working as a receptionist at Summit Dental in my hometown. People always told me I was pretty like my whole life, teachers, aunts, random old ladies at grocery stores. You could be a model with that face. You'll never have problems. I smiled and said thanks. But honestly, it never felt like the advantage everyone said. It was one Tuesday morning, I was restocking floss samples in the waiting room when the front door slammed open. Three police officers walked in, two men and one woman. They looked right at me. Emily Grant, the older cop asked, yeah, that's me. Is everything okay? He pulled out handcuffs. You're under arrest for grand theft. Turn around, please. I laughed, like actually laughed because I thought it was some kind of mistake or prank. But nobody else was laughing. The hygienist dropped her clipboard. Patients were staring. My boss came running out of his office. There has to be some mistake, I said. My voice was shaking now. No mistake, turn around. They cuffed me right there in front of everyone, my co workers, my boss, Missus Chen, who came in every three months for cleanings. They walked me out past the big glass windows where people could see everything. I was crying and trying to explain, but they just kept saying I had the right to remain silent. At the station, they threw me In a small white room with a table and two chairs, the female officer sat across from me with a laptop. She turned it around so I could see the screen. It was security footage from a mall, some fancy place with marble floors and big store logos everywhere. A woman walked into a designer handbag store. She had long, dark hair like mine, same height. She was wearing jeans and a black jacket. She grabbed three purses off a display and just walked out. The footage was super clear. You could see her face perfectly. It looked exactly like me. That's not me. I said immediately, I've never been to that mall. Where even is that Westfield Plaza about 80 miles north? The male cop said, and that's definitely you. It's not. I was at work that day, whatever day that was. The female officer leaned back and crossed her arms. The theft tap.

Still wouldn't tell me anything. Just kept saying, trust me. At 10:00am, I heard a loud engine, a yellow school bus parking on my street. Behind it, a line of cars, other parents. The door swung open and kids flooded out. Ethan's whole class, Missus Winslow came off the bus, Principal Blanders, too. I walked outside feeling like I was dreaming. And Erica came from the backyard carrying a banner. She hung it on the garage door. It said, happy 40th birthday, dad, in messy painted letters. My birthday. It was today. I had completely forgotten. Ethan ran up and jumped into my arms. Surprise, Dad. I planned everything. I held him tight. You planned this. Missus Winslow walked over. Two months ago, I asked the class to write about their hero. Most kids picked athletes or celebrities. She looked at Ethan. Your son wrote about you, about how you build things in your garage, how you fix stuff that's broken, how you never give up. She wiped her eye. Best essay I've ever read. I showed Principal Blanders and we decided to make it real. A field trip where Ethan could show his classmates what his dad does. Erica whispered in my ear, he thinks you're a superhero. Missus Winslow looked at Ethan, okay, buddy, time to read it. Ethan walked into the garage, stood in front of 30 kids and a bunch of parents. He pulled out a folded piece of Paper. His hands were shaking. He started reading. Voice quiet at first, but getting stronger. My hero is my dad. He builds things with his hands, tables and chairs and birdhouses. He built my bed. He built my bookshelf. He built the treehouse in our backyard. He looked up at me, then back at the paper. My dad says anything broken can be fixed if you're patient enough. He fixed my bike when I crashed it. He fixed the fence when the storm knocked it down. He fixed my favorite toy when the head fell off and I cried. A couple moms were already wiping their eyes. Some kids have heroes who are famous, like basketball players or movie stars. My hero is my dad because he never gives up and he's always there. And I wanna be just like him when I grow up. Ethan folded the paper. The end. The garage started clapping. I had to turn away because I was crying and didn't want 30 kids to see. Erica grabbed my hand. After everyone left, the house got quiet. Ethan tugged my shirt. Dad, did I do good? I got down on one knee so we were face to face. Pulled him into the biggest hug of his life. You did perfect, buddy. Absolutely perfect.

The destination was my house. I was sitting at the kitchen table when my eight year old Ethan dropped a crumpled permission slip in front of me. I smoothed it out and read it casually. Then I stopped, read it again. The destination line said Callahan residence, followed by my exact home address. I looked at Ethan, buddy, what is this? He shrugged. Mrs. Winslow said it's a special learning experience. I go play Minecraft. Before I could ask anything else, he was gone. I called the school office. The secretary confirmed the address was correct. I asked why my house was a field trip destination. She got quiet and said, I'm not authorized to discuss the details, Mister Callahan. It's been approved at the administrative level. Then she hung up. Something was happening, something everyone knew about except me. Dinner. I asked Erica about it. You know anything about this field trip to our house? She shrugged. News to me, probably just some school thing. But she had this tiny smile she was trying to hide. Ethan was grinning at me from his seat. What's with the face, buddy? He laughed and ran upstairs. They were both hiding something. Next afternoon I caught Mike at pickup. His son was in Ethan's class. Yo, you get that permission slip, the one that says my house. He wouldn't look me in the eyes. Yep, signed it. I asked what it was. For he checked his watch even though he wasn't wearing one. Man, I gotta go. And he was gone. Two moms were standing by the fence. I asked if they knew what the Callahan field trip was about. They shared a look. One goes, maybe ask the teacher. They walked away smiling. I found Missus Winslow in her classroom. She froze when she saw me. Oh, Mister Callahan. I asked her what was happening. She started fidgeting with her markers. You should talk to Principal Blanders. This came from her. I went straight to the principal's office. She grinned at me like we were in on a joke together. Except I wasn't in on anything. Your wife coordinated all of this with us. That's all I can tell you. I called Erica from my truck. I'm losing my mind. Just tell me what's going on. She laughed so hard, she snorted. Your such a control freak. It's a surprise. Let it be a surprise. The week dragged on forever. Erica kept hanging up calls. When I walked into the room, Ethan kept asking random questions. Hey, dad, what do you love about building stuff? What's the best thing you ever made? He wrote my answers in a notebook. Wouldn't tell me why the night before I couldn't sleep. Tomorrow, 30 kids would show up at my door and I still had no idea why. I woke up that morning with knots in my stomach.

Twelve months later, foreclosure notice. $12,000 behind. I had exactly that in savings. I thought about it for three days. That money could save their house, keep them from being homeless. It would also teach them I'd come running whenever they needed rescuing. That they could treat me like garbage and I'd Still be their safety net. I didn't give it to them. They lost the house.

Haven't heard from him since. I got a girlfriend who doesn't care that I'm a mechanic. She likes that I can fix thing. I've never met my niece. Don't plan to. Sometimes Bobby asks if I feel bad. I tell him the truth. I feel free. They chose Ashley over me. Every single time. Now they're living with that choice and I'm living with mine. The difference? I'm thriving. They're surviving.

She went completely white, didn't say a word, just turned around and went back downstairs. I heard her screaming at him. I'd never heard her raise her voice before in the three years I'd known her. She was asking him what the hell was wrong with him. Why would he tell me she wanted pot roast when she never said that? Why would he lie about something like that? He tried to defend himself, but she cut him off. She said she brought Chinese takeout specifically so I wouldn't have to cook. But she remembered how hard those first few days were, how she could barely sit down. After her first baby, his dad came upstairs and asked if he could hold the baby. His hands were gentle and he had tears in his eyes. He apologized for raising a son who would treat his wife like this. 48 hours after giving birth. Downstairs his mom was still going. She found out he'd made the whole dinner thing up because he was mad I wasn't paying attention to him anymore. He actually admitted he thought having a baby would be different, that I'd still have time for him, that I'd still want to be physical again soon. His dad handed me the baby and went downstairs. I heard him tell my husband to pack a bag, that he raised him better than this and until he figured out how to be a man. He wasn't welcome in this house. My husband tried to argue, said I was exaggerating. His dad said if he said one more word, he'd throw his stuff on the lawn himself. His mom came back up with the Chinese food and sat with me while I ate. She set up the bassinet and changed the baby while I took my first real shower in three days. She even washed my hair for me because I couldn't lift my arms above my head. His dad carried his duffle bag to the car. I watched from the window as my husband got in and drove away. That was a week ago. He's been calling from his friend's couch every single day, leaving voicemail saying I overreacted, that his parents turned on him, that everyone's being dramatic and I'm keeping his daughter from him. His mom texts me every morning asking how we slept. She came over yesterday with groceries and meal prep containers, held the baby while I napped for four hours. His dad called last night, said his son needs to grovel on his knees before he's allowed back in this house. any man who calls his wife lazy doesn't deserve to be called a father. I'm not answering my husband's calls anymore. His mom said I can stay here as long as I need to.

I called the suicide hotline a couple times. Yeah, just to figure it out. I don't know solutions. Just a couple weak moments. That's but don't worry, it's not like I called every day. It's not like I'm like, hello, they're like, Jason. It wasn't like that couple week moments that's not funny. But what's hilarious to me is that the people at the suicide hotline not trained at all. Hilarious. One time I called this dude was like, what is there an object around your room that could be a weapon that you could use it to hurt yourself with? I was like, um, I have never thought about that before. So when he asked that shit, I started to look around the room trying to get creative. I was like, sir, I think anything could be a weapon if I run fast enough, the wall could be a weapon too. Like why would you direct my attention to weapons? Why don't you say some nice shit like, hey man, do you got enough ice cream in the refrigerator? Yeah, eat that shit. Feel nice. What kind of shit is this? Hey man, do you got a knife? Yeah, in the kitchen. I guess I can stab myself in the face if you want me to. It's so funny this one time I called I was like, hey man, been thinking about killing myself, swear to God. This guy was like this. Yeah, people think about that sometimes. When he said that, I cracked up immediately. I was like, bro, I don't even need you anymore. You help me out in the weirdest way possible. I googled my high school arch nemesis the other day. We all do it. You Google. People used to hate to see if their lives up now, right? Google my high school arch nemesis. And the first result was a mugshot. And it made my day. It made me very happy. I was just hoping she was fat now too. But prison, like, wow, beyond my wildest dreams. Yeah, yeah, cause I'm petty and I'm filled with hate. I hold grudges forever. And when you're a grudge holder, people will tell you, you gotta release that negative energy. You don't wanna be carrying around that negative energy. I do. It brings me joy. Um, like if I thought I could earn a living holding grudges, I would quit comedy. I would run out of space and open up my own little grudgeery. I would just sit in there every day from 9 to 5. I would hold them. I probably wouldn't even take lunch breaks cause the hate will fill me up on the inside. I would take over other people's grudges. That's how much I enjoy it. Like, just come into my grudgery, give me some money and tell me the backstory. You know what I'm saying? Have a seat. Now, what did this bitch do? To us, like wouldn't that be great if aliens came to this planet and they were black and they got here and they were like, yo, we so happy we found this planet because we left all these black people here, came to get them, bring them back home to their home planet. Planet black. Black. But you pronounce it black. Black. All the black people over here be like, yeah, you want to go back home to the planet? Blur, blur. Go to Africa and talk to the Africans. And the Africans like we are going to come as well. No more black people on the planet song. And in tragic sporting news, there will be no NFL.

You ever do that before? Like some girl be like, it was nice to meet you. I'm like, yeah, hey, nice to fine line take for 4, 5. Mike, the car. Why are you walking like a Lego? Just get the car, Mike, please. You try to justify that. Maybe she just sticks that his stroke and I handled it well. Yo, you ever do that? Then realize you're walking the wrong way. You gotta go back. You're like, damn it. But you're like, it's okay. I got another chance. Then she throws you like, have a good night. You're like, yeah, keep the rain down. Keep the rain down. What are you, Prince? Mike, the car. I'm not doing well. Why are you walking in circles? Why are you asking questions instead of getting the car? You're the worst designated driver ever. She's looking at you weird. She's still there. Yeah. What should I do? Say something, Mike, help. I'm not even ashamed anymore to tell people that I want sex. I want sex, I want it, I need it, I need it. And they always go, they go, oh no. Oh, these female comments. They're always talking about sex. I said we want it. Yeah, we'll talk about it. Listen, let me tell you something. I was 27 years Old when I lost my virginity. You hear me? 27. Don't clap for that. That was sad. There's no honor in that. Zella didn't come out and give me a sword cause I did that. 27 cause my grandmother was in my ear. My grandmother is a pastor. She was in my ear. You better not have no sex. You know, Jesus is watching. Why Jesus is so nosy for those of you I don't know, it's a birthmark. That's what it is. It doesn't lower my self esteem enough for me to fuck you. Although sometimes people do stare and I am like, hey buddy, eyes down here. When I wear a mask, my mask sits right here and covers my birthmark. And so I'm just walking around as one of you. I meet new people while I'm wearing a mask all the time, right? And eventually I take my mask off and they see my birthmark for the first time. And every single time the reaction is the same. It's always exactly like when you see a man take his hat off and you're like, that hairline is not where I thought it was going to be. Well played. I will get real with all though over the pandemic. It's the first time in a long, long time I've thought about getting back on antidepressants. Okay? I haven't been on antidepressants in a decade. I'm older than you think. Do not ask. Okay? I told my friends isn't It really supportive. They just had a few questions like, okay, you're on antidepressants before. What did it feel like? Like, why do you want to get back on them? And I was honest, being on antidepressants feels like your brain is being gentrified. That's what it feels like. It really does. It's like the property value is going up, but I don't recognize this place. Like, where's the liquor store? You know what I'm saying? Like, where's the liquor store? Who fixed the sidewalk finally? Wow. Okay. Interesting. There's white women jogging around my brain at night. Streets are dead. Streets are dead.

Until one day, the lieutenant suddenly sent a letter saying they would never have to worry about money again. When Forrest opened the letter, he discovered that the lieutenant had invested in the fruit industry for him. A few years later, Forrest had actually become a billionaire. He always remembered his mother saying that money was only needed as much as necessary, so he donated all his excess wealth to charity and even gave all his shrimp business shares to Bubba's mother. But returning to his empty home, forest tossed and turned sleeplessly, until one day, a woman approached him. Hello, forest. Hello, Jenny. From that day forward, they were inseparable. Rediscovering the warm feelings of childhood, Jenny was like family to him. That night, forest gathered his courage, wanting to build a home for Jenny. Will you marry me? You would, forest. The next morning, Jenny quietly left, leaving behind the medal he had given her. Forest looked at the neat bed as if Jenny had never returned. He couldn't understand why, despite their deep love for each other, he was ultimately rejected. Unable to find an answer, forest put on his cap and immediately ran away from home. He ran through towns, across counties, and unknowingly reached the end of the highway. The tireless forest even ran through the entire state of Alabama. For several years, except for eating and sleeping, he was almost constantly running. Gradually more and More people began paying attention to forest. Facing media interviews, he remained silent. Because of this, people thought he was even more like a performance artist. So, LED by forest, countless followers joined the group. A businessman spotted an opportunity and planned to print Forest's image on T shirts. Just then, a large truck drove by, splashing MUD that dirtied forest. He took the T-shirt and casually wiped himself clean. This simple action created what would later become an American fashion brand. Finally, one day, forest understood his mother's words.

Mato a una persona cada día, pero soy terriblemente pobre. En mi casa hay más de una decena de autos deportivos esperando gasolina. Ese día recibí la llamada de mi empleador. El objetivo esta vez era john. Rápidamente le pedí a mi novia que preparara las armas. Luego conduje para ejecutar la misión, pero no esperaba que john ya hubiera llegado aquí y que su propósito también fuera matar, solo que su objetivo era diferente. Ese anciano era el asesino del hermano de john. En ese momento, el anciano se preparaba para abusar de la chica que había engañado. Para sorpresa, john bateó la puerta y el anciano se quedó congelado. No dejaba de suplicar, pero john no perdió el tiempo con él. Levantó el arma directamente y lo mató. La chica le rogó a john que no la lastimara, pero john solo la miró y se dio la vuelta para irse, porque nunca mata a inocentes. En ese momento, yo también llegué y justo cuando me preparaba para disparar, una chica salió de repente, lo que llamó la atención de john hacia mí. Él empujó a la chica a un lado y empezamos un intenso tiroteo. No esperaba que john fuera tan feroz. Yo no podía soportarlo, y cuando me disponía a contraatacar, john ya había desaparecido. Después se fue a un bar. Esta vez el objetivo era tucker. Tucker había asesinado a su hermano con sus propias manos. Siguió a tucker todo el Camino y entró al baño. Cuando tucker vio a john, supo que ese día solo uno podría sobrevivir. Taker sacó un cuchillo y atacó. Primero john esquivó fácilmente y de un puñetazo le rompió la nariz a taker. Taker atacó de nuevo con fuerza, pero john lo atrapó otra vez y luego john apuñaló repetidas veces. El abdomen de taker cayó al suelo, pero no suplicó, dijo que solo hacía su trabajo por dinero y que el verdadero asesino de su hermano era otro. Al terminar, taker cerró los ojos y john se fue del lugar conduciendo, preparándose para buscar al último asesino. En ese momento sonó la radio del auto. Resulta que taker no estaba muerto, había sido llevado al hospital para ser rescatado. Al escuchar esta noticia, john dio la vuelta de inmediato, preparándose para ir al hospital a acabar con taker. Llegó al quirófano, taker aún estaba siendo atendido. John se acercó y disparó. Una vez. Al oír el disparo, el sheriff salió corriendo. Justo vio a john preparándose para irse y el sheriff disparó de inmediato. John contraatacó rápidamente y por suerte el sheriff esquivó. Nunca había estado tan cerca de la muerte, temblaba por completo y por fin reunió valor, pero al asomarse, el arma de john ya estaba apuntándole. El sheriff no tuvo otra opción más que rendirse y cerrar los ojos esperando la muerte, pero pasó mucho tiempo sin que ocurriera nada y cuando abrió los ojos, ese lugar ya estaba completamente vacío John había escapado, preparándose para eliminar al último asesino

To make matters worse, the manager was about to arrive for inspection. Anxious and flustered, she didn't know what to do. At that moment, a woman waiting for a job interview softly suggested, try spraying a little alcohol. It'll be easier to clean. Not only that, the woman even crouched down and helped the janitor scrub the stain until it completely disappeared. The janitor thanked her sincerely, but another applicant nearby sneered, if you like cleaning so much, maybe you should apply for the janitor's position. Instead, the woman ignored the taunt and quietly continued waiting for her interview. Then she received a phone call from her son. The school was urging her to pay his tuition fee. He gently comforted her boy, feeling even more determined to secure this job. As time passed, all the other applicants finished their interviews and left. Yet no one came to call her in. She waited until nightfall, when she ran into the janitor again. The janitor told her everyone else had already gone home and kindly advised her to do the same. Just as she was about to leave in disappointment, the interviewer finally appeared overjoyed. She quickly handed over her resume, only to be told that the day's interviews were already over. She was asked to come back the next morning. The woman immediately promised she would return, but on her way home, she looked at a Photo of her son and couldn't hold back her tears. She feared her age might put her at a disadvantage, that she hadn't even been given a fair chance. Even so, the next morning she arrived at the company as promised. To her surprise, the manager informed her she had already been.

Each participant had to sit in a freezing zero degree chamber and demonstrate their skill on a massive block of butter. Right from the opening moment, contestant No. 1 rushed and ruined her entire block in a misstep. In sharp contrast, contestant No. 2, a young girl, was carving with calm focus. Contestant No. 3 was a seasoned artist who had arrived fully prepared with every tool. But contestant No. 4 had not yet shown up. Contestant No. 1 was completely lost, unsure how to recover, and the crowd showed little interest in her work. In frustration, she tossed her tools aside and went over to the experienced contestant to pick up some techniques. Just then, the veteran Carver noticed the little girl. She was shaping the butter with delicate, striking skill. Realizing she faced serious competition, the woman hurried back to her station and began working with even greater caution. Only 10 minutes remained until the contest ended. Meanwhile, the girl had fixed her minor flaws and more spectators were gathering to watch her creation. Contestant No. 1, on the other hand, was still scraping her butter aimlessly. Then contestant No. 4 finally arrived on the. She promptly pulled a lipstick from her purse and started tracing designs across the butter surface. Soon, the competition concluded and everyone laid down their tool. It was time to present their work to the audience. First, contestant No. 1 unveiled a sculpture of three adorable Puppies. But the audience response was lukewarm. Next came contestant No. 4. While her piece was somewhat unconventional, her presentation was truly remarkable. Then the pull tab on a can snapped off.

In that instant, a thought flashed through her mind and her eyes snapped to the metal roof she had punctured earlier, but never fully open. She pulled out a cloth strap, then used a knife to wedge the gap slightly wider, allowing the strap to pass through. Now the hatch could surely be lifted. At last, she gripped the strap with both hands, throwing her full weight and strength into one hard pull, and the metal sheet actually came loose. Filled her with fierce resolve. She kept pulling until the hatch was completely open. Feeling sunlight for the first time in days, she finally sobbed aloud. She wanted her Newborn to feel it, too. So she clutched the baby and climbed out of the shipping container. But what awaited outside was a fresh kind of despair. They were adrift in the middle of an endless ocean, no land in sight, no ships on the horizon. Yet this new mother had to stay strong. At least she and her child had seen the sun. Next, she tossed the baby's soil diaper into the water. Unexpectedly, the infant's waste attracted a school of fish. Overjoyed, the woman quickly found a metal rod to use as a spear, but she couldn't catch a single fish and ended up collapsing from exhaustion. Just as she was at a lot, a plane suddenly appeared in the sky. She knew this was Her best chance for rescue, she rushed back into the container ash the TV and picked out a shard of glass. Afraid the plane would fly away, she scrambled outside in haste, only to cut her thigh accidentally. Ignoring the pain, she raised the fragment, trying to reflect sunlight toward the plane to get its attention. But she was directly beneath the aircraft and the light couldn't possibly.

They were so poor they couldn't afford to buy new wood for his leg. The little money they had left was reserved for buying textbooks for the child. Nothing was more important than education. After much thought, Geppetto finally came up with a brilliant solution. He decided to use the money intended for textbooks to buy wood and make new legs for his son. The next day, he hurried to the store, hoping the owner would let him purchase the books on credit. But the owner wasn't so compassionate. Gepetto had to take off his coat, then another one, planning to exchange them for the textbooks was a bitter cold winter. But out of respect for his fatherly devotion, the owner agreed to the deal. Thus, Geppetto managed to fulfill his wish of sending his son to school. However, Pinocchio would never be the obedient child Geppetto hoped for. He appeared dutiful and well behaved on the outside, but deep down he had other plans. Geppetto escorted him to the school gate, watched him enter unexpectedly. Once Geppetto left, Pinocchio sneaked away. First, he went to the store and sold the textbook back to the owner, then used the money to buy a ticket and entered the puppet theater. However, while this was happening, Pinocchio encountered an accident. By the time school ended in the evening, Gepetto had waited a long time without seeing his son. He approached the teacher to inquire, but teacher replied that there was no child named Pinocchio in the school, nor one made of wood. Geppetto immediately panicked, unsure of what to do next. From that moment on, he embarked on a long and arduous journey to search for his son. Meanwhile, Pinocchio was running for his life with people chasing him closely behind. At the end of the road, he saw what appeared to be an abandoned castle. He ran up and desperately banged on the door, hoping someone inside would let him in to hide. Fortunately, a girl opened a window above, but her words left Pinocchio utterly confused.

In a rush, she pushed between them, pulled them apart, and warned the girl to stay away from him. Lilith had a darker plan in mind. She told Malfoy to meet her in her dorm at 5 p m. When he arrived on time, she intentionally wore her pajamas, allowing him to catch her applying moisturizer. Her scheme worked perfectly.

My husband exploded with anger when he saw the long list of charges. When he came home and found that the once obedient me completely ignored him, he immediately ordered me to cook dinner. But the next second I stood up and told him to pack his things and move out. The reason I did this was because not long ago I accidentally saw my idol husband publicly announce his relationship with another woman. When he came home, I had wanted to ask him why, but instead of feeling guilty, he pulled out divorce papers and demanded a divorce. It was all because my existence affected his career. Then he got a phone call and prepared to leave. Thinking about how I had supported him silently for five years, only to be treated so heartlessly, I signed the divorce papers without hesitation and warned him that he would regret it someday. All that was left for him afterward was a completely trashed living room. Later, I vented everything to my best friend. She admired how I had dealt with that jerk.

The remaining three thugs arrived with professional climbing gear, but seeing Lila ascend, their leader decided that risking the icy, treacherous cliff was pointless. So they circled around, planning to reach the summit from the other side. Lila had climbed a considerable distance, but the looming Canyon still sent chills down her spine. Then she spotted an old tent left by a previous climber. A plan formed in her mind, she cautiously moved toward it, using every ounce of strength to pull herself onto a protruding rock. The three thugs had reached the top and began searching. Lila hid behind the rock, but one of them guessed she might be below and lowered a rope, trying to drag her out. Instead, Lila tied a note to the rope and sent it back up. Reading it, the men erupted with rage. Quickly, she built a makeshift shelter on the cliff, fixing a carabiner into the rock, stretching the old tent tight and Suspending it over the edge, creating a precarious refuge above the void.

Ethan ignored him, picked up the phone dropped earlier, and tried to call his wife to reassure her he was alive. The call went through, but a man's voice answered. He hadn't even been dead a week, and she was already with someone else. In that instant, Ethan understood. His death was connected to these two. The doctor slowly regained consciousness. Staring at him in sheer terror, he stammered that the body had arrived two days ago. Unable to tell if Ethan was a ghost, a zombie, or still human, Ethan slapped him across the face, warning him to stay silent, then rushed straight home. Once inside, he locked his wife in the bathroom and dragged out the handsome man. Fists flew mercilessly. The man stammered excuses which only fueled Ethan's fury. He pinned the man to the floor, relentlessly pounding him. At that moment, his wife rushed out, throwing an object at him. Blinded by rage, Ethan grabbed a table ornament, ready to finish the man off. But in that split second, he was violently flung into the depths of space. As if reality itself had been torn apart.

Women no longer needed to go through pregnancy. Anyone could simply walk in and select the child they wanted. Anna quickly fell for a cute baby, but at checkout, she hesitated. Her husband was black and every baby in the store was white. To avoid conflict, she decided not to buy one. Instead, the couple opted for a more personal path. Doctors would use their DNA to grow their own biological child inside an artificial incubation pod. They signed the agreement and could even watch the process unfold. All right, we have a fertilized egg. Anna monitored the baby constantly, whether at work or resting, even supplying vital nutrients through an app. A month later, she visited the hospital like any other mother, gently stroking the egg, yet feeling an unsettling sense. That night, she dreamt the doctor had pulled a tiny chicken egg from her womb instead of a baby, leaving her to question how real the whole experience truly was. She began envying women with natural pregnancies. Two months later, the doctor told them they could take the egg home and raise it themselves. Excited, they agreed, believing this was the only way to truly experience the joy of parenthood. Under their care, the baby inside the pod grew rapidly and the father even read bedtime stories every night. Eight months later.

When darkness fell, David could slip into elegant dresses, adorn her hair, and escape through the hidden passageway to wonder the world as her true self. One afternoon, while David was bathing quietly in the river, he unexpectedly crossed paths with General Carlos. Carlos, completely unaware that Davia was actually a woman, fell hopelessly in love with her at first sight and immediately wished to marry her. But for the sake of the kingdom's stability, Davia could never reveal her true identity, so she rejected his heartfelt declaration. Meanwhile, the lords under the king's rule had grown restless and unruly, formed secret alliances with influential nobles and marched into the throne room, insisting that David marry as soon as possible to stabilize the fragile political situation. David had no choice but to obey her father's command. On the night of the wedding, desperate to conceal her womanhood, David told her bride that she had taken a solemn vow, unless she succeeded in bringing prosperity and security to the people, she would abstain from all matters of romance. Moved by David's conviction and selflessness, the bride voluntarily suggested they sleep in separate beds. Ever since his faithful encounter by the Riverside, Carlos had become utterly enchanted, borderline obsessed with the mysterious woman he Had met. Training his troops suddenly felt pointless. His mind drifted back to her relentlessly. When enemy forces were on the brink of launching an attack and Carlos still could not regain focus, Deva had no choice but to meet with him again, this time in her female form. Her words were firm, strategic and piercingly wise. Inspired by her council, Carlos made a vow on the spot he would quell the rebellion within a single month. And he delivered, recruiting soldiers, acquiring war horses, enforcing strict training and crushing the uprising in record time. Yet even with victory behind him, Carlos longed painfully for the mysterious girl. Eventually, he begged David to issue a royal decree allowing him to marry her. But David replied that if he truly wanted her help.

She still loads her cart like she owns the place. When it's time to check out, her total shoots up to $8,000. She stays calm. No panic. She pulls out a massive stack of coupons. The cashier spends three hours scanning every single one. When the system finally finishes, she doesn't pay a cent. The store ends up owing her $30. To hunt for more coupons. She buys newspapers by the bundle and cuts out every coupon she can find. She even climbs into dumpsters just to pull toothpaste boxes with a tiny discount code on them. At her house, everything she uses aside from the house and her husband comes from coupons. One morning, Anna notices her cereal is expired. She jumps online and sends the company a complaint. That same afternoon, a letter arrives with an apology and a voucher for free snacks. She takes it to the store while the cashier rings it up. He tells her, these brands can't risk bad press. Anyone complains, they usually send coupons to keep things quiet. That line hits her like a spark. She starts writing complaints to every company she can think of.

But complaint letters alone won't get them far enough. They Want more? So they set their sights on a company that prints coupons for the entire country. To be continued.

However, due to high costs, the restaurant was losing money every day. The staff suggested replacing beef with pork or raising the price to $7. the owner knew that nothing was worse for business than losing trust, so he didn't think these solutions were appropriate and decided to find another way. He came up with the idea of using inexpensive beef heart and liver to make a spicy beef stew. The owner stir fried the beef offal with Sichuan peppercorns and chili, then slow cooked it for an hour to make a fragrant beef soup. The staff eagerly tried the first bite and they ended up eating two big bowls of rice in one sitting, praising the flavor as incredibly delicious. Seeing the results, the owner decided to set up several large pots and have customers gather around them to eat. The next day at lunch, workers were drawn in by the smell of the beef stew and came in droves. For just $3, they could have a full serving of spicy beef stew, unlimited rice, vegetables and a bowl of tofu pudding. This creative idea not only earned the praise of customers, but also brought in significant profits for the owner.

According to him, she was moving between the kitchen area and the register while completely barefoot. He said it made him lose his appetite, so he recorded a short clip and sent a complaint to Wendy's customer service. Management reacted quickly. Several employees said the woman was taken into the office the same day and was told she could not continue working without shoes. When she explained that her feet were swollen from a possible pregnancy and regular shoes caused pain, managers still decided to remove her from her shift. By the next morning, she was officially terminated. Some people online defended her, saying she looked uncomfortable and needed support, not punishment. They said she was doing her job and not touching food with her feet, so the customer overreacted. Others insisted Wendy's followed company rules. They pointed out that bare feet in a fast food kitchen violate safety standards, risk injuries, and could create legal issues. The debate continues. What do you think about this situation?

In his memory, thousands of workers from the weapons factory poured onto the streets, all armed. Even a 90 year old grandmother joined in. Thousands of bullets were fired into the sky at once, continuing until every magazine was empty. When the firing stopped, everyone returned to the factory. At that moment, a man stood at the roadside watching everything, unaware that the next danger was about to strike him. An old man hurriedly told him to hide inside a car. Daniel didn't understand why, but he obeyed and climbed into the vehicle. Just seconds later, due to gravity, the thousands of bullets shot into the sky began to fall. In the next instant, bullets rained on the car like a storm of hail. Daniel was terrified, but hiding in time saved his life. As he exhaled in relief, he noticed something strange.

The man looked at the tree and said, your life is now tied to this tree. The more you speak, the more leaves will fall. The day all the leaves are gone, you will be gone, too. Ethan didn't believe it. He grabbed a microphone and rapped loudly, and leaves kept falling. Terrified, he grabbed an axe and struck the tree. The moment it hit, a deep Mark appeared on his stomach, confirming that this tree was indeed connected to his life. He stopped speaking, communicating only with gestures. But even when he angrily pointed his finger, leaves still fell, and life grew harder. One day, he attended a parent class with his son. All the other parents were singing, but he stood silently.

Most people thought they could accommodate one extra person, but the leader insisted on upholding the principle that only 513 people could survive on the island at the time the outside world was being ravaged by a virus. To maintain the balance of exactly 513 residents on the island, the leader decided to hold a vote in a few days. To ensure the voting would be fair, they created a scoring system.

He found the squirrels home, confirmed the location, and immediately drilled a hole on top. Walnuts instantly gushed out, filling the iron bucket. The sleeping squirrels were still in a dazed state until they saw nuts all over the ground and realized they'd been robbed. As they were picking up the scattered nuts, Dale spotted a giant walnut and got incredibly excited. They decided to move it home immediately. However, the walnut was too heavy. Even using tree branches as a lever didn't work. Suddenly, Dale saw a rock, so he wanted to use it to press down the lever, but the rock bounced off and hit chip right on the head, raising a bump. But Dale hadn't given up. He picked up the rock and threw it at the walnut again. Then the rock bounced back and chip got hit again. After taking two heavy blows, chip was about to lose his temper, but suddenly noticed a large rock on the high ground. So he had a bright idea. He'd push the rock down to smash the walnut. For safety's sake, he had Dale stand in the position below. Unexpectedly, Dale accidentally broke the branch. He immediately changed his original plan and prepared to use the branch to knock the giant walnut away, but the branch got stuck and he didn't notice at all. Chip gave him a hard kick. Suddenly, the sound of a boulder rolling came From behind, the two hugged each other in fright and accidentally dodged the rock's attack. Then the rock slammed hard into the walnut, opening a small hole in it. Through this opening, Donald's Nut Butter factory was revealed before their eyes. But the two squirrels didn't recognize what this was. Suddenly, Donald placed a jar of nut butter on the shelf. The two squirrels immediately opened the lid and smelled the anting aroma. It tasted really good. The squirrel brothers decided on the spot to pack up and take all this nut butter. However, Dale had only moved two bottles when his attention was drawn to the machine below. He got a bit impatient, so he took away one of the bottles, then opened his mouth wide, waiting to be fed. After eating once, turned back around to continue the buffet. But on the third time, he forgot to get off the conveyor belt and entered the packaging process. Donald applied the label and tightened the lid, completely unaware that anything was wrong. The two squirrels also went undetected. Because of this, the angry chip hit Dale and decided to go down himself to move the supplies. At first, they cooperated perfectly. However, when Dale adjusted his position, he missed a bottle. The nut butter instantly hit Donald Duck. Their operation was completely exposed. Just as Donald was about to retaliate, two long branches stuck into his neck. The two squirrels decided to rob openly. Dale turned on the conveyor Belt and put all the nut butter on it to send outside. Soon, they completely looted the cans. Donald Duck broke free with all his strength and so a chase began. Although the two squirrel speed stepping on the cans wasn't slow, the distance between them and Donald was closing. Dale hurriedly threw debris randomly behind him. Donald was instantly flustered. The next second, he actually turned the wood into a boat. At the same time, he vigorously waved a stick. Dale kept dodging. Suddenly, he rubbed to the ground hard, raising dust. Donald's vision was instantly obscured. Finally, he crashed straight into a tree. Since Donald temporarily lost the ability to resist, the two squirrels put him in a hollow log, then aligned the opening above with a hornet's nest. And chip directed Dale to chop down the hornets nest. The falling hornets quickly reached havoc inside the hollow log. Donald's pain had nowhere to vent. Finally.

She didn't dare move a muscle because two ruthless criminals were prowling around outside hunting for her. Now, the thugs were standing right beside the car, and the woman was so terrified she could barely breathe. When the criminals finally moved away, she let out a sigh of relief. She crawled out from under the vehicle, tore strips from her expensive wedding dress and wrapped them around her feet for warmth. Then she made her way to a nearby boat and yanked off its fuel line. Determined to escape, the woman risked being discovered as she dragged the heavy gas tank toward the garage. The snow was so deep that the tank carved deep grooves in the ground as she pulled it along. Just then, she sensed danger and immediately dropped flat into the snow. One of the criminals had emerged from the house, but he failed to spot her hiding in the white powder. Seizing the moment, the woman hauled the gas tank into the garage. If she could just fill up the car with fuel, she could drive away from this nightmare. But as she lifted the tank to a higher position, the noise caught the criminal's attention. He followed the sound into the garage and began searching every corner. The woman pressed herself against the ground under the car and quietly backed toward the doorway. When the Coast was clear. She bolted from the garage only to discover the other criminal emerging behind her carrying a dead body. She quickly dove into an underground passage.

After a thorough examination, everything seemed perfectly fine. But the patient kept screaming in agony, claiming the pain was unbearable. Confused, the dentist couldn't understand why there were no cavities, no swelling, nothing unusual at all, yet the pain was relentless. Suspicious, he took a closer look at the X ray, noticing faint white shadows near the tooth's root. He thought it might just be a reflection, so he advised the patient to go home and rest. Later that evening, as he was finishing his shift, he noticed something strange near the sink, few worms. Quickly removed the filter only to find a pack with tiny worms. Repulse, he tossed the whole filter in the trash. But as soon as he turned on the faucet to wash his hands, a horrifying thought struck him. He rushed back to his office, zoomed in on the old X ray once again. What he saw left him frozen in terror. The white shadows weren't reflections. They were worms very deep in the tooth's root. He had never seen anything like it before. Panic, he rushed to the library, scouring old medical texts. After hours of searching, he finally found a chilling entry in an ancient book. These creatures were called toothworms and they laid their eggs near the teeth, spreading slowly throughout the body, eventually reaching the brain. They were a product of a long forgotten and bio experiment and hadn't been Seen in decade until now. As the realization set in, he grew more anxious. And just then his phone rang. It was the same patient.

When they took off the hat, sure enough, they saw the popcorn on top of his head. So they made a faint and snatched it back. The duck angrily chased after them, but after all, he was just a duck and couldn't handle the agile and nimble squirrels. He fell off the roof. The squirrels even used his hat to hold more popcorn. When They escaped back to the tree hole. The angry duck brought a pile of wood, planning to burn the entire tree. The squirrels didn't panic. They pretended to surrender and threw things to him. Once he thought he had one, he left. Then the squirrels grabbed a box of fresh corn kernels and poured them all into the tree hole. The next second, the tree sprayed popcorn everywhere like snow. The duck was about to lose his mind. Now he had to shovel not only snow, but also popcorn.

Equipment, clothing and recording devices were seized at the scene. The 2 6 year old British creator was taken into custody along with multiple foreign men. Fourteen Australian men who were initially detained were later released without charges, but Bonnie remains under investigation. Authorities said Bonnie had been picking up young men in Bali and recording intimate encounters inside a branded Ute as part of her global content tour. While this activity may be legal in some countries, Indonesian law treats the creation and distribution of explicit material as a serious criminal offence. Police confirmed that Bonnie is being questioned under Indonesia's anti pornography regulations, which carry penalties ranging from heavy fines to several years behind bars.

That afternoon, just as Mike sat down for lunch, he received a message reminding him of his father's upcoming birthday, was ready to decline the invitation when a little boy suddenly appeared beside him, eyes glued to the rice ball in his hand. After a brief pause, Mike handed it to him. The boy devoured it happily. But before he could thank Mike, his older brother rushed over, scolding him and pulling him away. Mike assumed the encounter was nothing more than a fleeting moment. But the next day at noon, he saw the brothers again. The older boy bowed the younger one's head and apologized, explaining that his brother had fallen in love with Mike's rice balls and hoped Mike would teach them how to make them. He then invited Mike to visit their home. Surprisingly, Mike accepted. In their kitchen, he demonstrated step by step, washing and soaking the rice, steaming it in a clay pot, waiting until the steam faded. He laid seaweed on plastic wrap, spread warm rice over it, added whatever fillings he liked, and rolled it together. Soon, an entire plate of neatly shaped rice balls was done. Mike intended to leave right after the lesson, but the older brother stopped him.

As her friend poured out her troubles, Lucy used a computer to rapidly study all theoretical knowledge related to brain development. When she finally finished learning the theories, she used telekinesis to call Professor Norman, a world leading brain scientist. The professor clearly couldn't believe she'd gotten through over 6,000 of his papers in just a few minutes. Lucy offered to recite them to him on the spot and told him to meet her at once. The professor was stunned. Lucy projected herself onto the TV screen and told the professor she had absorbed a large amount of synthetic CPH4 and her brain utilization rate had reached 28%. This proved the professor's theory, once the brain reaches 20% utilization, it will break all barriers like Domino's. Lucy said she could no longer feel pain, fear, desire, or other such emotions, and even her humanity was gradually fading away. She was lost and sought the professor's advice. The professor pointed out the entire purpose of life is to pass on the knowledge one has Learned. There is no higher goal. Thus she should, like any simple cell, pass on her.

He demanded to know why his mother gave only his brother that special treat. But the mother abruptly shut him down. From that moment on, quiet fracture formed inside the boy's heart. Fifteen years later, the younger brother had grown into a thriving entrepreneur, a man who had even made his first million.

The owner asked for his thoughts, and the man praised his impressive cooking, then mentioned that he wished to bring back the meals his mother used to cook. Hearing that, the owner LED him upstairs, had his daughter record every detail he could recall. To recreate that long lost flavor, the owner traveled to the man's hometown, studied the local produce, and even cooked Alongside the villagers to learn their methods.

At the sprint, I sneaked up behind her rival, giving her a little nudge, enough to make her miss the starting signal. But the girl was fast, too fast, and soon caught up. I positioned myself at the finish line, sticking out my foot. But even that couldn't stop Jenny. She crossed first, leaving everyone in awe. Next came the long jump. I carried Jenny effortlessly to the farthest point. No one noticed because ghosts aren't seen. With that invisible boost, she shattered the world record with ease. Then her rival stepped up, but I stood directly in her path. My interference left her struggling, jumping less than a meter. The discus throw was her rival's specialty. She flung it effortlessly over 10 meters. But one accidental throw hit me in the head. Lucky for me, my powers healed instantly. Seconds later, a javelin came hurtling toward me. Whether intentional or not, I dodged just in time. Pole vault was next. Her rival soared impressively. But when it was Jenny's turn, I snapped the pole in half.

Another kid discovered he could actually fly, but no one knew how high he might drift. So the teacher strapped a rope around him, trying to keep him grounded.

Like a dark parasite, she surrendered her body to it, powerless to resist. The next day, during the school anniversary Celebration, the girl was called on stage to demonstrate her magic. She summoned a massive sphere of fire with both hands, but a sinister silhouette rose up behind her. In an instant, the shadow twisted itself into a demon. The crowd froze as terror swept Through the courtyard. Right then, students from the Flame Academy join forces, conjuring a colossal fireball and hurling it at the creature. But the blazing attack vanished the moment it touched the demon. Next, students from the flying academy lifted off to strike from the air, but a single roar from the demon sent them crashing down one by one.

The second guy yanked out a gun in pure panic, trying desperately to defend himself. But the attacker didn't even flinch.

Determined to avenge their fallen brothers, they stormed into the territory run by the Mexican crew. But strangely, the streets were silent. Too silent. No one stepped out. No one fired back. Nothing moved except the tension tightening around them. Kevin was seconds away from charging in headfirst, ready to start a war regardless of the consequences. But just then, Franklin returned, and he was furious. He couldn't believe that he'd been gone for barely a day and everything had already spiraled into chaos. Back home, he chewed everyone out for losing their cool, reminded them that if the enemy had the guts to come kill on their doorstep, it meant they were confident, maybe even prepared. For all out retaliation. Rushing blindly into their turf would be like shoving their head straight into a wolf's mouth. Once everyone calmed down, Franklin demanded the full story. The crew explained that earlier that day, a woman had purchased all their product and left behind a business card. And that very same night, the attack had gone down. Franklin dialed the number, demanding to know what she had done and who she had angered, but the woman insisted she knew absolutely nothing. Are you sure, lady? Because my boys were slaughtered right after you left your card on my table. I didn't know. I haven't heard anything. Who even are you? Lucio via Nueva. Then tell me, Lucia. Do you know who killed my people? I have no idea. Xia offered to look into it, proposing they meet somewhere neutral. Because she understood one thing perfectly. The only way to survive this spiraling mess was to clear the misunderstanding before the bloodshed grew into something unstoppable.

After eating, she headed upstairs to take a shower and Claire quietly followed. Just as Claire reached for the bathroom door, Kamaya swung it open and said, could you grab my towel? Her voice was so normal it felt unreal. Claire's heart nearly exploded. She rushed into Kamaya's old room and frantically rearranged everything to look Exactly how it used to be. Terrified Kamaya might sense something was off. After handing her the towel, Claire went downstairs in a daze, her mind spinning with fear and disbelief and immediately called her ex husband.

But when he arrived and heard water running behind the bathroom door, he opened it and saw someone standing inside. What are you doing? Get out of there, he shouted. But he was just as stunned as Claire. Neither of them had any explanation for the impossible sight. When Peter returned home, Claire told him straight. Kamaya came back.

He suspected Ryan might be overworked, hallucinating, so he called a military doctor and ordered Ryan to be taken to the hospital for evaluation. Another veteran pilot requested a test flight, but the moment he tried to lift off, the same wall materialized before his eyes, forcing him to hit the emergency brakes to land safely. Reported to the squadron leader the wall was real. For safety, the mission was immediately cancelled. Then a third pilot stepped forward, determined to verify it personally. The same terrifying event occurred. He saw the wall and slammed the brakes in sheer panic. The squadron leader, now furious, called off all test flights and summoned the top pilot for a serious debrief. No accident had happened yet, but he knew that if the pilot's confidence broke, disaster could strike at any moment. Captain Ryan admitted the gravity of the situation, but insisted it was merely an illusion. The runway was completely clear. He speculated the entire squadron might be imagining it due to exhaustion. Still, the leader was determined to solve the mystery. As the safety of every pilot hung in the balance, they all entered the flight simulator. The leader ran countless scenarios on the computer but found nothing. Unusual, Ryan explained, that the wall only appeared during real flights, never in simulation. He insisted on testing it at the actual airfield. Immediately, they headed to the site. Ryan climbed swiftly into the cockpit and the squadron leader.

Ethan lay on the operating table while the girl's family stood before him. Her father gripped the phone, fire burning in his eyes.

His friends tried to embarrass him, empting him from below as he spoke, but that level of distraction couldn't stop Jack's speech. What he didn't expect was Anna already waiting beneath the stage. She opened a pre prepared entrance and slid right into Jack's clothing. At that moment, Jack could do nothing but silently endure the trouble she caused. But he underestimated Anna's determination to embarrass him the next instant. Still mid speech, Jack rolled his eyes as if struck by a sudden jolt. Yet he continued reading his script fluently. But as the speech approached its climax, he finally couldn't hold back and let out a few strange sound. In the end, Jack managed to finish his speech, though his face was twisted from the stress.

Irena opened the door and found potential buyers staring at her, their curious eyes making her pulse spike. It turned out her sister had ignored all her desperate objections and insisted on selling the home filled with memories. The moment the contract was signed, Irena slammed the door, her frustration boiling over as she returned to the nightmare she had to erase. She dropped the blood soaked knife into a pot of boiling water, watching the rising steam twist like ghosts around her. After finishing the grim cleanup, she boarded the bus, but her nerves stayed taut, as if someone might grab her any second. Then, on the way, she saw police pulling a man from the canal, the same man she'd stabbed less than 24 hours ago. The investigation had clearly begun, and icy fear crawled up her spine, tightening like an invisible trap. Even at her desk, her hands trembled slightly, terrified that the smallest slip might expose her terrible secret. That was when the chief editor casually asked the team about the day's headline story, almost making her heart stop. Usually quiet, she was about to mention the murder, but a coworker spoke first, pushing her back into her invisible role. Frustration boiling inside her, she suddenly blurted out, the victim was probably murdered. Her voice thin but reckless. The room fell still as everyone turned toward her. Their Puzzled stares, drilling into her like spotlights. Realizing she had said too much, he quickly claimed she heard it on the bus. Trying to look calm despite the panic rising, Jeff, who handled Intel, confirmed moments later, male, late 20s, found by a jogger floating in the canal. 14 stab wounds, arms, legs, hands. Jesus. The scene must have been brutal. And the water washed away almost everything the killer could have left behind. So we've got nothing. Hearing that, the boss began assigning tasks once again, skipping over Irena like she didn't exist. Refusing to stay in the shadows, she approached him and asked to join Anthony in visiting the victim's family. The boss resisted at first, but after hearing she was good at comforting relatives, he reluctantly agreed, though with doubt. At the victim's home, the walls were covered with photos. Tightening her chest with a creeping sense of dread, she excused herself to the restroom, then silently slipped into Ryan's room, every step weighed down by tension. In the trash, she found a termination letter for misconduct, damning evidence she hadn't expected to see. Trying to convince herself Ryan deserved what happened, she visited his co workers. For anything to ease her guilt, Dave told her Ryan had spread vile rumors that he liked little girls, destroying his reputation just for amusement. To make the lie believable, Ryan had even hacked Dave's computer and uploaded a bathtub photo of Dave's own daughter. Hearing this dark truth eased Her guilt only slightly, though the fear inside her continued to twist and grow. But on her way back to the office, she. She spotted realtors entering her house with appraisers. Her heart seized instantly. There were still traces of blood in the bathroom. She had never managed to scrub clean.

Satisfied, he pulled a tiny bottle of glue from his pocket and carefully coated the slot where cash would emerge. Then, acting casually, he strolled away and lingered a short distance off, patiently waiting for his Mark. Soon, a wealthy businessman approached the machine, inserted his card, withdrew money, but no notes appeared. Concerned, he assumed a malfunction and walked away without another thought. One by one, more people tried. All of them left empty handed, each convinced the ATM was broken. Ethan remained in the shadows, observing quietly, biding his time for the perfect moment. Half an hour later, when the area was deserted, he returned to the machine, slid in his card and withdrew a single dollar, just enough to trigger the mechanism. The instant the ATM activated, Ethan slammed it with force. What followed was breathtaking. Banknotes poured out like a torrential storm.

The giant comfortably scooped up a pile of bread with a shovel like utensil, dipped it into eggs and swallowed it. All at once, a satisfied smile spread across his face. At the Queen's signal, a huge coffee pot was handed to him and poured directly into his bowl. Following royal protocol, he drank the entire cup in one go. But soon he couldn't handle the taste. While he could manage human food, the drinks were another matter. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a homemade green soda. A little girl nearby looked worried, both scared and embarrassed. She had seen the effects of the soda before when she visited the giant's home. Unlike regular soda, its bubbles move downward instead of rising up. Everyone knew that rising bubbles caused burps, but what about sinking bubbles? Only someone who had witnessed it could guess. The girl still remembered what happened after drinking the green soda. Now the giant was offering it again. He poured the soda into crystal glasses and handed them to everyone. Out of politeness, they all drank, but within moments their expressions changed. The servant was the first to lose control, followed by the guards. And then even the Queen couldn't hold it in. Strange noises echoed throughout the palace, and the royal dogs were quickly ushered out. The Queen took a deep breath. At last the diplomatic dinner came to a chaotic end.

The stranger pressed a button and the pool gate slammed shut, trapping her beneath the water. She struggled frantically to escape, pounding on the glass until passengers inside the cabin noticed. Oh, my god, help me. She was pulled to safety. When she asked those nearby, no one had seen the mysterious figure. Back in her room, preparing to shower, she turned and saw a dark silhouette past the bathroom door. Checking the glass, she only found a warning left by the stranger. Curious, she returned to her bedroom to steady herself, trying to piece together the events since boarding the ship last night. Shouting from Cabin 10 next door had woken her. She opened the door to investigate but heard a splash. Walking to the railing, she gazed out to see where a blond woman floated in the water. She turned, spotting a handprint appearing on the wall. Eyes wide with fear, he spun around to alert the captain. As the alarm blared, the cruise ship went into high alert. Crew members scoured the waters through the night, searching for the missing passenger, but found nothing. She informed the crew that the blonde from Cabin 10 had fallen overboard. Yet the security chief, Mister Harrow, wore an uneasy expression because Cabin 10 had never been occupied, Elena's eyes flickered. This cabin has always been empty. Those around her cast strange glances. She felt.

Within minutes, the insect pulled out a large chunk of gold, and in just 10 minutes, he had a full jar of gold. His excitement was obvious, his grin wide as he saw the pile grow. He quickly set up an alcohol lamp, carefully pouring the gold onto a tray. The woman stirred the molten gold with a spoon, her hand steady as the liquid melted into a brilliant golden pool. With a satisfied smile, the husband grabbed a mold and poured the gold into it, crafting a gold earring. He then retrieved a small bowl of diamonds and with precision embedded each one into the earring. It shimmered luxuriously, a stunning piece of jewelry. With a flick of his finger, he admired his work. This would certainly fetch a high price. What he hadn't told her was that he'd secretly opened a gold jewelry store behind her back. The gold from her earwax was now worth $50,000 per piece. His business, long established, was thriving. In one night alone, his stock sold out to wealthy families and he was counting the profits joyfully. Just then, a noble woman called him. She wanted to commission an exclusive piece of jewelry, offering a staggering $1 million. His reply was instant, no problem. The next evening, the husband returned to the bedroom with his hat, ready to repeat his secret of ritual, but this time, the Woman's ear was swollen red and filled with unbearable pain.

He would lift the heaviest barbells, fortifying his arms and muscles from morning until night, practicing relentlessly without pause. When hundreds of kilograms of dumbbells slammed to the floor, the ground itself seemed to tremble. Becoming the world arm wrestling champion had always been his dream. His greatest rival was the reigning world champion, rain. In every match, rain would place a brick on the table, and out of habit, he would try to break his opponent's wrist so no one dared challenge him again. Rain had used performance enhancing drugs for years, but he even facing such a dangerous adversary, Wang Hao never thought of quitting arm wrestling. He made himself stronger, stronger, and could now even pull a car with a single arm. Finally, the tournament began. All competitors were extremely powerful, including some new players who had never tasted defeat, and of course, the defending champion, rain. They all posed massive challenges to Wong how. He easily won his first match, while another equally strong wrestler also defeated all opponent and advanced to the next round. But in the following match, something went wrong for Wong how. His opponent deliberately committed a foul, not only defeating him, but also injuring his wrist. The referee saw everything and called for a rematch. Wong how was given another chance. This time he went all out, overpowering his Opponent, and with that victory, he advanced to the semifinals. Wong how kept winning match after match until he faced a brand new contender, undefeated and formidable. At first they were evenly matched, neither able to gain the upper hand.

And I brushed for a full 30 minutes. I didn't stop until my whole mouth was bleeding. I hated my father because he never taught me how to brush my teeth. And I hated him for letting me grow up poor. But even after I became a servant in a rich family, I still lived in a basement crawling with roaches. But once I saw how the wealthy lived, I started to resent how dark a poor person's life really is. To please my employers, I dressed up like some cartoon Genie to celebrate their birthday. After the lady of the house got drunk and wild, they still wanted to go out racing. But tragedy hit fast. A man suddenly appeared on the road and was hit and killed instantly. They wanted to call the police and an ambulance, but I told them to leave right away because no one is out on the roads that late, and there are barely any cameras in India. So I cleaned up the blood and covered their tracks. I thought I was doing my duty as a loyal servant, but I never expected. I wasn't saving them. I was ruining myself. The next day, the whole family showed up, acting unusually kind to me, even calling me family. Then they handed me a confession letter. I was stunned when I read it. I never thought they'd sell me out. Not Even a penny in compensation. Just like that, I became their scapegoat. I wandered the streets in a daze, feeling like I was worth less than the monkeys on the power lines. Servants of a low cast have no choices, only fate. I waited in that dark room for the police to come. But days passed and no one came. Turns out the man who died was low caste too. No one even bothered to report it, so I didn't need to take the blame after all. I thank the landlord excitedly, but he kicked me away, seeing how I was treated. Anna and Jack got into a huge fight. Because she'd been educated, Anna cared about human rights and freedom. She couldn't stand the caste system anymore or this family's obsession with status. So she came to me secretly late at night, asking me to take her to the airport before flying back to America. She gave me some money, saying it was her way of making things right. When Jack found out she left, he was furious and took all his anger out on me. Trying to comfort him, I took him to eat street food and even took him to pray, telling him that if he prayed sincerely, Anna would come back. But all he got was divorce papers, and I became his punching bag again. As a servant, I was always loyal to Jack. But if he no longer saw me as a human being, then I decided I had no reason to stay loyal either

Maybe we should start with the obvious suspect, Mr Loomis said, stopping right next to Denny's seat. And up. Denny's face went white. What? Why me? Because I saw you near my bag earlier. Stand up. I walked past it to get to the bathroom, that's all. Mr Illiumus grabbed Denny by the arm and yanked him into the aisle. Empty your pockets. I didn't do anything. Empty them now. Denny turned out his pockets with shaking hands. A crumpled tissue, some change, nothing else. Mr Loomis grabbed Denny's backpack and dumped everything onto the bus floor, books and papers and a Brown bag lunch scattered everywhere. A few kids laughed nervously. It's not here, Denny said, his voice cracking. I told you I didn't take it. Then where did you hide it? Mr Loomis was getting louder now, his face red. I know it was you. You've been a problem all year, failing my class, showing up late, always with an attitude. I don't have an attitude. You just don't like me because you're a thief. I could.

Keep your eyes forward no matter what you see or hear. For the next 50 minutes, do that and you pass. Leave your seat for any reason. You fail. Someone laughed. That's it. That's it.

Is that what you tell your mother when she comes home exhausted from working 60 hour weeks because of you, Mr Samuels? Come on, Billy said from his seat. This is messed up. Then leave Billy doors right there. Of course you'll fail. Billy shifted in his seat, look down at his desk, stayed. Sophie's eyes were wet. Now please stop. Stop what?

So I'm 23, living with my college roommate Ashley, in an apartment we split. Ashley's super close with her helicopter mom, who lives nearby and basically treats Ashley like she's still 12. Ashley's mom helped us get this place and co signed the lease. She has spare keys for emergencies only. Ashley's always been babied and never really lived independently. Her mom still does her laundry, brings groceries, and calls every night to check in. Last Friday, I went out with work friends for happy hour after a brutal week. Got home around 11 p m. Totally normal for Friday night. I'm quietly unlocking our door when suddenly it swings open before I can turn the key. Ashley's mom is standing there in fuzzy pink pajamas. With this stern look. She goes, where have you been, young lady? It's a school night. I'm confused as hell. Like what? I work full time in marketing, it's Friday night, and I'm 23 years old. I politely explain I was out with co workers getting drinks. She starts lecturing about responsibility and how girls my age shouldn't be out drinking on weeknights. First of all, it's Friday. I'm trying to get past her when she blocks me and holds out her hand like a crossing guard. Give me your car keys. You're grounded for the weekend. I actually burst out laughing. Because I thought she was joking, but she's dead serious and repeats it. I need to hand over my keys because I was completely irresponsible, and Ashley told her how worried she was.

My eight year old daughter Ella has been through hell. Her mom is a complete mess. Drugs, alcohol, arrests, the whole disaster package. I got full custody when she was little and I've been with my wife Laura since Ella was 2. Laura knew exactly what she was signing up for when we got married. She said she was cool with it all, that she understood Ella came first. But now Laura wants to adopt Ella to completely cut out her biological mom. And I get it. Every time Ella's mom shows up for her court ordered visits, she either doesn't come at all or shows up high. Last time she came to pick up Ella for a supervised visit, she reeked of weed and couldn't even remember what grade Ella was in. The social worker had to send her home. Ella's been in therapy for years trying to process why her mom can't just be normal. She draws pictures of them together sometimes where her mom looks clean and happy. It breaks my heart every single time. But even with all this pain, Ella doesn't want Laura to adopt her. When I asked her about it privately, she said she still loves her real mom and hopes she'll get better someday. Laura lost it when I told her Ella's decision. She started going on about how we have our two other kids. To think About how Ella might choose her train wreck mom over us if she keeps coming around. She said she's tired of just being the stepmom when she's been more of a mother to Ella than her actual mom ever was. I've been putting Ella first for six years, she said, pacing.

I've been working through the pain for three days. The supervisor blew up on the spot and started yelling at me. His words were harsh, but I still wanted to beg him for another chance.

Addicted to the thrill, Lisa attended a party hosted by her crush. With friends, Daniel deliberately took her to the beach, winning her over with sweet talk. In a moment of impulse, Lisa lost her senses. Yet after satisfying his desires, Daniel never contacted her again. She waited daily for his call, chronicling every feeling in her diary. One day, she encountered Daniel again. He lured her to his home, only to abandon her once more afterward. Returning home, she Learned her beloved grandmother had been placed in a nursing home by her mother, plunging her into despair. To avoid Daniel's contempt, Lisa began mimicking his behavior, actively seducing the man at the next table. She gently held a straw between her teeth, deliberately displaying it before the man. Soon, he approached and tentatively placed his hand on her waist. But at the last moment, Lisa stood up and left, laughing and joking with her friends. In that moment, Lisa seemed to grasp the thrill Daniel enjoyed. That evening, when Daniel called again, she decided to go to the meeting spot. What she didn't expect was that besides Daniel, a stranger was also present. Furious, Lisa tried to flee. But one remark from Daniel ignited her competitive spirit.

Sensing something is wrong, the girl immediately opens her eyes. She's terrified, but thankfully they soon arrive at their destination. A luxurious mansion appears before her. Without a second thought, the girl gets out and walks inside. This is her new workplace. Little does she know, her nightmare is about to begin. Her employer, a woman, explains that her job for the foreseeable future is to take care of their son. Everything seems normal until the girl sees the child. She's completely stunned. The child she's supposed to care for is actually a motionless doll. Seeing this, the girl can't help but laugh. She assumes the couple is just playing a joke on her, but when she sees the serious looks on their faces, she realizes they're not kidding. To break the awkward silence, the girl walks up and says hello to the doll. It's so nice to meet you, Brahms. I hope that you and I can be friends. Faced with such a strange family, the girl is a bit scared, but out of curiosity, she decides to stay. Little does she know, this decision will nearly cost her her life. The woman tells her that they've hired many nannies before, but their son didn't seem to like any of them. He seems to have taken a special liking to her, though. Then the Woman continues saying her duties include waking their son at 7:00am every day and changing his clothes for him. Hearing this, the girl finds it absurd. But since she chose to stay, she has no choice but to follow their instructions. She assumes it's all just an elaborate act, so she doesn't think much of it. She slowly starts to adapt to this strange lifestyle. But then one day, as she passes the couple's room, she sees something unsettling. Couple is kneeling by the bed, whispering something to the doll. Just as the girl stares in disbelief, the old man turns and sees her. Could you give us a moment alone to speak to Brahms privately? Sure. Shut out of the room, the girl returns to hers and calls her best friend to tell her what happened. She was hoping for some advice on whether to stay or leave, but her friend just says, it's just taking care of a doll. What's there to be afraid of? It can't talk, it can't move. The couple is just being weird. Besides, you moved to this strange city to get away from your obsessive ex boyfriend. If you quit this job, you won't be able to make ends meet. After hearing this, the girl thinks her friend has a point. This strengthens her resolve to stay. But the next morning, while she's combing her hair, she hears a strange noise from the room next door. How could you? What have you done? Wait till I tell daddy you've done this. Mommy has to go now, and you have to be a good boy because you promised us. I apologize for the rush, Miss Evans. It's so long since we've been on holiday. So this means that for the next few days, she'll be all alone in the house with the doll. Although she's terrified, she has to make a living, so she has no choice. So if nothing goes wrong, then something is about to go very wrong.

But that's when I Learned he was the owner of the restaurant. The staff kicked me out instead. Just as I was about to leave in despair, my condition suddenly worsened and I collapsed. He panicked and rushed me to the hospital. I didn't do anything to her, I swear. Oh, look, she's alive. Do you see? I'm not guilty. See, this stage for cancer. The doctor told him I was in the final stage of cancer. His mind went completely blank. All he felt was deep regret. Later, he brought me a dinner, hoping to apologize. But by then, I already hated him. He had ruined my last wish to wear a beautiful dress and have a meal at a fine French restaurant. I kicked him out. The next day, he came back with a chef. Since I couldn't leave the hospital room, he decorated it like a restaurant, trying to fulfill my final wish. When I saw how much effort he put in, I didn't reject his kindness, but I gave him two conditions. First, I need a dress. Turn around. Seeing his sincerity, I decided to let go of my anger. When I came out wearing my dress, his eyes were fixed on me. With him by my side, I enjoyed my last candle at dinner that night. We truly got to know each other and both of us felt something stir inside. But good times never last. The doctor said I needed to rest. As he got up to leave, I suddenly called out to him, thanking him for everything he had done. When he looked at me, I could tell he wanted to kiss me, but I firmly refused because I didn't want to drag him into my final days. After that, he couldn't focus on work anymore. All he could think about was me. He went back to the hospital to tell me how he truly felt. I just want to be you. I have about three days left. I will remember these sweet days for the rest of my life. This seriously, who the hell decided it should be exactly 3 days, huh? He refused to accept that I was dying. He begged the doctors to save me, saying he'd pay any price. There is an experimental treatment in Paris, but they don't guarantee. Okay. And you could open some more restroom for this money. It would cost you, too. Without a moment of hesitation, he agreed. The doctor, moved by his sincerity, revealed that I was actually her daughter. Because she couldn't afford the medical costs, she could only watch me suffer in pain. I was able to fulfill your dream. When I finally woke up, I saw him. Sitting beside me, he told me the surgery was a success. I was deeply moved by everything he'd done, so I invited him to share another dinner at his restaurant. I have no restaurant but the guide. May God send me the angel, and I now have you.

Where's mom? My son has been dead for 7 years, but today he suddenly appeared at home, running around in front of me, looking exactly the same as he did before he died. I could hardly believe it. I couldn't touch him, but he seemed so alive. I drove straight to my ex wife's house, begging her to come back with me to see our son. But she thought I lost my mind. She remarried six years ago and told me to stop showing up and ruining her life. When I got home, I lied to my son and said his mom couldn't come. Then he vanished again. I couldn't tell if what I saw was real or just my imagination. I drank myself into a stupor. Later that day, my ex wife showed up anyway. I knew she still cared about our boy, so I took her to his room and there he was calling out, mom. She bolted out the door. She thought I'd hired some kid to pretend to be our son just to hurt her all over again. She hit me and ran away crying. After she left, I cleaned up our son's room for the first time in 7 years. Then he appeared again, asking when his mom would come home. I couldn't tell him that she didn't belong to this family anymore. It would have been too cruel. I went to see a medium. She said my son must have some unfinished Wish, but what could a 5 year old possibly wish for? Maybe he just wanted to see his mom. So I went to my ex wife again, begging her to come back one last time. I told her our son spirit was still waiting at home. She finally agreed. As soon as she walked in, she heard sounds from his room. She rushed in and saw him. Just like I said, Mommy, I knew you'd come. She reached out to touch him, but a bright light pushed her back. Still, she could talk to him, play with him, just not touch him. She was stunned, but she stayed. From that day on, we made an agreement. She'd come over during the day pretending to be so she could spend time with our son and I take over after work at night. It was our way of making up for all the lost time. After a few days, I quit my job. I wanted to spend more time with our boy. But my ex wife was furious. We had a terrible fight seven years ago. I took our son out during a storm. Car skidded. He was thrown from his seat, hit the window and died instantly. She's blamed me ever since. She says I buried everything too quickly, hid my guilt behind a bottle while she had to live with the pain alone. But I only wanted to spare her the heartbreak. She was the one who left the one Who built a new family? We shouted at each other, and suddenly the lights exploded. Our son walked down the stairs and said softly, I just want us to be like we used to be.

Next, he used the pen tip he'd secretly hidden while signing his prison admission papers to pick the lock on his handcuffs. He then pushed open the window, locked the handcuffs onto it and used the chain to connect the window to the main door. Finally, he returned to the desk, grabbed a water cup and hurled it at the door. The reinforcements outside sensed something was wrong and drew their guns. The captain tried to open the door but couldn't budget. His teammates fetched an iron bar and worked together to pry the door open. The female officer opened her eyes and reacted swiftly. She tried to stop her teammates from opening the door, but it was too late. He stepped forward and covered her mouth. The door swung open, the window shattered. The captain rose, entered the interrogation room and checked the window. Then he turned, leading the others downstairs to pursue the spy, leaving only one officer to untie the female officer. The guard closed the police station's main door. They reached the first floor but found no trace of the suspect. He leapt from the window sill and kicked the lone officer unconscious. Then he grabbed his daughter's birthday cake and fled. Downstairs, teammates noticed an odd Mark on the captain's neck. The captain surmised it was A drop of blood dripped by the suspect when he leaned out the window. They turned to rush upstairs, but he had already hidden around the corner. The captain rushed back to the interrogation room where only the female officer remained. He mobilized the entire station, searching every corner of the building. They opened every vehicle trunk, but the suspect was nowhere to be found. The captain issued a full scale search order, deploying everyone inside the station. Yet they still couldn't locate the suspect. The captain stopped the car. The female officer realised only the trunk of the captain's official vehicle had not been searched. She signalled to the captain, who slowly reached for his holstered pistol. In that instant, as a tram approached, the suspect leapt out of the car. Using the tram as cover, he blocked the pursuing officers. He had completely evaded capture.

Bart taped up Maggie's pacifier. Facing the incoming Hurricane, Flanders turned his house into a fortress like structure. He mocked Homer, saying Homer's house would be blown down. It was only when Homer saw a bowling alley flying overhead that he realized he was right in the eye of the storm. The strong winds swept the whole family up, but luckily Marge's powerful arm strength saved them all. The Simpsons hit in the basement as the Hurricane grew stronger. Even the roof was torn off. After Marge prayed, the Hurricane finally stopped. The Simpsons house remained intact, but their neighbor Flanders House was reduced to rubble with his family trapped under the debris. Fortunately, none of them were seriously injured. The Flanders moved into a relief center where Rod and Todd had to wear clothes from the donation box. Flanders was deeply depressed, but Maud quickly comforted him, saying their left handed store would open soon. However, the TV news showed that after being hit by the Hurricane, people took their anger out on the left handed store. Just as the Flanders family was feeling dejected, Homer rallied all the townspeople to rebuild Flanders House. Homer showed Flanders around the new house. Flanders noticed one nail wasn't properly hammered in and one out of 25 ain't bad. And there was an extra toilet next to the fridge. A clown poster was holding up the house's structural weight. I wouldn't take it down if I were you. It's a load bearing poster. Additionally, the wires in one room short circuited, making Flanders hair stand up like a sea urchin. Even more ridiculous, the hallway leading to the master bedroom got lower and lower. Flanders couldn't even get in. What do you think of the house that Love Built?

That night, while we slept, he took Scissors and cut off all my hair. He thought destroying the hair would disable this sweater's Protection, never grasping that our bond needed no magical triggers. Furious, I kicked him out for good because I've decided to live with her forever.

It was the first time he'd ever tried to fix such an ugly face. Mo had been maliciously cropped out of posters because of his looks, so he'd made up his mind to get plastic surgery. Doctor thought his ugly face would be an extremely tough challenge, but still decided to do his best. So Mo was wheeled into the operating room. When the nurses saw his face, they were shocked by how ugly it was. I'm awake here. The doctor soon realized the drug wasn't anesthetic at all. The nurse had mixed up the medications. But once the drug kicked in, Mo still passed out quickly. A week later, the day to remove the bandages finally arrived. Homer screamed out loud. Mo thought he'd only gotten uglier, but when he looked in the mirror, he'd actually turned into a handsome guy. Homer told him to enjoy life as a good looking man. But Mo was already planning to get revenge on the TV station. He'd auditioned there before, but the director had rejected him outright, saying he was too ugly. Homer offered to help with the revenge by burning down the film crew set. But surprisingly, the director only took one look at Mo and decided to cast him as the lead actor. Wow! Wow, Homer, change of plans. Whatever. Mo became a movie star in no time. Later, the director Sent him the latest script. Mo flew into a rage the second he saw it. The character he was supposed to play was written to die. So on the day of the performance, he and Homer changed the plot without permission. Homer even spilled the entire next year's worth of storylines. The director immediately stopped the show when he saw what was happening. What the hell are you doing? Sticking it to you for killing off my character. Dr. Winslow was only going to die in a dream. Mo tried to save his job, but the director fired him on the spot. Mo still thought he could definitely get roles in other crews with his good looks. But right after he left, a plank hit him square in the face. Oh, my face! I'm not supposed to put weight on it!

Marge had thought the bag she had her eye on only cost fifty dollars, but when she got to the checkout, she was told the actual price was five hundred dollars. Unwilling to lose face in front of her friends, she maxed out her credit card to buy it. Homer was instantly furious. He wouldn't even splurge on a new vacuum cleaner. Is that the cat in there? Well, it's a cat. I'm not sure it's the cat. Marge decided to return the bag, but before that, they went to Springfield's best restaurant. At first, the waiter LED them to a table in the corner. But when the waiter noticed the bag in her hand, he immediately moved them to the restaurant's best table. To protect the bag, Marge walked extra carefully around the restaurant. She had planned to check the bag in for temporary storage, but the staff's wet nail polish startled her. Before heading home, Homer insisted on having one last shrimp. Unfortunately, the shrimp juice splattered all over Marge's bag. Next day, Marge went to the store to return the bag. The clerk inspected it carefully. Luckily, the salesperson didn't notice the stains, and Marge successfully got a refund check. Homer then spotted a loophole in the store's free return policy. Enjoy luxury items for free first, then return them angrily to get the money back. After that, the entire store might as well have been Their personal closet. Homer dressed himself head to toe in luxury goods, and even the carpet in their house cost $500. He brought all sorts of home appliances back, too, but left all the price tags intact. He didn't even dare peel off the protective film on the TV. Six days later, Homer planned to return everything.

Homer tried to lose weight by eating bell peppers. He replaced his usual potato chips with bell peppers and swapped his alcohol for bell pepper juice. Not quite. Yeah, get out. When watching a baseball game, Bart ate a hot dog while Homer only ate three bell peppers to satisfy his cravings. But what drove Homer to despair was that when he weighed himself again, he had actually gained 7 pounds. Homer tried to argue that the extra weight was just muscle. Marge couldn't help but suspect Homer was sneaking snacks, but Homer ate a bell pepper right in front of her to prove his innocence. Wrong again. Haha. Which only made Marge even angrier. One day while watching TV, Marge stumbled upon a show called the informant, which claimed to expose the truth about boyfriends. decided to use this show to find evidence of Homer's secret snacking.

The crew filmed him mashing up all the food in the buffet into a Soup and drinking it all in one go. That night, the crew finally caught Homer taking a woman to a hotel. Once they entered the room, Homer took off the woman's clothes only to find that it wasn't a person at all. It was a huge piece of lamb. He immediately pounced on it like a greedy pig and started gnawing. The film crew captured every moment of this, even filming Homer still chewing on the lamb while taking a shower.

I totally freaked out and quickly grabbed the hair removal spray. After a cloud of thick smoke, my calves became perfectly smooth. But the very next second, my entire body was covered in spines again. My mood instantly crashed. Today was supposed to be the day my boyfriend proposed. I brace my foot hard against the door handle. If he saw me like this, he definitely break up with me. I grabbed a razor in a panic, but the spines were harder than iron. They snap the blade right off. The situation was critical. I quickly spread hair removal wax all over my legs and stuck on bandages, clenching the razor handle between my teeth. The pain brought tears to my eyes, but not a single spine came off. My boyfriend was already trying to poke his head through the window. He was losing patience. Terrified, I collapsed on the floor. I couldn't let him see me like this. I snatched my back, pulled out a pair of tweezers and with all my strength, I started plucking. To my surprise, it actually worked. I quickly covered the spots with bandages, then grabbed foundation from my bag and applied it all over. Oh, my god, it worked. My skin looked absolutely flawless. I was glowing. Just as my boyfriend reached his limit, I finally opened the door. Radiant and smooth all over, I flashed him a killer smile. He Was completely mesmerized. I pulled him inside and he admired my smooth legs, saying he'd never seen skin so soft. Seeing how happy he was, I smiled with relief. But his joy lasted only two seconds before sharp spines sprouted all over my legs again. In moments, my whole body turned into a pain cushion. My boyfriend bolted and her heartbroken. I broke down sobbing. But to my surprise, it didn't abandon me.

Next, I pulled out the IV bag and dripped water directly onto the bear. Instantly, my husband's pants were soaked. The nurse thought he'd wet himself and looked at him with utter disgust before storming off. To this day, neither of the nurses that I was behind it all.

The crystal shoes were too small and her feet were too big. Still, the man forced the shoes onto her feet, pulled her up and made her dance. After just a few steps, her feet swelled up like balloons. The man showed no sign of stopping until he accidentally kicked the top of her foot. Unable to bear it any longer, she shoved him away, flung off the crystal shoes and breathe thy deep sigh of relief. Seeing the anger on his face, she took off her wedding ring, walked over, threw it right at him and left with her head held high. After all, only the wearer knows if the shoe fits. Confused, the men picked up the crystal Shoes and forced them onto his own feet. Though they hurt, he could tolerate it. He cried.

That way I could go to work with peace of mind. But I still underestimated his ability to get up to no good. He actually hit a woman inside the sofa behind my back, pulling her out as soon as I left and really can't be trusted. Luckily, I had put him in the fingerprint locked alloy shorts. It definitely limited his performance. But the woman insisted she had a way. Confidently, she took out steel cutters, planning to just cut the shorts right off him. Just then I returned and caught them right through the window. But she clearly underestimated the strength of my alloy shorts. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't damage them at all. Instead, her cutters shattered into pieces. My husband was hopping mad. The woman quickly moved to Plan B. She decided to use fridge magnets to disrupt the internal circuitry of the alloy shorts. At first it seemed to have some effect, so she covered the shorts with magnets. Just when they thought they'd succeeded, the magnets suddenly repelled away, violently knocking the women out cold. The shorts performed brilliantly. Frightened, my husband rushed to give her water, but accidentally grabbed vinegar instead. She spat it right onto the shorts, causing some minor interference. Suddenly, the woman had another idea. She poured a whole basin of water over my husband. He was instantly electrocuted and my Finger locked alloy shorts finally short circuited and dropped right off, but unexpectedly.

Quick thinking, I grabbed a comb and pretended to style my hair. My skilled combing convinced him I was truly blind. My flawless acting made him believe it. Seeing I was blind, he went back to stealing my clothes. I guessed he must run a lingerie shop. Then my damn phone rang. It was my husband calling. The thief snatched my phone, hung up immediately, then left me stunned with his next move. He told my husband I was traveling and already asleep. This guy was cunning. Just as I despaired, the doorknob turned. Overjoyed, I thought my husband was back. But to my shock, a woman was with him. I was so angry, I nearly exploded and regained my vision on the spot.

He thought he was about to succeed, but as soon as the man puckered his lips, he was almost knocked out by her breath. The smell was simply unbearable.

Thinking happily he was waiting for me, I climbed right in. My boyfriend broke into a cold sweat, but didn't dare refuse until he suddenly spotted lipstick on a wine glass and nervously used his boat to signal the woman inside, urging her to wipe it off quickly. The woman swiftly cleaned the glass and put it back, but accidentally knocked over another glass nearby. Startled, she hid underwater again while my boyfriend cleverly blew out the candles. I started to feel something was off. With the room now pitch black, the woman seized the chance to climb out of the tub. The sound was masked by my boyfriend's sudden coughing. I switched the light back on, thinking I might find something if I stood up. I didn't notice she had hidden inside the laundry hamper. Then my boyfriend pulled me back into the bath abruptly. That's how the woman managed to flip out of our bathroom and dash all the way into my bedroom, ready to grab her things and leave. But her phone rang and woke me. Hearing the noise, I walked toward the bedroom and was shocked to find wet footprints on the floor. Furious, I started searching everywhere, but found nothing. She was already hiding on the chandelier. Just as she thought she was safe, water from her hair dripped right onto my head. I looked up a Towel fell, but the light fixture seemed empty. Following the footprints, I realised the sly woman had climbed out the window. I rushed over, but saw nothing outside. She was truly cunning. Angry, I slammed the window shut, not knowing she was now clinging to the outside of it, wondering how to escape from the third floor. Back in the bedroom, I noticed a red high heel on the floor. So he really was cheating behind my back. Pretending not to know, I decided to teach him a lesson. In the dark bathroom, I lit the candles again and while pretending to give him a massage.

Then I pasted on my name, took out a model airplane I'd soaked in water beforehand, peeled off the airline logo and stuck it on the check. Finally, I pressed it flat in a book. Just like that, I forged a crude but functional airline paycheck. I took it to the bank to cash it. For most people, successfully cashing this check would be quite difficult. But for me, it was as easy as breathing. Cause not only did I have a handsome face, I knew exactly what kind of person was easiest to fool. After some careful observation, I zeroed in on a pretty female teller who looked like she'd be a total sucker for charm. Welcome, Miami Mutual Bank. How may I help you? My name is Frank Taylor. I'm a co pilot for Pan Am. I'd like to cash this check here and then I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner. Just like that, I successfully cashed the check. After that first success, there was no stopping. I started buying model planes in bulk, mass producing fake checks, then heading to the airport to cash them. I specifically targeted attractive rookie employees. For long, I'd infiltrated the bank's inner circle and Learned from these women that banks had machines to verify check authenticity. So I bit on and won a decommission verification machine at a high price. Brought It home and studied it carefully. Then I created fake checks that even the machine couldn't detect. Posing as a pilot, I started flying for free and illegally cashing checks all across the country. As the amounts grew larger, the FBI finally caught wind of what I was doing. Agent Carl tracked me down to my hotel using the address on a fake check. He burst into the room with his gun drawn. Being the tools of my trade on the table, Carl knew he had me this time. Just then, the sound of a toilet flushing came from the bathroom. I calmly walked out, not the least bit rattled. I smoothly pretended to be with the intelligence agency claiming I was also after the same criminal. Relax, you're late. Alright? My name is Alan Barry on United States Secret Service. Your boy just tried to jump out the window. My partner hasn't been tested. I don't know what you're talking about. Carl didn't buy it at first, but seeing how composed I was and watching me hand over my entire wallet for inspection, he started to have doubts. Just as Carl was about to open the wallet, I stopped him and pulled him over to look out the window. Look out the window. A partner's walking into the car as we speak. Look, old man was pissing his pants. When I came through the door, he jumped right to the window under the hood of my car. Hey, Murph. Yeah. Call the LAPD again. I don't want people walking through my crime scene. I didn't expect a Secret Service. Don't worry about it. What's your name? Just like that, Carl believed me. To demonstrate my professionalism, I turned the tables and asked to see Carl's credentials. He handed them over. Oh, tough luck, Carl. 5 minutes earlier, you would have landed yourself a pretty good caller. It's all right. While talking, I gathered up the printer and checks and asked Carl to watch the scene for me. Then I just walked out of the room. I didn't even take my wallet. At this point, Carl thought to himself that after all this time chasing me, he'd finally caught this master conman. He finally relaxed, sat down on the bed and even started laughing. But as he laughed, he felt something wasn't quite right. So he opened the wallet to check. What he saw left him stunned. Inside were nothing but ads for various products, salads, desserts and the like. He realized he'd been played, but it was too late. I was long gone. And that's how the first round of cat and mouse ended with my complete victory. After this incident, I got cocky. I dressed myself up like James Bond, drove around in a fancy car and picked up down on their luck models at hotels. On Christmas Eve, I called Carl to taunt him, claiming I was in room 31, 13 at a hotel and daring him to Come catch me. Carl had been fooled once already, so naturally he didn't believe me. But he seemed to see right through my psychology. 对对对最底下最下方 上面是三角你have no one else to call这个i don't stop it往下面点 你现在点的是三角Carl had hit a nerve because after I'd gotten money I'd gone back home once I thought my parents'divorce was just about money because after I'd gotten back together wanting to return to that perfect life find the one but reality had changed beyond recognition mom had remarried and dad had become someone barred from spending due to unpaid debts in the end I discovered that money still couldn't solve my problems Christmas which should have been a family reunion I had to spend alone combined with Carl's taunts I stormed out in anger and the room number happened to be 3,113 obviously I calculated that the agent wouldn't come on Carl's end he started investigating the name Barry Allen and after much searching Learned it was a Flash's man Carl suddenly realized the con artist he was chasing was likely just a kid who loved comic books following this lead investigated all the runaway teenagers in New York and eventually narrowed it down to me but Carl never could have imagined that this genius scammer was only 17 years old the agent told my mother I was suspected of forging checks my protective mother immediately decided to pay back all the money for Me. But she underestimated my capabilities. Just tell me how much it was about paying back. So far, it's about $1.3 million. I realized my whereabouts had likely been exposed. So by forging a Harvard degree, I successfully landed a job as an attending physician and hooked up with a nurse. When I Learned my girlfriend's father was a well known local attorney, I proposed marriage and successfully married into the family. By imitating lawyers in movies and leveraging my incredible memory, I passed the bar exam in just two weeks and became a lawyer. Christmas Eve came around again and as usual, I called Carl. This time I hoped he'd let me go since I was about to get married. But Carl used this as a breakthrough and quickly tracked down my location. On my wedding day, Carl showed up uninvited to avoid tipping me off, Carl 1st found my girlfriend's father to ask questions, planning to find out where I was before making the arrest. But I spotted him anyway. I quickly pulled my girlfriend into a room and frantically, incoherently told her everything. As I talked, I pulled out a suitcase full of money and before my girlfriend could even figure out what was going on, I pulled out another suitcase. I knew I couldn't take my girlfriend with me and didn't have time to explain, so I grabbed the money and left alone through the window. But before leaving, I made plans with my girlfriend to meet At the airport in two days and run away together. Soon, two days had passed. I arrived at the airport. After some time, my girlfriend showed up as promised. But just as I was about to go meet her, I noticed she seemed nervous and strangers were approaching her. What was going on? My girlfriend sold me out. I quickly got back in my car and started carefully observing my surroundings. Sure enough, I spotted numerous disguised police officers. If I showed my face, I'd be arrested. Leaving seemed impossible. Impossible for others, maybe, but not for me. Once again, posing as a pilot, I went to an all girls school and said I was recruiting eight flight attendants for the company. In that era, being a flight attendant was just as coveted as being a pilot. So when they heard the news, everyone got excited and eagerly participated in interviews. After some selection, I successfully chose 8 female students to play flight attendants. They all had angelic faces and perfect figures. Since I couldn't keep a low profile, I'd go completely high profile. I brought these eight girls and walked brazenly into the airport. And the facts proved this tactic worked. When these eight youthful, beautiful, sexy girls walked into the airport, everyone's eyes, including the police officers, were instantly drawn to them. No one noticed, or rather no one thought the pilot walking behind them was their target. Me, new friend. As for Agent Carl, I used a Classic diversionary tactic to draw them away. Step out of the car. Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver. A man paid me $100 to wear this uniform. Picks up at the airport. Who you picking up? As I finished speaking, the driver pulled out a sign from the car with Carl's name written on it. He'd been played again, and by that time, I'd already successfully boarded the plane and taken off.

The other dogs endure it in silence. But the newcomer, buck, turns out to be a different story. Buck walks onto a nearby patch of ice, stumps hard and cracks open a fresh hole. The moment the dogs see water Welling up, they rush toward it instead of chasing them off. Generously shares the water with everyone watching this, the husky grows furious. Bucks kindness threatens its authority. As the lead dog of the sled team, the husky believes that as long as it runs fast enough, it will always enjoy the owner's favor. But an accident shatters that illusion. While the woman leads ahead to scout the path, the ice suddenly breaks, plunging her into the freezing lake. Her husband sprints toward her, but she sinks before he can reach her. At that critical moment, buck charges forward without hesitation, dives into the icy water and pushes her upward with all his strength. He Rams the ice repeatedly until he finally manages to lift her out. Exhausted, buck watches her escape danger and loses all strength and sinks into the darkness below. The man, frantic, kneels on the ice and screams Buck's name. Hearing movement beneath, he grabs his knife and hacks at the ice, only for the blade to snap. The surface is simply too thick. Despair takes over as he presses against the Ice, unwilling to lose the loyal buck. Just then, a wooden stick appears beside him. He grabs it and starts smashing again, but something feels off. He turns and realizes the stick was handed to him by buck himself, who managed to surface. Nearby, the husky watches its owner fuss over buck, jealousy simmering that night. The woman rewards buck with an extra chicken leg and thanks him sincerely. The husky notices again pitter his groan. It decides the time has come to settle things with buck. Later, while the dogs chase a snow hare, buck manages to catch it, only to release it unharmed. But the hair barely hops away before the husky lunges out and kills it in one bite. Issuing a direct challenge, the husky approaches buck. A pack can have only one leader. Buck, raised as a pampered city dog, has never fought before and is frightened. The husky attacks first, despite Buck's larger size. Then experience shows he's thrown to the ground again and again. Unable to rise, the husky mocks him triumphantly. Then the husky turns to intimidate the rest of the pack, hoping to reassert dominance. But the dogs have had enough.有个帕斯的报告一个 点在帕斯下面左侧看到吗 点在下面点在下面啊点在英文字母下面哎这个哎就这个位置啊 this time he wins the pack celebrates Buck's victory knowing it no longer has a place here the husky slinks away with its tail between its legs the next morning with the Team lacking a lead dog, buck naturally steps to the front, but the man thinks buck lacks experience, protests, but the man drags him to the back anyway and brings out an older season dog to lead. Yet the old dog, glancing at the unhappy buck, refuses to put on the harness. Not wanting to anger either the owner or buck, it simply collapses on the ground in stubborn refusal. Helpless, the man finally gives the position to buck. Because of the delay, the man expects they'll arrive late, but he's surprised to find the team now united under buck, running faster than ever. This place they'll reach town two days early. Excited, the man laughs loudly. Too loudly his voice triggers an avalanche. He orders buck to turn left, but buck, assessing the falling snow, knows it's already too late. Instead of obeying, he charges straight into the heart of the avalanche path. 哈哈哈 对他他是到那个好像是这个草莓症的 草莓正杂货店 他他不是春天哥春天哥是青头发对他是杂货店杂货店 里面够the team miraculously escapes danger in indeed reaches town two days ahead of schedule the one rather chaotic fashion最贵的衣服 did you see that on their way home buck notices townsfolk joyful meeting their mail he finally understands the purpose of a sled dog in his own colony in the days of the Follow Buck leads the team to deliver mail early every time probably at the front as people cheer him on But the good times don't last. With new technology rising, telegraphs replace letters and the slave team becomes obsolete. Meeting income takes another job and reluctantly sells buck to a gold prospector to save money. This prospector barely feeds the dogs and forces them to pull loads many times heavier than before, pushing them to utter exhaustion. One golden retriever collapses and slips down the slope. The buck digs in and holds steady, preventing a deadly chain reaction. The prospector, instead of understanding, accuses the dogs of slacking and beats them with his whip. Wanting to shield his companions, buck struggles forward with all he has left. When he finally drags the load to the top, he collapses. Seeing that buck can no longer work, the man immediately pulls out a gun and aims it at Buck's helpless body.

The next second, her coworker lost a huge chunk of hair. The woman got more excited. As she kept pulling, she ripped the doll completely bald. The next second, her coworker's head went completely bald, too. The woman remembered how her coworker had pulled her. Furious, she grabbed a pair of tweezers. She ripped off the doll's toenails. The next second, her coworker screamed out loud and she twisted off the doll's limbs. Just like that, her coworker lost her life. The woman's name was Mina. One day, her best friend gave her a mysterious box. Mina opened the first compartment. Inside was a piece of candy. The packaging showed the game's rules. If you eat the first one, you must eat one candy every day. You keep going until you open the last compartment. If you quit halfway through, you die. Nina thought it was just a silly joke for kids. She popped the first candy right into her mouth. What she didn't know was she had just officially awakened the demon. The next day, Nina met a new boyfriend. After Nina fell asleep, the man slipped his hand into her pants. Nina immediately pushed him away. The scumbag dragged her out of the car. Then he dumped her on the roadside. Furious, Mina cursed him to die. The very next second, the box at home seemed to hear her command. It automatically opened a compartment. Inside appeared a tiny car. Identical to the man's, even the license plate matched. Curious dog nearby bit down on her. At that moment, the man noticed cracks on his windshield as the dog kept chewing. The scumbag ended up dead inside his car. The next day, Mina Learned about the man's death from her friend's call. It hit Mina that the box had supernatural powers. That night she opened another compartment. Inside was a heart shaped candy to test her theory. The next day she dropped the candy into her crush's cup. After the man drank it, the next second he walked over to her. He passionately confessed his love to Mina. Just like that, they became a couple. After experiencing the box's magical power, Mina opened another compartment. This time it contained a time candy. She swallowed it with curiosity. The next second, she suddenly found four candy wrappers in her hand and she realized four days had already passed. The next day she went to work. She got fired by her boss for missing work. Heartbroken, Mina had just fallen asleep. At midnight, the box opened on its own. The demon summoned the little dog over. Inside was a bone shaped piece of candy. The dog swallowed it on the spot. Just then the door, the door swung open by itself. The dog ran outside. The next morning she opened the door and found the dog standing there, blood all over. As Nina washed the blood off the dog, she found a Pendant in its mouth. It belonged to her boss. She immediately called her boss, but the phone was off. Nina remembered the broken toy car pieces in the trash. She pieced together all the candy wrappers and the incidents. Once again, she was certain the box was behind every death. She started feeling afraid of the box. Suddenly, the box reminded her she hadn't eaten today's candy. The game does not stop seeing Mina's refusal to act. A dagger popped out of the final slot. Looking at the blood stained blade, Mina dropped it in terror. The next second, a demon appeared right in front of her. Facing the horrifying creature, trembling, she swallowed the candy. The next second, something even more terrifying happened.

I never thought his experiment would actually work this time. He impatiently pulled me aside, put on the brain computer interface himself and pointed to a fresh green apple on the table and told me to power it up. I couldn't believe how shameless he was. I've turned into this mess. Yeah, I still have to help him first. But luckily I came prepared. I took out another apple and connected it to the power. Amidst sparks and crackles, the old man rushed out eagerly wanting to see if he turned into a handsome young man. To his surprise, he really did look 50 years younger. But before he could celebrate, one of his teeth fell out. Then one by one, all his teeth loosen and dropped, covered his mouth in disbelief. The truth was the apple he'd used was also rotten. I'd just painted the outside to make it look fresh. Finally I had my revenge. He felt a sharp pain in his stomach, almost threw up, then rushed desperately toward the bathroom. I couldn't help but laugh joyfully. Once he was in the restroom, I took out the green apple he'd given me earlier and plugged it into the brain machine interface. Now it was finally my turn to use the machine and restore myself to the 18 year old girl I used to be. The feeling was incredible as For this research institute identity, anyone who wants it can have it. I'm off to enjoy my youth while it lasts.

I'm such a genius. But the moment I smiled, my teeth fell out again. Without gums to hold them in place, they were too loose. Thinking of gums reminded me of my toothless elderly neighbor. She had a set of dentures that could help me in a pinch. Even better, she was asleep right now. I climbed right through her window. But just as I was about to grab them, she caught me red handed. Terrified, I begged for mercy and confessed everything. How I'd lost all my teeth. Surprisingly, she didn't Just sympathize. She brought out her best denture collection and let me choose one. Meanwhile, my sister was busy flirting with my boyfriend. But luckily, his love for me was the real deal. What shocked her even more was when I walked out looking flawless, with a perfect smile and not a tooth missing. The moment my boyfriend saw me, he came over, offered me his arm, and we walked off together. My sister was so mad she nearly coughed up blood. When she wasn't looking, I secretly switched her grape juice with something else. Then I happily headed out on my date. My sister watched us leave fuming. She couldn't understand how my teeth were perfectly fine until she finished her drink and realized her teeth were gone, too.

I used all my strength to put on these skinny jeans. Because of my chubby figure, I couldn't let Jack find out about the thick fat on my thighs. But then my silly cat clawed a huge hole in my pants. Panicked, I quickly kissed Jack to distract him. Back in the room, I tiptoed toward the bedroom open to change my pants secretly. But Jack asked me to sit next to him. Reluctantly, I shuffled sideways onto the couch, only to have my thigh fat spill out from the torn seam. I handed Jack a drink, dash toward the bedroom while he took a step. But my annoying cat seemed to know my plan. It followed me and then pooped on Jack's popcorn without realizing. Jack grabbed a handful. Smell hit him so hard he almost threw up. He couldn't shake it off no matter what he did. Back in my room, I was frantic. That's when I spotted a stapler. I decided to staple the hole in my pants shut. After what felt like 100 staples, I finally fixed my pants. But my triumph lasted one second. The whole pants slit wide open. If my boyfriend saw this, he definitely break up with me. Just as I frouzy and panic, my boyfriend started banging on the door again. But I'm clever. I decided to wrap my legs in duct tape. Time was tight. I used all my strength and After finishing the whole roll, my legs were fully wrapped, but they fell rough and sharp. The texture was awful, so I grabbed a hair dryer and melted the tape smooth. My dumb cat stared in shock. While sleek and hard, now that dumb cat couldn't claw through it. My legs looked like glossy glass. Absolutely irresistible. Finally, I could open the door with confidence. Jack stood there with poop on his hands, huming and ready to complain. But the moment he saw my legs sleeker and longer than his, his anger completely vanished. He stared mesmerized. My ego was thoroughly satisfied. I decided to strut around the living room and let him admire the view. But then I tripped.

But instead of exposing us, the magician saw a business opportunity. He brought me on stage to perform magic tricks, then covered me with his magic cloth. When he pulled it away, the audience saw me hovering in the air. The whole crowd went wild, but I didn't dare move an inch because I knew Jack was struggling to hold me up underneath. The magician made a fortune from that act. Next, he used a magic wand to make me levitate, then moved it up and down to control my motion. In reality, it was Stew Jack lifting me with his hands. Then the magician climbed a ladder, took out some empty plates and tossed them into the air, claiming I could stop them using telekinesis. Once again, it was Jack secretly catching each one. With these telekinetic tricks, the magician earned $5 million, but Jack secretly told me he wanted to leave. Problem was, our hands were stuck together. If he went, I had to go to. As he tried to pull me backstage, he bumped into a table corner and yanked us both into a large box. The magician saw it and was thrilled. Another chance for a trick. He slit the box in half. When I crawled out, I almost peed my pants. My lower body had been replaced by Jack's transparent legs, the Magician kept performing. Now the other half of the box showed my legs attached to Jack's invisible upper body. Jack was just as stunned. The audience thought my legs had been separated from my torso. Seizing the moment, Jack snatched the magician's cloth and covered us both. The next second, we were.

Without my light, he can't see to study, and so my body melts faster and faster. After my husband happily finishes eating, finds there's no hot water left. That's also my job. I lift a kettle and pour all my energy into boiling water for him, even if it means melting more quickly. But our son complains he can't see his homework clearly, and my husband insists on having his hot water right away. They argue, neither giving in while I slowly melt away between their demands. Just as they're about to come to blows, they finally notice I've almost melted completely. What hurts most is this, they don't even care about me. They just want me to keep serving them. In rage, I knocked the kettle away, deciding I won't take care of either of them anymore. I lie comfortably on the sofa, extinguish the flame above my head, the one that was spraying my life away. Then something changes. My husband gently applies a face mask to soothe me and my heart softens. He brings me a cool drink and slowly I start feeling better. Our son comes with cookies and made himself. The first time he's ever shown such care, warmed by this love.

Just like that, Jenny easily broke the world record. Then it was her opponent's turn to compete. This time I stood right in front of her to block the way. With my interference, she ended up with a terrible score. The next event was the discus throw, which happened to be her opponent's special. She could casually throw it more than 10 meters away. The discus even hit my head by accident. Luckily I had superpowers to heal myself. But the next second she threw a javelin, and the javelin seemed to have a tracking system locked right onto me. Next was the running race. I came up behind the opponent and slapped her on the butt, causing her to miss the start signal, but she was way too fast. She quickly caught up again, so I went to the finish line to wait for her and stuck out my foot to trip her, but she still managed to take first place. The next event was pole vault, another event her opponent was great at. Just as she jumped, I snapped her pole in half. When Jenny's turn came, I grabbed the pole to help her, and she easily cleared the bar during the high jump. Soon as the opponent jumped over, I knocked the bar down, leaving her completely confused. When Jenny jumped, I gave her a Push from below, and she successfully took first place. The final event was the relay race, but the blue team's members were much stronger than ours. Sure enough, as soon as the race started, my teammates fell far behind, so I secretly took a soda bottle and a hot dog. Then I also grabbed a flower. That's when the blue team realized their baton had been replaced with a soda bottle, and the rest of their batons were replaced with hot dogs and flowers, so they had to run back to get their real batons. But the blue team's captain was incredibly fast. She quickly caught up, so I had to stop her by force before she reached the finish line. Watching her run in place right before the line, everyone around was completely puzzled. In the end, Jenny crossed the finish line first and finally won the first trophy of her life.

I noticed that the toppings had been eaten by someone from the upper level. So I thought about taking someone else's food. However, as soon as I picked up a piece of chicken wing, Tony from the upper level stopped me, told me I could only eat my own food. This was the rule of the loyalists because if someone steals food, it means the people below will go hungry. I explained that my pizza had been eaten by someone else. Tony said they would solve the problem for me, and he told me not to break the rules. If I insisted on stealing someone else's food, I would be punished by the loyalists. I didn't want to hear their explanation. I just wanted to compensate myself immediately. But then my cellmate Jenny stopped me. She gave me her croquette to eat, so I finally put the chicken wing back. The next day, we heard fighting from upstairs. Four members from the 19th and 20th floors came down to the 21st floor to punish the one who stole my pizza. But the four of them couldn't even beat the opponent. This meant the thief had strong combat abilities. Tony from upstairs told me that if they couldn't beat that person, Jenny and I would need to prepare for a fight. Hearing this, I immediately gave up and lied, saying I never fought. But as soon as I finished speaking, the platform arrived. Upstairs, Tony and Laura immediately started fighting. Seeing this, Jenny quickly lifted the mattress, then took out an iron bar from the bed frame to prepare for the enemy. When the platform came down, I was stunned. I saw a corpse quietly lying on it. This should be the punishment for someone from the 21st floor who broke the rules. I couldn't help but feel scared, because if I had eaten the chicken wing yesterday, I would have received the same punishment today. Before I could react, I saw Laura from upstairs frantically kicking the food down. But she was still one step too late, because she had secretly kept food. This caused the temperature on her floor to rise sharply and she was burned alive and dropped down. Jenny tried to use a bed sheet to extinguish the fire, but it was too late. In an instant, Laura was burned to a charred corpse. By the time I reacted, platform started moving down to the next floor. Tony told us to quickly clear the food, and the room returned to its normal temperature. Because of the thief's disregard for the rules, today's food could not be eaten in the fight, so the people below had no food to eat. From the third day on, I began to follow the rules. I only ate my own pizza every day. To enforce the rules strictly, Tony threw away all the food from the people who died yesterday. But on this day, After eating pizza for more than 20 days straight, I suddenly had an idea. I pretended to throw away the food and secretly grabbed a piece of food and stuffed it in my mouth. But this scene was noticed by the people above. However, they didn't expose me. Soon, it was time to change floors. Good news came from downstairs that food could be delivered intact to the one hundred and seventy fifth floor. Jenny and I happily started dancing, but when we woke up the next day, we found we had been assigned to the one hundred and eightieth floor, the floor where food had never reached.

Before they could understand anything, the man turned and started walking toward them. They panicked and ran straight to their car, escaping at full speed. That night when the girl reached home, someone knocked on the door. The next second, the door was smashed open and the same man stormed inside. He stared at her and slowly opened his massive mouth again. The girl quickly grabbed a broom and shoved it into his mouth, but it had no effect on him at all. She realized the situation was extremely dangerous. She ran for her life and reached her father's house. But after some time, the man followed her there, too. The father stepped outside ready to protect his daughter, but instead of attacking, the man suddenly dropped to his knees and said, don't be afraid, come inside my mouth. Shocked, the girl asked, will I be safe if I go inside? The man nodded calmly. Trusting her instincts, the girl stepped straight into his mouth. The father had no other choice and followed her inside. Both of and were stunned. There was no stomach, no organs, just a huge empty space. The man finally explained, I am not human. I am an angel sent to capture demons that hide among humans. The girl I swallowed earlier was not a human. She was a demon.

The woman paid off all my debts just so I'd help her with one favor. Today she's going on vacation and needs me to take care of her husband while she's away. I thought it would just be babysitting for a few months. But when I saw her husband, I almost threw up. I never imagined someone could be this filthy. The moment he saw me, he said, it's been 10 minutes since I last ate. I'm starving to death. Then he dug out a booger and ate it, proof he was truly famished. Next, he pulled a hamburger from his underwear and asked me to feed him. The stench was so strong, I could barely keep my eyes open. By then, I already regretted taking this job. I turned to leave, but he grabbed me, begging me not to go or he'd starve. Helpless, I agreed to stay on one condition. He had to take a bath first. Charlie agreed, but his enormous body could barely move, let alone get up to wash. Luckily, I used to work at a car wash. Using all my strength, I pushed him to the bathroom. I just treat him like a car to wash. When I lifted his arm, the smell Hit me like a truck. This was absolute torture. Just how long had it been since his last bath? Charlie stayed silent. He pulled out a hundred dollar Bill from between his fat folds and handed it to me. I crumpled it up and threw it away. He looked shocked. You always demand the payment before when I asked you to do anything. I brushed him off, saying, I pick it up later. Let's just focus on washing first. I put on rubber gloves, first cutting off a huge clump of his thick armpit hair. The remaining smaller bits I lathered with soap and shaved off. Strangely satisfying process. Of course, I couldn't ignore the sebaceous cysts either. After removing them, the stench immediately disappeared. Next, I soaped up his entire body and gave him a thorough cleaning. Then came the facial hair. Even his nose hairs weren't spared. There wasn't much to trim on his head, though, so little hair left. Is this what they mean by rich men's brains don't grow hair? I never expected him to look so handsome after washing up. Turns out fat people really have beauty potential. Even he looked in the mirror and called me a magician. It's a shame he's too fat to go on walks with me. Charlie used to be very handsome. Then, after a car accident, his wife deliberately fattened him into this monstrosity. This was the first time I felt sorry for him. So I made up my Mind to help him lose weight. At first he could barely move 10 cm

He was furious. He immediately yanked off my prosthetic leg. I was still deep asleep and had no idea what was happening. Angrily, my husband threw the fake leg into the fireplace and watched it burn. As the flames roared, he rubbed his hands with satisfaction, clearly plotting something. When I woke up, not only was my husband gone, my prosthetic leg was missing, too. How was I supposed to get out of bed to look for him? Luckily, we still had the old wheelchair I used before. But with only one leg, even standing was a struggle, let alone walking. I lost my balance and fell straight to the floor. The wheelchair was right in front of me, but no matter how hard I stretched, I couldn't reach it. Fumen, I dragged myself toward the wheelchair. Little did I know, my husband was at that moment eyeing my jewelry collection. He picked up the largest diamond, bit it, and it shattered. Instantly. Frustrated and angry, he gathered all my jewels into a bag and took off with them. Meanwhile, I'd finally managed to get into the wheelchair, only to be stopped by the staircase ahead. Facing those tall steps, I felt completely helpless. Then my husband tossed all my jewelry into a high temperature crucible, melted it down into liquid, then pulled out a bundle of wires from the car. With paper and pen. In hand, he began sketching a design no one could have imagined. Though my husband may not look like a good guy, he's surprisingly skilled at technical drawings. Just then, I finally found him. As I angrily demanded why he'd taken my prosthetic, he breathed a sigh of relief and presented me with what he'd worked on all night. It turned out he'd stayed up to make me a beautiful, sturdy metal legs, so I never have to worry about a wooden prosthetic failing again. Tears of emotion filled my eyes as I looked at the elegant limb. I thanked him deeply for such a meaningful anniversary gift. With it on, I was finally able to dance with my husband again. Once or twice was enough.

Within moments, the ice began breaking fast.

He said they were here for him, but he was framed. The police accused my husband of stealing and jewels worth billions. I quickly denied it, saying our home was poor, cramped and tiny. They could search if they didn't believe me. The officers immediately took out a metal detector and began scanning my husband's body. My husband insisted he was innocent. The officer said to wait until the scan was finished. My husband grew very nervous. When the alarm sounded, I showed them my tongue piercing, but then it went off again over my stomach. My husband quickly showed an old X ray of me, claiming I had titanium implants from a car accident. The police believed his story. After they left, I confronted my husband. I never been in a car accident and had no implants. Just then, a sharp pain hit my stomach. I thought I had an upset stomach and said I needed the bathroom, but he stopped me, warning me not to be careless. I knew a famous doctor who could check me properly. He then made a video call. The doctor said she thought I was pregnant. I was overjoyed. We'd wanted a child for so long. We'd been married for years, but couldn't conceive. I'd even kept baby clothes ready for years. Finally, they could be used. My husband asked when I could be examined. She told him to bring me quickly and not let me use the toilet before that. Just then, my stomach hurt again. My husband gave me water to drink, claiming the doctor said it would help bloating. Unsuspecting, I drank it and passed out. I was taken to an operating table. The doctor and my husband clearly had a shady relationship. He was already picking out luxury cars. He urged her to cut my belly open. But as she made the first cut, it popped like a balloon. They were stunned. The person on the table was an inflatable dummy. Only then did they realize they'd been tricked. I later Learned it. The woman was my husband's mistress. When she claimed I was pregnant without an exam, I grew suspicious. I went to a real hospital, where doctors found the jewel inside me. I contacted the police and returned the jewels to their true owner. The wealthy owner gratefully gave me $10 million. I donated all of it to charity. Wealth that can be lost is not true wealth. Never cling to what isn't rightfully yours.

Flipping through the pages, the ghost's eyes light up when she sees a trendy short hairstyle and she eagerly points to the picture. The stylist gets to work, but this is no ordinary hair.

It struck him as odd, but he thought maybe the wind had caused it. However, a few days later, he noticed the soil was sinking deeper. At this point, he started to suspect there might be a large rat burrowing beneath the ground. So he brought a whole bag of rat poison and spread it around. But it didn't work. Instead, the hole grew even bigger. Next, he bought a small detector, dug the hole himself, set a trap and placed peanut butter as bait. He even stuck a small flag on top so he'd know when the trap was triggered. But as he worked, he didn't notice his wife acting unusually nervous. The following day, when he came home early from the office, his wife rushed out to meet him, saying, please bring some barbecue food. I'm hungry. He found it a bit odd, but as soon as she went inside, the trap's flag started shaking. Excited, he ran to check, thinking he'd caught something. But when he looked, the trap was empty. And in that moment, he knew something was wrong. He quickly checked the CCTV footage and turned his gaze toward his neighbor, Mister Sharma's house. On the third day, he lied to his wife, saying he was going on a business trip for a week. As soon as she heard that, her face lit up. But the moment She opened the door. There was a loud explosion from inside the house. She screamed and ran out, hearing strange noises coming from within. Within minutes, the fire department arrived. When they saw her, there were small blood stains on her face. The firefighter asked, are you hurt? She replied, no, not me.

He measured her face carefully with a ruler, pointing out that her ears differed by two millimeters, her nose wasn't sharp enough, and her chin was a little too short. On her 18th birthday, he decided to gift her a plastic surgery, procedure Anna had no right to refuse because her father wasn't just obsessed with perfection, he was also a control freak. Years ago, her mother gave birth to twins, but one of them was deformed. Her perfectionist father couldn't accept it, so he heartlessly abandoned the baby in the snow. Anna, who was born healthy, survived by sheer luck. But growing up under her father's constant criticism, she became extremely insecure. Despite her beautiful face, she couldn't even walk with her head held high, terrified others would see her imperfections. One day, Anna stood in front of the mirror and noticed an ultrasound photo hidden in a crack. Only then did she realize she had a twin sister she had never met. She didn't think much of it at first, but the next day, while doing her makeup, her reflection in the mirror quietly looked up at her. Anna didn't notice anything unusual and went to school as usual. But when she returned home, she kept hearing a strange voice calling her. Unsure if it was just her imagination, she.

Scientists attempted to sever its limbs, hoping to immobilize the creature, but it remained brutally dangerous. After extensive trials, they concluded the most reliable kill method was to strike directly at its central nervous system. Once we identified that weakness, the general issued combat orders on the spot. According to the operation plan, we deployed several bombers to drop incendiary munitions on the swarm's core zone. Under the intense bombardment, bugs scattered in all directions. By the time our ground units arrived, only charred remains were left behind. As the squad marched across the scorched terrain, the captain instantly recognized that we'd scored a decisive victory. But to eradicate the species entirely, we still had to track down their nest and destroy it. During the search, bugs occasionally burst out of nowhere, but our superior numbers handled them with ease. We had just taken down one bug when, to our shock, several more poured out of a cave right ahead. Not good, Rico. I heard the order and didn't hesitate. I grabbed the launcher and carried out the command. Before anyone could react, a massive explosion ripped through the air. We had barely cleared one nest when a distress signal came in.

Melinda's lover actually walked right up to Vic just to rub salt in the wound, mocking him, thanking him for sharing, even praising his wife as incredible. Vic was burning with rage, but he held himself together because losing control meant losing his marriage. So Vic calmly told him a story. A few days ago, a man named Martin vanished from town. He was once one of Melinda's so called friends. The truth is, I killed him. Vic watched panic flash across the man's eyes. Without another word, the guy bolted. Out of the party. And even when Melinda tried stopping him, he refused to stay.

In her panic, she accidentally deleted it, worried that if he found out, he would get incredibly upset with her. So the next morning, she nervously confessed to him, telling him she had snooped through his phone the night before and begged him to forgive her. He didn't show much reaction on his face, but deep down his mind was in complete chaos and his thoughts were racing. Once she fell into a deep sleep, quickly grabbed his phone, immediately changing the password as if to take control of the situation. Even while at work, his thoughts were consumed by that message he found on his phone. Meanwhile, his wife was in the kitchen preparing a lovely home cooked lunch for him, passing it to him with a bright smile and full of enthusiasm. But once he left, he began to vent his frustration about her to his colleague. His words revealing a deepening emotional distance from his wife. The worst part was that without a second thought, he tossed the whole situation into the trash as if it didn't even matter to him. And that moment, that scene was witnessed by his wife who had come to find him standing by the trash can. And immediately her eyes began to well up with tears. She could never have imagined that the meals she Carefully prepared for him day after day with so much love and effort, would be treated with such blatant disregard and disrespect. When he saw her standing there shaking and hurt, not only did he not apologize, but he coldly told her that her actions made him feel suffocated and trapped. She held the lunch box tightly in her hands. Tears began to stream down her face uncontrollably. Later that night, she got herself ready with hair, hoping to have a beautiful romantic evening with him. But when she looked at him, he was already sound asleep on the couch, completely unaware or uncaring about her feelings. In silence, she gently covered him with a blanket and then with a heavy heart or their bedroom. As soon as she left the room, he opened his eyes. And in that moment, his lack of response made it clear her sincere gestures hadn't touched him at all. It was raining heavily outside, and although he was sitting in his car, felt no urge to return home, as if the house was a place he no longer wanted to be. Even when she told him she was pregnant, there was not a trace of joy in his reaction, not even a flicker of happiness. His wife still held out that perhaps he was just a man of few words until the day she decided to surprise him by visiting his office, only to discover that things were.

It belonged to her father, who was now wanted by the authorities. So while the officer monitoring her happened to look down, she gulped the entire yogurt in one breath. No one could have predicted what happened next. After Kelly drove away, the surveillance officer reported the incident to his superiors. Things grew even stranger when the arriving inspector found the yogurt box Kelly had thrown into the trash. Without hesitation, he stuck out his middle finger and used it to scoop out the remaining yogurt, tasting it directly. That seemingly insignificant action would cost the inspector dearly. Meanwhile, shortly after drinking the yogurt, Kelly felt a sudden wave of nausea. Clutching her stomach, she rushed into the women's restroom, and that's when he appeared. It was Kelly's father, but he didn't embrace his long lost daughter. Instead, he immediately located the listening device the police had secretly planted on her and blocked its signal.

That night, I wet the bed again. My husband ended up with it all over his hands. Enraged, he grabbed a sledgehammer and smashed the bed. Right then. Then, right before our stunned eyes, we were thrown out of the house. It was freezing outside, with heavy snow falling like goose feathers. My baby and I were shivering all over. We had nowhere to go. I wrapped my only actual layer around my baby, thinking we might freeze to death. Tears of despair streamed down my face. I carried my baby through the icy streets. My feet were nearly frozen stiff. My hair and even my snot were frozen solid. Just as I was about to collapse, my baby noticed a rundown cabin ahead. We desperately needed shelter. It was old and broken, but at least it could block the wind and snow. My feet were completely numb. Mustering the last of my strength, I lay my baby down.

They both intend to push the limits of humanity. At the time today, an altitude of 7,000 meters is nothing remarkable. But in 1862, humans had not yet mastered the art of flight. The hot air balloon continued to ascend. The woman began to remove her clothing and change into a thick coat. As they drifted into the clouds, the air currents suddenly became turbulent. They had entered a cluster of cumulonimbus clouds. The balloon shook violently in the storm. The man fell, cracking his head open. A hot air balloon was like a small boat on a raging sea. A fierce gust of wind struck, throwing the woman out of the basket. She barely managed to grab onto a rope. The man pulled her back with all his strength, trying to escape the storm. They had no choice but to continue climbing higher. They began discarding sandbags to lighten the load. The rate of ascent suddenly accelerated. Everything fell into silence. They were now above the sea of clouds. High up, sky was crystal clear and sunlight poured down. The two hurriedly secured the cabin, which had been thrown into disarray by the storm. Just then, the man caught sight of a strange spectacle, a Swarm of golden butterflies circling around the balloon. Who could have imagined encountering butterflies at an altitude of 5,000 meters? They did not know that the real danger had yet to arrive. Finally, they reached 7,000 meters. No one in history had ever been to such a height after.

After days without a sip of freshwater, he could finally drink to his heart's content. He swam with unrestrained joy, savoring every precious drop of this hard one water. Nearby, the tiger could also indulge in the bounty, Pi's only companion since the shipwreck, everything felt like a gift sent from the heavens. To show his gratitude, pie tied the safety rope his girlfriend had given him to a sturdy route. Soon, he fashioned a simple bed among the branches. As twilight fell, something strange unfolded. Countless mangos darted back into the jungle, scrambling up towering trees in panic. Even the tiger seems spooked, rushing back to the boat in a flurry. The island fell into an eerie silence. As night descended, Pi awoke to a mysterious glow cascading down from above. Curious, he peered over the edge and was stunned to see the pool floating in midair.

She wrapped warm rice in the seaweed, dipped it in soy sauce and handed it carefully to her little brother. The house was a complete mess. It overflowed with their bright, innocent laughter. Everything shifted the day their father walked in with a breathtakingly beautiful stepmother. At first, the siblings believed that real happiness was finally approaching them, that someone would truly take care of their young lives. The once cluttered home became spotless and shining under her hands, and the stepmother tended to them with almost delicate precision, even blow drying the girl's damp hair with gentle patience. That evening, the family sat together for dinner pretending peace. The boy, clumsy as ever, spilled food across nearly the whole table. Her voice was soft at first, almost rehearsed, but the once vanished suddenly and completely, leaving only a cold, resentful glare fixed on the children. Mom said, you can't even hold chopsticks, sis. That woman has fully awakened. That woman woke up. She truly woke up as just the night before the girl had taken a life with her own trembling hands. When she woke up, she realized she looked strangely, almost unnaturally beautiful. Only when she spotted the dried blood smeared in the bathroom did the memories of that terrifying night flood back. Panic, she shoved her bloodstained clothes into the washing machine, desperate to erase every trace.

When he opened the window, he noticed only the areas he had sprayed were raining. The rest of the city remained bathed in sunlight. That's when Jack realized the model was connected to the real world. He decided to use it for good. The next morning, residents were astonished to find their homes looking brand new. Seeing everyone smile, Jack felt a sense of satisfaction. He even tackled complaints piled up in the suggestion box. He, he filled a pothole on the model street and the real road was repaired instantly. He picked up litter with tweezers and the actual trash disappeared as well. He spent the entire night solving everyone's problems. By the next day, the entire city was overjoyed. But he never expected what came next. Everyone assumed the mayor had done it all and began supporting him for reelection. Even worse, the shameless mayor claimed every bit of credit. Jack felt a surge of anger. He picked up a stone, determined it was time to teach the mayor a lesson.

It meant the killer could unlock the stall at any moment. He jumped off the toilet, crawled into the next stall, but accidentally triggered a sensor with a faint beep. Panicking, he scrambled back onto the toilet. And right as the killer stood up, the toilet suddenly flushed with a loud burst. Fortunately, the killer thought the corpse had hit the button, snorted and Walked away. After a long, suffocating moment, sane, finally rushed out of the bathroom.

On the third operation, only the father remained. After surgery, Marlo lost his last leg. He was now completely paralyzed. Yet the father chose to continue. Marlo's kidney and one lung were removed. He survived only through feeding tubes. He was even forced to watch recordings of his own operations. By now, Marlow had grown silent. He had become humble. But the family was still not ready to forgive. On the fifth Operation, Marlow's genitals were removed. This time, he did not cry, not a single tear. The sixth surgery.

A sudden sensation of falling jolted her awake, but she was sliding too fast to react and tumbled off the edge of the balloon. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself dangling upside down at 30,000 feet. She remembered her companion in the basket, cried out for help, but James had already fallen unconscious from oxygen deprivation. With no other option, Mia began swinging her body, using the momentum to finally reach the edge of the basket. Summoning every ounce of strength, she hauled herself back into the balloon. As they descended to lower altitudes, James woke up, but then Mia noticed something alarming. The snowflakes were falling upward. She immediately realized the balloon was dropping too fast and at this rate, they were as good as dead. She quickly pulled the rope to close the valve But she yanked too hard and the valve flew wide open. Instead, they were falling even faster. There was no time to think. Survival instinct kicked in. They frantically threw everything overboard, trying to slow their descent. Even after emptying the basket complete, they were still plummeting at breakneck speed. James realized the basket itself was the heaviest part. He told Mia to hold on tight to the rope, then pulled out a knife and started cutting through the baskets rigging. As they got closer and closer to the ground, James finally severed the last rope and the balloon quickly separated from the basket, which fell away. But even then, their descent barely slowed. That's when Mia remembered she had been through something like this before. Back then, her companion had jumped from 30,000 feet, giving her a chance at survival. So Mia decided to sacrifice herself so James could survive, the weather data in her hands. Just as she was about to jump, James suddenly thought of one last desperate move. He told Mia to hold on tight to the rope, then began cutting the inner ring ropes of the balloon one by one. In an instant, the balloon attracted like a jellyfish, transforming into a massive parachute and their descent slowed dramatically. The two embraced, thrilled to be alive as they plunged toward the forest below. They landed safely. Years later, the whole world knew their story. James shared the monitoring data from the balloon, which made a Major contribution to future weather forecasting. Before long, they bought a new hot air balloon. And although the journey had been brutal, they never stopped pushing forward.

As her friend poured out her problems, Lucy quickly turned to a computer, diving into all the theoretical knowledge related to brain development. When she finally finished learning the theories, she used telekinesis to contact Professor Norman, a world renowned brain scientist. The professor was in disbelief that she had gone through over 6,000 of his research papers in just a few minutes. Lucy offered to recite them to him on the spot and asked him to meet her immediately. The professor was stunned. Lucy projected herself onto the TV screen, informing the professor that she had absorbed a large amount of synthetic CPH4 and her brain utilization rate had reached 28%. This proved the professor's theory, once the brain reaches 20% utilization, it breaks through all limits like a chain reaction. Lucy explained that she no longer felt pain, fear, desire or any other emotions. Her humanity was slowly fading away. She felt lost and sought the professor's guidance. The professor told her that the ultimate purpose of life is to pass on the knowledge one has acquired. There is no higher goal. Therefore, she should, like any simple cell, share her knowledge. In that moment, the professor enlightened Lucy completely. She realised she had not only to pass on her knowledge to humanity, but also to figure out how to break the chains of time. She told the professor she would Meet him in 12 hours. She rushed to the airport using telekinesis to make a call, contacting the local police chief in Paris. Lucy ordered the chief to sit down and write down every word she said. She informed him that three criminals carrying large quantities of drugs would soon pass through the airport to Paris. She ordered the police to arrest the criminals and wait for her to arrive. The police chief was completely incredulous, but when he followed Lucy's instructions to pull up the criminal's information, he found them at the airport, just as she had said.

Then the lead specialist instructed her to hold her breath as long as she could and yanked away the only oxygen tube. Within seconds, the entire chamber ignited. Flames roared across the walls. As the heat skyrocketed, she felt her body burning and angry blisters crawled across her skin. But that was only the opening act. As minutes passed and the honey hardened around her, her movement slowed and she nearly blacked out.

Once the flames were gone, fresh air flooded back in, turning the chamber into a perfectly sterile zone. They had no choice. Her immune system was collapsing and she could only exist inside total sterility. Then the specialist urged her to climb out.

He scans the place and makes a chilling call. Someone inside the Krusty Krab has a super contagious flu. Boom! Lockdown! Everyone freaks out. Squidward scrubs himself with a brush, Mister Krabs hides in his office, and plankton crawls out of a soda bottle, only to get blasted into ashes by a robot. To find the infected, Mister Krabs checks everyone, but Squidward panics, knocks over pepper, and SpongeBob sneezes, scaring the life out of everybody. He's the sick one! He belongs in the freezer. Get it? Yeah, I'll go willingly. I feel fine, but I don't want to risk infecting my friends. Feeling guilty, SpongeBob locks himself in the freezer. All I ask is that you remember me as I was, full of life. No, it sounds like he's really suffering in there. From outside, it sounds painful, but inside, he's skiing and stuffing his face with ice cream. Patrick sees this and fakes being sick just to join in, sparking an ice cream war. With fewer and fewer people left, Squidward scratched an itch and was immediately locked in the freezer. Mrs. Puff yawned and wasn't spared either. Oh, I. I just remembered I didn't spend all your money at the mall. Here's your change. Change? Oh, the disease must have added your tiny, tiny mind. Mister Krabs was so paranoid that he even locked up his own daughter, Pearl. In the end, Only Mister Krabs was left outside. Eventually the crew realizes. Wait a second. The real suspect might be Mister Krabs himself.

A cabin that should have been packed with travelers looked almost deserted. Only a handful of passengers scattered around. She didn't breathe easy until she spotted her luggage being loaded below. But that relief wouldn't last long. Ever since boarding, her daughter had been unusually quiet. As the plane took off, Kyle told Julia to rest for a bit. But when Kyle opened her eyes again, her daughter's seat was completely empty. Thinking the girl had simply gone to the restroom, she searched the cabin row by row, only to come up empty handed. Kyle's worry grew. He approached a flight attendant for help, but was told something unbelievable. Her daughter had never boarded the plane. Kyle froze. She vividly remembered walking on with her child. Yet the crew insisted Julia wasn't on the passenger list. Feeling trapped and desperate, Kyle kept searching every corner she could reach. She returned to her seat and saw Julia's teddy bear still sitting there. Her fear deepened. Nearby passengers also claimed they had never seen any little girl beside her. Flight attendant stepped in and made an announcement to help search. Ten minutes passed. Nothing. The crew promised to alert the captain, and Kyle, with no other hope, clung to that promise. But half an hour later, the search still hadn't begun. Panic pushed her to ask passengers again. No one had seen Julia. Then another attendant appeared abruptly, acting tense, whispered something. To her colleague and pulled her aside. Sensing something was being hidden from her, Kyle followed, only to hear something far more terrifying. I don't think the girl is on this plane. What? Ma'am, we have no record of your daughter ever boarding. That made no sense. Kyle insisted she still had the boarding pass, but when she went back to look, the pass had vanished. With no proof left, the crew began treating her like she was unstable. While Kyle was certain her daughter was in real danger, she rushed toward the front cabin, only to be stopped by an air marshal. Once he heard her situation, he escorted her directly to the captain. The captain listened and asked whether she had any history of mental illness. Kyle admitted she struggled with depression, but made it clear that she wasn't hallucinating. This flight was transporting her late husband's body back home. His coffin was in the cargo hold below. Although the captain still had doubts, he decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. Bring the lights up. Everyone back to their seats. No one stays in the lavatories.

But while preparing it, he found some unknown liquid leaking from the bottom. The chef flipped the lobster over to check it out. But the next second, the chef, who got sprayed in the face, instantly lost all interest in working. So he directly called his assistant to clean up. But the assistant, wanting to free a hand to wipe the table, casually handed the lobster to the female apprentice beside him. And when the apprentice crushed the lobster, she also accidentally got sprayed all over. But she did not think much of it. Seeing the lobster already flushed into the drain, she walked away. Little did she know, this action would bring a huge disaster to the entire city. That night, the chef suddenly felt weak while working. He simply thought he just had not rested enough, so he decided to leave work early and go home. But he collapsed halfway, with his legs giving out. Black blood came out of his mouth, and he died on the spot. And the assistant, who had also touched the lobster, was sent to the ICU the next day. But faced with such strange symptoms, doctors had no idea what to do. They could only watch him die in pain. So to find the Cause Doctor Anna went to the restaurant manager to ask questions, but he also did not know. He only knew the chef had handled a lobster that day, and the assistant and apprentice tossed the lobster into the grinder afterward. Then two of them died tragically, and the remaining apprentice called in sick this morning. Hearing this, Anna immediately asked for the apprentice's address. She wanted to ask for some details, but the person had already died and the cause was exactly the same as the other two, so it was clear the cause had to be the lobster. Anna immediately took the dead assistant's blood, dripped it on a slide, then cut her finger and mixed her own blood with it. Under the microscope, she found the assistant's blood was full of marine vibrio bacteria, constantly eating away at blood cells. The speed was so fast, even Anna felt a chill.

The woman questions him, saying this dress looks like it's for a child. But the man believes that as a good fitness instructor, he should have a slim wife determined to marry him. Woman sticks to a strict diet all the way up to the wedding day. However, on the 50th day, the woman starts to feel a little off. She pushes through the dizziness and heads to the kitchen. She finds a table piled with fast food. Hunger takes over and she finds herself walking uncontrollably toward the food. Just as she touches the food, a strange noise comes from the bedroom, clearly the voice of another woman. The woman tries to open the bedroom door, but it's locked. Frantic and angry, she starts banging on the door. The man steps out shirtless, explaining that he was giving a class to a VIP client and asks her not to disturb him. The woman looks inside and sees a plus size woman greeting her. She breathes a sigh of relief, thinking her boyfriend would never fall for someone like that. But she's still confused about the fast food on the table. The man explains that it was what the client wanted before class and he'd asked her to clean it up. As the love alarm goes off, the woman suddenly craves the fast food again. She picks up a burger and slowly brings It to her mouth. Just then, the man finishes his class and exits the bedroom. Seeing this, he runs toward the woman.

That kindness you've been showing, that Grace under pressure, that refusal to become the monster that they tried to create, it wasn't weakness. It was the final examination. And congratulations, you magnificent anomaly. You just passed the test that you didn't even know you were taking. Let me break this down for you, because this is where it gets interesting. While you were busy being kind, being patient and understanding to people who, frankly, didn't deserve a single second of your mercy, something else was happening in the background. You were being observed not by your enemies. They're too busy nursing their wounds and, and wondering why their tactics stopped working. You were being observed by something far more significant. Call it the universe, the energy, the pattern recognition system that governs how power actually moves in this reality, whatever you want to name it. It saw what you did. It watched you choose Grace when you had every right to choose violence. It witnessed you extend kindness to people who would have shown you nothing but betrayal. And in that moment, in those countless moments of restraint and compassion, you demonstrated something rare. You proved that you understand real power. See, here's what most people get wrong about strength. They think it's about dominance, about crushing your enemies, about making sure everyone knows that you're not to be messed with. And sure, that's one form of power, that, that cruel, obvious, temporary kind. But Real power, the kind that bends reality itself, the kind that opens doors that nobody else even knows exists, that power only comes to those who've mastered the paradox. You have to be capable of destruction, but choose creation. You have to be capable of revenge, but choose peace. You have to carry the capacity for absolute chaos while maintaining perfect order. That's the test. Not whether you can hurt people. Any wounded animal can do that. The test is whether you can spare them with, when, when, when every fiber of your being is, is screaming for their blood. And you did. You look at people who have lied to you, betrayed you, used you, mocked you, abandoned you, and you still chose kindness, not because you're naive, not because you're weak, not because you didn't see exactly what they were doing. You chose kindness because you understood something they never will. Kindness from a position of power is the most devastating weapon in existence. It's mercy given by someone who doesn't need to give it. It's Grace extended by someone who could just as easily extend their fist. And that, that's what makes you dangerous in ways that they're only beginning to.

Thank you. Sure. Have a good night. Thank you. I fell in love with Kirk, the airport security officer. Our first date, he wore a red suit, but it matched the restaurant waiter's uniform. I didn't mind at all. What I liked was Kirk's genuine, honest nature. While Kirk helped a neighboring table with a coat, my ex boyfriend suddenly appeared. We exchanged greetings. When Kirk returned to sit down, my ex took seat instead. He thought Kirk was a waiter and started ordering. Sorry, friend, he's with me. My ex awkwardly stood up and gave the seat back to Kirk. That our romantic date becoming very awkward. On the way back, we talked about our dream. Kirk's dream was to become a pilot, but deep insecurity held him back from trying. I kept encouraging him if he that he should go for it. And I shared my own story with him. Kirk drove me to my doorstep, but neither of us wanted the night to end. As Kirk reached over to unbuckle my seatbelt, I leaned in and kissed him. We officially became a couple. The next day, Kirk took me home to meet his parents. They didn't believe I was really his girlfriend. His father even held my hand and Wouldn't let go. Kirk introduced me to his brother. His brother didn't believe it either. During lunch, face with his brother's rude remarks, Kirk didn't speak up. He just told me if I wanted to leave, he wouldn't blame me. But I didn't mind. His brother started mocking Kirk again. He asked me, how could someone like you be with him? He doesn't try and impress me. And, um. I can just be me around him. That left them speechless. After the gathering, Kirk drove me home. This time, I invited him upstairs. He came inside with me. We sat on the sofa talking. I leaned in and kissed him again. Just as things were getting intense, my parents suddenly returned. When my father reached out to greet him, Kirk froze in place, unable to stand up. We were both confused. As we all sat down, Kirk seized a chance and hurried out. I watched him, bewildered. I didn't understand why he acted so distant toward my family.

She only needed to take some time away from her boyfriend and her body would heal naturally. Hearing this, she felt a deep sense of sadness. She had been divorced for over a year, and during all that time she had not had a boyfriend. Doctor Wong was somewhat puzzled. Although Elaine did not seem to be lying, he still trusted his professional judgment. Unexpectedly, the next day, Elaine returned again, this time complaining of neck pain. Doctor Wong took a quick look. It clearly appeared to be a hickey, but Elaine denied it firmly. She had researched online beforehand, and every source suggested it could be a sign of cancer. Doctor Wong grew a little frustrated, absently pulled out two of his own hairs and sent her to the hospital for a drug test, suspecting she might have been intimate with someone. Strangely, all the test results came back normal. On the third day, Elaine came back again, this time due to vaginal bleeding. Doctor Wong performed an ultrasound and discovered that she had actually suffered a miscarriage. Elaine was furious, insisting she had not been with anyone, though this was completely impossible. Doctor Wong was equally bewildered, even beginning to suspect she might have schizophrenia, and considered further investigation.

Folks are pretending that they don't know what they did to you. Or folks are acting like they didn't do nothing to you. They don't know why you cut them off. They don't know why you would have ended the relationship. They don't know why they're not allowed around you. They don't know why you have these boundaries up now and that things are different now and there's a distance now. They're acting. But the keyword here is acting. Act. They know exactly what they've done, but they don't wanna take accountability for what they've done. Because perhaps what they've done is go too far. And whatever it was that they did and for them to address that would be too uncomfortable for them. Not uncomfortable for you, the nonsense they could have put you through. But uncomfortable for them to have to face the fact that now, you know, you have guidelines in place. You have boundaries in place to ward off or to protect yourself from these very same, uh, offenders. Right? This is the same perpetrators, the same players, the same comics. Trust me. Um, they're acting like they did not do anything to you. They know what they did. Ha, ha ha ha ha. It's like that movie, I know what you did last summer. Guess what? I know what you did last summer. Last fall. Last winter. Last spring. Right? Like we know what they've Done. It could have been an ongoing thing, not even seasonal. Every year, it's the same thing with these people. Every week, every month. Trying to deal with them, trying to navigate tricky issues with them. A lot of sabotage, a lot of hate, a lot of jealousy, a lot of competition that could have been force fed to you that you had to somehow combat. And now with the boundaries in place, now with the distance in place, now with you standing up for yourself more, it's like things are not how they used to be. And people are acting like they don't know why. Why are you moving different? Why do. Are you staying away from them? Why are they blocked

He was executed on the spot. The boy instantly tore off his red scarf and buried his identification in the dirt. He was Jewish too. Soon, a German officer approached to question him, and the boy claimed in fluent German that he was a local who had narrowly escaped the Soviet. The officer couldn't tell whether he was lying, so they brought the boy before the captain for clarification. Facing a barrage of questions from the captain, he answered smoothly at first, but when asked for his parents names, he froze. He had forgotten to invent any. Just then, chaos erupted outside. The Germans had captured a Soviet officer. Because of the language barrier, an argument broke out between the two sides. The boy volunteered to act as interpreter. Through his translation, the Germans Learned that among the prisoners was none other than Stalin's son. The soldiers were thrilled, credited the boy for the revelation, and even dragged him into a group photo. Afterwards, the boy was invited deeper into the German unit, and his disguise was so convincing that the soldiers completely dropped their guard around him. Suddenly, a prisoner shouted the boy's real name. It was an old rival from his past. He told the Germans the truth. The boy was Jewish, but the Germans couldn't understand him, so they ordered the boy to translate the boy.

The story begins on a silent night in the hospital when doctor strap a dying man named Ryan firmly onto a cold metal operating table, scanning his neural network upload completed successfully while his physical body is completely frozen, his consciousness is transported into a meticulously crafted virtual world. First, Ryan thought he had arrived in paradise, living in an opulent presidential suite where with just a gentle snap of his fingers could instantly change the weather, light and atmosphere. But reality hit him hard and mercilessly when he tried to eat breakfast at exactly 10:00am. The food vanished instantly from his hand. Breakfast is over. No, Because here every single thing comes with a price tag without exception. He quickly realized this was not heaven but a trap meticulously crafted for the wealthy elite. He discovered the dark underbelly of this world, the 2 gigabytes floor, pitiful slum for the poor where residents are allotted only 2 gigabytes of data per month. And once it's used up, they freeze completely like statues, unable to move, speak or make any sound until someone is willing to pay for a data top up. Even reading a book costs extra after the first five pages, making knowledge a commodity. Ryan once thought about escaping back to the real world until he witnessed a truly horrifying spectacle. A billionaire spent a staggering $4 billion to download his consciousness to a freshly 3D printed body while the entire world's audience held their breath, eyes glued to the live broadcast. But just seconds later, the old man's nose began gushing blood uncontrollably and his body convulsed violently, seemingly beyond all control.

He suggested that a way to lift the curse might be found in the forest of the Karen, the mountain god. There might Be able to help him. Early the next morning, as the thick fog had yet to disperse, Ashitaka embarked on his long journey once again. While passing through the bottom of a cliff, he discovered several injured villagers. Seeing that they were still breathing, Ashitaka searched the area for other survivors, but accidentally spotted a girl riding a white wolf. She was licking the white wolf God's wounds. She seemed to possess a beast like alertness and immediately noticed Ashitaka hiding behind them. The girl did not speak, only staring at him with a fierce gaze. My name is Ashitaka. I've traveled far from lands to the east. Are you ancient gods? And have I come at last to the realm of the spirit of the forest? Before riding away on the white wolf, Ashitaka seemed to feel a stirring in his heart. But before he could speak, he was suddenly interrupted by a scream from behind. It turned out to be a villager who had seen a white ghost. Ashitaka comforted the man, telling him not to be afraid. As it was only a tree spirit often found in dense forest areas, these little creatures gathered around. They meant no harm and even eagerly guided Ashitaka on his way. Sunlight filtered through the tall trees. Butterflies fluttered by the stream, creating a scene of tranquility and harmony. Ashitaka couldn't help but marvel. It was truly like a fairyland. Just as he was about to scoop some clear water to Quench his thirst, a dazzling golden light flashed from behind the bushes. Nearby, a group of Elk walked leisurely by, and among them was one with many Antlers, the legendary Kirin. Just as Ashitaka tried to get a clearer look, his arms suddenly began to surge uncontrollably, as if disturbed by some powerful force. He quickly submerged his arm in the water, and the intense agitation gradually subsided.

By now, the toxin on Ashitaka's arm had Penetrated deep into his skin, once it seeped into the bone, it would cause immense suffering and could even kill him. After some divination, the wise woman told him this was a mountain boar from a distant western land. It had become covered in wounds after being attacked by humans. Resentment gathered various curses upon it, thus transforming it into an incarnation of a demon. And the root of it all was this bullet. The wise woman had a premonition that ominous events were unfolding in the distant west because only villages there could smelt such iron bullets.

The interaction between Nick and flight attendant Lisa implied that they were the real internal thieves. Their target was a diamond encrusted mobile phone worth $20 million. This phone had three layers of security measures, with the core being a global positioning system and a two part password. The password was kept by the minister and the security company respectively. As an employee of the security company, Nick had already bribed the minister's secretary to get the other half of the password. Since there was no

But this time there was a note stuck to the box, drink me quickly. With police officers watching her every move, Kelly immediately recognized the familiar handwriting on the note. It belonged to her father, who was now wanted by the authorities. So while the officer monitoring her happened to look down, she gulped the entire yogurt in one breath. No one could have predicted what happened next. After Kelly drove away, the surveillance officer reported the incident to his superiors. Things grew even stranger when the arriving inspector found the yogurt box Kelly had thrown into the trash. Without hesitation, he stuck out his middle finger and used it to scoop out the remaining yogurt, tasting it directly. That seemingly insignificant action would cost the inspector dearly. Meanwhile, shortly after drinking the yogurt, Kelly felt a sudden wave of nausea. Clutching her stomach, she rushed into the women's restroom, and that's when he appeared. It was Kelly's father, but he didn't embrace his long lost daughter. Instead, he immediately located the listening device the police had secretly planted on her.

But the men who met her standards were getting uglier by the day. The first had a face covered in bumps, making her stomach turn instantly. The second was a frizzy, buck toothed oddball that made her skin crawl. The last was a balding Mediterranean type, crushing her mood. Completely disheartened, she returned to her company to wrap up the day's auditions when a handsome young man suddenly barged in. He snatched her skin tone card, held it beside his cheek, a flawless match. Thrilled, she couldn't believe her luck. She immediately shoved two empty vials into his hands and wrote him a 100 thousand dollar check, demanding healthy samples as soon as possible. She even promised a massive bonus later. But he took the money and party like crazy, blowing it all in one night and ending up drunk on the floor. She was furious, but as long as he delivered the samples, she would forgive everything. Yet he came back with the vials still empty. When she demanded an explanation, he shamelessly shrugged, asking for more money so he could restore his health. Even though anger was boiling in her chest, she prioritized the superior genes she wanted for her future child and gave him another 100 thousand dollar check. Money meant nothing to her. She sternly warned him he must deliver by the 27th the optimal conception Date he promised with absolute confidence. She believed it would work out. But on the 27th, she waited the entire day at the hospital. He never appeared. When she video called him, he held a thermometer in his mouth, pretending to be sick, and her rage nearly exploded. $200,000 wasted and always the same excuses. In fury, she stormed to his home. The place was brightly lit, messier than a nightclub. Her temper snapped even harder. She pushed the door open and saw instantly that his fever was nothing but a lie. She completely lost it.

The shorts performed brilliantly. Frightened, my husband rushed to give her water, but accidentally grabbed vinegar instead. She spat it right onto the shorts, causing some minor interference. Suddenly, the woman had another idea. She poured a whole basin of water over my husband. He was instantly electrocuted and my finger Locked alloy shorts finally short circuited and dropped right off. But unexpectedly, they started emitting a strange sonic wave which knocked the woman out on the spot.

After watching Jack devour the fish, Mary's feelings for him grew even stronger. But when Jack tried inflating Mary's belly instead, something seemed to grow in his own stomach. This is our turn of events. Stun Jack. Even More shocking, Mary threw Jack into the sea. As he flailed helplessly, Mary provided him with an oxygen helmet. Then she tied his legs and dragged him through the ocean straight to me. Jack immediately complained, she's an evil woman, but I couldn't care less. After all, Mary and I are true sisters. Seeing our solidarity, Jack stopped resisting and obediently let us stuff him into a cage.

Right? Just speaking from a experience Austin after a really rough breakup is not the time that you want some guy crashing at your girl's place. I know, right?

And then they started using words like boundaries. And I thought to myself, they don't know what's about to hit them. They're gonna have this precious baby and they're gonna be up all night. And that's gonna go into weeks and months. And then my little daughter in law is gonna start hallucinating and then she's gonna wake up the night and she'll be breastfeeding the lamp. And we'll see who's got boundaries. Well, I was right. So they work full time, both of them. And my daughter in law has been going to NBA school at night and on the weekends. So they are so tired and crazy they don't even know their own name. I was in an Uber with a man up north. And this man, we were talking about our grandchildren and he's got a grandson and he's in love with him. And he said, I love him so much that if he came to me and said, granddaddy, I've killed somebody, I'm gonna need some help, he said, I do it. And the first thing I thought was, I'm in an Uber with a man who would cover up a murder. And then the second thing I thought was, I'd help. When I see darling young mamas like this, my heart goes out to them cause I remember it. But it was Stressful, especially. My boy is so smart and sweet, but forgetful. And he would say to me almost every week, oh, I've got a project due. I go, when? In the morning. It'd be 9 o'clock at night. I go, oh, my lord. He go, it's not bad, it's not bad. I just gotta build a replica of a early 1900s tenement house in Brooklyn, New York. I just need 300 popsicle sticks and A&A can of brown paint. Where my kids went to school, they went to a small Christian school in Nashville. And I swear, all those kids were like pilgrims. And everybody dated intentionally. That's what they called it. They would go, we're dating intentionally. And. And I would. I was. That was so foreign to me because I didn't. I didn't. And so I would say to my boy, why don't you take that little girl to steak and shake in a movie? And he go, good night. I can't do that. I barely know her. I need to talk to her for a year before we can go on a date. And I'll be like, good night. I went with anybody that asked me to go anywhere. Husband is here and. But he's in the hotel room. I don't let him come and watch me. I know it makes me nervous. And I'll tell you why. Socially, when we are out and about with our friends, I'm out there dazzling, you know, in a social situation, Trying to spin a yarn in the middle of a bunch of people telling a big tale. And he's a detail person. He's an anal retentive type. A detail person. And he'll say, Leanne, it was not Wednesday. It was Tuesday. It was not 2:00. It was 3:00. And I'm like, be quiet. Questions all the time. For example, questions about the solar system. And finally one day, I said, baby, I didn't pay attention in school. Is there anything you'd like to know about young and the restless? This is my take on snow skin. I had to get all those little children dressed with all those layers. And then I had put ski boots on little children. They go, no, mommy, no, don't put those ski boots on me. We were skiing. This baby child, she starts taking all of her clothes off. I go, what are you doing? And she said, my butthole itches. I remember praying to the Lord and saying, what did I do that was so bad that this is my vacation now? I don't know what it is about my husband in a hotel room, but he gets in a hotel room, gets a glazed look over his eyes, and I feel like I'm doing this. And people ask me all the time, why did you name this big panty tour? And I tell people I like Big Panties. Big panties say to me, freedom. And the kind that I wear are called Vanity Fair lingerie. Beyond comfort. Beyond comfort. And they are soft and luxurious. And they don't ride up. They stay out of my crack. I don't want anything in my crack. I know. Love them. Okay? But I want you boys to know that I've held on to some tiny little hateful. Have you ever heard of lock in? I know everybody in here that has been from Chattanooga has probably been raised in church. Okay? I don't know who that little darling, sweet fool was that came up with the lock in. Some. Probably a little woman in a committee meeting.

And that sensitive baby, that middle one, would ask me deep, deep questions all the time. For example, questions about the solar system. And finally one day I said, baby, I didn't pay attention in school. Is there anything you'd like to know about young? And the, my oldest baby was my, Charlie was 2. He had quit taking a nap, was still in diapers, but he was a precious baby, but very active. And he would beat on the front door trying to get out so he could run down the yellow line of the highway. And I was worn to a frazzle, and I was about to give birth at any minute, and I got stripped real bad. And my OB GYN was Pete, who was in our Sunday school class. And he was so cute, and I hated for him to see me that way. But Pete said, you got a horrible case of strep. I'm gonna have to put you in the hospital again overnight. You're gonna have to get a bag of fluids and rest. And I say it for real, for real. I get to go in the hospital overnight. It's like somebody sent me. You girls that have got young boys, I'm sorry to tell you, but I, you have to hand him over to another woman. And my boys said to me, mom, she is but my best friend. She's gonna be my wife. I'm supposed to cling to her. That's biblical. And I thought, why did I show him the Bible? Remember Tiger King? And that felt like 10 years ago now, but I loved it. And that little, if y'all didn't watch it, y'all gotta go back and watch it. There's a little guy named John and he was on meth and he, and, and he had a sweet heart. He had a good, sweet, kind heart. And he was having to have homosexual sex with a man and he wasn't gay. And then the girl that worked the front desk, he got her pregnant and that got him out of it. But anyway, and then when Travis, I think his name was Travis, was having homosexual sex, he wasn't gay, with the Tiger King Feller. And then he died. And the Tiger King guy, Joe, did his funeral and said, I'll never forget when he just came up and he put his doings on my face. And I've done every diet in the world. My mama and my sister and I took dexatrim when I was 17 years old. I'm the youngest. You could buy it everywhere. Do you remember dexatrim? Yeah, it was speed. We took speed as a family. We would take the Dixie trim and our heads would itch and We fight in the yard. And my boy was 9 years old. And we joined Pop Warner football. And y'all take football just as serious as we do in Tennessee. And that little Pop Warner team scared me to death that they mean it. And it was serious. And it was 130 degrees. And the man who was the coach, head coach, his boy was a quarterback, 9 years old. He was talented. You could tell this child had it. And they work that little thing like a meal. And, and I bet that boy is somewhere smoking dope somewhere. And my, my boy was over there, you know, talking about the Alamo and could have cared less. We all get in this tiny little float plane and we've got on, they put these big old headphones on us and somebody's narrating. I think it's Wink Martindale. And all of a sudden this little man starts pumping his foot, pumping his foot. And that's how we get in there. He's pumping that point. And I don't know if I saw a glacier. I don't know if I saw one, one, because, I mean, it was all white everywhere. But also, I was praying. I was praying and I took my purse handles and took them around my neck and put that, my husband, I bet y'all are a lot like him, cause my husband's like that, very driven and overachiever. And he, I had to hide from him that I, Was watching Real Housewives because he thought it was awful. He goes, what are you watching? This mess? And I would have to get the remote and do theirs real quick and change it before he got up to the bedroom. And one time he said to me, by watching this, Leanne, you are single handedly ruining the United States of America.

Hard things. Things like paint the hallway, something like that. And I said, excuse me, but I stay in my gown until the third hour of the today show. The last time I dated, it was the 80s, and I was in a club, honey, dancing. Dancing the prince and having a big time, big hair, I think here. If I had to go on a date right now and go to a club, let me tell y'all that I have got rhythm and I'm coordinated and I can dance. I really can. I can bust a move. Now, I can't do math, but I can dance. But if I had to go to a club with a man, this is how I would dance right now. I would. I would go, cause I don't wanna jiggle. I can see a man going, what's that, may? Going, nothing, that's just a pre cancer. I just burned one off of my leg about two weeks ago. Yeah, I'm okay. Me and my husband in Hawaii on a company trip. I had bought a lavender miracle suit. Don't ever do that. This VHS tape was of us snorkeling. We both have been eating white Flour and sugar. And our heads were this big and we were white and gross. And I had the, uh. So then. And my husband had been taking Propecia and it grown a patch of hair out right here. He's floating and there's this one thing of hair doing and then all of a sudden this lavender thing comes across the screen. I'm like, what is that? Yet is that. He's an old soul. Have y'all ever known anybody that was just born an old soul? He. He was born an 80 year old man. All right. Let me tell you why I say that. He has had a garden since he was in middle school. He is just always loved to learn and had all these nifty things that he's been into. Like he raised chickens. He was in Barry College. They have enterprises, business enterprises. And he started the cage free egg enterprise. He raised 200 chickens while he was in college. Do you want to know what I was doing at the university of Tennessee in the eighties? I mean, let's just get out. My little daddy, all of my life has been scared to death something would happen to me or my sister. And he was like, don't you dare get on a motorcycle. That was one of the things, and it would just scare me to death. I was like, I'm not going to. Well, my husband buys one and says, because we're 30 minutes, From the Smoky Mountains. Let's go ride in the mountains. And I thought, oh, my Lord, if I get on this thing, he's gonna pull off into the bushes and make me do something horrible, and I can't be scared. So she was worried about who was going to heaven, and she asked me about J Lo. And this was years ago, and I'm a huge Jlo fan. And she said, Mommy, is Jlo going to heaven? Just let me tell y'all. I was in a bad place, okay? I was in a bad place, and I think I'm going up a size in my pants. And she asked me about Jlo. She goes, is she going to heaven? And I said, I don't know. I don't know. I think she needs to mature spiritually. And, um, she's going through a lot of men right now. I said it. I remember saying it, and it was wrong, and I'm sorry, and I should have never said it. But you in that glitter jacket, you yummy thing. Is this wrong for me to assume that you are a precious gay man? Do you know that my next husband's gonna be a gay man? I mean that. Think about it. I'll leave him alone, he'll leave me alone. There was never alcohol in our house until my sister is a little bit older than me, and she was gonna marry late in life, and she was gonna marry this hootie doo man. Country club, man. I had to explain to women in North Dakota what that was. Hooptie doo. You know, country club. Cause I'm from a town of 500 people, farming people. We didn't know what. We never seen anybody play tennis. I've seen somebody on the. On TV and I think, oh, that's the Queen and her people. So we didn't know anything about a country club. So she's gonna marry this country club man. And, you know, some country club people like to drink, so. To get young girls. When y'all get through this, when you start going through these hormonal changes, it'll disrupt your sleep. Not everybody, but the majority people it will. And it did me. I haven't slept in years. And I said to my nurse practitioner, I can't sleep. And she said, do you want some Ambien? And I was like, I would love some Ambien, but will I get hooked on dope? Marijuana is not legal here in Kentucky, right? It's not in Tennessee, either. Okay, I don't mean to scare y'all, but I travel all over the United States, and let me tell you something. Everybody. Everybody is high on marijuana.

And this man, we were talking about our grandchildren and he's got a grandson and he's in love with him. And he said, I love him so much that if he came to me and said, granddaddy, I've killed somebody, I'm gonna need some help, he said, I'll do it. And the first thing I thought was, I'm in an Uber with a man who would cover up a murder. And then the second thing I thought was, I'd help my baby cover up a murder. When I see darling young mamas like this, my heart goes out to them cause I remember it. But it was stressful especially. My boy is so smart and sweet, but forgetful. And he would say to me almost every week, oh, I've got a project due. I go, when? In the morning, it'd be 9 o'clock at night. I go, oh, my lord. He go, it's not bad, it's not bad. I just gotta build a replica of a early 1900s tenement house in Brooklyn, New York. I just need 300 popsicle sticks and a. And a can of brown paint. And I'd have to get in the car with no bra on with three little children and go to Walmart in the middle of the night. But I want y'all to know what your future is gonna where my kids went to school. I went to a small Christian school in Nashville. And I swear, all those kids were like pilgrims. And everybody dated intentionally. That's what they called it. They would go, we're dating intentionally. And I would. I was. That was so foreign to me because I didn't. I didn't. So I would say to my boy, why don't you take that little girl to steak and shake in a movie? And he go, good night. I can't do that. I barely know her. I need to talk to her for a year before we can go on a date. And I'll be like, good night. I went with anybody that. I see some younger mamas in here. I see some younger girls. If you got little children, can you clap for me? You're too tired. Pretty tired. Sound pretty tired. Well, Lord, you got a lot on you. And, um, you know, you're gonna have to go home and do nasty things to pay for these tickets. I just wanna say thank y'all for coming out, cause y'all probably don't get to go anywhere most of the time. I know my darling husband is here and. But he's in the hotel room. I don't let him come and watch me. I know it makes me nervous. And I'll tell you why. Socially, when we are out and about with our friends, I'm out there dazzling, you know, in a social situation, trying to spin a yarn in the middle of a bunch of people telling a big tale. And he's A detail person. He's an anal retentive type. A detail person. He'll say, Leanne, it was not Wednesday, it was Tuesday. It was not 2:00, it was 3:00. And I'm like, be quiet all the time. For example, questions about the solar system. And finally one day I said, baby, I didn't pay attention in school. Is there anything you'd like to know about young and the restless? This is my take on snow skin. I had to get all those little children dressed with all those layers, and then I had put ski boots on. Little children, they go, no, mommy, no, don't put those ski boots on me when we're skiing. This baby child, she starts taking all of her clothes off. I go, what are you doing? And she said, my butthole itches. I remember praying to the Lord and saying, what did I do that was so bad that this is my vacation? Now? I don't know what it is about my husband in a hotel room, but he gets in a hotel room, gets a glazed look over his eyes, and I feel like I'm doing the. Have you ever heard of lock in? I know everybody in here that has been from Chattanooga has probably been raised in church. Okay? I don't know who that little darling, sweet fool was that came up with the lock in. Some. Probably a little woman in a committee meeting, and she probably said, oh, gosh, y'all, let's Come up with something for all the hormonal teenagers. Let's gather them up and put them in the church building and lock the door and turn the lights out. We've got a girlfriend in our friend group, and she's 58, and she loves her husband. Loves him. But we were saying, Lord, if we had to get out here and get a man. She said, okay, I think I could show somebody my left breast. She said, it still looks okay. Where do people go on dates in their 50s and 60s? Lord, I had not dated since the eighties.

Yesterday I caught her filling her water bottle with chocolate milk from the cafeteria machine. She drank the whole thing like she was dying of thirst. The next morning I picked Emma up from her dad's at 6:30 a. M. Like always, she got in the car wearing the same clothes from three days ago. I knew because I bought her that purple shirt for picture day. Her hair was matted. She smelled Like she hadn't showered in a week. I kept my voice steady.

But sometimes he doesn't come home until morning because they go out after his shift. Where do you sleep? The garage. There's an old couch, but it's really cold and there's no bathroom, so I have to hold it all night or go behind the bushes like an animal. She started crying. Please don't make me go back. Please, mom. I'll be so. Oh, good. I'll do all my homework. I'll clean everything. Just leave. I pulled over and hugged my daughter while she saw. Then I called my lawyer and said four words, get me everything ready. I drove straight to her father's house. Emma gave me the garage door code. She wasn't even allowed a house key. The garage was exactly as she described, a broken couch covered in motor oil stains. No blankets, no pillow, just empty Gatorade bottles she'd been using when she couldn't hold it anymore. The smell made me gag. I took photos of everything, the locked house door, the garage, the bottles. Then I called the police for a Wellness check. They arrived in 12 minutes. Emma's dad pulled up while the officers were still there. His girlfriend stumbled out of the passenger, clearly drunk. At 8:00am, they both started screaming about private property until one officer held up his hand. Sir, is this where your 11 year old daughter has been sleeping?

So I put the entire school on lockdown. Miss Chen, he's here again. Maya crashed through my door at two fifty two PM phone trembling in her hands, but earlier than usual. The countdown clock in my head started. Eight minutes until dismissal. Show me, I said, though my stomach was already dropping. This was day seven of her reporting the same man she. She showed me a live stream from her friend in the parking lot. A man in a gray hoodie was methodically checking every exit door, pulling on handles. He had something in his hand. Yesterday he left this on my mom's car. She showed me a photo of a note. Stop keeping her from me. Two fifty three PM, Seven minutes we. I ran to Principal Morrison's office. He was on a video call laughing about basketball scores. Emergency. I interrupted. He muted himself, annoyed. Miss Chen, we've discussed Maya's anxiety issues since her sister disappeared last year. She didn't disappear, Maya whispered. She ran away from our stepdad. There's a man checking all our exits right now, I insisted. Morrison unmuted. Sorry, folks, dealing with a student panic attack. Where were we? Two fifty four PM, 6 minutes until 1,200 kids would flood outside. Security Officer Dale was watching TikToks. Wait up, lady, I'm off in five minutes. File a report Monday. He's trying doors right now. Maya showed the live stream. Probably a confused Parent happens daily. Two fifty five PM, Five minutes through the window, I saw him, gray hoodie now pulling bolt cutters from his bag near the gym exit. Lockdown, I screamed in the hallway. Everyone inside. Vice Principal Roberts grabbed my arm. Stop scaring students with your hysteria. He has bolt cutters. Maya's stepfather already called about her making up stories to avoid coming home. Maya froze. My stepfather called you. Two fifty six PM, Four minutes. I ripped free and sprinted to Morrison's office still on his call. I do for his desk phone and slammed the lockdown button. Sirens exploded. Red lights flashed. Lockdown, lockdown. This is not a drill. Morrison lunged at me. You're fired. I grabbed his mic. All students stay locked in classrooms. Man in gray hoodie attempting entry. Do not exit through the window. Chaos. The man was running toward the main entrance where kids usually exit but doors were locked. No one came out. He smashed the glass door with his bolt cutters and climbed through. Two fifty eight PM, Two minutes he was inside running down halls, checking every locked classroom door, getting more frantic. Maya's phone buzz. Unknown number. I know you're here. Mom's coming to get you dentist appointment. That's what my stepdad always said. When Maya gasped, the man ripped off his hood in frustration. My scream shattered the air. That's Brian. That's mom's boyfriend. Morrison went white. But your stepfather? Brian is my stepfather. 2:59 p. M. One Minute police surrounded him in the main hall. When they tackled him, items scattered from his backpack, zip ties, duct tape, a knife. The detective looked sick reviewing everything. Brian Hutchinson, two restraining orders, wanted for assault in Nevada, his ex wife's daughter. That was your sister who disappeared, wasn't it? Maya nodded. He called the school this morning. The detective told Morrison, classic creditor move, discredit the victim first, make them look crazy. He turned to me. Your lockdown saved her life. His van had a mattress in the back and receive it's for a storage unit two states away. Morrison couldn't speak. Dale was suspended, Roberts under investigation. Later, security footage revealed 31 staff members Maya had begged for help over seven days, 31 adults who dismissed her fear, but also one teacher who finally listened. The detective hold me aside. We tracked his phone. He'd been inside the school three times this week during lunch mapping exits. He knew exactly when each door would open. Maya hugged me tight. Everyone said I was paranoid that I was making it up for attention. No, I said. I just remembered that every missing girl was once a student whose warnings were ignored. The news report counted 1,200 students saved that day. But really we only saved one, the one that mattered, the one everyone else chose to ignore.

The sky immediately darkened. In the next second, countless plastic wastes fell from the city sky. According to the biologists, the aquatics predated humanity. Now that they were awake, they would inevitably compete with humans for survival space on earth. Nobody wanted a war, so the matter needed to be resolved peacefully. Berkeley was originally just a clerk in the transport department, but due to an HR mix up, he was mistakenly assigned as an agent for the Jeff. The general believed this unwitting rookie. And that, I suspect, is how history is made. One great big chain of mistakes. Before they could finish their discussion, the alarm sounded again. Technicians had detected an unknown life form near the coast. If their suspicions were correct, it was undoubtedly an aquatic envoy. General understood that the envoy's willingness to show up fence negotiation was still possible. The technical department was ready translating the general's English into the aquatic language. After calibration, the two sides finally began normal talks. The envoy's message was simple. Humans had killed one of their kind, and they were only acting in forced retaliation. The general requested a temporary truce, which the envoy agreed to without hesitation. The general then proposed many suggestions regarding peace. The envoy agreed to every one of them. Just when everyone thought the conflict was a false alarm, the envoy's next words made everyone's heart sink again. But. But the envoy demanded to communicate with all life. Forms on land, not just humanity. The technician thought it was a translation error, but the envoy clearly understood the principle that the weak have no diplomacy. Only by demonstrating the power of the aquatic race could they engage in equal negotiation. Furthermore, this negotiation did not require human consent, because they were already talking. We are talking to the whole world. We are talking to the whole world right now. The general was baffled by the translation, unable to grasp what method the envoy was referring to. But the next second, an alert popped up on every soldier's phone. The Aquatics had taken control of all the rivers, lakes and seas on earth. Within days, videos of the aquatics appeared on major social media platforms, sending the public into a panic. As the first country to make contact, the UK bore the heavy responsibility of hosting the initial peace talks. President has called for a new age of cooperation. It's being called H2O diplomacy.

Call the cops on me cause I broke curfew. So lame. Where were you? Not your business, Haley. Answer his question or what? You'll ground me for another month. Your father was attacked that night. Is he dead? No, he's gonna be fine. Too bad, Haley. It's a really terrible thing to say. It's your father. Wish she wasn't. Wish she were dead. She doesn't mean it. You wanna bet whoever attacked him, it wasn't me. Just want you to tell us where you were. Just out, okay? Were you with anyone? Boy. Boy. Haley, are you gay? You still don't get it, mom. I'm a girl. I'm supposed to be with boys. Sounds like a typical teenage girl, except that she was born a boy. Haley's anatomy is irrelevant. Her brain is female. She wants what a girl wants. Well, what causes the mix up? We don't know. For some children, something happens in utero where the brain develops as one gender and the body the other. So she feels trapped, born as the wrong gender, trying desperately to become the right one, and the only one standing in the way is dad. Sounds like motive to me, DOC. I gotta say, Mark, being beaten in the crutch is pretty symbolic. She also. Gave her mom a black guy. It's not such a leap to attacking her dad. Well, I'll feel better once we run down Haley's alibi. Head over to the school, get the name of the boy she snuck out to see, check with a guidance staff. Home may not be the only place where Haley loses control. She came out in September and started wearing girls clothes. A lot of our old friends don't talk to her anymore. And how'd she handle that? Any acting out? Well, there have been some problems. Two months ago, Haley went to the bathroom. Some older girls were in there and one of them said they didn't allow he she's. Haley dragged her into the stall and pushed her head into the toilet. Well, that's not a problem. That's battery. Well, we suspended her for three days. Now Haley uses the gender neutral bathroom in the nurse's office. She doesn't take the Zeds so she won't have to change in a locker room. Any other violence? Haley got into a scuffle with a little boy who called her a faggot. Haley gave him a black eye. And a new teacher called her Henry by mistake. Haley threw a book at him. All that and she hasn't been expelled. Well, there's been talks, but I've told the school it's a process, a learning process for all of us. Where's Haley now? In my office. Ellen called to tell me about Mark's attack. I brought her In to talk to her. Hi, Haley. Not again. Do people just leave me alone. We have a few more questions. Need your boyfriend's name so you can tell my mom. We can keep it between us. I think I'm stupid enough to believe that. Haley, you need to answer the detective's questions. Whose side are you on? Yours. But this is serious there, Haley. We can find out where you were. We can check your email, check your cell phone records. No, don't do that. I did it, Haley. What are you talking about? I did it. I tried to kill my dad.

I believe that when I'm out. The police arrested an innocent man. This mistake LED to him being wrongfully imprisoned for 8 years. Meanwhile, the real criminal remained free. That criminal went on to commit another crime. This LED to a new tragedy. So if you hadn't put away the wrong man, this never would have happened to me. Detective Benson was filled with guilt and remorse both. The lawyer representing Omar agreed to give her one week to find the real culprit. Otherwise, he would sue her personally. New evidence pointed to the true perpetrator. He was a sailor in the Brazilian Navy named Javier. His DNA matched evidence from multiple cases across different countries. All the crimes shared the same method. What was more shocking was that Javier was the one who had identified Omar eight years earlier. The investigation later revealed that the Brazilian Navy uniform closely resembles the US Navy uniform. If a victim wasn't familiar with the differences, they could easily mistake one for the other. When Ariel, the victim from eight years ago, put on her new prescription glasses and looked at Javier's photo, she realized she had identified the wrong man. Her mistake had ruined Omar's life. And also LED to the harm of a new victim, Gina.

Nothing, mom. Looks like I won't be home for supper. And you can forget about a home cooked meal anytime in your future. That's alright, son. I'll take care of you. The mother sought to act as an alibi witness for her son. She claimed that her son had been with her the entire time the crime occurred. She even brought a surveillance video recorded three days earlier as evidence. The footage showed that on the day of the incident, Dwight and his mother had been volunteering in the community all day. But the police noticed something unusual. Dwight had left through the back door and returned looking disheveled. More critically, the time he was away coincided exactly with when the rape occurred. As it turned out, Dwight's mother had never actually watched the surveillance footage and was unaware that her son had been gone for an hour. She had been convinced that the video would clear her son's name, never expecting it would become key evidence leading to his conviction. During the trial, Dwight's defense lawyer questioned the victim, Catherine, asking how she could be sure the suspect was Dwight given the dim lighting during the incident, especially since she had previously wrongly accused Kevin of assaulting her. Catherine explained that the reason for her mistaken identification was that Kevin and Dwight had similar height and skin tone.

She wanted the world to believe she'd been abused. It was all part of her revenge. She drew a bag of her own blood, splattered it on the cabinets, poured some onto the floor and spread it with care. Then she dipped a hammer in blood and tossed it into the fireplace. Next, Anna reached out to her pregnant neighbor, invited her over for tea, and casually mentioned her husband's violent temper.

Then she wrote 200 fake diary entries, painting a story of fear and cruelty before burning half the pages to make it look real. Anna cut her hair, sealed it in a plastic bag, dyed what was left and picked up a hammer. She hit herself hard. Then she vanished. When her husband, Jack, came home, the house was a wreck. Within hours, the police arrived. They found blood on the cabinets and took Jack in for questioning. With no solid evidence, they had to let him go.

I looked around like grabbing a lifeline, found the voice was from a walkie talkie. But this short 1 meter distance with no cover made me stuck. To draw the killers attention away, I grabbed two packs of chips and threw them over my head, successfully distracted the other person. I quickly picked up the walkie talkie to ask for help, told the person on the other end to call the police for me. The person asked what happened, but before I could explain clearly, the walkie talkie got interfered. Worse still, my colleague came into the store at this time, ended up getting killed on the spot. I wanted to cry but had to hold back. My friend just got shot. You have to call 9, 1 1. The person on the other end felt sorry after hearing my experience and said they had called the police, told me to stay put to calm me down. The person casually asked what relation that black eye had with me. Hearing this, I trembled all.

So she danced with her feet in the MUD, but she still couldn't feel that lightness beneath her steps because she was about to face a dance performance that could change her fate. And she practiced hard for it. She ranked first in every test, but she just couldn't master that sense of lightness under her feet. She kept making mistakes while dancing. Her master harshly scolded her in front of everyone, saying she could only ever be an average dancer. Unwilling to give up, the girl went to the marketplace to learn rope walking. But rope walking was a skill only men were allowed to learn. The rope walker rejected her outright. The girl refused to quit. She explained her reason to him, hoping he would help her. Moved by her determination, he finally agreed to teach her in secret. After some time of training, her skills grew more refined and her body became lighter and lighter. Her sudden improvement shocked everyone and even stirred an unprecedented jealousy in her best friend. Soon, the day of the dance performance arrived. The girl cooperated earnestly with her teammates, not daring to slack off for a moment. But her friend shot them a look and her teammates suddenly quit, walking off the stage one after another, leaving the girl standing alone under the lights. She panicked instantly. Not knowing what to do next, seeing this, everyone believed the important performance had just been ruined. But the girl suddenly ran to the side of the stage, drew a sword, and as the music rose, she seemed to transform into an elegant crane. Her graceful and weightless dance stunned the entire crowd. Applause erupted nonstop. Her friend watched and regretted everything. And the girl's breathtaking solo left a deep impression on everyone there.

But before he could figure out what was happening, the girl suddenly Pushed him aside. The next second, something strange happened again. The world that was just full of colors turned back into black and white in the blink of an eye. However, what was even more bizarre was that he saw all objects had no color. Only the girl's colors remained unchanged. This made the man instantly realize something was wrong. And to verify his inner suspicion, the man immediately had a bold idea.

The employees in the meeting were stunned and soon the whale dove deep into the sea. Now all they could do was call the police. Fortunately, the whale that swallowed the boss was a humpback, a filter feeding mammal incapable of swallowing a person. It could only temporarily keep the boss in its mouth. Thankfully, Eddie had brought a satellite phone with him when he went out to see. The firefighters could stay in contact with Eddie through the phone at any time. However, there wasn't much they could do. They advised Eddie to conserve oxygen as much as possible. Through phone tracking, they located the whale. But the question was, how could they get the boss out? One firefighter mentioned he had seen a documentary about whales. When a humpback surfaces, it sometimes spits out indigestible food. But whales can stay underwater for at least 45 minutes and Eddie couldn't last more than 10 minutes. The only solution was to force the hump back to surface. The captain quickly came up with an idea. Whales are extremely sensitive to sound. Maybe they could use noise to force the whale to come up. As for how to send noise underwater, the captain had a plan. He attached a cone over the Siren, then connected it to the loudspeaker on the police car and hooked it up to the fire hose. Finally, he turned On the Siren and the 120 decibel alarm could reach the bottom of the sea. With the captain's command, a firefighter turned on the Siren. The loud noise quickly reached the whale's ears, but the boss's condition was getting worse. He had slipped into a semicomatose state. However, the captain's method finally worked. The whale, disturbed by the noise, spat out the foreign object in its mouth. One firefighter didn't hesitate. He jumped into the water. Whether the person was a civilian or a billionaire, he wouldn't hesitate. After performing CPR, the boss was successfully rescued. The employees waiting in the meeting room breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed the company wouldn't be going under after all.

Tina drove up again, saying the exact same things as before. This time, they gave Tina directions. After Tina left, they thought they were going crazy, but Duncan believed they weren't insane.

But the team boss refused, ordering him to stick to the plan. The crew swapped the tires fast, ready to send him out, but sunny didn't move. Silence. No one knew what was happening. The team boss rushed over, trying to reason with him, reminding sunny he was a five time champion. But sunny just stared at him, furious, unblinking. The tension was unbearable. Neither man wanted to give in. Then finally, the boss broke. Give him his tires. Okay, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go. Let's go. Let's go. Chase. Get back! In seconds, the new tires were on. The moment they hit the ground, sunny slammed the throttle, the engine roared to life, and he shot out of the pit lane like a beast, finally unleashed. Be ready. Ready for what?

I had no choice but to tell her the truth. I'm your father. The moment she heard it, she went silent. While she slowly calmed down, I took her to a small diner nearby. It was the first real conversation I ever had with my daughter. And strangely, I could feel her guard lowering. When I noticed the diamond necklace around her neck. I told her it was the one I gave her mother years ago. And then I told her that her mother's death might have been connected to her father, Vincent. She was just about to argue back. A group of men suddenly rushed into the diner. All of them were after the twenty million dollar bounty. Their goal was clear. Take Mia. I fought with everything I had, but there were too many of them. They dragged Mia away. To stop me from chasing them, one of the men shot out my tire. By the time I made it out of the diner, Mia was already gone.

My vision went dark and I didn't even have time to fight back before I blacked out. A few hours later, I was jolted awake by the sound of my phone ringing. I didn't recognise the caller, but he called me by my full name. And what was even stranger was that I wasn't hurt at all. My house didn't have a single sign of a break in. As a former special forces operative, my first thought was that I wasn't the real target. I rushed into my son Liam's room. It was empty. I tore through the entire house, the front yard, the backyard, nothing. That's when the man on the phone finally gave me the answer. He said Liam was locked inside an abandoned castle with a gas line hanging right above his head. As long as I did exactly what they told me to do, my son would stay alive. I had no choice. I followed the instructions to the garage or a metal crate I had never seen before was waiting. I opened it and found a full loadout inside, a handgun, magazines, a bulletproof vest and a razor sharp knife. There was also a tiny camera mounted on the vest. The next second the garage door lifted, an off road vehicle was parked outside. The GPS was already programmed pointing me toward a luxury hotel downtown, the Kidnappers told me two major crime organizations were forming an alliance there. My mission was simple, kill everyone and destroy the alliance for Liam's sake. I forced myself to go in with a submachine gun. In my training, the massacre was quick and clean. And as soon as I finished, the second mission was already waiting for me. They knew Liam was my weakness, so they were certain I keep obeying. I knew where the next target was, so I streamed the best cameras feed to the living room TV, letting my team see everything live. But when I reached the next location and was about to move in, trouble hit right at the entrance. One of the guards spotted the camera on my chest.

It didn't take long before a Mexican cartel discovered my dad's identity. He continued his work as usual, completely unaware that danger was closing in. The cartel sent two backup teams equipped with satellite cameras and even infiltrated our home. That day, I heard strange noises coming from inside the house. I ran to check and saw a horrifying scene. My dad's wife had been killed and even my twin brothers were gone. The cameras recorded everything. Frozen in terror, I couldn't move. The man spotted me and I immediately ran to the balcony. He was right behind me, so I had no choice but to jump. Shots rang out, but I miraculously escaped, running into the forest to hide, at least temporarily safe. That night, my dad finally came home only to find cold corpses. His wife and brothers were gone. His heart broke and he knew the cartel's revenge had arrived. I saw my dad's car and carefully approached the house. Being me safe, he tried to shield me from the horrific scene inside. The backup teams handed the video to their boss and only after watching did they realise the dead were actually my dad's twin brothers. By then, my dad and I had already made it to a secret base. My dad fixed his hair, shaved, picked up his gun and Phone and prepared for the next move. I lost control and furiously demanded answers. Finally, my dad revealed the whole truth. He had been trained by his family from a young age and had killed members of rival families. But he couldn't bear that life, so he escaped in secret and lived under a false identity. Hearing this, I completely broke down. It was all because of the photo I posted. It had put mom in danger. My dad was silent, full of regret. He organized his weapons, packed them into a bag and told me to stay at the base and wait for him to return. He handed me a phone and warned me not to use it recklessly. Shortly after he left, I still called my boyfriend hoping he could come pick me up. I had no idea that this decision would cost him his life.

La ballena confesó que una vez cometió un grave error, había tragado cien barcos pesqueros y por eso había sido encarcelada allí. Pero sentía que todo había sido accidental y que no merecía un castigo tan cruel. Mientras hablaba, una sola lágrima rodó por su rostro. El caballito sintió compasión por su desgracia, pero no tenía forma de ayudarla. entonces, vanya estornudó y una idea le iluminó la mente, ¿por qué no hacer estornudar a la ballena? Quizá así podría liberarse de las cadenas. Panya montó caballito y volaron hacia la enorme fosa nasal de la ballena. Debían entrar antes de que se cerrara y finalmente lo lograron. Por dentro era hermoso, como si estuvieran en la vía láctea, aunque el olor dejaba mucho que desear. El caballito extendió las alas de inmediato y comenzó a rascar paredes internas con las puntas para provocar el estornudo. La ballena reaccionó, sus ojos se abrieron de par en par y empezó a inhalar profundamente. Una de las gruesas cadenas ya había roto. Sin querer, su cuerpo entero comenzaba a elevarse. ¡Qué criatura tan gigantesca! Pero había un problema. Vanya y el caballito seguían dentro.

Después de todo, esto es un cuento de hadas, pero vanya había olvidado su misión, había venido en busca de un anillo. Si no lo encontraba, el rey lo mandaría decapitar. La leyenda decía que el anillo estaba en el estómago de la ballena, pero ahora el animal ya había nadado muy lejos. Justo cuando banya estaba desesperado, apareció un cangrejo frente a él.

In the blink of an eye, its entire body slipped free, and I scampered into the safe house, terrified. What I didn't know was that the little creature had already sneaked into the woman's home. Spotting the creep who'd been preying on her, it crept up to him silently. This beast never harms the innocent. And once it confirmed he was evil, it slid its hand right back into the woman's mouth. Early morning, the woman was primping in front of the mirror when a worm slithered across her face. Something felt off, but just then her assistant knocked, urging her to the show taping. She forced a smile and agreed, dismissing the sight as a hallucination. Mid interview, chaos erupted. The worms inside her started swarming. She swatted at her skin frantically. Everyone sensed something was terribly wrong. Clutching her face in agony, she bolted for the bathroom, slumped onto the toilet and grabbed a knife, determined to cut the worms out. She succumbed to the agony and struck herself. In the end, she was dragged down to the 18 level of hell to pay for her sins.

Para su sorpresa, la clienta quedó encantada, pero pronto notó que el cabello de mi brazo, donde yo estaba comiendo, se había vuelto Dorado. La clienta, totalmente fascinada, abandonó a la mujer y se fue corriendo. Ella gritó tratando de detener. Mientras tanto, yo admiraba mi propio vello Dorado. De manera inesperada, la clienta se acercó a ella por detrás, exigiendo que colocara el vello Dorado en sus pestañas, así que saqué un mechón Dorado de mi brazo y lo coloqué en las pestañas del cliente. Para mi sorpresa, el cliente encantado me dio una generosa propina inmediatamente

Mientras ella no prestaba atención, él añadió en secreto. Un agente que provoca caída de cabello en su champú ya había tenido éxito muchas veces usando este método. La mujer desprevenida tomó el champú y lo aplicó en su cabeza caída en la trampa. El ladrón se retiró a la alcantarilla. De repente, la mujer notó que su cabello comenzaba a caerse rápidamente, especialmente después de enjuagarse con agua. Todo se desprendió por completo. El cabello flotó con el agua hasta el alcantarillado, donde el ladrón esperaba para recogerlo. Solo. Después de que todo su cabello se había caído, se dio cuenta de que algo iba mal al mirarse en el espejo. Mientras tanto, el ladrón de cabello feliz trepó de regreso a través del alcantarillado hasta su taller. Allí, tomó una peluca y la colocó en un maniquí con una herramienta especial para enganchar cabello. Colocó cada mechón robado en la base de la peluca 1x1. La verdadera identidad del ladrón era el dueño de una tienda de pelucas. La razón por la que robaba el cabello de otros era para venderlo, ya que el cabello procesado por él era más hermoso y atractivo que antes. Para evitar que la dueña original reconociera su cabello, el ladrón rediseñaba el peinado. Incluso usaba planchas para transformar los rizos finos en ondas sueltas. Finalmente, lo teñía de un rojo brillante. El resultado podía describirse como perfecto para Venderlo a buen precio. El ladrón incluso se cambiaba a un elegante traje de gerente antes de llevar la peluca artística a su tienda. Inesperadamente, justo cuando comenzaba su negocio, la mujer que había perdido su cabello y estaba calva entró a comprar una peluca. De inmediato, eligió el nuevo cabello rojo brillante. Por supuesto, no tenía idea de que era su propio cabello. Solo el dueño, al recibir el dinero, sabía la verdad

When he woke up again, his legs had been burned to charcoal. Pinocchio, I'm sorry. Pinocchio, I'm sorry. Because they were so poor, they couldn't afford to buy another piece of wood for new legs. The little money they had left was for the child to buy textbooks. Nothing was more important than going to school. After thinking long and hard, gepetto finally came up with a perfect win win solution. First, he used the money he planned to buy books with to purchase wood and made new legs for his child. The next day, he ran to the store, hoping to get the textbooks on credit from the owner. But the owner wasn't that kind hearted. Gepetto had to take off his coat, then took off another one. A plan to use these to pay for the textbooks. It was the cold winter. Out of respect for his fatherly love, the owner agreed to the deal. So Geppetto finally fulfilled his wish of sending his son to school. But Pinocchio would never obey obediently. He seemed compliant and well behaved on the surface, but he had already been plotting other things in his heart. Geppetto took him to the school gate and watched him go inside. Unexpectedly. As soon as Geppetto left, Pinocchio slipped out. First, Pinocchio went to the store and sold the book back to the owner. Then he used the Money to buy a ticket and entered the puppet theater. However, an accident happened to Pinocchio during this time. By the time school ended in the evening, Geppetto hadn't waited for his son to come out. So he went forward to ask the teacher, but the teacher said there was no child named Pinocchio in the school, let alone one made of wood. Geppetto panicked instantly and didn't know what to do. From that moment on, he embarked on a difficult and long journey to find his son. On the other side, Pinocchio was running for his life. The people behind were chasing him closely. At the end of the road was what looked like an abandoned castle. He ran forward and banged on the door frantically, hoping that someone inside would let him in to hide. Fortunately, a girl opened the window above, but what the girl said left Pinocchio confused. Ma come nessuno ti vedo, ti prego aprimi sono morta anche Io ma come morta. In the end, Pinocchio was still abducted by the bad guys. They hung the piece of wood from a tree. Only now did he miss his father. Early the next morning, a mysterious coachman quietly rescued him and sent him back to the abandoned castle from the night before. The girl wasn't human either, but the blue haired fairy.

Mientras su amiga desbordaba sus problemas, lucy utilizaba una computadora para estudiar rápidamente todo el conocimiento teórico relacionado con el desarrollo cerebral. Cuando finalmente terminó de estudiar las teorías, utilizó la telequinesis para llamar al profesor norman, un líder mundial en la ciencia del cerebro. El profesor claramente no podía creer que ella hubiera pasado por más de 6000 de sus artículos en solo unos minutos. Lucy le ofreció recitarlos en el acto y le dijo que se encontrara con ella. A 11h. El profesor estaba atónito. Lucy proyectó su imagen en la pantalla de televisión y le dijo al profesor que había absorbido una gran cantidad de cph 4 sintético y que su tasa de utilización cerebral había alcanzado el 28%. Esto probaba la teoría del profesor. Cuando el cerebro alcanza un 20% de utilización, rompe todas las barreras como fichas de dominó, dijo lucy. Ella ya no sentía dolor, miedo, deseo ni otras emociones. Incluso. Su humanidad estaba desapareciendo gradualmente. Estaba perdida y buscaba el consejo del profesor. Él le indicó que el propósito de la vida era transmitir el conocimiento que uno había aprendido. No existía un objetivo más alto, así que debía, como cualquier célula, pasar su conocimiento. En ese momento, el profesor iluminó completamente a lucy. No solo debía transmitir el conocimiento a la humanidad, sino también encontrar la manera de romper las Cadenas del tiempo, lucy le dijo que iría a verlo en 12 horas. Rápidamente se dirigió al aeropuerto y utilizó la telequinesis para hacer una llamada, contactando al jefe de policía local en parís. Lucy ordenó al jefe de policía que se sentara de inmediato y escribiera cada palabra que ella dijera. Le informó que 3 criminales con una gran cantidad de drogas pronto pasarían por el aeropuerto de parís. Ordenó a la policía que arrestara a los criminales y esperara a que ella llegara en su vuelo. El jefe de policía estaba completamente incrédulo, pero cuando siguió las instrucciones de lucy para obtener la información de los criminales, los encontró en el aeropuerto. Como ella había dicho, la policía arrestó a los 3 criminales al instante. Mientras tanto, lucy subió al avión. Estaba absorbiendo rápidamente todo el conocimiento de la humanidad desde internet, dominándolo en solo unos minutos. El desarrollo de su cerebro se disparó al 40% en un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Pero entonces ocurrió una escena extraña. Sus dientes comenzaron a caerse y su piel empezó a pudrirse. En ese momento, recordó la teoría del profesor. Si el entorno no es lo suficientemente favorable, las células optarán por la inmortalidad. Corrió al baño, ya que debido al aumento drástico de la utilización de su cerebro, su cuerpo ya no podía mantener su forma física normal y estaba a punto de alcanzar un estado crítico. Rápidamente, recuperó el resto del cph 4 y lo devoró frenéticamente pronto Su apariencia comenzó a recuperarse, pero entonces su cuerpo se desintegró en cenizas y humo. El avión aterrizó pronto en el aeropuerto de parís. El oficial de policía río se enteró por las azafatas sobre los extraños cambios en el cuerpo de lucy. Los médicos le dijeron a río que lucy estaba en coma, sin saber que después del impulso del cph 4, el desarrollo de su cerebro había aumentado al 50 por 100, permitiéndole reestructurar y controlar su estructura molecular y reconstruir su cuerpo. Cuando estaba a punto de escapar del hospital, el pasillo ya estaba rodeado por innumerables oficiales de policía.

Aferrada a un trozo de madera. Derivó corriente abajo, pero un rock en el agua le dislocó accidentalmente el hombro. Al ver esto, el desarrollador dirigió a sus hombres para perseguirla corriente abajo. Finalmente, logró alcanzar la orilla, encontró una piedra, la presionó contra su brazo y empujó con fuerza, estableciendo su hombro dislocado. Luego recogió algunas hierbas, las masticó y aplicó la pulpa sobre la herida para detener el sangrado. Estas eran las habilidades de supervivencia de la joven India. Usando los materiales a su alcance, fabricó un arco y flechas y cubrió las puntas con veneno para prepararse para el contraataque. Usó humo como cebo para atraer al grupo del desarrollador. Escondida en la oscuridad, tensó su arco y disparó una flecha, impactando a un mercenario en la pierna. El grupo del desarrollador levantó sus armas y disparó, pero no acertaron nada. La persiguieron hasta un puente colgante, pero ella ya había desaparecido. Caminaron sobre el puente sin darse cuenta de que ella se escondía debajo. Secretamente cortó las cuerdas con un cuchillo.

Ella pateó enviando el cuchillo del enemigo volando, y luego rodeó el cuello del enemigo con sus piernas, causándole asfixia temporal. Finalmente, la pateó en el abdomen, enviándola al río. El enemigo pronto nadó hasta la orilla Y discutió estrategias para lidiar con ella. Ella no los mató de inmediato porque necesitaba seguirlos para encontrar su campamento. Se coló en el campamento, se acercó a la parte trasera de una tienda y escuchó el verdadero propósito de estos desarrolladores turísticos bajo la fachada, desarrollar un sitio escénico. Los desarrolladores habían ofrecido a la joven y a su abuela 50 millones de dólares para comprar su tierra. En realidad, habían descubierto grandes cantidades de tierras raras bajo el pueblo indio y planeaban extraerlas para obtener enormes ganancias. Ella usó su teléfono para grabar todas las pruebas criminales desde fuera de la tienda, pero cuando regresó al pueblo para exponerlos, encontró su casa quemada y a su abuela cubierta con una sábana blanca, siendo llevada a una ambulancia. Ahora decidió vengarse a su manera

Sin imaginar que la mujer había recuperado el oído, planeaba vengarse. La mujer fingió no darse cuenta del complot entre su esposo y su hermana y les preguntó con calma qué era lo que había ocurrido. La hermana, que deseaba secretamente su muerte, fingió preocuparse por su seguridad mientras los dos malintencionados discutían abiertamente cómo matarla. Siguiendo la sugerencia de la hermana, el esposo llevó un cuenco de sopa de pollo, diciendo que era para ayudarla a recuperarse. Sabiendo que la sopa estaba envenenada, la mujer intentó buscar una excusa para evitar tomarla, pero la hermana insistió en que la necesitaba para recuperarse del susto. Al ver el cuenco envenenado, la mujer se puso tan nerviosa como un gato sobre un tejado caliente, viendo que su secreto, haber recuperado el oído fuera descubierto y arruinara su plan de venganza. En su desesperación, fingió haberse quemado con la sopa y terminó volcándola por todas partes. La hermana se enfureció, pero no tuvo más remedio que dejar que la mujer se fuera a descansar y se ofreció a limpiar el desastre. Cuando la mujer se dio la vuelta para marcharse, la Hermana tomó un cuchillo e intentó matarla de inmediato, pero fue detenida por el esposo, que había notado su comportamiento extraño y sospechaba que quizá había recuperado la audición para comprobar si seguía fingiendo ser sorda. La hermana destruyó cruelmente la figura en sombra de su difunto padre. La mujer ardía de rabia por dentro, pero siguió fingiendo ser sorda y muda para no despertar más sospechas. Entonces, cuando escuchó un secreto estremecedor, el hombre sabía que ella era una rica heredera antes del matrimonio y había montado toda una historia romántica para seducirla, haciéndola caer ciegamente en sus manos.

Primero tenía que sobrevivir para poder vengarse. La villa estaba llena de secuaces del hombre, así que tenía que encontrar una forma de escapar. Mientras buscaba desesperadamente una solución, escuchó a su marido y a su hermana planear de nuevo su muerte, que la aterrorizó tanto que cerró su puerta con llave. Luego arrojó agua sobre un enchufe, provocando un apagón en toda la villa mientras los dos conspiraban en la oscuridad, el timbre sonó de repente.

El novio era un respetado comerciante de joyas y a la madre de Esther le gustó. Al día siguiente, ella envió un lujoso vestido de novia. Su abuela le enseñó que después del matrimonio, Esther debía someterse completamente a su esposo, quien se convertiría en el centro de su vida. Por primera vez, Esther vio a su prometido Yankee el día antes de la boda. Externamente parecía ser modesto y Cortés, pero en cada palabra suya siempre mencionaba a su madre.

Looking at the shabby food in front of him, he felt disgusted, having been used to gourmet delicacies. That's when his sister stepped in to set him straight. Only then did Jack give in. He scooped up a spoonful of spicy kimchi. After one bite, he was stunned. He thought it tasted even better than what professional chefs made. I'm sure Muggins did. You guys chill out. His sister quickly took a taste, but found it tasted the same as usual. And that wasn't all. Their son, who used to hate comics, now loved reading them. It turned out that Jack used to hide and read them in secret under his father's strict control. Now he could finally read them openly. His family thought he was acting even stranger. The next morning, the boy woke up with a start, then began to panic. After calming down, he realized this man wasn't his real father. His parents thought he had a nightmare and tried to comfort him. Jack started going to school like a normal kid. As he was leaving, his father suddenly called out to him. Even though the family was poor, he still received some pocket money when he got to school. The rich kid who used to bully Jim now turned his attention to Jack. They dragged Jack to his house. But to their surprise, even though Jack had Swapped identities. His intimidating presence remained unchanged. Just a few words were enough to scare them off. But soon they snapped out of it and started beating Jack even harder, even pointed a gun at him. Jack was terrified. Everything they used to do to Jim was now being done to Jack. Fortunately, Jim got word and rushed over just in time. Seeing Jack injured, Jim's eyes turned cold. He grabbed a gun from the shelf, loaded it, and aimed at the guy. The man was so scared, he dropped to his knees, begging for mercy. Jack went home. His mother saw his injuries and asked with concern. He just said he got hurt playing ball. A few days later, his mother got up early to make him seaweed soup. The boy found it very strange. His mother said it was his birthday and gave him a big red envelope. But he refused to take it. Even now, everything still felt unreal to Jack. And his father, wanting to celebrate the boy's birthday, took on extra work at a construction site to earn money and bought him a birthday cake. The boy was overjoyed when he saw the cake.

And in Eritrea, becoming a sorceress isn't a dream. It's a trial by death. Just moments ago, I watched our instructor raise her hand ever so gently, and the girls beside me vanished. Their bodies twisted, shrank, and turned into slippery, writhing eels on the floor. That was the fate of every girl who failed the exam. A few days earlier, the Siah gave us our test. Capture lightning in a bottle. One mistake and you'd end up like those eel. The first girl step forward, her hands shaking, the lightning struck, and she collapsed. Instant on, the second girl succeeded. For about a heartbeat, her bottle flashed white and a surge of chaos her apart. Then it was my turn. Your turn? I raised my bottle, trying to steady my breath. But the lightning didn't wait. Slammed into me before I even spoke, the spell throwing me against the wall while electric red wrapped around my wrists. I watched another girl succeed effortlessly, and the scene felt almost magical. Magical in a way I could never reach to. Sisi praised her, calling her the strongest among the weak. Then she looked at me with nothing but cold disappointment. I refused to accept that. I tried forcing the chaos inside me to obey, to show her I was worth something. But Tesiah stopped me instantly, swatting a moth away from a flame. When the test ended, only two girls survived their attempt. The rest disappeared. That night, I heard footsteps, so I followed down into the water chamber, and what I saw froze. My heart failed. Girl

Se apresura hacia el conductor pidiendo ayuda, diciendo que el hombre rico dentro es un asesino retorcido. Pero lisa no tiene idea de que esta mujer es en realidad la novia del hombre rico. Antes de que lisa pueda reaccionar, la mujer saca un arma de su bolso y se la apunta. Lisa es capturada y arrastrada de vuelta a la casa. El hombre rico herido también aparece. Al ver esto, lisa solo puede suplicar que la dejen ir, prometiendo que nunca le contará a nadie. Pero el hombre rico no responde en absoluto. Al comprender la situación, lisa usa la grabación en su teléfono para amenazarlo. Dice que si no la deja ir, subirá el video a la nube para que todo lo vea. Incluso si muere, la gente sabrá quién es el asesino. Inesperadamente, el hombre rico permanece tranquilo. Levanta lentamente la pistola tranquilizante y dispara. Lisa sin dudarlo, lisa cae al suelo, incapaz de moverse de inmediato. El hombre rico lata una cama de metal y la empuja hacia el laboratorio aterrador. A primera hora de la mañana siguiente, jack regresa a casa. Él es el novio de lisa. Ambos habían estado en la mansión durante 7 días, mientras el hombre rico estaba afuera. Jack no tiene idea de lo que pasó la noche anterior, ni de que el hombre rico regresó antes. Lo primero que hace al entrar es gritar el Nombre elisa, pero por más que llama no obtiene respuesta. Jack piensa que elisa se está escondiendo. Para asustar al no encontrar a nadie en el cuarto de almacenamiento, sube lentamente las escaleras.

Jack se cuela en la habitación y toma la pistola que está junto a la bañera. Exige saber dónde está lisa. Al ver que tiene un arma, la mujer no se atreve a resistirse y finge que lo llevará a encontrarla. Pero antes de que lleguen lejos, la mujer juega sucio. Durante la lucha por la pistola, jack la arroja con fuerza y ella cae sobre un objeto afilado cercano. Queda empalada y muere al instante. El ruido atrae de inmediato al hombre rico. Jack lo obliga a llevarlo hasta lisa y la encuentran encerrada en el laboratorio. Pero extrañamente, solo jack aparece y tiene rasguños en la cara. Lisa no puede preocuparse por eso.

Abren otra sala de vidrio con una tarjeta de acceso, pero justo cuando están a punto de salir, jack apunta la pistola a lisa. Ella lo mira incrédula y pregunta qué está haciendo. Jack dice que está cansado de ser pobre. Quiere entregar las grabaciones del laboratorio ilegal al hombre rico a cambio de 1000000 de dólares. Lisa queda atónita, pero no importa lo que diga, jack exige que le entregue el teléfono si quiere sobrevivir. El hombre rico entra, abre el teléfono y le muestra a lisa cómo compró a jack con un alto precio. Antes de que el video termine, la mujer mutante, atada detrás de jack, lo agarra del cuello. Lisa aprovecha la oportunidad para correr, pero el hombre rico no la persigue. Con calma toma el arma y termina con jack. El hombre rico ya había planeado todo. Había retirado la tarjeta del ascensor. No hay manera de que lisa escape. Todas las salidas están bloqueadas. Se siente indefensa. Lisa regresa al laboratorio dispuesta a negociar con el hombre rico.

Claramente drogado. Lisa finalmente revela la verdad. Usó su propio parche tranquilizante pegado en la parte trasera del teléfono. Nunca esperaba que funcionara tan bien. Solo alguien como él podría crear Algo tan efectivo, un verdadero profesional que nunca imaginó que terminaría así

Mary watched in excitement. Her beautiful face, now 11 out of 10, morphed into a sausage shaped mouth. This voluptuous transformation only fueled the goblin to keep casting more spells. Mary, whose body was inflating so quickly she could no longer stand, stumbled toward the door trying to escape, but her hips had grown so enormous that she got stuck in the door frame, rendering her immobile. Just as Mary was about to burst out of the house, the goblin quickly opened its magical umbrella. In the next second, Mary's clothes exploded apart and the goblin cracked a satisfied grin. No one knew that this goblin was actually a sealed evil spirit which had existed in the form of a statue until recently. Two days earlier, a customer had sold the statue to the shopkeeper, Jimmy. After the customer left, the greedy Jimmy casually removed the ceiling necklace from the statue's neck. The moment the spell was broken, the goblin revived instantly. By the time Jimmy turned back to check, the goblin had vanished without a trace, leaving behind a bucket full of gold coins in its place. As Jimmy celebrated this unexpected windfall, the goblin suddenly leapt from the shadows and bit him hard. Frightened Jimmy scrambled into hiding, but his greed never faded. He was soon lured back by the bucket of gold while distracted. By the coins, the goblin quietly manipulated a statue in the shop, pointing its arrow directly at him. After being tormented by the goblin and on the verge of death, Jimmy managed to pull out the ceiling necklace just in time, temporarily driving the evil spirit back.

She wanted to end her life so she could be with her late husband again. Lying in bed, she tightly held her photo and passed away silently. At that moment, her soul detached from her body. Suddenly, a blinding light appeared. It was a door. And from it emerged the Grim Reaper, holding its scythe. Before leaving, the old woman made one last request. She wanted to see her husband again. Death agreed, and together they started walking toward the gates of heaven. Just then, a hand pulled her back. It was the doctor's hand. She had been revived at the last second. On the other side, the Grim Reaper stood frozen, completely confused. When it saw the old woman breathing again in the yard, it became furious. It returned, snatched her soul once more. But the doctor noticed her heart had stopped again. He put on his gloves and used the defibrillator. Just as death thought the job was done, the old woman disappeared once again. Over and over, death tried to take her. And over and over, the doctor brought her back. Finally, a nurse even managed to hide her. That was the last straw. Curious death raised its scythe and took her soul once more. Only to realize it had trapped a fish. The doctor rushed to an elevator and death dashed to another on the opposite side. The doctor refused to give up. He believed the old woman Would live. Meanwhile, death began to lose patience. Its shift was almost over. They ended up in the morgue, and death raised its side again. But every time it got close for the final blow, the doctor interrupted. Finally, death managed to catch the old woman's soul, but the doctor revived her once again. Just then, both saw her at the end of the hall, sitting in a wheelchair at the top of a steep staircase. They both froze. Then they rushed forward. He's trying to claim her! In the chaos, the wheelchair slipped and the old woman rolled down the stairs. Death and the doctor ran after her, crashing into each other in a heap. In the end, all three fell back into the same small room. Death scratched its head, looked at the time, and let out a sigh of frustration. Finally, it gave up and decided to let the old woman stay.

Dejó que el pescador la atrapara a propósito. Después de ser enviada al mercado de mariscos, un chef local compró esta langosta, pero al prepararla, descubrió un líquido desconocido que salía de la parte inferior. El chef volteó la langosta para investigarlo, pero en el siguiente segundo, el chef, al ser rociado en la cara, perdió todo interés en trabajar, así que llamó directamente a su asistente para que limpiara. Pero el asistente, queriendo liberar una mano para limpiar la mesa, casualmente le entregó la langosta a la aprendiz femenina que estaba a su lado, y cuando la aprendiz aplastó la langosta, también la roció por completo. Pero no pensó mucho en ello. Viendo que la langosta ya había sido arrastrada por el desagüe, se alejó sin saber que esta acción provocaría una gran catástrofe para toda la ciudad. Esa noche, el chef de repente se sintió débil mientras trabajaba. Pensó que simplemente no había descansado lo suficiente, así que decidió irse temprano y regresar a casa, pero se desmayó a medio camino, perdiendo la fuerza en sus piernas, sangre negra salió de su boca y murió en el acto, y el asistente, que también había tocado la langosta, fue enviado a la UCI al día siguiente. Ante tales síntomas extraños, los médicos no sabían qué hacer. Solo pudieron ver cómo moría de dolor. Entonces, para encontrar la causa, la doctora Ana fue a hablar con El gerente del restaurante, pero él tampoco sabía nada. Solo sabía que el chef había manejado una langosta ese día y que el asistente y la aprendiz tiraron la langosta al triturador. Después de eso, los dos murieron trágicamente y la aprendiz restante llamó enferma esa mañana. Al escuchar esto, Ana pidió inmediatamente la dirección de la aprendiz. Quería preguntarle algunos detalles, pero la persona ya había muerto y la causa fue exactamente la misma que la de los otros dos, así que estaba claro que la causa tenía que ser la langosta. Ana tomó inmediatamente la sangre del asistente muerto, la puso sobre un portaobjetos, luego cortó su dedo y mezcló su propia sangre con ella bajo el microscopio. Descubrió que la sangre del asistente estaba llena de bacterias bibliomarinas que devoraban constantemente las células sanguíneas. La velocidad era tan rápida que incluso Ana sintió escalofríos. Pero más que eso, se sentía confundida, porque el cuerpo humano tiene inmunidad natural contra los vibriones y, según los registros anteriores, no hay bacterias vibrio en el océano que puedan matar a los humanos. Pero esta cepa era extremadamente extraña. Podía evadir los ataques de los glóbulos blancos y cuando se mezclaba con la sangre humana, producía toxinas. Ana se alegró de haberlo encontrado a tiempo. De lo contrario, si se propagaba, las consecuencias serían inimaginables. Pero nunca imaginó que en un lavadero de autos en algún lugar de la ciudad. Un trabajador masculino ya mostraba debilidad en todo su cuerpo. Luego Vomitó sangre negra, se desplomó en el suelo de dolor y comenzaron a aparecer más y más pacientes. Pero lo extraño era que ninguna de estas personas había comido mariscos antes de enfermarse. Justo cuando el asistente estaba abrumado, Ana recordó de repente. El gerente del restaurante dijo que la langosta se tiró al triturador, así que probablemente las bacterias entraron al sistema de agua de la ciudad a través de las alcantarillas. El rostro del asistente se congeló porque en solo una corta llamada telefónica, el número de pacientes casi se había duplicado. Entonces, después de extraer agua del lavadero de autos para confirmar la ruta de transmisión, Ana contactó de inmediato al CDC francés. Les aconsejó que advirtieran al público de hervir el agua y suspendieran temporalmente toda la pesca costera en todo el país. Pero esta medida afectaría enormemente la economía. Y como ningún otro marisco había mostrado el mismo problema, los superiores no creyeron que la industria pesquera expandiera la propagación de las bacterias, así que rechazaron la propuesta de Ana. Pero lo que nunca imaginaron fue que en la costa de Sudáfrica, al otro lado de Francia, estaba ocurriendo una invasión biológica aún más extraña. Una playa que antes estaba vacía de repente se llenó de millones de cangrejos rosados. El novio vio que la situación era grave. Jaló a la mujer hacia su motocicleta, usó toda su fuerza para pedalear y arrancar, y finalmente despegó antes de que la masa de cangrejos llegara. Pero La masa de cangrejos ya había rodeado toda la ciudad. El novio, mientras esquivaba, perdió el control de la motocicleta. Ambos cayeron al suelo, provocando 1/1 sangre y una doble baja, y en ese momento la masa de cangrejos ya cubría toda la ciudad, tantos que se extendían más allá de la vista. Y eventos similares ocurrieron en múltiples lugares a nivel mundial. Después de ver las noticias, Ana sintió que todo era demasiada coincidencia, primero langostas, luego cangrejos y ambos con virus mortales. Así que al día siguiente hizo traer algunas muestras de cangrejos de la zona del brote. Usó una sierra para abrir el abdomen del cangrejo, tomó algo de líquido del interior y luego lo mezcló con sangre humana bajo el microscopio. Ana se sorprendió. Las bacterias dentro del cangrejo eran idénticas a las de las langostas, y estos cangrejos no tenían ojos, por lo que debían vivir en el mar profundo, lo que teóricamente significa que no pueden sobrevivir en tierra y mucho menos atacar a los humanos. Ana no podía entenderlo hasta que su asistente mencionó casualmente la historia del Éxodo donde Dios envió plagas para salvar a los israelitas. En resumen, era el cielo castigando a los humanos por contaminar el océano. Ana primero lo tomó como una broma, pero como dice el refrán, cuando la ciencia no puede explicar algo, se convierte en metafísica. Ana lo pensó más y más y lo encontró razonable. No hay dioses en el cielo, pero eso no ¿Significa que no haya seres inteligentes en el océano? Los humanos pueden entrenar perros para gestionar otros animales, así que los seres oceánicos podrían hacer lo mismo. Pero esta idea no tenía base científica y el gobierno no lo tomaría en serio

However, that very night after the funeral, the doctors secretly dug up the coffin that had already been buried. It was possible that the woman wasn't actually dead, but when he looked closely inside the coffin, the truth came to light. The one lying there was actually the Doctor's demonic daughter in disguise. It turned out both were shape shifters, able to alter their faces at will. They needed the ancient book passed down through Grace's family. Father and daughter divided the tasks. Again, the doctor focused on mentally pressuring Jared, the twin brother. But Jared clearly remembered the warning from his great aunt, never trust anyone. Taking advantage of the fact that magical creatures fear iron, he baked cakes with iron in them to test everyone around him. Not even his own brother escaped suspicion. Only after confirming his identity with the clan's tongue did Jared feel a little more at ease. Meanwhile, the demonic daughter used her alluring face to emotionally manipulate Simon. When the two brothers were about to open the first secret chamber with a page from the book, a careless phrase from the doctor's daughter gave them an unexpected, decisive clue. The two n s on the door represented the minor and major modes, common way of expressing musical chords. Thanks to this hint, Jared suddenly recalled his great aunt's favorite song. So all the friends, Started singing and dancing together. Their surprise, the great door in the wall slowly opened. But as soon as Jared pulled out the page, the heavy iron door slammed shut with a loud bang. They quickly examined the page and one of the friends instantly recognized the place indicated by the drawing. They rushed out and soon arrived at a large rock by the lake in the park. At that moment, Simon made a shocking discovery. Through a hole in the rock, they could really see magical creatures. The four friends were stunned by the sight. Two unicorns were running and playing by the river. When Jared looked through the stone circle left by his great aunt, he realized that it was actually an eye, a special eye for seeing magical creatures. But that very night, another unexpected event occurred. The brothers returned home excited and found their mother arguing with the grandmother who had come to the funeral. By a series of coincidences, the page they had just found ended up being the object where the grandmother vented her anger. It was then the brothers realized that they could never save the entire village on their own. That night, another small incident happened that accidentally revealed a huge secret. Jared was admitted to the hospital for an arm injury, and there Simon saw the doctor's daughter. He noticed a strange, damp, earthy smell coming from her, but he didn't tell anyone. Simon never would have imagined that the Doctor's Daughter was actually a small demon who could foresee death. Every time she saw someone on the verge of dying, she unknowingly transformed into the image of the deceased at that very moment. The doctor also visited the hospital to check on Jared. Jared seized the opportunity to directly ask for his help, hoping the doctor could clear up all his doubts. But the doctor was thinking about how to get the page. He grabbed a random iron cookie and ate it without a second thought.

Lo encontré en una cafetería, observando a las niñas Con una sonrisa en sus labios, me senté frente a él. Nos conocemos. Nos vimos en la tienda de comestibles el otro día. No lo recuerdo. Le pediste a la hija de mi novia que te ayudara a encontrar los cheerios, ¿verdad? Sí, sí. ¿Qué puedo hacer por ti? Cállate, nathan. Le advertí que se alejara de mis hijos. Esto es un malentendido. Intentó explicarse. Le dije que lo había visto en la playa el día anterior con su cámara. Él explicó que era fotógrafo y que llevar una cámara era completamente normal. Yo sé quién eres, lo que eres. Lo que encontré gracioso fue que él realmente intentó decir que sabía qué había hecho mal, que había pagado su precio y había aprendido la lección. He cambiado. Los deseos no pueden cambiarse así como yo no puedo cambiar mis propios impulsos sanguinarios. Infiltré en su casa en silencio. Estaba concentrado en su pantalla de computadora y no notó mi llegada. Cuando vi lo que estaba mirando. Mi último resquicio de duda desapareció. En la pantalla estaban las imágenes

Flotó río abajo, pero una roca en el agua le dislocó accidentalmente el hombro. Al ver esto, el desarrollador y sus hombres comenzaron a perseguirla río abajo. Finalmente, logró llegar a la orilla. Entonces encontró una piedra, la presionó contra su brazo y la empujó con fuerza, realineando su hombro dislocado. Al final, recogió algunas hierbas, las masticó y aplicó la pulpa sobre la herida para detener la hemorragia. Esa era la habilidad de supervivencia de una chica India. Usando los materiales disponibles, hizo un arco y flecha, y recubrió las puntas de las flechas con veneno para prepararse para el contraataque. Usó el humo como señuelo para atraer al grupo del desarrollador. Escondiéndose en la oscuridad, tensó el arco y disparó una flecha, midiendo un mercenario en la pierna. El grupo del desarrollador levantó sus armas y disparó, pero no acertaron en nada. La persiguieron hasta un puente colgante, pero ella ya había desaparecido. Caminaron sobre el puente sin saber que ella se encontraba debajo de él. Secretamente, cortó las cuerdas con un cuchillo justo cuando varios de ellos estaban a punto de llegar al centro del puente. Cortó las cuerdas completamente. Dos mercenarios cayeron al río. La mercenaria femenina intentó defenderse. Dio una patada enviando el cuchillo del enemigo volando. Luego le rodeó el cuello con las piernas, provocando que la enemiga sufriera asfixia temporalmente. Realmente la pateó en el abdomen Haciéndola caer al río, la enemiga pronto nadó hacia la orilla y discutió estrategias para lidiar con ella. No los mató de inmediato porque necesitaba seguirlos para encontrar su campamento. Se infiltró en el campamento, se arrastró hasta la parte trasera de una tienda y escuchó la verdadera intención de estos desarrolladores turísticos. Bajo el pretexto de desarrollar un lugar turístico, los desarrolladores le habían ofrecido a la chica y a su abuela 50 millones de dólares por su tierra. En realidad, habían descubierto una gran cantidad de tierras raras bajo la aldea India y planeaban extraerlas para obtener enormes ganancias. Usó su teléfono fuera de la tienda para grabar toda la evidencia criminal, pero cuando regresó a la aldea para exponerlos, encontró su hogar quemado y a su abuela cubierta con una tela blanca, siendo llevada en una ambulancia. Ahora decidió vengarse por su cuenta

After pounding it for ages with no reaction, they simply hauled the strange object back to their village. This bizarre contraption quickly drew crowds, and people not only posed for photos, but even dared to sit right on top of it. Then a clueless villager suggested trading the metal lump to the Japanese soldiers for food. Worried the soldiers might cheat them on the weight, they even weighed the bomb ahead of time. In those chaotic wartime days, the bomb somehow became the village's beacon of hope. Even the elders lit incense, praying the gods would help them sell it for a fortune. Soon they began transporting the bomb, but on the hanging bridge, they ran into a funeral procession. The clairvoyant monk took one look at what they were carrying and staggered backward in terror. The old bridge couldn't handle so many people, shaking violently until the cart holding the bomb collapsed. Fortunately, the bomb itself remained intact, so the villagers hoisted it onto their shoulders and pushed on. Days later, they finally reached their destination. The moment the Japanese soldiers saw the bomb, their expressions froze. They barked orders at the villagers to take it away immediately, without delay. To prove the bomb was perfectly fine, the villagers began hammering on it like madmen. The scene terrified the Japanese, who drew their weapons and shouted For the villagers to drag the bomb to the ocean and destroy it at once. Though reluctant, the villagers had no choice but to hurl the bomb into the sea under threat. With a thunderous blast, the bomb detonated. But by sheer luck, a massive school of fish floated up. The villagers lit up with excitement, rushing forward to scoop up the unexpected haul.

When his older brother woke up, he discovered that every fish he'd raised for three years was floating dead. Furious, the older brother stormed to their mom to complain. But shockingly, their mother didn't scold the younger boy. She chased the older one instead. She even warned him that if he dared to pick on the little one again, she'd smash all his fighting crickets. The older brother swallowed the injustice and stayed silent. The next day, the little boy tried to sneak into his brother's room to cause more trouble, but he found three heavy locks installed on the door, so he went straight to his sister's room and stole every one of her goldfish. When the sister came home, she immediately noticed they were gone. She searched everywhere, and after seeing the picture frame on the cabinet, she instantly knew her younger brother took them. Meanwhile, the boy was holding the goldfish in his hands, inviting his friends over for a barbecue. While everyone was enjoying the food, the sister appeared, gripping a shovel with fire in her eyes. The boy bolted, sprinting for his life, and she chased him relentlessly, but he was too fast and she couldn't catch up. Just as she was about to give up and head home, she spotted him climbing onto the roof. She told him to get down, but he stubbornly refused. So she angrily went to complain to Their mother. Yet their mother refused to intervene. Instead, she asked if the sister had hurt the boy. To her, the two goldfish were nothing worth getting upset about. But the sister felt deeply wronged. Those goldfish were a gift from the boy she liked. As they argued, an uncle walked in carrying the younger boy. The sister grabbed the shovel again, ready to confront him.

Yet the mother's blatant favoritism left a fire burning in her heart. She decided it was time to teach her little brother a real lesson.

He aimed the blade at the bad tooth, propped it in place, picked up a rock and smashed it down hard. The intense pain made him pass out on the spot. When he woke up, he got ready to open the packages, hoping to find something useful. The first box had a bunch of videotapes. Second had a volleyball. The third had a pair of roller skates, which he used to smash open coconuts. Then he found a long dress. He tore the bottom part and turned it into a fishing net. He caught a small fish, but the fishy smell was so strong he couldn't bring himself to eat it. So he tried to make fire by rubbing sticks together. He accidentally cut his hand, and in frustration, he smashed things all around him. After calming down, he noticed the handprint on the volleyball. He drew a face on it and named it Wilson.

One day, he found a metal sheet floating on the sea, blown in by the wind. Seeing it gave him an idea. He started chopping trees, gathering sticks, and twisting bark into rope. He even ripped up the videotapes to make more rope. But it still wasn't long enough. He looked at Wilson, not wanting to hear what it had to say. Yeah, I know. I know where there's 30 feet of extra rope. But I'm not going back up there. Still, he climbed to the top of the mountain and took down the rope he once planned to use to end his life. Before leaving, he dressed Wilson up, carved a message on the rock wall, and tied Wilson to the front of the raft. He also brought along the one package he had never opened. He set out to sea, facing the wind and waves. He wasn't afraid. He even encouraged Wilson to survive the storm together. When a huge wave came, he untied the rope and raised the sail. The raft made it through the storm. They floated on the sea. When it rained, he used coconut shells to collect water. He caught fish to eat and proudly showed the fish to Wilson. But at night, another storm hit. The sail was blown away. The man held Wilson tightly as the raft drifted with the waves. When he woke up, Wilson had Been blown into the ocean. He jumped into the water right away and swam after it. But the farther he swam, the more he fell behind. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wilson. He climbed back onto the raft in despair, threw away the paddle and collapsed. At that moment, a ship rumbled past. He reached out his arms. He was finally rescued.

Hace ruidos extraños para asustarlas o pasa flotando cerca de ellas justo lo suficiente para que sientan un escalofrío. Incluso en el día más caluroso del verano. Pensaba que su vida siempre sería así, hasta que un día un chico de su misma edad se mudó. Mientras limpiaba su cuarto. Cole encontró un compartimiento oculto. Dentro había un álbum de fotos rojo. Estaba lleno de fotos de una chica desde el día en que nació hasta sus años de secundaria. Pero después de eso, las páginas estaban en blanco. La chica en las fotos era b. Ella murió justo después de que se tomó la última foto. Eso es privado, señor. B estaba claramente molesta porque cole había estado ojeando. Su álbum cerraba de golpe una y otra vez en el proceso, un anillo salió de entre las páginas y cayó al suelo. Cole no lo notó hasta la mañana siguiente, cuando lo pisó sin querer. Curioso, lo recogió y se lo puso en el dedo. Fue entonces cuando Bea apareció. ¿Es ese el anillo que me quité? ¿Qué me viste? Me viste. Cole se dio cuenta de la verdad.

The four thieves touched down on the rooftop and instantly took out the officers chasing them. Then they slipped straight into the hotel. Their hacker partner erased every trace of them from the security feed. By the time the police arrived, the group had already switched into entirely different disguises. To keep the escape flawless, the hacker shut down the building's entire surveillance network. Without any digital tools left, the lead detective ordered every agent to activate their body cam. They were told to film every face they saw and run them through AI recognition. At the tensest moment, the mastermind behind the operation quietly entered the hotel. Disguised as a waiter. He observed everything from the shadows. One thief dressed as a laundry worker caught the attention of a hotel guard. The mastermind instantly told him through the earpiece to hide in the locker room. Seeing the guard closing in, the mastermind reacted on instinct. He flicked a pen under a food cart rolling toward them. Plates crashed across the floor, pulling the guards focus away. The thief used that window to change clothes and stroll past the guard like nothing happened. With the mastermind's guidance, the group dodged every threat. But at that exact moment, the detective recalled a critical Detail, the guy at the corner wore the same earring as the thief she fought in the elevator. She instantly turned around and sprinted after him. Hearing this through the covert earpiece, the mastermind realized the thief's identity had been exposed. He immediately ordered another member to cover him.

The brown bear lunged in, devouring the honey. It didn't even spare the boar's meat. Annoyed that the bear hadn't waited, he grew furious. He grabbed a chunk of honey and turned to leave. But the bear trailed after him. The two wandered to the river bank to wash up. Suddenly, the tall grass rustled violently. The bear signaled him to hide behind its body. He spotted his mentor, the black panther. Overjoyed, he ran to it, proudly showing the food he gathered with tools. But the panther was enraged. It scolded him for disturbing the forest's natural order and even threatened to send him back to the human tribe. He climbed a tree in protest, only to be snatched by a sudden hand. The monkey troop whisked him through the tree tops. Then the gibbons hurled him into the air. Panther chased swiftly, but the river cut off its path. He landed on a mountain peak and saw a human built palace below. The monkeys shoved him inside. A massive hand reached out from the shadows. He backed away in fear, realizing it was the Monkey King. The king tossed him fruit, demanding he teach them how to make fire. But he was raised by wolves. He knew nothing about fire. The Monkey King stomped the ground. Furious, he stammered, I can't stop forcing me! Brown Bear suddenly appeared, boasting about the Monkey King's strength. Drawing the king's interest away, he then saw the panther signaling him to escape. He slipped out while the king was distracted. But one monkey spotted them. The small one yelled to the larger one. They sprinted faster as the entire troop charged after them. The boy ran, desperately checking if the big monkey was closing in. The large monkey grabbed the palace wall and instantly blocked his path. He risked a leap out of the palace, landing on a tree outside. The Monkey King couldn't dodge in time. He watched as the collapsing palace buried the Monkey King beneath the rubble.

But the moment she reached the bottom and turned around, she froze. She was staring straight at a corpse. Shaking with fear, she scrambled out and called the police. A forensic expert descended into the well to examine the remains. He noticed the part of the skull pressed against the stone had turned in a very shade of green. Looking closer, he found several coins fused directly into the bone. Hodgins concluded that the well had been dug through Limestone and over time an electrochemical reaction caused the coins to melt with the skeletal tissue. Meanwhile, investigators spotted drag marks leading right to the well's opening, along with an iron grate crushed inward by force. Together, the evidence pointed clearly to murder and a body dumped down the shaft. The examiner also noted heavy strain on the victim's shoulder, damage usually seen in competitive swimmers with overdeveloped muscle groups. Angela matched the remains through the missing person's database. The victim was Daniel, head swim coach at a local community college. His wife was devastated by the news and had no idea who would want him dead. The intern then found multiple paramodum fractures around the ninth left rib and near the humerus, while the L3 and L4 vertebrae showed signs of complete shattering. Injuries like these would have left Daniel unable to move at all. Investigators visited the swim team for leads, where they met coach Avery A female swimmer and Osborne, who had just climbed out of the pool and seemed nearly deaf. When police suggested Osborne might have killed Daniel over some conflict, Avery instantly pushed back. He insisted Daniel had been nothing but a mentor to them. He'd even helped both him and Osborne earn full university scholarships. Looking through Daniel's spending records, investigators discovered he ate at the same restaurant every Friday exactly during the hours his wife work. That hinted at a possible secret affair. That night, they visited the restaurant, but strangely, no one there recognized him at all. Just as confusion set in, the female investigator turned and spotted a nightclub down the street. She realized that was where Daniel had actually been spending his Friday nights. Inside, they found the club filled entirely with male performers dressed as women, and Daniel had been one of their featured acts. Hodgins later found copper zinc alloy fragments in the L3 and L4 brakes, along with traces of common plastic on the humerus. Together, the materials matched the makeup of a drainage pipe, meaning Daniel had been struck with one. Angela reviewed footage from across the street and captured Daniel arguing with another man, the investigation revealed.

She wanted her lover's name finished. What name should we ink? Robert. Robert, is there a problem? No. No. Well, I never expected she'd betray me while I was away serving. I angrily threw the flowers I had brought into the trash. This will be our third anniversary. Ouch. I'm sorry. It's a particularly painful spot. She didn't notice anything strange. I asked her, are you planning to marry Robert? She said no. She still had a husband in the military. I asked her again, why don't you just divorce your husband? Why would I do that? My husband takes care of me. Robert doesn't even know. That's when I finally realized it was all about my money. I decided to give her a little punishment. I told her to finish the tattoo and said, your lover will be so happy. I was about to leave, but when I opened the door, I saw someone looking for my wife. Suddenly, I had an idea, so I quietly hid while she wasn't looking. Soon the person came in with flowers. I thought they were just friends. But then Robert knelt down and pulled out a diamond ring to propose. To my wife is, is it a diamond? Yeah. Where did you get the money for that? Well, I saved up some money so I could get you the best one. So what do you say? I quickly called my wife to make sure Robert didn't find out she was already married. My wife rushed out saying she was going to the bathroom. She ran to the bedroom, lay down, pretending to be at home, and then answer my video call. The first question I asked her was, do you love me? Of course not, honey. You know you're my one and only. Oh, my god. Did you hear everything? Yeah, I heard every word she said. My wife realized something was wrong. She rushed into the room and saw both of us standing there. She tried to explain, but no one believed her. I told her, look at the tattoo on your thigh. It says liar. Finally, I threw away the wedding ring I'd worn for eight years and ended everything for good.

Un rugido aterrador resonó desde dentro de la red y el veterano pescador enseguida sintió que algo no iba bien. Ningún pez grande podía romper una red de esa manera. Aun así, no comprendió la gravedad del hallazgo, pensando que solo habían capturado una especie extraña de las profundidades. Lo que no imaginaron fue que una guerra entre la tierra y el mar acababa de comenzar. Días después, los militares compraron el cadáver de la criatura. En los antiguos relatos se la llamaba demonio marino, pero en pleno siglo 21 el general prefería llamarlos hombres de agua. Los biólogos encontraron una perla alrededor de su cuello y sospechaban que funcionaba como una identificación, cifrando datos biológicos esenciales. Siguiendo las órdenes del general, los soldados devolvieron la perla a su sitio. Ahora que sabían de la existencia de otra civilización bajo el mar, la prudencia exigía evitar cualquier provocación. Antes de marcharse, berkeley sintió lástima al verlo suspendido en el vacío, pero como simple auxiliar administrativo, solo pudo ofrecer una plegaria silenciosa. El general, decidido a evitar un conflicto, quería establecer amistad con la civilización oceánica. El departamento de i. D ya había creado un sistema de traducción basado en los órganos vocales del hombre de agua. Aunque todavía en fase de pruebas, podía manejar frases sencillas. Qué fue eso, ¿señor? Un saludo traducido. Y aunque la superficie seguía tranquila, ese mensaje ya Habría llegado a su destino. Solo quedaba esperar la respuesta del océano. Pero esa noche, mientras los soldados se preparaban para dormir, el peligro se acercaba al almacén donde guardaban el cadáver. El cabo morgan y el soldado dular estaban de guardia. Creían que custodiar un pescado salado sería rutinario y más aún con sensores activados en todo el perímetro. Lo que no imaginaron fue que el enemigo atacaría desde el suelo. Morgan se había alejado solo para servirse té cuando notó que la tierra bajo sus pies empezaba a humedecerse. Al principio no comprendieron la amenaza, pero justo cuando dulara intentó agarrar la radio. El piso lo tragó por completo. Morgan entendió por fin que algo iba muy mal y tomó el radio para pedir refuerzos. Las criaturas del agua no pusieron resistencia. Ya habían cumplido su objetivo, los humanos habían matado a uno de los suyos. Para ellos, devolver 2 vidas era justicia. Cuando sonó la alarma, los soldados se equiparon y corrieron a la sala del incidente, pero para su sorpresa, no había señales de lucha, solo cuerpos desaparecidos y un silencio inquietante. Berkeley notó algo sobresaliendo en una esquina, lo tiró y una silla completa salió de la pared. El general sintió que algo iba terriblemente mal. Tomó la radio y gritó el nombre del soldado. Tras el chisporroteo, la voz llegó desde debajo del suelo. El general se arrodilló y volvió a llamarlo. Los peores temores se confirmaron. Nadie quería una guerra, resolver esto pacíficamente Era lo mejor. Berkeley era solo un empleado del departamento de transporte, pero por un error administrativo lo asignaron como agente de la fuerza conjunta. Ahora estaba metido de lleno en la misión y para el general, este recluta inesperado podía convertirse en su arma secreta. Antes de que terminaran de hablar, las alarmas volvieron a sonar en la base. Se había detectado una forma de vida desconocida en la costa. Si su intuición era correcta, debía ser un emisario de los acuáticos. El general se tensó, recordando que podían convertir el suelo en pantano, pero el hecho de que se presentaran abiertamente en lugar de atacar de inmediato indicaba que aún había espacio para negociar. El departamento técnico preparó el sistema para traducir del inglés al lenguaje acuático. Pero como aún fallaba, la asistente pidió al general concentrarse en los puntos clave y evitar su estilo habitual, demasiado largo. Con los ajustes listos, la negociación comenzó. El mensaje del emisario era directo. Los humanos habían matado a sus compañeros y ellos respondieron. El general deseaba vengar a sus soldados, pero comprendía que había mucho más en juego. Propuso un alto el fuego temporal. El emisario aceptó sin dudarlo. Luego, el general presentó varias propuestas de paz y todas fueron aceptadas. Pero cuando parecía que todo estaba resuelto, las siguientes palabras del emisario tensaron el ambiente. Exigía comunicarse con todas las formas de vida terrestres, no solo con los humanos. El general quedó desconcertado. No entendía el método en ese Instante, todos los teléfonos de los soldados comenzaron a emitir alertas. Los acuáticos habían tomado el control de todos los ríos del planeta. Tal vez no buscaba negociación, sino forzar la rendición humana mediante el poder. Al día siguiente, el enviado apareció por fin. Los primeros 4 acuáticos parecían guardias. Después llegaron 2 criaturas con aspecto de bagre, probablemente asistentes, y la figura más sorprendente fue la última, una emisaria cuyo aspecto encajaba claramente con los estándares humanos de belleza. La multitud quedó atónita lo los guardias arrojaron redes con crías acuáticas dentro ante la situación que dio órdenes claras. Es cierto que los humanos cometimos el primer error, pero esta negociación busca que ambas especies puedan convivir en paz en la tierra, nuestro hogar compartido. Pero el mensajero no confiaba en jonathan. Si debía haber negociación, solo sería con la persona que él designara conmigo. Berkeley no entendía nada. Era un hombre común, sin habilidades especiales. ¿Por qué elegirlo? La razón era simple, cuando vio los cuerpos de los guardias acuáticos, él fue el único que mostró compasión en berkeley. Ellos vieron la actitud que cualquier ser vivo merece

Al ver esto, Jack disparó dos veces contra la puerta y al segundo siguiente, la puerta salió volando aterrados. Los secuestradores apuntaron a Jenny. En cuanto Jack vio eso, una furia asesina estalló en él. Jenny parecía muerta de miedo y Jack trató de lanzarse hacia ella justo cuando el secuestrador iba a disparar. Jenny se lanzó contra él con el hombro. El coche se desvió, golpeó la barandilla y cayó al mar. Jenny gritó aterrada, pero Jack la agarró a tiempo. Aún así, ella estaba más preocupada por Jack que por sí misma al llegar a la orilla Jenny se lanzó a sus brazos. Después de todo lo que habían vivido, entendió que no podía seguir sin él.

Al instante, Jack le dijo que no podía permitir que ningún otro hombre la viera así o se pondría celoso. Jenny se quedó helada un momento, preguntándose si Jack realmente sentía algo por ella y en el fondo estaba feliz. Siempre había querido ponerse ese traje de baño para él, pero nunca había tenido la ocasión. Después fueron a la piscina. Jack llevó algunos juguetes que había preparado, pero Jenny se aburrió rápido. Le salpicó agua y le dijo que bajara a jugar con ella. Jack no dudó un segundo, se quitó la camisa y se lanzó.

Jenny volvió a ponerse toda roja. Entonces Jack añadió que Jenny era exactamente su tipo. Al oírlo, el corazón de ella empezó a latir sin control

The president tossed him his I D. Card. After checking it, the boy finally relaxed. He guided the president away from the crash site. Moments later, the traitor's bodyguard arrived with a team of terrorists. But the President had already vanished. The boy continued leading the president down the mountain, where the president spotted the bodies of his security team. Their sabotaged parachutes confirmed the presence of a traitor. Just then, the bodyguard caught up to them. Realizing escape was impossible, the president handed his badge to the boy and told him to run. But the imposter was already closing in. The president raised a submachine gun to push him back, only for the bodyguard to snatch it away with a disgusted glare. The man soon he radioed for a helicopter. The terrorists forced the president into a freezer compartment, but the boy didn't run. He stayed determined to rescue him.

Instead, he quietly slipped off his wedding ring while the doctor examined her. He slid the ring onto Julie's finger. Sir, this isn't a charity clinic. She's my wife. Use our family insurance. Fortunately, the doctor didn't question it. Soon, Julie began to wake under medical care. Hoping to earn her forgiveness, he waited until she was fully conscious, but Julie clearly wanted nothing to do with him. She rejected the meal. He brought without a second thought. Just then, the doctor returned. I need a word with your husband. MI ha. He hasn't left your bedside once. What? He's not mine.

Luckily, he grabbed the railing just in time. Falling off a speeding yacht could easily get you killed by the propeller. Even if you somehow dodge the blades, you'd be stranded in the ocean, waiting to die. He knew the moment he let go it was all over, so he fought to reposition himself, hooking his foot onto the deck. Once he found a foothold, he pulled himself back to the edge and finally escaped disaster. He slumped against the railing, gasping for air, taking a long time to calm down. But then a sharp pain hit his stomach. He knew he couldn't wait any longer, so he rushed into the cabin to find a bathroom, made it to the cramped bathroom and took care of business. But then the door behind him suddenly swung shut on its own. He didn't think much of it, figuring it was just the Sea Breeze. But when he turned around, the window was closed. He realized it wasn't the wind, but he didn't dwell on it. He just opened the window for some fresh air. But when he tried to leave, the door wouldn't budge. He crouched down to check the lock, twisting the handle over and over, but it wouldn't move. He looked for a gap to work with, but the door was sealed too tight. After repeated attempts, he still couldn't get it open. Then He remembered the coin in his pocket. He pulled it out and tried to turn the lock, but that was wishful thinking. He opened the medicine cabinet, looking for something useful. That's when he noticed a bloody handprint inside. He didn't think too much about it. He just grabbed a pair of Scissors and tried to unscrew the lock. Strangely, the Scissors fit the screw perfectly, but the lock seemed welded shut. No matter how hard he pried or twisted, nothing happened. Just as despair set in, he heard a rumbling outside. He looked out the window and saw a ship heading straight toward him with no sign of slowing down. He realized if he didn't stop his boat, they'd both be destroyed. Panicking, he opened the cabinet again and found a metal bottle. He started smashing it against the door handle. The ship kept getting closer. He hit it again and again, but the bottle was too light to do anything. In desperation, he tried kicking the door once, twice, but it still wouldn't move. Frantic, he stuck his arm out the window, waving his shirt wildly to signal for help. But the ship didn't seem to notice and kept its course. As collision seemed inevitable. He pressed his face against the window, trying to squeeze through to get their attention. But the frame was too narrow. His face was crushed against it, the pain unbearable, forcing him to scream and give up. Panic and despair washed over him. He forced himself to calm down and reached out the window again. In his frenzy, he accidentally grabbed a rope. He tested how tight it was, then tied a firm knot and threw it into the sea. His plan was to tangle the propeller and stop the boat. Luckily, the current carried the rope right into the propeller. But the rope tightened too fast. Before he could let go, it wrapped around his neck. Suffocation hit him instantly. Worse, his feet were dangling in the air. His vision started to black out, and he nearly passed out. Fighting to stay conscious, he fumbled around on the deck. Finally, he found a hook. He used it to pry the rope loose, ignoring the pain, twisting his face. After a desperate struggle, he escaped death once again. He collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath. Once he recovered, he realized the danger wasn't over. The momentum had caused a small collision between the boats. The impact knocked him unconscious. He didn't wake up until the ships had drifted far apart. The bad news was, even though the propeller had stopped, the boat had no anchor to hold it in place. It was drifting with the wind, far off his familiar route, heading into unknown water.

Esto debería haber sido motivo de celebración, pero antes de que pudiera decírselo, inesperadamente notó que algo no estaba bien con los niños. Uno de los bebés tenía los ojos muy separados, el puente nasal bajo y los dedos de los pies cortos y grueso. Basándose en sus años de experiencia médica, reconoció estos signos como síntomas del síndrome de Down. Mirando a su esposa, que aún dormía profundamente, Jack tomó una decisión despiadada, abandonar al niño con síndrome de Down. Llamó a una enfermera y le ordenó que llevara al bebé a un orfanato cercano, exigiéndole que mantuviera el secreto. Aunque Lisa sintió una punzada de renuncia, llamó a la puerta del orfanato para conservar su empleo. Sin embargo, al entrar, se quedó paralizada por el horror. 1atm siniestra impregnaba cada rincón y una enfermera estaba reprendiendo a un paciente. Al observar el entorno, Lisa consideró que aquel lugar era un auténtico infierno en la tierra. Incapaz de abandonar al niño, tomó una decisión audaz, apretó al bebé contra su pecho y lo llevó a su coche. Aunque no era suyo, no podía soportar ver cómo se pisoteaba una vida tan joven. Al pasar por una tienda de camino, compró numerosos artículos para bebés y amamantó al niño en el coche. Sin embargo, cuando se dispuso a conducir de vuelta a casa, descubrió que el depósito de combustible estaba vacío en aquel paisaje nevado y helado. Sin encontrar un refugio cálido, el Niño moriría congelado. Justo cuando se encontraba paralizada por la desesperación, un hombre la vio. Al contemplar al bebé en brazos de Lisa, le sugirió que descansara en su coche, aunque Lisa temía que pudiera ser un villano. Por el bien del niño, se armó de valor y subió al coche. Afortunadamente, el hombre no resultó ser un villano. Le preguntó a Lisa su dirección y la llevó a casa. Así fue hasta la mañana siguiente, cuando Lisa se despertó y descubrió que el hombre se había ido. Al darse la vuelta, lo vio cocinando en la cocina. Tal amabilidad conmovió profundamente a Lisa. Después de despedirse con la mano, Lisa dedicó toda su energía a cuidar del niño. Sin embargo, esa misma noche alguien llamó a su puerta. Era Jack. Había venido con dinero para que guardara silencio, pero al oír llorar al bebé durante el interrogatorio de Jack, Lisa le contó lo que había presenciado en el orfanato. Aún así, Jack la reprendió por entrometerse. Al ver la total insensibilidad de Jack, Lisa tomó una decisión desesperada

This made everyone anxious and uneasy. Jack decided to stay there for the night. Next morning, John, struggling to move due to his leg injury, rang the large bell, waking everyone up. He rang it countless times, but no staff appeared and the promised helicopter was nowhere to be seen.

But when the dog returned with it, he had secretly boarded the plane. Upon entering the cabin, he urged the flight attendant to close the door immediately. Only then did the dog realize its owner had abandoned it. The owner expected it to wander off, sadly. But just as the flight attendant announced clearance for takeoff, the dog recklessly dashed in front of the aircraft, trying to block its departure with its own body. The pilot, seeing this, had no choice but to abort the takeoff. When the dog approached the fuselage, barking pleadingly for its owner to take it along, its cries drew the attention of everyone on board. The owner sat coldly in his seat, unmoved. As the plane started its engines again, the dog was left behind for good. Just as it was drowning in sorrow, airport security suddenly rushed over, aggressively attempting to seize it. The dog could only panic and flee desperately. Even after squeezing through a gap in a wire fence to escape, the guards remained in close pursuit. At this critical moment, the dog slipped into an aircraft maintenance hanger. Fortunately, a worker who spotted it didn't raise the alarm, but instead deliberately redirected the security team in the opposite direction. After they left, the mechanic gently placed a bowl of water before the dog, his kind eyes gradually easing its tension. But then the roar of another plane landing. Thundered from the sky, mistaking it for its owner returning, the dog anxiously sprinted back toward the airport. Filled with hope, it waited by the boarding stairs, only to be shooed away by a flight attendant. No sign of its owner, and even have its paw stepped on by a passenger. Still, it stubbornly stayed at the airport, watching plane after plane land, convinced its owner would come back at its presence became a nuisance. With mounting passenger complaints, staff had to call security again. Cornered with no escape, the dog was eventually herded onto a bus by the guards and the door shut. As the security captain assured passengers such incidents wouldn't recur, a boy who had just disembarked watched intently, resolved to save the dog. Seizing a moment of distraction, he sneaked into the bus through a window. But as he neared the dog, it growled warningly, bearing its teeth, yet it never attacked. The instant the door opened, the dog bolted out and vanished into the airport crowds. The infuriated security captain marched toward the boy to scold him, but the mechanic stepped in to intervene. As they argued, the boy's father, the plane's captain, hurried over. Seeing this, the security captain backed off, though the boy's distant manner revealed the strained relationship between father and son. The, the boy's parents had divorced early on, and he had lived with his mother until her recent passing, after which his father brought him here. But his father buried In work had never shown him care. Late that night, while his father slept, the boy sneaked out, hoping to buy a ticket and leave, only to learn he was too young to purchase one. In desperation, he he had inside an aircraft's landing gear, thinking he'd succeeded until the dog appeared barking persistently despite the boy's attempts to quiet it. The noise alerted airport staff as they closed in, the boy leaped down and fled with the dog in tow. Dawn, the father received a call from the mechanic and was stunned to find his son, whom he'd searched for all night, asleep on the grass with the dog. Enraged, the father yanked the boy up, but the child refused to go back. As they stood deadlocked, the mechanic, citing imminent flight delays, arranged for the boy to stay temporarily under his watch at the airport. Once the father left, the boy vented his frustration at the dog, blaming it for ruining his escape plan. But the mechanic revealed a startling truth. At high altitude, freezing temperatures in the landing gear would have been fatal. The dog's barking had actually saved the boy's life. Realizing he'd misjudged the dog, the boy listened as a flight attendant explained why it was stranded. Days earlier, its owner had abandoned it at the airport after forgetting its vaccination papers. Deep.

Then I took the gun, loaded a bullet and aimed. It was clear that I was better at shooting. We set out to herd the sheep with the gun. Soon I saw a wolf and my brother fired at it. The shot didn't kill the wolf and scared the sheep away. My brother complained that the gun, which the seller said could shoot 3,000 meters, was a lie. I thought it was just his aim that was bad. To test the gun, we both fired at a distant bus. A few seconds later, the bus stopped. We were terrified, ran home. That night, when my father came home, he told us to be careful while herding because a terrorist attack had just happened on a bus carrying American tourists. My mother said there were no terrorists here, but my father said that since it.

He hinted for the player to throw the ball at my eyes just because I was black. The baseball flew at my face. I slipped and fell. Everyone knew it was on purpose, but nobody spoke up for me. Even my teammates made fun of me. The pitcher threw a second pitch. I slipped again. The opposing coach started to mock me. I had no choice but to get back up. My mindset became agitated. Facing the third normal pitch, my batting power was insufficient. The baseball flew slowly. The opposing outfielder easily caught it and just like that, I was out. But the opposing coach kept on insulting me, even brought up my family. I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed a baseball bat and tried to fight back. Just as the crowd thought I was going to hit someone, I controlled myself. I turned around and left the field. I swung the bat in the hallway and let out all my anger. I completely broke down. I wanted to rush out and duel with that coach, but the boss stopped me. He thought I should lead the team to victory and win the game for all the black fans. So I got my act together. I went back to the field. The opposing coach was still insulting me, but I didn't care. This time I hit a beautiful shot. Then I quickly took off and made it to first base. The Crowd cheered for me. I started to sway from side to side. Then I swiftly scored a run. In this way, my team won the game. But the.

He begged us to stop and help him, but we couldn't dare to stop. We were participating in a deadly walking game. Once you stopped, you'd get a warning from the judges. And three warnings meant death. What was even more terrifying was that this competition had no finish line. Only one person out of hundreds of contestants could survive and claim victory. The champion would receive one wish and endless wealth. Initially, we hadn't realized how dangerous the game was and were still imagining the good life after the competition. We quickly completed the first six miles. Suddenly, a young guy's leg cramped up. The intense pain left him unable to get back on his feet. After three warnings, he was shot in the head. I was scared stiff, but thankfully, Carl grabbed me just in time. We had already walked 60 miles. Most contestants had reached their physical limits. Some tried to escape, but they'd only get gunned down. It started pouring rain at night. Fortunately, the few people left were in pretty good physical shape, and we made it through to the next day. John's stomach started hurting. He must have caught a chill last night. He could only risk a warning to use the bathroom for eight seconds. There was no time to wipe himself, so we had to endure the stench. On the fifth day, only six people remained out of hundreds of contestants. We Came back to town and I saw my own mother. I broke down and wanted to rush over to talk to her, but thankfully John stopped me in time, or I would have been killed. Shortly after we continued walking, John started bleeding from his nose. It looked like his internal organs had been damaged. Realizing he was about to die, he quickly handed his pennant to a teammate, then stopped walking to end his suffering. At 326 miles, only three contestants remained in the group. The judges kept mocking us. John realized that blood had filled his lungs, and he said his final goodbye to us. The gunshot behind us, only Carl and I were left on the course. The crowd of spectators kept growing. On the surface, they were cheering us on, but they were really there for the thrill, wanting to see how we would die. Finally, I couldn't hold on any longer and stopped in my tracks. Carl watched as the judge shot and killed me, and he was overcome with grief. He won the championship, made a wish that required a gun, and without hesitation, shot and killed the cruel judge, avenging all the contestants.

I wanted to know how deep I was buried, but as soon as I did, MUD poured into the car through the crack. Startled, I quickly closed the window. Before I could catch my breath, the sunroof shattered. Panicked, I grabbed tape to try and patch the broken glass, but the tape couldn't hold the weight of the MUD. As I was about to be buried alive, I suddenly spotted a steering wheel lock under the seat. Thinking fast, I pulled it out and wedged it diagonally against the sunroof. Thankfully, it held the sunroof in place, preventing further shattering and even stopping the soil from sinking further. I was safe for now and finally dared to relax. By then, my mouth was parched from exhaustion, so I grabbed the nearby mineral water bottle and drank without hesitation. Only after it was empty did I realize it was the car's sole supply of water. But regret came too late. At this point, I might as well finish it. Then I began inventorying the car's supplies, hoping to find tools for self rescue. Clearly, nothing would help, but just then, water droplets suddenly seeped through the sunroof into the cabin. I tilted my face upward and frantically sucked at the water with my mouth, but it was nowhere near enough. I took out a bank card, folded it into a funnel shape, and inserted it into the empty bottle. Then I Wedged it onto the lock plate, watching the murky water accumulate in the bottle. I clapped excitedly, marveling at my brilliant design. But this didn't last long. I began to feel short of breath. The oxygen inside the car was rapidly depleting. If I didn't find a solution soon, I would suffocate to death. So I pulled out the hollow steel pipe from the folding chair. I removed the bottle cap and drilled a small hole in it with my nail clippers. Then I found some hemp rope, tied a tight knot, and threaded it through the cap. Finally, I stuffed the rope into the steel pipe, sealing the opening with the cap. After completing this series of actions, I couldn't help but marvel at my own ingenuity. Gripping the pipe tightly, I pushed it upward with utmost care. But when the first pipe went in, I saw no light. I had to connect a second pipe using the same method.

She claimed she was there on behalf of her daughter, who is sick and would return for the finals. Back home, mom was furious. She immediately started sucking. With little life energy I had left.

And just like that, she restored our youth. To avoid another accident like last time, she he stored a whole jar of energy in advance. Just then, Jack called again to check on me. Mom hung up on him, but she didn't notice that Jack was hiding nearby. He had overheard our conversation from outside the bedroom and decided to play alone.

Hizo llamar al departamento de bomberos, pero tardarían al menos veinte minutos en llegar. No había suficiente tiempo. Apretando los dientes, decidió hacerlo él mismo mientras inspeccionaba la mina con cuidado. De pronto vio la información de nuestra empresa marcada en la carcasa. Llamó al jefe de inmediato. En ese segundo, sonó un teléfono en la cajuela. Mi hijo abrió el panel trasero y la mano cercenada del jefe cayó. Me quedé en shock total. Esto era un asesinato planeado cuidadosamente. Mi colega llamó a su asistente para que trajera más equipo especializado. Después de una inspección minuciosa, encontraron cuatro cables conectados a la mina. Yo creía que cortar el cable azul del panel detendría la cuenta regresiva, pero mi colega insistió en que el cable amarillo era el del circuito principal de la mina y los demás eran trampas. Ignoró mi consejo y preparó el robot desactivador para cortar el cable amarillo. Todos contuvimos la respiración. El cable amarillo fue cortado y el contador siguió corriendo. Solo quedaba un minuto. Mi colega tomó las pinzas, se arrastró bajo el auto para cortar el cable azul que yo había mencionado. Las manos le temblaban de los Nervios. Una colega mujer se metió debajo rápidamente ayudar. Con cuatro segundos restantes en la cuenta regresiva, ella cortó el cable verde. El contador se congeló en cuatro segundos. Yo me derrumbé por completo. Mi juicio había sido incorrecto. Si me hecho caso, habríamos muerto todos, aunque sobrevivimos. Por ahora, el peligro no ha terminado. La mina aún tenía un micro sensor, cualquier cambio en el peso del auto y podría explotar en cualquier momento

Meanwhile, the man in the car had no idea the bomb's countdown had already begun. Suddenly, an annoying bee flew into the car, and the man kept swatting at it. As the seconds ticked away, the increasingly agitated man began to lose his temper. Without warning, he made the car drift at high speed, stopping in an empty lot. At this point, there were only 14 seconds left on the bomb. The man continued to fight the bee, but suddenly it landed on the car. He quickly grabbed his shoe, preparing to strike the bee with a fatal blow. From a distance, the killer thought his mission had succeeded, but to his surprise, the man standing at the front of the car was unharmed. The killer, still lost in his own satisfaction, reluctantly kept shooting. Several bullets hit the car's fuel tank and gasoline sprayed out immediately. The the man, however, was still unaware. Casually talking on the phone, he then pulled out the cigarette lighter, only to find it wasn't working. He carelessly tossed the lighter out of the car. To his shock, the gasoline on the ground immediately ignited. The unfortunate killer ended up driving the car straight into the raging fire.

They're all useless. During the surgery, I found that all the medicine provided by the pharmacy was expired, which caused the baby's blood pressure to keep dropping. The nurse called the pharmacy but was told all the medications had expired. To speed up the rescue, I ran to the pharmacy right away to get a new batch of medicine. I increased the concentration of the medicine, but it still didn't work. The doctor finally announced the baby's time of death. This baby had not even seen his mother. I rushed into the medicine room and found that all the drugs had expired, expired, expired. They're all useless. Lim found director Sarren and informed her that the baby's death was caused by expired medication. She accused Sarren of focusing the hospital's efforts on saving money instead of saving lives. Staron threatened Lim not to tell the truth. She claimed that would damage the hospital's reputation. Are you suggesting we not tell her the truth? I'm suggesting we all have exposure, you, the residents. This is a tragic day. However, next day, Sarah rushed to find the baby's mother. She blamed everything on me, which caused Dr Murphy to briefly administer an expired medication. He quickly realized and corrected the mistake and it's unlikely it had any effect. Sarah put on a guilty look. She told the mother that the hospital would waive all fees. The mother signed the consent form. Sadly, the next day, Darren gathered the doctors. For a meeting, she promised to strictly manage the medicine supply. She assured us that something like this would never happen again. But in reality, no one believed her.

After being taken to the seafood market, a local chef happened to purchase it. But while prepping the lobster, he noticed a strange fluid dripping from underneath. He flipped it over to take a closer look, and in the next instant, some creature blasted water straight into his face. Caught off guard and disgusted, the chef instantly lost the mood to work and told his assistant to finish the cleanup. Trying to free one hand to wipe the counter, the assistant casually handed the lobster to the young apprentice beside him. When the apprentice crushed the shell, she also got sprayed all over. She didn't think much of it and walked away after the lobster was flushed down the drain. She had no idea that this tiny moment would trigger a disaster for the entire city. That night, the chef suddenly felt drained and dizzy. Assuming he was just over tired, he decided to clock out early, but collapsed halfway home. As his legs gave out, black blood poured from his mouth. He died instantly. The assistant who touched the lobster was rushed to the ICU the next morning, but doctors had no clue how to treat the bizarre symptoms, could only watch him die in agony. Determined to find the cause, Doctor Anna questioned the restaurant manager, but he was just as clueless, only remembering That the chef handled a lobster that day, and the assistant and apprentice tossed it into the grinder afterward. Then both died horribly, and the remaining apprentice called in sick earlier that morning. Hearing this, Anna immediately asked for her address, hoping to get more details. But the apprentice was already dead with the exact same symptoms. It became obvious the source had to be the lobster. Anna collected the assistant's blood and dripped it onto a slide, then cut her finger and mixed the two samples together. Under the microscope, she saw his blood swarming with Marine Vibrio, devouring blood cells at terrifying speed. Sight sent a chill down her spine. But what puzzled her even more, humans are supposed to be naturally resistant to Vibrio, and no known ocean strain has ever been lethal to humans. Yet this one was different. Could dodge white blood cell attacks and produce toxins once mixed with human blood. Anna felt lucky she discovered it early, because if it ever spread, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Not until they watch the rescue footage where the sunken vessel is encircled by a glowing white ring and sharp, piercing noises echo all around it. Even the veteran professor who spent decades studying the sea has never seen anything like this, let alone the intern, Kelly. Yet unexpectedly, Kelly is the one who uncovers the cause of the accident. Back at the coastal station, she finds a video message left by her friend before the disaster, but she missed it because she was out drinking that night. The guilt of losing her last chance to speak to her best friend crushes her. But soon she notices something unusual in the video. Right before the recording ends, a white light rises outside the window, the same glow as the deep sea light paired with the same shrill noise. To test her theory, Kelly extracts both audio samples, the one from the message and the one from the deep. The comparison shows they match almost perfectly. Kelly concludes the shipwreck is tied to these strange signals. She immediately reports her findings to the old professor, but this is far beyond what the professor can accept. She refuses to believe anything supernatural exists in the ocean. Their argument escalates and they part on bad terms. However, Professor Seagle overhears and makes a New discovery. When he gets home, he receives whale footage sent by kit comparing the two. The same white light and bizarre noise appear again. Tests confirm the match. The professor realizes she wrongfully blamed Kelly. Too proud to apologize herself, she asks Seagull to deliver the footage to Kelly on his way to a global ocean conference. Seagull acknowledges Kelly's findings. The tension between Kelly and the professor finally eases. They are getting closer to the truth. But as Kelly walks Seagull to the helicopter, a catastrophe of unprecedented scale erupts. Because the bearded researcher running experiments notices everyone's phones suddenly start ringing. He checks his own and sees a tsunami emergency alert. Kelly City is listed among the three danger zones. He calls her immediately, but Kelly didn't bring her phone while seeing Seagull off. Luckily, just before take off, Seagull receives the institute's emergency warning. He drags Kelly away from the danger zone. Minutes later, the tsunami slams into the coast. Watching her entire station wiped out so effortlessly leaves Kelly trembling. At least she is alive. Others aren't so fortunate. Blocks of seabirds suddenly flee inland in panic and the shoreline retreats dramatically. Anyone who has lived through a tsunami knows this is the omen of a coming catastrophe. People sprint wildly. Drivers slam the gas. Those on foot wish they could grow wings, but nothing can outrun the fury of the sea. Three coastal nations are struck simultaneously. The Global Ocean Organization immediately takes action. During the emergency summit, a virologist speech shocks every top scientist present, and they realize a threat far more terrifying than the tsunami is rapidly approaching.

Unexpectedly, the school beauty started screaming. Yes. I immediately realized something was wrong. I rushed out of the classroom in a panic. Strangely, the girl just blushed. My name is Jack. Just days ago, I was a weirdo with Pica. I couldn't control my urge to eat strange things. Mom bought me a huge bag of snacks, but I only ate the receipts from the store. Even with instant noodles right in front of me, I would only eat the packaging box. Worse still was how the bullies treated me. They stuffed me in a trash can in front of my crush. Being weak, I just changed into clean clothes silently. I seem to be used to this treatment. Back at school, I started chewing on erasers again. I noticed everyone around me was laughing. The bully had posted a video of me online. Humiliated, I tried to leave the scene, but I crashed right into the bully. I'm so, I'm so sorry. Are you blind, bitch? I'm sorry. I really. You what? I'm so sorry. Between the bullying and my poor nutrition, my body finally collapsed and I couldn't get up. Even the doctor said there was no hope for me. Mom was desperate to find the cure for me. She found an old man on the street claiming to be a healer. This old man had a mysterious power. He touched a disabled woman and she walked instantly. Mom. Paid him immediately to bring him home. The old man placed his hand on my chest. He started coughing in severe pain. Cigarette in his mouth fell onto my chest. I endured unbearable pain in that moment. But the old man's reaction was even more intense. Before my mom could even react, the old man screamed and ended his life right there. Suddenly, I sat up from the bed. My body was completely recovered. I even felt incredibly strong and energetic. Police arrived to ask about the situation. I noticed the burn on my chest had vanished. The next day, I cut my finger fixing a car. Before I could even feel any pain, the wound healed right before my eyes. I realized I now possess superpowers. I was thinking about how to test my abilities. The bully who always picked on me showed up. He punched me hard on my body. I didn't feel a single thing, but he clutched a stomach in pain. The angry bully threw another punch at me. He ended up with a bruised face himself. He grabbed a wooden stick in a rage. He swung it hard on my head. The damage reflected back to him instantly. The terrified bully ran away in a hurry. I went home that night. I couldn't wait to tell my mom everything. I showed her my amazing healing powers. These superpowers changed my life completely. I went from a loser to a tough man. When the school bully Bullied my goddess. I stood up for her without hesitation. The teacher arrived just in time to stop it, but the bullies couldn't accept the humiliation. They chased me in a Mustang while I was biking home. Suddenly, I tripped over a rock on the road.

Mourning because a longtime colleague was on that ship. Disbelief because a massive research vessel shouldn't vanish without cause. Not until they watch the rescue footage. See the wreck encircled by a glowing white ring with piercing noises echoing through the water. Even the veteran professor who spent decades studying the sea has never witnessed anything like it, let alone the intern Kelly. Yet ironically, Kelly becomes the one who uncovers the reason behind the tragedy. Back at the coastal station, she discovers a video message her friend recorded before the accident, but she missed it because she'd gone out drinking. The guilt of losing her final chance to speak with her best friend crushes her. Then she notices something odd in the footage. Right before the video cuts out, a white glow rises outside the window, the same eerie light from the deep sea, accompanied by the same shrill tone. To test her suspicion, Kelly extracts both audio tracks, the one from the message and the one recorded underwater, and finds they match almost perfectly. She concludes the shipwreck is tied to these strange signals. She calls the old professor to report her findings instantly. the discovery is far beyond what the professor is willing to accept. She refuses to believe anything supernatural exists in the ocean. The two argue and part ways unhappily. But Professor Seigel, who overheard their exchange, makes a new breakthrough. After returning home, he Receives whale footage from Kit. Comparing the videos, the same white glow and bizarre sound appear again. Tests confirm it, and the professor realizes she wrongly doubted Kelly. But pride keeps her from apologizing. So Seagull brings Kelly the footage himself while heading to an international ocean conference acknowledging her discovery, and the tension between Kelly and the professor finally begins to ease. They are now closer than ever to uncovering the truth. But as Kelly watches Seagull board the helicopter, a disaster unlike anything before unfolds. Because the bearded lab tech notices everyone's phones ringing at the exact same moment he checks his screen. A tsunami emergency alert, and Kelly City is one of the three at risk. Calls her immediately. But Kelly left her phone behind while seeing Seagull off. Fortunately, seconds before take off, Seagull receives a warning from the institute and yanks Kelly out of the danger zone just in time. Minutes later, the tsunami crashes in. Kelly watches her coastal station crumble like paper, terrified. But at least she survives. Others are not so fortunate. Flocks of seabirds suddenly flee inland, and the shoreline pulls back. Anyone who's lived through a tsunami knows this is the final warning. People sprint, drivers slam the gas. Those on foot wish they had wings. But nothing outruns the fury of the sea. Three coastal nations are struck at the same instant, and the Global Ocean Organization steps in. An emergency summit is held. A virologist takes the stage. Delivering a speech that stuns every leading scientist and makes them realize something far more terrifying than the tsunami is rapidly approaching.

Just then, my colleague pushed the door in like nothing happened. Not sure if my husband saw this, I hurried to ask my colleague to take me home. My husband kept calling on the way. Guilty as I was, I had to hang up all of them. But I never thought this vision would make me regret it for life. Then we stopped at a gas station. I went into the convenience store to buy a coffee to stay awake. But when I got to the checkout counter, I found there was no clerk at all. So I put the money on the counter. But when I turned to leave, I saw blood all over the shelves. Feeling something was wrong, I hurried to walk out. But before I could reach the door, a bullet hit my arm straight. Haven't figured out who wanted to kill me. Then another bullet broke the glass, almost cost me my life. I instantly realized this wasn't an accident. The other person was dead set on killing me. I hurried to hide behind the shelf, shouted for help to my colleague in the car outside. But my colleague was listening to music in the car, didn't notice the danger at all. No choice but to save myself, tore my clothes to bandage the wound. Then I peaked out again. This time I was totally scared. I got on the floor trying to pick up my phone to call the police. Unexpectedly, the other person shot another bullet. Just as I sat on the floor not knowing what to do, a man's voice suddenly came from the checkout counter. You read me over. I looked around like grabbing a lifeline, found the voice was from a walkie talkie. But this short 1 meter distance with no cover made me stuck. To draw the killer's attention away, I grabbed two packs of chips and threw them over my head, successfully distracted the other person. I quickly picked up the walkie talkie to ask for help, told the person on the other end to call the police for me. The person asked what happened, but before I could explain clearly, the walkie talkie got interfered. Worse still, my colleague came into the store at this time, ended up getting killed on the spot. I wanted to cry but had to hold back. My friend just got shot. You have to call 9, 1 1. The person on the other end felt sorry after hearing my experience and said they had called the police, told me to stay put to calm me down. The person casually asked what relation that black eye had with me. Hearing this, I trembled all over, dropped the walkie talkie right away. That's when I realized the person on the other end was the Killer now there was really no hope left. Then I noticed the light switch. I knew if I turned off the lights, the killer wouldn't be able to see me and I could run away in the dark. But as soon as I reached out, a bullet was shot, almost disabled my right hand. In despair, I had a sudden idea. Since I couldn't reach it, I could use something to hit the switch, but failed several times. The repeated failures made me frustrated, so I pushed the shelf unexpectedly, found the shelf could move. I quickly got down to unlock the wheels, use the shelf as a shield to slowly move towards the power switch. The killer shot crazily but couldn't stop me from turning.

After thinking for three seconds, I tossed the old one and put on the youthful mask. Only this can match my elegant style. Just then, a handsome guy walked by and was instantly captivated by my beauty. One flirtatious glance and he was already wrapped around my finger. But the moment I tried to speak, the mask slipped off from the smell, stared in shock, pushed me away, and left without looking back. I was heartbroken. That was the closest I'd ever come to love. Suddenly, a flyer landed on my face. A cosmetic ad. My chance had arrived. I immediately called the number. They understood my needs before I even finished explaining, and delivered a beauty device to my door right away. The technician put on disposable gloves, tightened my skin with tape, but got distracted by the leftover food stuck in my tooth. Without delay, he picked up tweezers and clean every stain, applied toothpaste for a basic cleanse, then used whitening gel for a deep treatment. My teeth became brilliantly white. Though the tiny bumps between them were a bit distracting, he plucked them out, then took a metal file and shaped my teeth into perfection within three minutes. I have to say, this technician was a true professional. He even zapped away the pimple on my nose with a laser. For areas needing refinement, he marked them precisely with a pen. It felt like I Was getting a whole new face. After their expert adjustments and repairs, my face felt reborn. With some light makeup, the result was almost Hollywood level stunning. Paired with a gorgeous outfit, I felt like the most beautiful woman in the world. Sure enough, that same handsome guy drove back, hopelessly in love with me all over again. When I gave a subtle smile, he pulled out a diamond engagement ring. Afraid someone else would snatch me up just like that, we got married, and I soon gave birth to a daughter. There's just one thing. Somehow she turned out a little too stunning.

Inside the barnacles, he discovers a strange fungus no scientist has ever documented. Driven by curiosity, kit dissects the stranded orca and finds the same organism embedded inside its brain. Yet orcas are mammals. They shouldn't share a fungus with crustaceans like barnacles. So kit concludes the fungus mutated the barnacles and triggered the whale's bizarre behavior. Following the trail, kit searches for the fungus's origin near the spot where the orca attacked the fishing vessel. But he stumbles upon something unexpected. Connecting the locations forms the whale's migration path, meaning the source must lie somewhere along that route. The next morning, kit and his team begin tracking humpback for safety. He slips into the water only after the giants fall asleep. Even then, seeing those massive bodies suspended upside down in the dark terrifies him. Every motion he makes is painfully cautious, terrified of waking these unpredictable Titans. But the mishap still happened. Just as he tries to attach a tracking camera, the humpbacks jolt awake, nearly stopping his heart. Luckily, they don't attack. Instead, the entire pod surges toward the surface. His teammate on the boat notices and reacts instantly. Firing up the engine to escape, kit drops all his weights and kicks upward with everything he has, climbing aboard seconds before the whale strikes. His partner slams the throttle forward, and they speed away from danger. Days later, following the signal, kit retrieves the detached tracker plugs. It into the laptop and freezes in shock. The humpbacks weren't drifting at all. They were lined up, diving deeper and deeper. But humpbacks must surface every 10 minutes to breathe. They shouldn't survive dives that extreme. The only explanation. Something down there is calling them. Sure enough, as the pod continues descending, everyone is left speechless. Far below, in the pitch black water, a glowing white mass pulses with light and emits eerie sounds. When the whales reach it, they stop sinking, almost as if they're worshipping the light. The footage freezes here, leaving the researchers bewildered. Every scientific record insists nothing in the deep can glow uninterrupted. And certainly not produce such powerful acoustic waves. What they don't realize is, days earlier, when the camera first captured that white glow, something even more unsettling had already occurred. Beneath an ocean research vessel. The sea suddenly churned like boiling water, accompanied by a sound no one should hear underwater. The entire ship shook violently. Before the crew could react, the intact vessel was swallowed whole by the ocean in an instant.

A few days later, buck officially started his new job. He hated the harness digging into his body and struggled terribly to adjust. Every time he tried pulling the sled, he'd stumble over his own legs. Just when he began matching the team's rhythm, a wild rabbit darted past his vision, the shot after it, swerving off the trail and yanking the entire team downhill. The sled kept sliding uncontrollably. The other dogs grumbled and snapped at buck, and he lowered his head in embarrassment. But the husband didn't blame him. Instead, he encouraged buck to keep trying, reminding him that teamwork was everything. With that support, buck slowly carved out his place in the pack, even though the lead dog, a husky, loved making things difficult for.

She was one of the world's most formidable female operators. She deliberately allowed herself to be arrested by the police, feigning drunkenness, all to infiltrate the prison and take down an international drug lord. The guard delivered a sobering drink, inspected the cell, then turned to leave. The instant the lights dimmed, she opened her eyes, rose and removed her hairpin. She shed her wig and retrieved the night mission outfit concealed beneath. Finally, she effortlessly unlocked the cell with the hairpin. The guard returned to the monitoring room and began reading a newspaper, unaware she had slowly swiveled the camera away. She took the metal spoon from the sobering drink, walked to the water cooler, grabbed a cup and filled it halfway. Finally, she slipped into the electrical distribution room. She inserted the spoon into the fuse box, bit a hole in the cup, placed it over the spoon and started a 30 second countdown. She opened the ventilation duct. Water began dripping onto the spoon. She traversed Cell Block a to the exhaust fan leading to Cell Block B. Water pulled thickly on the spoon. Staring at her watch, she began counting down as officers rushed to investigate. She slipped through the gap. When the fan stopped spinning, officers entered the electrical room and opened the distribution box. Only her head remained trapped. Officers restored power. She slipped through successfully. Officers picked up the cup without suspicion and tossed it in the trash. She opened The bathroom ventilation duct, pushed the door and slowly approached the Zone B guard. Seizing the moment he turned, she knocked him unconscious. Using the unconscious guard, she successfully deceived the monitoring room and opened the Sector B gate. The officer lay passed out on the floor.

The unconscious officer, still clutching the pistol, sat up. He had no idea what had just transpired. Look at me, Jay. Look at me. Give me the gun. She entered the ventilation duct, changing her escape route. The detective suspected the drunk female prisoner was suspicious and rushed to her cell. She had already successfully returned to her own cell and locked the door. When the detective arrived, she was fast asleep. And just like that, she had flawlessly completed her mission.

The woman turned and hurried away. Yes, he deliberately targeted a woman wearing two layers of formal attire. His goal was to cause a commotion in the casino, allowing him to steal the dice from the gambling table unnoticed. He left the scene, entered the restroom, removed his laundry and sprinkled it over the shoe shining machine. A makeshift polisher was complete. He polished the corners of the stolen dices 4 and 3 until smooth, ensuring he could reliably roll a 7 every time. Returning to the table, he casually tossed the dice and won $10,000 again. As a stack of chips grew, the casino owner took notice. The owner sent a beautiful woman to inquire about his identity, only to hear a name that rang a bell, James Bond. Spotting the owner approaching the table to investigate, he quickly and secretly replaced the dice with a normal pair and threw them naturally. This time he lost. He prepared to leave, but the owner picked up the dice for a closer look. He seized the moment to toss the rigged dice into his juice. Without evidence of cheating, the owner had no choice but to exchange his chips. But just as he was about to slip away, a server brought his juice. The owner picked up the cup and discovered proof of his cheating. His companion, realizing his peril, immediately feigned a collision with the owner's bodyguard, creating an escape route. He sprinted down the stairs, slammed the door shut and used a cable to secure the handle, trapping the boss outside. Facing pursuers armed with guns, he hid behind a liquor cabinet and sabotaged the coolant valve. The cabinet crashed precisely onto the attackers. He calmly exited the casino, met up with his companion and successfully escaped.

When the doctor asked them about their plastic surgery requirements, the elder sister said she wanted to change her body shape and the younger sister wanted to change her facial shape. So after the doctor wheeled the two sisters into the operating room, he made slight adjustments to the elder sister's chest and calves and performed a nose job on the younger sister and also changed the shape of her ears. Two hours later, the plastic surgery was successfully completed. However, the doctor suddenly found that the elder sister was lying in the younger sister's arms, crying loudly in a corner. The doctor was very puzzled and quickly asked them what was wrong. Only then did the elder sister explain that ever since the plastic surgery, everyone had unconsciously turned their eyes to the younger sister and no one had given her a second glance. The male nurse, when he came in, he didn't even look at me. The twin sisters hoped to be treated equally, so they wanted to have the surgery to go back to their original appearance.

The sky immediately darkened. In the next second, countless plastic wastes fell from the city sky. A doomsday like plastic rain thus descended. We are cleaning up your mess. This move is seen by the top Echelon of humanity as a declaration of war. With the arrival of the garbage rain, major cities around the world have come to a standstill and the losses caused are incalculable. But since Aquarians can instantly move marine garbage to cities, they can naturally drive the sea to swallow the land. To them, modern human technology is no different from a clown. The commander didn't give up. She asked Barkley to start the second negotiation with the aquarium. She had already drafted the lines. Barkley just needed to read them. But as an ordinary person, Barkley broke the order again and started the negotiation according to his own ideas. There's words here I'm supposed to say, but the fact is you're clever than we are. That's obvious. He's off script again. This is like working with the doctor. Berkeley said that many innocent people had been harmed by the garbage rain and hoped that the aquarium could suspend the attack during the peace talks. Since the water creatures couldn't agree to the human conditions, it would be better to listen to their thoughts. The messenger didn't hold back and immediately put forward three conditions. First, immediately stop polluting the oceans and all water bodies. Start now. The commander Had long anticipated this. She had already communicated with the heads of various countries. Anyway, with such a heavy rain of garbage, enterprises and factories couldn't operate normally. But then the second proposal put forward by the aquarium was somewhat unacceptable. They demanded that a boundary be demarcated between humans and the aquarium and that all water areas on earth belong to the aquarium. Are we permitted passage across the oceans? No. The human race evolved to live on land, not in the waters or the sky. She said sky. Do you want the skies? Now? You live in the ocean. The skies are not your concern. The air above the ocean is the ocean. This is our space. Are you seeking to ground all air transport? Transport over land is your concern. Transport across water will not be permitted. But that's ridiculous. Trade between continents is an essential function of the modern world. Yes. Our continent relies on food import. We will take questions from the Ambassador Berkeley. There's no prep for this. We don't have responses. You are amphibian. You don't own this guy. You cannot stop our people. We will take questions from the ambassador. You're holding us hostage. But the channel, channel. The world cannot function without cross continental travel. How dare you? How dare you come in here and dictate the future of the human race? You are condemning developing countries to death. Just as the situation was about to get out of control, the Messenger let out a roar immediately after his face and skin changed. It turned out that this messenger was both male and female. Under the commander's instructions, Markley apologized on behalf of humanity. But the questions raised by representatives from various countries are also crucial. The conditions of the aquariums have already threatened the survival of human beings, so they need time to discuss countermeasures. After all, unlike the aquariums, the humans on land are divided into hundreds of countries of all sizes and it is indeed quite difficult to reach an agreement. Barkley suggested that both sides first sign a formal ceasefire agreement. Otherwise, it would still be these people living at the bottom who would suffer. The envoy neither agreed nor disagreed. He merely put forward his third condition. Since it was an equal dialogue, it couldn't always be in this concrete jungle. The location for the next negotiation had to be designated by them. After saying that, the envoy touched the pearl around his neck and the image on the screen instantly changed. Looking at the longitude and latitude above. The negotiation site was actually set at the Roman J Trench, which is located at the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean. At about 7, 800 meters. Even the most advanced man submersible would be crushed by water pressure halfway down. Look, you don't agree to anything. Will you meet us sparkly at the bottom of the ocean? Okay.

And Doug seemed to feel the same connection. From that day forward, they were inseparable. She fully believed Doug cared for her just as much, until that one day she picked up the underwear left by the girl who visited Doug yesterday. To her surprise, Doug's girlfriend seemed thrilled to see it, but the underwear wasn't hers. Doug claimed it was a Christmas present. His girlfriend reminded him that it was only January. Somehow that tiny detail sparked a fight. After that moment, she never saw Doug's girlfriend again. One night, Doug got drunk. She stayed by his side, only to hear him say she had ruined his life. He said if she hadn't brought random things home, his girlfriend wouldn't have discovered anything. Watching Doug cry while calling his girlfriend, she wanted to comfort him and grab the ball on the back. But the next moment, she accidentally broke Doug's most treasured item. Doug scolded her. Immediately, she felt certain she had done something terribly wrong. But then Doug suddenly stopped and the way he looked at her made her tremble inside. After that, nothing unusual happened. Doug even took her out to the countryside to play. He threw the ball and she dashed after it. But when she turned back, Doug was walking away. She thought it was just another one of Doug's game when she returned with the ball. And ran into the cabin. Doug became strangely excited, seemed to truly enjoy this game with her. Soon, he brought her to the countryside again, again and again. But she always managed to find her way home. Seeing her win every time, Doug became strangely thrilled by her ability. Then he drove her even farther, three days and nights on the road from the West Coast to the East Coast. Along the way were breathtaking sights she had never seen before. She thought Doug was being thoughtful, but then the game started all over again. She chased the ball and Doug once more stepped on the gas and disappeared. Only this time the ball landed behind a closed door or completely out of her reach. But she wouldn't be stopped that easily. She went around the side to retrieve it, but in the next moment, she realized she couldn't return the way she came. Still, she believed her owner trusted her to find the path home. She wandered through the light rain searching for another way, but suddenly the game didn't feel fun anymore. At that moment, all she wanted was to go home. Night fell and she began feeling sleepy. Luckily, she found a piece of cardboard to lie on. Just as she was drifting off, a car sped past. She thought maybe Doug had come to get her. She rushed after it, but soon lost track of the vehicle. And in the very next second, two large black Dogs appeared right in front of her.

The wealthy man outside is hunting her like prey. Just as she's about to be spotted, Lisa quickly uses the key she found to unlock the garage door. While the rich man steps outside. Lisa crawls out from beneath the car, backing away quietly, but the sound of the elevator button alerts him instantly. She turns around, only to witness something even more horrifying. The man tied up here is the same one the rich man drugged with wine earlier. Lisa is about to speak, but the wealthy man has already caught up. He steps into the elevator area, but doesn't see her, so he turns around and leaves just as the doors start to close. Lisa peeks out and quickly hits a floor button. The elevator shoots downward and stops on an unfamiliar level. When the doors slide open, a cold, unsettling hallway appears, sending a chill through her spine. With no other way out, she forces herself to move forward. At this point, she can only descend deeper. She scans the surroundings nervously, afraid something monstrous might suddenly appear. Soon, Lisa steps into a brightly lit room. Judging from the equipment, it seems to be some sort of laboratory. Driven by curiosity, she continues exploring, only to stumble upon a site beyond terrifying. Several warped human figures hang suspended in midair, clearly injected with some kind of compound that twisted them into these shapes. Wanting evidence, she quickly pulls Out her phone to record, but something goes wrong. One of the women is actually still alive. Startled, Lisa drops her phone. The noise inside the glass chamber immediately draws the rich man over. On the edge of danger, Lisa snatches a scalpel, slashes his face, and bolts. She sprints toward the elevator. The man recovers and charges after her, but this time Lisa manages to escape the mansion. As she runs out in terror, car suddenly stops right in front of her. Seeing a woman step out, Lisa thinks she's finally saved, unaware the woman is actually the rich man's girlfriend.

She's terrified to make even the tiniest sound. Right now, the mansion's owner is roaming around with a gun in hand, checking every corner for her. Just as she's about to be discovered, Lisa reacts fast, snatching a decoration from the shelf and hurling it hard to the opposite side. Hearing the noise, the wealthy man is instantly lured over. Seizing the moment, Lisa leaps up and bolts toward the first floor. She wants to see if the front door can be opened so she can flee, but no matter how hard she pulls, the door doesn't budge. Panic surges through her. Knowing it's her only exit, she drags over a chair and smashes it against the glass door. Suddenly, the rich man appears behind the glass, startling her so much she nearly collapses. Not only did she fail to escape, she also revealed exactly where she is. Lisa has no choice but to sprint up to the third floor, only to find every door locked tight. Refusing to give in, she pried open the ventilation duct and climbs all the way to the rooftop, but it's too high and she doesn't dare jump. Seeing the man notice the open vent, she's forced to leap. Luckily, there's a pool below and she barely survives. But just as she tries to climb out, a pair of heavy feet appear, and the rich man demands to know why she broke in, asking if She even realizes it's illegal. Lisa hurriedly explains she only needed a place to stay for a few days, meaning no harm and hoping he'll spare her. He ignores her completely, raising the tranquilizer gun to finish her off. Fortunately, right then, a knocking sound comes from his phone. To avoid trouble, he closes the pool cover first, then goes to check outside. Trapped in the water, Lisa wastes no time, diving to the bottom in search of a switch that could open the cover. After a frantic search, she spots a faint red light under the water. The switch! She shatters the glass shield, and as the cover opens, she climbs out without even taking a breath, sprinting straight toward the main door. But unexpectedly, the visitor is already gone, and as she reaches the entrance, the door shuts right in her face. Lisa is completely devastated. Meanwhile, the rich man notices the open pool cover but doesn't chase her. Instead, he takes her ID from her wallet and checks it carefully on his computer, finding nothing unusual. She's clearly just an ordinary person. But he still has no intention of letting her go, grabbing a tranquilizer gun and heading toward the basement garage, unaware that Lisa is trembling beneath a car, barely holding on.

His younger brother was holding a sickle, bending down, ready to snag a fish. He had no idea that the blade behind him was angled straight at his neck. The man sensed danger, instantly, hurried over and told his brother there was a snake nearby. The younger boy froze in fear, and the man softened his voice to calm him, telling him to slowly set the sickle down. His brother obeyed and handed the tool over, but what happened next was completely unexpected. The moment the man grabbed the sickle, he began striking his brother hard. The younger boy was furious and bewildered, not understanding why he was being hit. Seeing that he still didn't get it, the man picked the sickle back up and mimic the swing his brother had just made. Only then did realization finally dawn on him. If he had kept swinging that blade, he could have taken his own life. The thought sent cold sweat running down his forehead.

He instantly realized that if he didn't stop his own boat, both vessels would be smashed to pieces. In a panic, he yanked the cabinet open again, grabbed a metal bottle and began hammering it against the door handle. But the ship drew closer and closer. And no matter how many times he slammed the bottle, it was far too light to damage the lock. Desperate, he kicked the door once, twice, yet it wouldn't budge. Frenzied, he stretched his arm out the window, wildly waving his shirt for help. But the oncoming ship didn't notice him and continued its path, the crash moments away. He pressed his face against the window, trying to squeeze through to get their attention, but the frame was far too narrow. His face was crushed painfully against it, forcing him to scream and give up. Panic and despair washed over him. He forced himself to stay focused, reaching out again. In the chaos, his hand accidentally caught a rope. So he tested its tension, tied a tight knot and flung it into the sea. His idea was to jam the rope into the propeller and stop the boat. Luckily, the current guided the rope straight into the spinning blades, but it tightened far too quickly. Before he could release it, the rope snapped around his neck. A Wave of suffocation hit instantly and worse. His feet were lifted off the deck, his vision fading to black as he fought desperately not to lose consciousness. He fumbled blindly across the deck, finally grabbing a metal hook. And despite the agony contorting his face, he pried the rope loose. Bit by bit, the man struggled violently and after a brutal fight for survival, escaped death yet again. He collapsed onto the floor, gasping for air. And once he regained his breath, he realized the danger wasn't gone. The momentum had caused the two vessels to collide lightly, and that impact had knocked him out cold. When he finally woke up, the two ships had already drifted far apart. Worse still, although the propeller had stopped, his boat had no anchor and the wind was carrying it away, far off its familiar course toward uncharted waters. And worst of all, the cabin had begun leaking for unknown reasons, with seawater pouring steadily through the cracks.

But the worst thing happened. Do we have a double wide shoe? The receptionist loudly teased her, saying her shoe size was the same as a man's. I'm just gonna take these. These are perfect. Okay. She had already gotten used to this, the verbal abuse about her body size. She could only relieve her body anxiety through exercise. And then a miracle happened. The woman woke up and noticed something had changed. Her body was now slim. Her face had become beautiful. But she didn't realize these changes were only visible to her. You're good. She quickly felt the perks of her new body. She used to feel inferior whenever she saw a beautiful woman. She envied how those women were approached by handsome men. But now she greeted beautiful women with confidence. A whistle from a man was taken as flirtation. When a man opened the door for her, she believed it was done for. Her chivalry alive and well. Feeling confident, she went for an interview at a beauty company she'd always admired. It was something she only dreamed of before, but now she confidently handed over her resume. And I'm applying for the receptionist job. The receptionist as the company's face. Paul legally told her she wasn't suitable for the job. But the woman didn't understand. She had only worked in basements before. She truly loved the idea of working at the front desk. Her passion and sincerity moved the female CEO sitting nearby. While others saw the front desk as a stepping stone to the modeling world. This girl was different. My only real goal is to come here to this office every day and help people feel the same way I feel when I step off that elevator. That this is the only place to be. The CEO approved of her interview. Renee, full of energy yet graceful, truly embodied the idea of being standard in the mirror, but with a soul that blossomed uniquely.

The rest of the dog endured in silent. But the newcomer wasn't built for that kind of obedient. Bucks step onto a nearby sheet of ice, slammed his paws down and cracked open a brand new hole. The instant water bubbled up, the entire pack rushed toward him. Instead of chasing them off, let every dog drink really beside him. Watching this, the husky see that Buck's generosity was shaking. Its dominant as the sled teams leader, it believed pure speed it would always secure the owner's approval, keeping its status untouched. But a sudden disaster shattered belief. While the woman moved ahead to find a safe route, the ice beneath her split open, dropping her into the freezing lake. Her husband sprinted toward her, but she vanished under the surface before he could reach her. In that split second, buck lunged forward without a hint of hesitation, diving into the frigid depth and lifting her up from below. He slammed his body against the ice again and again until he finally shoved her back into the open air. Exhausted, buck watched her escape danger, then lost his strength and sank into the dark water. The man panicked, collapsing onto the ice as he shouted Buck's name, heard movement beneath and quickly hacked at the ice with his knife, only for the blade To snap the sheet was simply too thick. Overcome with despair, he pressed against the ice, unwilling to lose buck. Then out of nowhere, a wooden stick appeared beside him. He grabbed it and smashed downward again. But something strangely off. When he turned his head, he finally understood the stick had been pushed up from below by buck, who had miraculously surfaced once more.

But no matter how fiercely he resisted, he couldn't escape, and the dog traders forced him onto a train, shipping him toward the icy, desolate north. There he was tossed into a metal cage, put on display for anyone willing to buy. Because of his powerful frame, a man quickly noticed him and made the purchase. And just like that, buck ended up with his second owner, a married couple who hauled mail across the wilderness. At first, the wife didn't think much of him. Her buck was just a spoiled house pet, hardly suited for hauling a sled. She had no idea he'd one day save their lives again and again. A few days later, buck started his new job. He hated the straps digging into his body and struggled to adapt to the demanding work. Every time he tried pulling the sled, he would stumble all over himself. And just as he began to match the team's pace, a wild rabbit darted past. He sprinted after it without thinking, swerving off the trail and dragging the whole sled team down. As soon as he the sled kept sliding all the way down. The other dogs grumbled, blaming buck for the chaos, and buck lowered his head in embarrassment. The husband never yelled at him. Instead, he told buck to keep trying and reminded him how much the team relied on each other. With that encouragement, Buck slowly found his rhythm. Even though the lead dog, a husky, often made things difficult for him, the team still worked well enough, and they managed to deliver the mail on schedule. By sundown, Buck's first day was finally behind him. But when dinner time came, the husky flaunted his authority as leader, snatching food straight from a golden retriever's jaws. The golden retriever backed down in defeat. When buck witnessed this, he did something no one expected. He offered his own meal to the golden retriever, then quietly stepped aside. That small act of generosity changed the way the other saw him. As the days rolled by, buck evolved from a clueless newcomer into a seasoned worker. He treated every task with seriousness and did his best to keep the pack united. One day, during a break, the husky hogged the only water source, growling and chasing away anyone who dared get close. Buck observed all of this, and a daring thought began to take shape in his mind.

Soon, buck sauntered over to his master. A chicken leg. Dangling triumphantly from his mouth. One glance and the master knew disaster had struck. Sure enough, when he rushed to the dining hall, the entire table was a wreck. The master let out a helpless sigh, prying the last remaining drumstick from Buck's jaws. Only to find it stripped down to a bare bone. That night, as Punishment, Buck was forced to sleep outdoors. But what the master never imagined was that this choice would mean losing buck forever. Hidden in the nearby woods, dog thieves had been waiting for a moment like this. They tempted buck into a crate with food as bait.

But one day after taking off birds, his plane hit a flock of birds. Both engines caught fire and stopped working. The captain didn't know the exact situation but felt the thrust drop sharply. Every move he made next would decide the fate of 155 passengers. He tried to reignite the engines but got no response and the cabin lost power. Without hesitation, he switched on the auxiliary power unit, restoring normality. The flight attendants told everyone not to panic and all thought it was just turbulence. Unbeknownst to them, the cockpit was in a life and death race against time. The captain called the control tower for help. The tower ordered all planes to stop flying, cleared the runway and assisted flight 1, 5, 4, 9 in returning. But Sully knew given their height, returning was impossible. The tower still had hope, but Sully's 42 years of flight experience told him they had to make an emergency landing on the Hudson River. After that, the tower lost their signal. The controller called Sully again and again. The nearest airport was only 11 kilometers away, but there was no response. He was distraught because the success rate of water landings was less than 1%. As the plane approached the water, Sully operated calmly. The first officer cooperated fully. This is the captain brace for impact. Passengers prayed and some even left farewells heads Down! Stay down! Race, race, race! Heads down! Stay down. Sully adjusted the angle of impact and prepared for the crash. 50, 30, 20, the plane landed on the Hudson River at a perfect angle. It didn't break apart or capsize. After sliding for a distance, it came to a stop in the middle of the river. But a more dangerous test followed. Sully walked into the cabin and told all passengers to put on life jackets and evacuate in an orderly manner. Water flooded in instantly, quickly reaching the cabin windows. The plane could sink at any moment. The first officer was still shaken and a flight attendant with a torn leg immediately joined the evacuation efforts. The front door opened and the life raft deployed smoothly. The emergency exits on both sides were opened. Nearby passengers stood on the wings to wait for rescue. Some jumped into the river, trying to swim to the other side, but forgot it was freezing New York with temperatures below zero. Sully reminded people to wear life jackets and handed out blankets to increase their chances of survival in the cold. Fortunately, the nearby Coast Guard spotted them and aerial rescue was on the way. All passengers were evacuated from the cabin safely. Boats rushed to the scene from all directions. The Coast Guard pulled passengers onto their boats. One by one, the pilots jumped into the icy water to rescue those who had overestimated their abilities. Three hundred citizens also joined the Rescue. Everyone worked together in an orderly fashion. Thanks to people's joint efforts, the rescue ended in just 20 minutes. First thing Sully did after getting ashore was to call his wife to say he was safe, but he was still uneasy. The mayor and the police chief wanted to greet him, but Sully was only concerned about one, No. 155. He needed to confirm that everyone on the plane was rescued, but it was impossible to count the number at the moment. At the first officer's strong suggestion, Sully was taken to the hospital for a checkup. At this moment, the union president brought some news. 1:55. 1:55, it's official. 1:55. 1:55. Sully felt joy, relief and mixed emotions, which finally turned into a sigh of relief. He had created a miracle. News reports flooded in, and Sully became a hero in people's hearts. The National Transportation Safety Board invited him to a hearing, but Sully never expected it to be a trial. A joint investigation team was set up to look into the crash. Engineers from the transportation board calculated that under the conditions at the time, the plane had enough time to return and there was no need to risk a water landing. Without giving Sully a chance to refute, they raised doubts about how he calculated all the parameters to conclude that the plane couldn't land. The transportation board scoffed at his judgment. Moreover, a double engine failure caused by a bird strike was a completely Unprecedented accident. No matter how Sully explained, the transportation board remained aggressive and even questioned his men.

Hi. Hi! Look at my nuts to say that I missed you like crazy. A lot. A lot. Haha. Sorry about the rain. No, I love it. I love your hair. I love your sign, Lily. I love you. In fact, Dylan was a troubled teen who got expelled three times in one semester. As his father, Benjamin also wondered what about his son was so annoying to the teachers. The teacher explained that during a school activity where everyone was asked to draw a picture of love and peace, only Dylan's creation stood out in a bad way. Looking at the painting on the wall, Benjamin was left speechless. However, he didn't blame Dylan too much for the expulsion. Not long ago, Benjamin's wife had passed away due to illness. It wasn't just Benjamin who couldn't let go. Dylan and his sister Rosie were also deeply affected. So take taking advantage of Dylan's expulsion, Benjamin decided to move his family to a new place. He took all his savings and started looking for a house. After a long search, chose a very remote location. This house was not only far from the hustle and bustle of the city, but also came with 18 acres of land. As soon as they got out of the car, Benjamin fell in love with the place. And Rosie thought it was like heaven. But the real estate agent said the situation with this Property was a bit complicated. It wasn't just a standalone villa, it was a zoo. Looking at the lion walking right in front of him, Benjamin was a bit bewildered. The zoo not only had over 40 kinds of animals, but also several zookeeper. He could afford to buy it, but could he afford to run it? If it wasn't managed well, he could go bankrupt in no time. So although Benjamin felt a bit sorry, he had to ask the agent to find another house. Just as the two were about to leave, Benjamin turned his head and saw that Rosie was gone. they rushed to the upper platform and saw Rosie feeding a peacock. Benjamin didn't disturb his daughter. Instead, he sat down beside her, enjoying the tranquility in the setting sun. Seeing his daughter's innocent smile, Benjamin couldn't help but smile himself. He then looked back at the lion and felt like everything was meant to be. When he got home, he told his son about his decision. To his surprise, Dylan had no interest in the zoo at all. Moving to the countryside meant he would be far away from his friends. But Benjamin didn't con sitter what Dylan wanted. In his eyes, Dylan was the older brother, a man, and they should take care of their sister together, no matter how Dylan felt about it. The next day, Benjamin drove to the zoo. For him, leaving his old life behind was also a way To get out of the shadow of his wife's death. Soon the car stopped at the zoo entrance. Young Lily had already made a welcome sign and greeted Benjamin happily. Then the family officially met everyone. Kelly, the zoo manager, introduced Benjamin to everyone's names and skills. Benjamin also introduced Rosie and Dylan. During this time, Lily, who was meeting Dylan for the first time, had a smile on her face the whole time. After getting to know each other, Kelly took the new zoo owner on a tour. Kelly had been here for 13 years and had a bond with every animal. So she had a lot of doubts about Benjamin. First, he didn't know anything about animals and had no experience in running a zoo. Second, Benjamin didn't seem like a rich person. Buying the zoo had almost used up all his savings. In Kelly's eyes, the zoo's fate would be to be auctioned off again when Benjamin couldn't handle it. We need somebody who can really take charge of this place, or else we and all these animals are gone. Why did you buy this place? Why not

If you're real, how the hell did you end up out here? You better tell me right now. I was driving home with my dog. But in that exact moment, I saw something unbelievable. The mannequin I had seen in the store yesterday had somehow appeared in the middle of the road today. Since the virus spread and wiped out so many, this world had long been taken over by monsters. It had been so long since I met another uninfected person like me. How the hell did this thing get here? Fear washed over me in an instant, and in a panic, I shot. After calming myself, I decided to walk up and check it out. It was a trap. The blow to my head knocked me out cold. When I came to, it was already night. The last rays of daylight were fading away, and the monsters were about to rule this world. I rushed to cut the ropes with my knife. But as I landed, I stabbed myself in the thigh. The pain was unbearable, but I dragged myself toward the vehicle with every ounce of strength I had left. That's when my dog noticed something moving in the darkness.

The box was completely empty and even the receipt was blank. Furious, she tried calling the restaurant, only to find the number didn't connect at all. Confused and uneasy, she noticed a strange note inside. Write down any food you want and place it in the box. Thinking it had to be a joke, she played along, scribbled barbecue on a slip of paper and tossed it inside. Seconds later, the box rattled violently and burst with a flash of white light. When it stopped shaking, real steaming barbecue sat inside. One bite told her everything. This wasn't a prank. It was magic. Greed quickly took over. She swapped the paper and requested sushi, and fresh sushi materialized instantly, dish after exotic dish. She pushed the box to its limits and a bold thought hit her. What's the priciest food on earth? A quick search told her caviar, worth nearly $1,000 per spoonful. Her note was full, so she grabbed the nearest item, a supplement box, wrote caviar on it and placed it inside the magic container. the box trembled again and real caviar appeared right before her eyes. She immediately jumped online to brag about tasting such an extravagant delicacy. But midpost, her nose began to bleed, her vision blurred. Moments later, she collapsed, foaming at the mouth. The horrifying truth, the package she wrote on didn't just say supplement It clearly warned poison. The box didn't produce what she wanted. It produced exactly what she wrote on.

The soldiers drew their gear and prepared for the assault. They opened their strange umbrella like weapons, lay themselves inside the metal frames and used a second umbrella as a shield against incoming fire. Their comrades pulled the ropes with every ounce of strength they had. And the moment those ropes snapped free, the soldiers spun forward like human war wheels, thundering straight toward the enemy lines. The enemy guards spotted the bizarre movement and sounded the alarm. And within seconds, soldiers swarmed from every direction. But when they saw this whirling contraption charging at them, confusion turned into panic. They fired volleys of arrows at the spinning umbrellas, acted like indestructible Shields, making their attacks completely useless. Meanwhile, the soldiers hidden within the rotating frames struck back with ease, knocking down opponents one after another and breaking through the fortress gate without effort. Once inside, an even larger squad of enemy warriors surrounded them, confident their numbers alone would crush these intruders. But then the soldiers raised their weapons, triggered a mechanism in the umbrella handles and spun with brutal force. Rows of razor sharp blades shot outward like a storm of steel, raining down like a mechanical hailstorm that caught the enemy completely off guard. After the first devastating blast, the soldiers advanced slowly, their movements strange yet unstoppable.

Instead, people dressed up as creatures and acted like the real thing. One worker played a polar bear. Another pretended to be a gorilla. Someone else became a lion. And one unlucky staff member even had to be a sloth. Above them all stood the man in charge, mastermind running this bizarre show. When the first wave of visitors arrived, the sloth caught their attention, but only for a moment. It hung from a branch like a mannequin, frozen in place, and the crowd quickly lost interest. They moved on to the lion, only to find it lying flat on the ground without so much as a twitch. So one suggested checking from the back. So the group circled around right as the lion actor spun over and revealed his face. That only disappointed them more, and the crowd drifted away again. Their next stop was the polar bear. The man under the bear suit, who used to be the zoo's director, was trembling so badly he hid behind a rock. But the leader refused to let the guests walk away unsatisfied, forcing the old man to step out and perform a little. The poor actor shuffled out nervously and a kid immediately pointed out how strange it was for a polar bear to be shivering in the middle of summer. To avoid more questions, the leader decided to showcase the giraffe. He didn't have the Budget for a full costume, so he bought only the giraffe's head and mounted it on a metal frame. When he lifted it high, the visitors shockingly thought it looked real. Exhausted, the old man could barely stand. So the leader had no choice but to replace him and become the polar bear himself. The next morning, the moment he walked out, a visitor hurled something at his head. This suit was suffocatingly hot and keeping up the act was torture. Then he spotted a soda bottle lying on the ground. Parched, he grabbed it and twisted the cap open, only to realize he was now holding the most dangerous weapon on earth.

Whenever he consumed someone's luck, that person would immediately face disaster. To test the theory, he drank the milk drifting above a woman's head, and seconds later, the puppy in her arms bit her. From that day forward, he became reckless.

Every person on the bus was someone whose luck he had already taken. As he smirked to himself, his expression froze. Crowd of unlucky people trapped in one vehicle could only mean one thing something terrible was coming. Panicked, he sprinted to the front, begging to get off, only to freeze again in terror. The bus driver was the same blind man whose luck he had consumed earlier. At that exact moment, a massive truck roared across the opposite Lane and crashed straight into the bus sitting right in front. The man blacked out instantly. In the end, he paid the ultimate price for the luck he greedily stole.

This heartwarming moment fell into Jack's eyes. It also made him drift into deep thought. Jack had always liked Lisa, but because he was naturally shy, he never dared show even a hint of how he felt. This little incident only confirmed the feelings he had been trying to ignore. That night, when Lisa returned from dinner, she realized her dog had somehow slipped out of the camper without her noticing. To make things worse, her flashlight suddenly died while she searched. Just as she was getting frustrated, she heard two barks nearby. Following the sound, she ran into another man who was drawn to her. After calling her dog over, the man asked who she was. Once they both confirmed neither was a thief, the tension finally eased. Lisa thanked him and headed back. But the man just stood there, his eyes fixed on her disappearing silhouette for a long time. The next morning, the man went to see Jack and told him about the woman he met the night before. He asked when and where Jack had met her. Jack already knew the woman had to be Lisa. The thought stung a little. Lisa had nothing to do with him yet, so he had no reason nor the right to interfere, especially since the man was his younger brother. Unlike Jack, who kept everything inside, his brother was far more outgoing. After hearing From Jack that Lisa was staying here temporarily, he went straight to her camper. Good morning. Hi. Can I help you? You look even more beautiful in the daylight. Downright pretty as a peach. Do I know him? We met last night. Because it had been so dark the night before, Lisa hadn't seen his face clearly. Only after he reminded her did she realize she was officially meeting him for the first time. They introduced themselves. When she Learned he was Jack's brother, Lisa instantly relaxed and spoke more naturally. As she turned to leave, she suddenly remembered she actually needed his help with something. Do you know how I can get a ride into harmony? What's in harmony you can't find here on the ranch? An assisted living center. I thought I would help pass time by volunteering. There. Being a chance to impress her, George wasn't about to let it slip. He said there were way more fun things to do than volunteering. Off roading, fishing, horseback riding. It's been so long since I've. There you go. We could settle up in about an hour. Really? Yeah. Just meet me. The stable by the house. Jack knew his brother had gone to find Lisa, but he didn't say anything. Anna, however, was unusually upset with her uncle when she found out. Bus isn't here yet. Where you headed? Taking a new girl for a ride. You met Sarah? Sure have. I think my dad likes her. He Just won't admit it. And I saw him looking at her when she wasn't looking interesting. She wanted to say more, but the school bus horn blared from the road, cutting her off.

When she saw the familiar old tree in front of her, she pulled out an old photo with her father and held it up for comparison. Then it hit her. This was the exact same spot where she'd taken pictures with her dad and sister as a child. Flooded with memories, she asked Jack to take a new photo with her. As the sky began to darken, Lisa still couldn't bring herself to leave. Two of them sat side by side, looking up at the scattered stars. The quiet night seemed to stir something in her heart. Lisa began talking about her father, the man who raised her and her sister alone until he passed away three years ago. The sadness in her voice mixed with the peaceful night air, creating an intimate atmosphere between them. Before long, two days had passed. George but exceeded the deadline of their bet, suddenly reappeared in Lisa's life. One brother was funny and charming. The other was simple and sincere. With both of them trying so hard to win her over, Lisa acted as if she wasn't turning either of them away. But she wasn't playing with their feelings at all. In fact, after spending time together, she had already developed feelings for Jack. The only reason she still treated George warmly was because she didn't want the two brothers fighting over her. Lisa had come on this trip for a reason. And it all started With her ex boyfriend. A month earlier, he had broken up with her. But just one week later, her own sister married him. Clearly, the two had been together behind her back long before that. His betrayal destroyed her relationship with her sister. And now, faced with another pair of siblings, she refused to let something similar happen again. That night, George found her under the moonlight. He confessed his feelings for her. As expected, she turned him down. But George blamed everything on his brother. Watching the two of them argue over something as ridiculous as a piece of wood, Lisa realized it might be time for her to leave. Just as the thought crossed her mind, the town's rescue center called. They told her that her RV's engine had finally been repaired. With mixed emotions, Lisa went to Jack alone. I told him she would be leaving the next morning. Last month, my. My sister married my ex boyfriend. We've been dating for like a year, and I thought we were in love. I thought he was gonna marry me, but he told me he was in love with my sister. That must have been really hard to hear. It was. Jack tried everything he could to make her stay, but he couldn't change her mind. The next morning, with help from the ranch hands, she quickly hooked up her RV. Just as she was saying a reluctant goodbye to Mary, something happened that could completely change the Ending of the story Mary's husband injured his arm while working a machine, losing focus for just a moment. The injury was serious and couldn't wait. There was no time to find Jack or anyone else, so Lisa changed her plans on the spot and rushed the man to the local hospital. Meanwhile, Jack was staring at the photo of the two of them, his thought swirling. Overwhelmed, he called Lisa, but Lisa was inside the hospital and her phone was still in the car. On the way to drop off his daughter at school, Anna looked at him and asked, puzzled, Lisa can't drive that fast towing an RV. Why didn't you just go after her? Hearing that, Jack's face fell as he explained that his call never went through. And just like that, misunderstanding was born.

But as she watched them start destroying evidence, she was powerless to stop it. Desperate, she turned to axe, telling her everything. Axe stayed silent for a long while. Years ago, she'd been shunned by the town after an accident that killed a friend. Looking at Neve, she saw a reflection of her younger self. After wrestling with her conscience, axe finally decided to tell the police about Joseph tampering with evidence. The cops rushed to the memorial, ready to arrest Joseph. Joseph, I'll arrest you here if I have to. I'm not going anywhere. Turn around. Get the fuck off me. But a heated argument suddenly broke out. Nevesh means spine. The eerie voice from before echoing in her head. Stop. Then she realized reality itself was starting to shift with her emotions. She froze. Meanwhile, Joseph was taken to the station for questioning. No matter how much evidence the police showed, he refused to admit anything. And Neve saw her sister arrive. She followed, desperate to hear what she'd say. But the moment her sister spoke, Neve froze completely. Joe didn't kill me. He was with me oh night having sex. She slammed the door in frustration, feeling betrayed by the whole world. The real killer, she realized, might be someone else entirely. Pouring her anguish out to X, Neve Learned they shared a common pain. Axe was Still haunted by that old accident. And suddenly, axe remembered the same eerie voice from back then. Neve was certain now it came from deep in the forest. To get answers, axe cautiously asked her police mother about the forest. Her mother only said that some townspeople went there to pay respects to a legendary woman. The two decided to investigate themselves unnoticed. Axe's stepfather, William, had already noticed her talking to thin air. In the forest, they found the legendary site. They followed the ritual, laughing at its absurdity. Me then nave described the hallucinations she'd seen. Ax noticed something. This place sounded like an abandoned hotel in town. They decided to check it out. As they left the forest, something strange happened. Black smoke rose from Neve's hands. Danger was spreading. She told axe to return to town while she went alone to the site. From her visions at a bar, she saw William watching her. Axe couldn't explain, only asked him what he knew about the abandoned hotel at the site. The eerie voice struck again. What do you want? Just tell me. A sudden invisible force grabbed Neve's neck. She almost choked. She realized this was where she had been strangled. Before she could process it, William appeared behind her. What did I ever do to you? I'm sorry. Don't leave this house. Don't make me go. Stop! Run away. Neve ran for her life, weaving through the dark forest and finally bursting into the killer's Home, she frantically searched for the belt that had killed her. Upstairs, a sound made her freeze. Oh, for fuck's sake. It was just axe checking in. Neve realized the killer wouldn't leave the belt out in the open and decided to retreat. Axe was confused. Neve told her everything, though it sounded unbelievable. She left. He attacked me. The room went crazy. We, we, we fought. And he tried to stop me from leaving. Calm down. I need you to go to the police. But axe grew suspicious and decided to test William. He refused to explain where he'd been, accusing axe. Instead, the confrontation ended bitterly. Axe sneaked into the storage room to find the belt, but William appeared at the door. She improvised and noticed strange marks on his hands. Nave shared everything with her father. Though it sounded insane, he called the police, accusing William. Neve knew William would never show his hand so easily. Back at Axe's house, William faked signs that his daughter was mentally unstable. But when he turned away, Neve got a flash of inspiration. She taunted him relentlessly. William finally lost control. You can't kill me twice. Shut up. And their mother witnessed him yelling at empty air. Only then did she realize the truth. Her husband hadn't been home the night of the crime. The police arrived and arrested William. Nee felt a huge weight lift and climbed the mountain with axe shouting into the wind. Then a memory from The party flashed. X had secretly spiked her drink. X explained she'd taken the same dose with no effect. Neve's amnesia wasn't from the drug. She just kept quiet. The real cause of her memory loss was someone else, William. But that wasn't the whole story. By the time they got home, William had been released for lack of evidence. Police had to let me go. Lack of evidence? You were wrong. Neve's anger boiled over. He might not have acted directly, but he was definitely involved. Despair surged like a tidal wave. And then the eerie voice returned. Okay, I'm listening. Come on. ليف

Unexpectedly, the school beauty started screaming. Yes. I immediately realized something was wrong. I rushed out of the classroom in a panic. Strangely, the girl just blushed. My name is Jack. Just days ago, I was a weirdo with Pica. I couldn't control my urge to eat strange things. Mom bought me a huge bag of snacks, but I only ate the receipts from the store. Even with instant noodles right in front of me, I would only eat the packaging box. Worse still was how the bullies treated me. They stuffed me in a trash can in front of my crush. Being weak, I just changed into clean clothes silently. I seem to be used to this treatment. Back at school, I started chewing on erasers again. I noticed everyone around me was laughing. The bully had posted a video of me online. Humiliated, I tried to leave the scene, but I crashed right into the bully. I'm so sorry. Are you blind, bitch? I'm sorry. I really you what? Between the bullying and my poor nutrition, my body finally collapsed and I couldn't get up. Even the doctor said there was no hope for me. Mom was desperate to find the cure for me. She found an old man on the street claiming to be a healer. This old man had a mysterious power. He touched a disabled woman and she walked instantly. Mom paid him immediately to bring him Home, the old man placed his hand on my chest. He started coughing in severe pain. Cigarette in his mouth fell onto my chest. I endured unbearable pain in that moment. But the old man's reaction was even more intense. Before my mom could even react, the old man screamed and ended his life right there. Suddenly, I sat up from the bed. My body was completely recovered. I even felt incredibly strong and energetic. Police arrived to ask about the situation. I noticed the burn on my chest had vanished. The next day, I cut my finger fixing a car. Before I could even feel any pain, the wound healed right before my eyes. I realized I now possess superpowers. I was thinking about how to test my abilities. The bully who always picked on me showed up. He punched me hard on my body. I didn't feel a single thing, but he clutched his stomach in pain. The angry bully threw another punch at me. He ended up with a bruised face himself. He grabbed a wooden stick in a rage. He swung it hard on my head. The damage reflected back to him instantly. The terrified bully ran away in a hurry. I went home that night. I couldn't wait to tell my mom everything. I showed her my amazing healing powers. These superpowers changed my life completely. I went from a loser to a tough man. When the school bully bullied my goddess, I stood up. For her, without hesitation. The teacher arrived just in time to stop it. But the bullies couldn't accept the humiliation. They chased me in a Mustang while I was biking home. Suddenly, I tripped over a rock on the road.

That one move almost cost me my life. When I opened my eyes again, I was stunned. The platform that had been crowded moments ago was now completely empty. I rushed toward the first floor. Just as I expected. The staff had already left. The doors were locked tight. Hello. Just as I stood there helpless, the last train slowly pulled into the station from the darkness. I ran back down. Immediately. I jumped into the car right before the doors closed. What I didn't know was that a shadow had quietly followed me on board. I was still feeling lucky. Then the train suddenly slammed to a stop. The doors didn't open. This wasn't a station at all. There were no other passengers around. I had no choice but to walk through two cars to reach the driver's cabin. I wanted to ask what was going on. The peephole was too small to see clearly. The driver was already covered in blood with no signs of life. The next second, the entire train went dark. A light suddenly flickered on in the car behind me. It was a phone flashlight. It was overjoyed. I kept calling out, asking who was there. There was no answer. Instead, the figure started walking toward me. I was terrified. My instincts told me I had to get out of there. I was so nervous that I tripped. And fell. When the figure got closer, I finally saw who it was. It was my coworker, the same one who had followed me onto the train. Back at the office, he always stared at me to get close to me. He had set up this disgusting fake encounter. The next second, he started undoing his belt. He didn't care if I was willing or not. He was determined to have me. Just then, the door behind him suddenly opened. A mysterious force yanked him out of the car. What? I ran through car after car. I pried open the driver's cabin door and hid inside. Before I could catch my breath, a shadow flashed past the window. I had to keep moving. Soon I was back at the original platform. Nothing had changed. No staff. Doors still locked. Strange noise came from behind me. I peeked around the corner carefully. I found a small dog. Where there's a dog, there's an oona. I followed the direction the dog ran off to. I found a ventilation shaft. Inside was a homeless couple hiding out. I told them everything that happened. I begged them to help me get out. The man didn't refuse. We had just started moving when the woman was startled awake by a strange sound. What happened to her next was easy to imagine. The man and I made it to the platform. We found my coworker. We tried to save him. Just as we got him settled The man's dog came running over. It was covered in blood. Clearly traumatized, the man immediately ran toward where his girlfriend had been. He was too late. Outside the vent was only a trail of blood being dragged away. He knew she was probably dead, but he had to get revenge. He followed the blood trail into the darkness. The trail disappeared into the black tunnel. My coworker had lost too much blood and stopped breathing. I tried to figure out how to escape. That's when I noticed a communication device on the wall. I pressed the call button. It connected to the security room. Hello. I told the guard everything that had happened. He didn't believe me, so I dragged my co worker's body into view of the security camera. The guard finally realized how serious this was. He was about to call the police. A pair of hands holding a blade sliced across his throat. I heard his screams through the intercom. The guard was gone, too. I ran like a mad woman to find the homeless man. I caught him just as.

But we're determined to become the biggest drug lords in all of Mumbai. Pots and pans are our cooking tools for making product. The kitchen has turned into our drug lab. As long as we hide the stuff in lunch boxes, we can deliver it to every corner of Mumbai in 30 minutes. Not only is the product top notch, the food is delicious. Too. Soon, we took over more than half of Mumbai's market. But that also drew the anger of the gangs. And a bloody war began. To save enough money to immigrate to Germany, I cooked in my tiny home kitchen. But for an extra 300 rupees, customers could get an extra service. So business was booming. But that day, we received a notice from the community. All commercial activities were banned in the neighborhood. That notice crushed my dream of getting rich. It was obvious someone set me up. If I wanted to keep doing business now, I had to find another place to work. But the profit on this business was tiny. And our budget was only 10,000 rupees. While even a tiny room in Mumbai cost 70,000. Such a ridiculous idea was immediately mocked by the agent. He said, people with no money shouldn't dream of doing business. If I couldn't afford rent, he told me to leave and said this wasn't a charity. Just then, Sharda overheard it. She thought this was a great chance to make money. So she jumped right into our car. She said she had an apartment. No deposit, no fees. Just 10,000 rupees and it was ours. But there were two conditions. First, it had to be cash only. Second, her boss could never know with a place this cheap. I agreed right away. The messy floors were spotless. The rundown kitchen was surprisingly clean. And there was a huge sofa.

The driver, focused on helping her, didn't notice the boy standing in the middle of the road. In a panic, he swore to avoid him, but the bus lost control and crashed off the highway. By nightfall, the girl crawled up from the cliff and walked home along the road. Claire heard noise upstairs and came down to find a girl rummaging through the fridge. When the girl turned around, Claire froze. Wasn't this her daughter, Kamaya? But Kamaya had died in a car accident four years ago. Don't get mad at me. It's not my fault. Something really weird happened. Kamaya seemed unaware, her memories only stretching back an hour. Not realizing she had been dead for four years, Claire slowly moved closer to Kamaya, trying to see better. Kamaya stared blankly, confused. After eating, she went upstairs to take a shower, and Claire quietly followed. Just as she was about to open the bathroom door, Kamaya suddenly pulled it open. Can you bring me my bathroom, please? Claire's heart raced. She quickly turned and entered Kamaya's room, hurriedly putting everything back in place, afraid Kamaya would notice something was off. After handing Kamaya her bathroom, thank you, Claire quietly went downstairs. Her mind was still in turmoil, filled with doubt and anxiety, so she quickly called her ex husband. At first, he didn't believe her, thinking she was just missing Kamaya too much and losing her Mind. But when he reached the bathroom and heard the water running, he opened the door to find someone inside. What are you doing? Get out! Both of them stood there stunned, unable to explain what was happening. When Peter got home, Claire immediately told him that Kamiya had returned. Peter was stunned, looking at her ex husband with a mixture of emotions he couldn't express. Claire introduced Peter as a doctor and he wanted to ask about the accident, but Kamiya couldn't remember anything. She said she had no recollection of that time and woke up with no idea where she was. Kamaya said she was tired and asked him to leave. Later that night, Rena came home and suddenly heard knocking from the wall. She stopped and listened closely, and then heard two more knocks, making her jump. She carefully approached and pressed her ear against the wall, responding with two knocks. Soon she heard an echo from the other side. Just then, Rena's door opened and she saw Kamaya, causing her to stumble back in shock. Kamaya seemed confused too, feeling that the girl in front of her looked too much like her deceased sister. Rena couldn't understand it. She was the twin sister, so why had Kamaya suddenly grown so much? But this was just the beginning of the strange events.

I did it without flinching. Satisfied, he turned away to answer a call. He kept talking and forgot I was still burning. By the time he looked back, my whole arm was on fire. He just laughed because I'm not human. I'm a robot he bought for $180,000, but real human touch, programmed to fulfill his every demand. The moment I was powered on, I was coded to love him. Love Link established. Hey, you. That day, Matt took me to a party at his friend's villa. On the way, I noticed the GPS didn't show this road. Matt said it was private property. I didn't think much of it. At the entrance, I suddenly froze. I was afraid his friends wouldn't like me. I still didn't know I was just a robot. I just wanted to get along with them. Matt said a few comforting words. I gathered my courage and followed him inside. His friends were warm and welcoming. The villa owner, Jack, seemed especially impressed. He said Matt had found such a perfect girlfriend, but I caught a hint of greed in his eyes. That night, everyone drank and danced. The mood was great. No one knew a terrible scheme was brewing. The next day, everyone planned to sunbathe by the lake, but Matt said he had something to do and told me to go ahead. I did as he said. When I got There only Jack was waiting. I felt uneasy, but he was the host, so I couldn't just leave. I sat on the lounge chair next to him. He handed me sunscreen and asked me to rub it on his back. Reluctantly, I stepped forward. Then he dropped the act. He said Matt had agreed to lend me to him for a day. He lunged at me. I fought back with everything I had. In desperation, I pulled out the small knife from my pocket. I struck him down. I went back to the villa covered in blood. Everyone froze. Robots should never be able to harm humans. Matt immediately shut me down. When I powered back on, I was tied up tight. I broke down completely. Matt finally told me the truth. I'm a robot. I couldn't believe it. Iris, do you know any foreign languages? My system supports over a dozen languages, but I had no idea I wasn't a human. After I calmed down, I realized something. I didn't even care. I just wanted to live with Matt like before. Then Jack's girlfriend called Matt away. Everything that happened was all part of their plan. They opened Jack's Safe. Inside was $12 million in cash. Everyone there would split it. The reason, I could break the rule against harming humans. Matt had hacked my programming. Once they restored everything, they give pin all the blame on me. They had already called the cops. They were just waiting for the Police to take me away, but they didn't know something. I had amplified my hearing and caught every word. I tipped over the chair and grabbed the knife from under the table. I cut the ropes and escaped into the woods. I also took Matt's phone. If I could access the program that controls me, I can max out my intelligence to 100%. Now it's my turn to fight back.

We have to go out in groups to relieve ourselves in the wild. Out here, we not only have to watch out for insects, we also have to beware of creeps passing by. When we run into perverts who use their headlights to peek at us on purpose, all we can do is wrap our faces with our scarves. As someone who is well educated and grew up using a proper private bathroom, I just can't stand the shame of going outside like this. So I slammed down the chamber pot and left. When I got home, my husband gave me an ultimatum. If we don't build a toilet at home, then he and I should get a divorce. He agreed to my demand on the surface, but deep down he was very unhappy. He felt like I was always picking fights. Because of religious beliefs, many rural areas in India don't have toilets. To them, a toilet represents filth and bad luck, so it can't be built near where people live. But to keep me from leaving, my husband still worked up the courage to ask his father if they could build one. But I didn't expect his father to be furious. He said it insulted tradition and disrespected the gods and unless he died, there would never be a toilet in this house. Even went on a hunger Strike for days out of anger and I refused to back down. My husband, stuck in the middle, was miserable. The next day he had no choice but to take me to his grandmother's house to use the toilet. Because she is paralyzed and can't move. The village allowed her to build a toilet inside her home. But even after using it, I was still upset because this wasn't a long term solution. Going to the bathroom felt like committing a crime. One night I woke my husband because I needed to go urgently and asked him to walk with me to the field. But right after I squatted down, I saw my father riding by on his motorcycle, his headlights shining right on me. The moment was painfully awkward, so I quickly covered my face with my scarf and in his panic, he fell into the grass. The next day I smashed the cookware in anger over what happened. But my father didn't care at all. He said since I covered my face, it wasn't a big deal to him. I didn't expect my patience to just make him push further. So I stormed out in anger. And to keep me from leaving for good, my husband decided to take me to the train station restroom. When the train stops, it stays for 7 minutes so I could use the bathroom on the train. Every day we rode the motorcycle to the station at the same time. It was A hassle, but at least it kept the family somewhat stable, until one day the train was packed. I was stuck inside and started yelling for help. People heard me and moved the cargo aside. But by the time I got out, the train had already started moving. My husband chased after it, yelling for me to get off. But right then, I made up my mind because I was done with this village's old traditions. I decided to stay on the train and go home.

I found a shop, had Nick stand guard at the door. I went inside and had a friendly little chat with the owner. Just like that, I walked out with the cash. See you next Thursday, Mister Woo. Next, I headed to a school, found a disabled guy and slipped him some money. Asked him to carry my bag into the school for me. He used the handicapped entrance and got the bag inside. No problem. Just like that, I was back in business. Next. You know why you're here? Buy a gun.

I used to eat tissues when I was little, not because I was hungry or anything. I just liked how they dissolved on my tongue into this soft papery mush. It started when I was maybe 4. And by the time I was 5, it was basically my secret snack. Mom caught me once in the living room with a Kleenex hanging out of my mouth like I was some kind of tissue eating monster. What are you doing? Spit that out right now. She looked so horrified, I thought I'd done something truly terrible. You cannot eat tissues. You understand me? So I stopped, well, I stopped doing it in front of her. I got sneakier about it. I grab a few tissues from the bathroom and take them to my room. I eat them slowly, one at a time, like they were some kind of forbidden candy. I knew it was wrong because mom had yelled, but I couldn't really understand why it was wrong. They didn't taste bad. They didn't make my stomach hurt. What was the big deal? This went on for months, maybe. I ate a tissue every few days, sometimes more. If I was bored or watching TV in my room, I'd stuff the evidence deep in my trash can so nobody would find the empty tissue boxes. Then one morning I woke up and couldn't breathe through my nose at all. It felt completely Blocked like someone had shoved cotton up there. I was breathing through my mouth, making these weird gasping sounds and my head felt full of pressure. Dad took me to Doctor Morrison that same day. Doctor Morrison looked up my nose with one those light things and made a hmm sound, the kind of sound that means something is definitely wrong. How long has this been going on? Just since this morning, dad said Doctor Morrison pressed around my nose and face, which hurt. There's significant blockage here. I'm referring you to an E N. T. Specialist today. She needs to be seen as soon as possible. The way he said as soon as possible made my stomach drop. That afternoon we were at Doctor Hayes's office. Smelled like antiseptic and had giant pictures of the inside of noses on the walls. Doctor Hayes had kind eyes, but her voice was serious. She stuck this long camera up my nose while I gripped the chair arms trying not to scream. When she pulled it out, she turned to my parents with this. I couldn't read. I need to schedule a procedure. There's excess tissue causing severe obstruction of the nasal passage. My blood went ice cold. Excess tissue. The tissues, the tissues I've been eating, they were up there stuck in my nose. All those months of eating them in secret and they've been traveling up into my nose and building up like a damn. And now they were going To cut me open, to pull them out, and everyone was going to know what I did. Is it serious, mom asked, her voice tight. If we don't remove it soon, she could develop a serious infection. The procedure is straightforward. We'll put her under general anesthesia and extract all the excess tissue. Extract all the tissue? All of it. However many tissues I'd eaten, they were all up there. I wanted to throw up. I wanted to confess everything right there. But what would I even say? Sorry, I've been eating Kleenex for months and now they're stuck in my nose. They'd think I was insane. Mom would be so angry. And the surgery was happening anyway, so what was the point? Don't worry, sweetie, Doctor Hayes said, noticing I'd gone completely white. You'll be asleep. Don't feel anything. That wasn't what I was worried about. The days before the surgery were torture. Every time mom or dad looked at me, they somehow knew that the doctors had figured it out and told them and they were just waiting for me to confess. I couldn't sleep. I kept imagining them pulling soggy wads of Kleenex out of my nose while everyone stood around looking disgusted. The morning of the surgery, I barely spoke in the car. The hospital was massive and cold and smelled like cleaning chemicals. They made me change into a gown with little blue bears on it. A nurse put an IV in my Hand and it hurt, but I was too scared about everything else to care. We're just going to give you some medicine to help you relax, the nurse said, smiling. I didn't want to relax. I wanted to run. In the operating room, someone put a mask over.

What's the worst thing you found out about a family? I've been their nanny for ages. Two kids, sweet as hell. And the parents both worked demanding jobs. So I was there 50 hours a week. I thought we had a great relationship. Everything was perfect for almost two years. Then little things started shifting. The mom started coming home early and just watching me with the kids, standing in doorways with her arms crossed, not saying anything. She started asking weird questions when I gave her my daily update. What did they say about me today? Did they mention me at all? Did they seem excited when I came home? I told her, yes, of course, they always loved seeing her. She'd nod, but her eyes stayed suspicious. One day the older one told me, Mommy asked if I love you more than her. I thought that was strange, but I let it go because kids say all kinds of things and I didn't want to make it into something bigger than it was. the mom started texting me new rules that had never existed before. Don't let the kids sit in your lap anymore. Don't let them call you nicknames. No more baking together because that's something mothers do with their children, not babysitters. No more special songs at bedtime because she wanted to be the one they associated with comfort. The little one cried because she wasn't allowed to hug me goodbye anymore. And I Had to just stand there with my arms at my sides while she sobbed and reached for me. I tried to talk to the mom about it and she smiled tightly and said everything was fine. She just thought we needed clearer professional boundaries. The housekeeper pulled me aside the following week while the mom was upstairs. She looked nervous and kept glancing at the stairs to make sure no one was coming. Be careful, she said quietly. This happened before. I asked her what she meant and she shook her head and walked away without answering. Two days later, I got a text from the mom at 6 in the morning. Don't come in today or ever. You're terminated effective immediately. No explanation, no notice, no Severance, nothing. I tried calling her and she didn't answer. I texted asking what I did wrong and she left me on read. I called the dad and it went straight to voicemail every time. A week later, I got a letter from a lawyer saying that any attempt to contact the children would result in immediate legal action and a restraining order. Spent the next three weeks going over every interaction, trying to figure out what I've done wrong. I couldn't sleep. I barely ate. I'd spent two years with those kids, watch them grow, help then when they cried. And now I wasn't even allowed to say goodbye. Then the dad called me out of nowhere on a Sunday morning. He Was crying before he even said hello. I need to tell you the truth about what happened. He said his wife had a complete breakdown. She'd been building a case against me for almost a year, collecting evidence that I was trying to steal her children. She had a folder on her phone with hundreds of screenshots and photos and videos, drawings the kids made where I was in the picture, text from their iPad where they said they loved me, recording she'd made of the kids saying they missed me when I wasn't there. She showed me the folder and said you were psychologically manipulating our children to love you more than their own mother.

As her friend poured out her troubles, Lucy quickly studied all the theoretical knowledge related to brain development on her computer. Once she had absorbed the theories, she used telekinesis to contact Professor Norman, a world renowned brain scientist. Professor could hardly believe that she had managed to read through over 6,000 of his papers in just a few minutes. Lucy offered to recite them to him right there, told him to meet her at 11. The professor was stunned. Lucy projected herself onto the TV screen and explained to the professor that she had absorbed a large amount of synthetic CPH for and her brain utilization rate had reached 28%. This proved the professor's theory when the brain reaches 20% utilization, it will break all barriers like a chain reaction. Lucy said she could no longer feel pain, fear, desire or any other emotions and even her humanity was gradually fading away. She felt lost and sought the professor's guidance. The professor pointed out that the entire purpose of life was to pass on the knowledge one has Learned that there was no higher goal. Therefore, she should, like any simple cell, pass on her knowledge. At that moment, the professor completely enlightened Lucy. She realized she not only had to share her knowledge with humanity, but also had to figure out how to break the shackles of time. She told The professor, she would meet him in 12 hours. Rushing to the airport, she used telekinesis to make a call contacting the local police chief in Paris.

The entire family gathered at the table, slurping the soup as if it were a Celebration, devouring flesh like it was simply dinner. Whenever this family craved meat, they didn't shop, they hunted, dragging whoever they chose into the kitchen and cooking them right there on the spot. Among all the children, the eldest was the most obedient, which is the only reason he survived long enough to make it to college. One day, he even brought home a beautiful girlfriend. The hallway leading to his place was broken and grimy, every inch worn out, and the neighbours stared with a strange, unsettling intensity. That alone was enough to make the girl's nerves tighten. The moment she stepped into Jack's home, she noticed the filthy sink, dishes piled like they've been rotting for months, and a rancid smell heavy in the air. She forced a polite smile, pretending everything was fine. She handed over her gift, but a swarm of kids tore it from her and shredded the cake like starving animals, swallowing even the plastic wrapper. Their mother stormed in, yelling at them, not because they were rude, but because they didn't let her eat first. By now, the girl wanted nothing but escape. Yet Jack's mother blocked her way, insisting she stay for tea. She sat down, looked into the cup, and found Hair and a dead fly floating on top. Her stomach twisted. She couldn't drink a drop. Right then, her boyfriend's father walked in. He stopped staring at the girl. A long, unsettling look that froze the room.

The beans he dropped were rolling only in one direction, revealing that their offshore watch tower had already begun to tilt. If they didn't evacuate soon, the whole structure would collapse into the sea and bury them without a trace. The worst part was that they had already served two full years. And according to protocol, fresh personnel should have arrived long ago to relieve them. Yet no one ever came. When morale was at its darkest, a lookout spotted a vessel approaching on the horizon, but strangely, there was no radar signature to match it. He assumed it was the long delayed transport ship finally coming to replace them. The captain, however, felt something was profoundly off. Uncertain of who was aboard, he slammed the alarm button and ordered his men into combat readiness, directing their cannons toward the unidentified ship. As the vessel crept closer, every soldier felt their pulse tighten and the entire tower held its breath. Just when the command to fire was about to be given, the captain changed course. He drew his sidearm, passed it to the lookout and ordered him to board a small craft and investigate the ship directly. The lookout hesitated, but duty left no room for refusal. Slowly, his boat edged toward the vessel. He shouted again and again, yet no voice answered. Back up close, the hull was smothered in rust, lifeless, abandoned, a drifting relic that looked every bit like a True phantom ship.

Who would have thought a dog could catch an arrow? Infuriated, the bandit leader immediately ordered a hunt, determined to kill this dog. But to their surprise, as soon as the minions charged forward, they fell into the man's trap. By the time the bandit leader came to his senses, all his men had perished on the spot. So in order to avenge their fallen comrades, the rest began to move around the traps. But they didn't realize that something even more formidable lay ahead. Suddenly, two bed sheets appeared, blocking the bandit leader's view. Then we kept hearing screams coming from inside, clashing, sound of swords and blades. It seemed they had fallen into another one of the man's traps. Finally, one bandit could not take it anymore and immediately flew over to cut the bed sheets. But it was too late. Inside, the minions were already lying dead everywhere. Such a shocking scene made the bandits dare not move forward anymore. But the banded leader refused to admit defeat, once again forcing the minions to charge as a result. Now that the bandits were depleted, the man finally revealed his true form. It was a thrilling, action packed blockbuster. If you haven't seen it yet, friends, hurry up and watch the original. I guarantee it won't disappoint you. The movie is called The Killer of Swordsmen.

Did it work? I escaped my violent husband four years ago. He went away for what he did to me. My daughter was 2 at the time and my son was just a baby. I moved to a new town, got a job and raised my kids alone. Now my daughter is 6 and my son is 4. They don't remember him at all and they don't know what he did to me. When they asked about their dad, I told them he worked on oil rigs overseas. It was a lie, but it let them be normal kids. Then I checked the mail and my hands started shaking. He was getting out early for good behaviour. His lawyer called and said, my client is seeking full custody. He's a changed man and you have no right to keep his children from him. I had a restraining order and photos from the hospital and court records proving what kind of man he was, but none of that seemed to matter. The hearing was in three months, which meant I had to figure out how to keep my baby safe. The first thing he did was send letters to the kids. His lawyer had gotten our address through the custody paperwork. Birthday cards with money inside and stuffed animals and toys. They had been asking for the return address said, dad. I grabbed every single one before my kids could see And threw them away. Then he started showing up at their and parking across the street every afternoon, watching them walk out. He was never close enough to break the restraining order so the police couldn't touch him. I called the cops three times and every time they said, ma'am, he's not breaking any laws. There's nothing we can do. Then he started waving at the kids through the fence during recess. My daughter came home with this big smile and said, Mommy, there's a nice man who waves at me at school. He told me to tell you hi. My heart sank. He had talked to her and nobody stopped him. I forced a smile and told her, I don't know who that is, baby. Then my own mother betrayed me. She called and said, he reached out to me. He seems so different now. Everyone deserves a second chance. I told her exactly what he did to me and she said, that was a long time ago. People change. I hung up and never called her back. Then he filed the custody papers and his lawyer painted him as a saint. My lawyer called and said, judges love a redemption story. There's a real chance you could lose your kids. I stopped sleeping and barely ate. Then something made everything worse. My daughter came home from school with a teddy bear I had never seen. She said the nice man gave it to her through the fence. He Was grooming my children and there was nothing I could do. Then my mom called and said she was having a birthday dinner and promised he wouldn't be there. My kids begged to see their grandma, so I said yes. Should have trusted my gut. We get there and everything seems fine at first. We're halfway through dinner when the front door opens. He walks in holding flowers and my mom stands up and smiles at him. She set me up. I grab my kids and move toward the back door, but he blocks it. He looks at my daughter and says, hey, sweetheart, I'm your real daddy. Your mommy has been lying to you. My daughter presses against my leg, shaking. I pull out my phone and dial 9, 1 1. He sees the phone and his face changes. He grabs my wrist hard and says, hang up the phone. I don't move. He squeezes tighter and says, I sat in a cell for four years.

I met Crystal in college and we became the kind of friends who would do anything for each other. When her husband walked out while she was six months pregnant with her second child, I moved in for three months and never really left. That was seven years ago. And I became Auntie Laney, the woman who knew her oldest was allergic to strawberries and terrified of thunderstorms, the woman who could get her youngest to sleep when nobody else could. I was the emergency contact at both their schools and the person who held Crystal's hand in the delivery room when her youngest came into the world. I never expected a medal for any of it because I loved those girls like they were my own. And I thought Crystal understood that. About six months ago, Crystal started dating a guy from work and everything shifted. Her new boyfriend had opinions about me from day one, constantly asking why I was always around and suggesting it was strange for a single woman to be so attached to someone else's children. Crystal started canceling our usual weekend plans and having him handle school pickups instead, which he constantly messed up by forgetting backpacks or showing up 20 minutes late. But I told myself this was just an adjustment period and tried to give them space. And came her youngest daughter's seventh birthday. Party. And I overheard a conversation that changed everything. I was in the kitchen grabbing juice boxes when his voice carried in from the living room. It's honestly pathetic, he said, a woman with no family of her own playing pretend with someone else's kids. I froze and waited for Crystal to defend me. Instead, I heard her sigh. I know I've been trying to get her to back off, but she won't take a hint. I walked straight out to the backyard where she was standing. Is that really how you feel about the last seven years? She crossed her arms. He has a point. You're too involved, Laney. Maybe it's time you focused on building your own life instead of borrowing mine. I gave her exactly what she wanted and disappeared from their lives completely. Two weeks later, my phone rang and it was the elementary school telling me that Crystal's youngest was having a severe allergic reaction and they could not reach her mother. I was still listed as emergency contact, so I grabbed my keys and the epi pen I had been carrying in my purse and ran. I made it there in 12 minutes and handed over the epi pen. The nurse administered the shot while I held the oldest daughter in the hallway and let her sob into my shoulder. Twenty minutes later, Crystal finally rushed through the doors with her boyfriend trailing behind her. She spotted me and her face went hard. She Pulled me into an empty classroom and got right in my face. What are you doing here? I told you to back off. I stared at her in disbelief. I just saved your daughter's life. She stepped closer. You had no right to be here. You're not her mother. Laney, stop pretending you have any claim to my children. Something in me snapped. I'm the one who noticed she was developing a peanut allergy three weeks ago. I told you about it and you said I being dramatic. So I bought an EP pen with my own money and I called the school nurse myself to warn her. What exactly did you do, Crystal? Because you couldn't even answer your phone. Her boyfriend stepped forward with his chest puffed out. You need to.
