Let's talk about Gloria, because this look is almost perfect. I give it a nine and a half out of 10, and the only reason is because I don't like it with black shoes. But if you cover the shoes, I'm obsessed with the outfit. Mccrae is performing tonight, and I was excited to see what she was gonna wear, but to be honest, it looks like she was sleeping, grabbed her bed sheet, and ran out of the house. It's not that it looks bad. It's just it gives me nothing. Doja Cat is serving. She literally looks like an actual Barbie doll. I love everything about this, including her little clutch. 10 out of 10. Perfection. Mickey Martin will also be performing tonight, and I absolutely love His. Look, let me know if you agree or disagree with my takes, and I'll be back with more.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd discuss, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nurse free and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision, my husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Like you want me to be pregnant for 9 months? Bro I can barely survive school. Is there a build a baby shop? Cause I also low key want to customize my baby. Like yeah, I want the little curly hair and chubby cheeks combo. Maybe give them my sarcasm and someone else's math skills because I've been failing since birth. I don't wanna do the freaky either. Like why is that step even required? Why do I have to risk my soul insanity in a sweaty emotional situation just to unlock the baby starter pack? The fact people would know I did too. And the way people say but it's all worth it in the end. Like girl, that's what they say after surviving a car crash. You're not convincing me to grow a human like it's a houseplant when I literally forget to feed myself some days. I'm not stable enough to be a life factory. why is no one talking about the fact that you don't even get a break after the baby's born? Like now you get to wake up every two hours and get screamed at by a bald roommate with anger issues. I just want the baby. I want to dress them like a minion and send them to preschool with a juice box. But I want to skip the pregnancy part. Skip the pain, skip the loading screen, give Me? The kid. Just spawn them in at this point. Every time I hear someone say I miss being pregnant, I start glitching. Miss what? The swollen feet? The back pain? Being built like a human recliner with a foot sticking out your ribs? No, cause at that point your body is not yours anymore. I don't even read the instructions on frozen waffles and now I'm supposed to build a whole human from scratch? And don't even get me started on baby names cause I already know I'd name my kid something adorable. And then he'd grow up to be a middle school menace with a mullet and a scooter who calls teachers by their first name? I'm not risking all that just to have my custom baby turn out like a Fortnite sweat who screams into a headset and tells other 12 year olds you're trash while I'm in the back crying over how I spent 9 months assembling this child just for him to rage quit over losing in Roblox Obby level 2. And the emotions. I crashed out yesterday because my charger fell behind the bed. Now imagine me pregnant.

So my kids daycare had some family emergency and shut down for the day. They sent this email at like 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my stepbrother's girlfriend, Ashley. She doesn't work, just sits around all day while my stepbrother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, a whole designer purse collection. been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years. But whatever, I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200 for six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family Discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked a day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my stepbrother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My stepbrother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together. Now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency. My babysitter bailed, and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. Then I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the Day, the typing bubbles appear and disappear, like, five times. Then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. Just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me. You said it was the family rate, remember? You said you took this very seriously. She completely lost it. Started calling me every name in the book, saying I was petty and vindictive and that she was in a real emergency. I told her that's exactly what I said to her two years ago. The best part? She ended up having to call out of work anyway because nobody else would watch her kid for free on such short notice. And apparently, her manager was not happy about it.

This rich kid at my college paid me $500 to take his final exam. For him not cheat. Literally show up as him. See, Brad was this trust fund baby who partied through freshman year while I worked three jobs just to afford ramen. His dad threatened to cut him off if he failed chemistry. And Brad was looking at a solid F. Problem was, Brad and I looked almost identical. Same height, same messy brown hair. Even wore the same thick rimmed glasses. People mixed us up constantly. Which gave Brad a brilliant idea. He cornered me outside the library one Tuesday, panic in his eyes. You're a science major, right? Just walk in, take the test, walk out. 500 cash. I thought he was insane, but $500 was two months of rent money. My bank account had $47 in it, and my landlord was already leaving threatening notes. So I agreed to the stupidest plan ever. For two weeks, I lived and breathed chemistry. I memorized Brad's textbook, practiced his signature until my hand cramped. Even Learned to write with my left hand, since he was left handed. I studied his social media to copy his mannerisms. The kid barely knew what carbon was, but I was determined to nail this thing. I even got his roommate to help me practice. You need to slouch more, he said. Brad never sits up straight, and he always taps his pen when He's thinking the day of the exam, I showed up 20 minutes early, put up trying to look casual. My hands were shaking as I walked into the lecture hall. 200 students, and I was pretending to be someone else. The professor barely glanced at Brad student ID when I handed it over. Good luck, Bradley, he said without looking up. I found Brad's usual seat in the back corner and sat down. My heart was pounding so loud, I thought everyone could hear it. When they handed out the test, I felt confident. The first 30 questions were exactly what I'd studied. Molecular structures, chemical equations, periodic table stuff. I was flying through it. Then I hit question 47. Describe the quantum mechanical model of electron behavior in metallic bonding under extreme pressure conditions. I stared at the question for five full minutes. This wasn't just advanced chemistry. This was graduate level theoretical stuff. I'd never seen anything like it in Brad's textbook. That's when it hit me. Brad had been skipping so much class, he'd missed entire units. The professor had been covering cutting edge research while Brad was passed out in his dorm. I was complete. We screwed. Panic set in. I looked around the room. Everyone else was writing furiously. Some girl in the front row was already on the back page. I had two choices. Leave half the test blank and guarantee Brad fails, or make something up and hope for partial credit. So I Started inventing chemistry. I wrote about electrons forming pressure cascades and quantum tunnels under extreme conditions. I made up equations that sounded scientific but were complete nonsense. I described metals becoming molecularly fluid and electrons fade. He's shifting into higher dimensions. It was like writing science fiction, but with chemical formulas. When I handed in the test, the professor actually looked up from his papers. He flipped through my answers with raised eyebrows. Interesting approach, Bradley, he said slowly.

Brad thought scaring people was hilarious, and his kids did, too. Every morning, his dogs attack the fence while his boys laughed at crying kindergartners. At the 4th of July barbecue, he let all three dogs loose while his kids timed the chaos. When our HOA tried discussing dog rules, Brad brought his meanest one and nobody would speak up. His brother worked for Animal Control and made complaints disappear. Here, things got worse. After Brad realized nobody would stop him, he started training his dogs in the front yard while his boys kept score. They had a whole system where old people were worth one point, but runners were worth five. His wife Lauren started taking the kids to her mother's house during training sessions. I tried asking him to keep the dogs in back during school hours. The next day, his older son stood at the bus stop with Rex. The chain was just short enough to not reach the sidewalk. Kids pressed against the opposite fence anyway. Brad filmed it from his porch while his younger boy counted how many kids cried. Whenever anyone complained, Brad would claim discrimination against pitbulls. He threatened to sue for harassment and mention his brother at animal control. he'd let his dogs accidentally get loose near the complainer's house. he started bringing raw meat to the park during family Picnics, his dogs would fight over it while his kids cheered. At the farmers market, he'd act shocked when they lunged at other pets. Lauren stopped coming to neighborhood events after people begged her to intervene. My puppy Milo was everything Brad's dogs weren't. My mom gave him to me two weeks before she died of cancer. Was this gentle golden retriever who loved everyone. Brad kept saying I was raising a marshmallow, not a dog. That morning, I just let Milo out. When I noticed Brad's kids by their back gate, the older boy was teaching the younger one something about the latch. I had a bad feeling and moved toward the door, pull it fast and watch him work, the kids said. The gate flew open and Rex burst through like a missile. I screamed and ran but knew I wouldn't make it. Hit Milo hard and went straight for his throat. Brad appeared on his deck holding his Sunday newspaper and coffee. His kids whooped and hollered while my puppy fought for his life. I pleaded with Brad to intervene. He checked his watch like he was timing it. The emergency vet couldn't save Milo. She said Rex had been trained for quick kills, not regular dog fights. The police claimed without video evidence, their hands were tied. Brad's response when I confronted him was that I'd Learned why people get real Protection dogs. His kids high fived him and went back inside. I buried Milo under His favorite tree and a week planning. Brad posted constantly about hunting trips and being an APEX predator. He thought fear was entertainment, but I'd show him what being prey felt like. I studied the woods behind our properties and found paths between the trees. Mrs. Chen.

It's literally a marriage certificate. It doesn't get much clearer than that. Marriage is temporary. Kids are forever. We have a deeper connection than you'll ever have with her. We broke up 6 years ago. We have no connection other than parenting our kids. Oh, really? Then why are you still talking to me right now? Clearly, there's still something there. I'm talking to you because you texted me accusing my wife of pretending to be married to me, which makes zero sense. Wow. You're so obsessed with me. It's obvious you're just trying to make me jealous. Jealous of what? Exactly? You sending weird texts every week. The fact that we still communicate this often just proves we still have chemistry. We communicate because of custody arrangements, not chemistry. Keep telling yourself that deep down you know you'll never get over me. I promise you. I've been over you for years, happily married and moved on. Yet here you are still texting me, trying desperately to get my attention. You literally started this conversation. I'm responding because you messaged me first. Omg. Denial much. It's obvious you still have feelings. Get help. You're projecting again. Let's keep conversations about the kids only, please. Wow. Avoiding your feelings. As usual, blocked. Sounds good. See you at pickup. Tell your therapist I said hi.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? I whispered. She wouldn't look at me. Just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot, next to me. That night, she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons. Just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them. Finger shaped bruises on her upper arms. Dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard. My hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the PE teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team. The one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything. How Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class. How he made her play a secret game. How it hurt. How he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at six am. Not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first. That calling police was premature. That Mr. Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

The Disney princess stopped mid autograph, stared at my ankle, then at my six year old daughter, Emma, then back at my ankle. Sir, is that she started clearly breaking character, which apparently requires something serious at the Happiest place on earth. It's not what you think, I said quickly, but Cinderella was already flagging security. Within minutes, I was surrounded by three guards and mouse ear hats trying to look threatening, while tourists took photos of what they assumed was part of the show. Here's the thing. I'm not a criminal. The ankle monitor was court ordered, but not for the reason everyone assumes. My ex wife, Patricia, claimed I was a flight risk during our custody battle. Said I might take Emma to Brazil because I'd renewed my passport. I renewed it for a work conference in Toronto. Judge still ordered the monitor as a caution until custody was finalized. I've been wearing it for three months, setting off every metal detector in Orange County. Emma didn't understand why Cinderella looked scared. Daddy, why is the princess sad? I knelt down, ankle monitor clicking against the pavement. She's just confused about daddy's special bracelet. Security moved closer. One spoke into his radio, we have a code yellow in fantasy land. I didn't know what that meant, but it sounded bad. Tourists started pulling their kids away from us. One mom loudly whispered, that's why we check The registry, Karen. The head of security, a surprisingly intimidating man named Raul, escorted us to Disney jail. Yes, that's a real thing. It's a small office behind Main Street that smells like churros and broken dreams. Emma thought it was a VIP experience. Are we getting special Mickey ears? She asked. Raul pulled up my information on his computer. His expression shifted from suspicious to confused to sympathetic. City battle? He asked quietly. I nodded. He sighed. My brother went through the same thing. Judge made him wear one for six months because his ex said he'd flee to Cuba. He's never even been to Cuba. Raul made some calls 20 minutes late. Later, we had a Disney escort. Not because I was dangerous, but because Raul felt bad. No kids should have their Disney trip ruined by adult problems, he said. Our escort, Jerome, was a former NBA player who'd retired to work at Disney because he loved making kids happy. Emma rode on his shoulders the entire day. We skipped every line, got front row seats to every show. Jerome told everyone I was a special guest, which technically wasn't a lie. The ankle monitor kept setting off the sensors on rides. Space Mountain stopped three times because of me. They had to manually override the system. By the third ride, the operators knew me by name. Ankle monitor dad is back, they'd radio ahead. It became a running joke. One operator said, you know, we've had Weapons, drugs, even a snake once. But you're our first ankle monitor. I chose to take that as an achievement. Plot twist came at dinner. We were at the character meal when goofy sat down at our table. He pointed at my ankle, then did an elaborate MIME of being arrested, going to court, then being innocent. Emma laughed hysterically. Goofy's silly daddy. But then goofy pulled out his phone.

So I gave him exactly what he asked for. It started when I wore a tank top and shorts to the grocery store on a 90 degree day. You're not leaving the house dressed like a SLT, my dad said. While I was grabbing my car keys, I looked down at my completely normal summer outfit. Cover yourself up because I'm not having my daughter walking around looking like she's for sale, he continued. His face red with anger. I went back upstairs and changed into jeans and a hoodie despite the heat. And he nodded approvingly while saying this was about respect and dignity and protecting my reputation. That night I did some online shopping with his credit card since he cared so much about my clothing choices. Thank you for helping me understand modesty, I said. The next morning wearing a full length denim dress that covered everything except my hands and face. He seemed pleased until we got to his office barbecue where everyone kept asking if I was feeling okay and why I was dressed for winter. She's exploring modest fashion, he explained uncomfortably, while his co workers exchanged concerned looks and I stood there sweating through three layers of fabric. Monday, I wore a beekeeper's suit to school because dad had been very clear about covering up and protecting myself from unwanted attention. The principal called him within an hour asking if Everything was alright at home and whether I was being forced to wear extreme religious garments, it just a phase, my dad told them. But I made sure to explain loudly in the main office that my father said my body was shameful and needed to be completely hidden from men's eyes. The counsellor started taking notes while my dad's face turned purple. Tuesday brought his important client dinner at the country club and I arrived in a full birka. I'd ordered express shipping from Amazon. This is our daughter, my dad said weekly, as his Japanese investors stared in complete confusion. They kept asking questions about our family's religious beliefs and whether this was common in American households while I sat silently eating through my face covering. His biggest client pulled him aside to discuss their concerns about doing business with someone who had such extreme views about women. And I heard my dad desperately trying to explain it was just teenage rebellion. Wednesday, I upgraded to a hazmat suit for his company picnic because he'd mentioned Protection so many times that biological Protection seemed appropriate. His boss's wife cornered him by the potato salad to express her deep concern about what was happening in our home. If you need resources for controlling behavior or religious extremism, we have employee assistance programs, she said, while I stood nearby in my yellow containment suit explaining to anyone who asked that my dad said my skin was too dangerous to be Exposed to the public, Thursday was parent teacher conferences and I wore a Victorian morning dress, complete with a black veil that covered my entire face. My teacher asked my dad Point Blank if he was abusing me or forcing me into a cult while I sat there looking like a Gothic ghost from 1850. She seems to be crying for help, the teacher said sternly, while my dad tried to explain that I was doing this to myself. But she'd already seen my essay about how my father called me a slut for wearing normal clothes. Friday, I went full throttle when I wore a full medieval suit of armour to his promotion announcement dinner because nothing says covered up like actual metal plating. The clanking drew everyone's attention as I walked in and his regional manager immediately asked why his daughter was dressed like she was going into battle. My dad says my body is a weapon that needs to be contained. I announced to the entire restaurant and several people took out their phones to record while my dad tried to disappear into his chair. His promotion was put on hold pending an investigate into his home situation. Saturday morning, the neighbours had organised an intervention after seeing me mow the lawn in a radiation suit all week. We're concerned about your daughter's well being, Mrs. Jacob said, while six other concerned parents stood behind her. They documented everything with photos and time, time stamps, creating what they Called evidence of escalating abuse. My dad kept insisting I was doing this to spite him, but I maintained perfect innocence and said I was just following his rules about modesty and covering my shame full body. By Sunday, his girlfriend had dumped him via text, she couldn't date someone who psychologically tortured his daughter. His boss had suggested he take family leave to deal with his issues and Child Protective Services had opened a case file after receiving 17 different reports from concerned citizens. He sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while I stood there in my newest purchase, which was a full deep sea diving suit, complete with brass helmet. Please stop this, he begged. But I reminded him that he said I dressed like a slut and needed to cover up. Fine. Wear whatever you want, he said in defeat. But then his phone rang and his lawyer's name appeared on the screen. My mom had heard about everything from concerned friends and was filing for.

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me, and I never received a single rejection email either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to, university of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. Plus, I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks. Of applying. They told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't want to be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. And I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study, how my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me, that I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N. C. Charlotte. There it was in plain red, Ariel font, rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades, just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything, found a tiny school 3 states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first few Weeks, she called me every day but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording, it was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for and my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone. Like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was, 4.2 dash. What? She exclaimed, how the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his effery encounter my name? By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was still Good. Why didn't she get.

Like me and my friend could be in the most tense, awkward, silent room and all it takes is one look, just one glance, and it's over for us. I'm talking courtroom silence, funeral level seriousness. And somehow in that moment, your brain's like, what if I laughed right now for absolutely no reason? And suddenly you're fighting for your life. Your stomach is shaking, your eyes are tearing up, and you're doing that weird wheeze cough to hide it, like hoping nobody notices. And bro, your friend isn't helping. They got that stupid smirk, biting their lip, looking anywhere but at you. And now it's a battle of who breaks first. You start doing that dramatic exhale like breathing through your nostrils is gonna save you. And it's never a situation where you can laugh. It's like during class when the teachers yelling at the whole room talking about this isn't funny, this is serious! And now you're in the back like trying not to burst that laugh out, trying not to make eye contact cause you know once you do, it's over. Worse, your friend starts shaking, doing that shoulder bounce laugh that's silent. And then your laugh becomes 10 x funnier cause now you're both gasping for air but making no sound, just wheezing like broken vacuums. If someone asks what's so funny, you can't even answer cause There's nothing to explain. It's just pure forbidden laughter energy at the worst possible time. To this day, I don't know how I survived those moments. Shout out to my laugh partner. We risked our lives not to laugh out loud. Tag your laugh, buddy, cause y'all know the struggle.

Yeah, that's what I want to know. Okay. Now, I don't suppose you have her number? No, um, but when it calls, it doesn't, like, show her number or anything. It just says, you know, Holly's calling or missed call. Right. Okay, so we can't call her. We can definitely call him, though, right? Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's devise a quick plan here during the commercial break, and then when we come back, let's see what we can find out about this, okay? Okay, so we're gonna call Tony. Call Tony and. And Ashley, tell him that you are this Holly girl's sister. Oh, no, not sister. It's like, say cousin. Say I'm Holly's cousin. And we're throwing her a birthday party. So we stole her phone and we called all of her contacts. Okay? So we can invite people, but we don't want her to know about it. Oh, like a surprise. Like a surprise, buddy. Yeah, we saw that you were in her phone. Okay, and then when he says, yeah, I'm in her Phone say like. Well, we just assumed you were her new man because of all the times she's called you. Yeah.

Brad thought scaring people was hilarious, and his kids did, too. Every morning, his dogs attack the fence while his boys laughed at crying kindergartners. At the 4th of July barbecue, he let all three dogs loose while his kids timed the chaos. When our HOA tried discussing dog rules, Brad brought his meanest one and nobody would speak up. His brother worked for Animal Control and made complaints here. Things got worse after Brad realised nobody would stop him. He started training his dogs in the front yard while his boys kept score. They had a whole system where old people were worth one point, but runners were worth five. His wife Lauren started taking the kids to her mother's house during training sessions. I tried asking him to keep the dogs in back during school hours. The next day, his older son stood at the bus stop with Rex. The chain was just short enough to not reach the sidewalk. Kids pressed against the opposite fence anyway. Brad filmed it from his porch while his younger boy counted how many kids cried. Whenever anyone complained, Brad would claim discrimination against pitbulls. He threatened to sue for harassment and mention his brother at animal control. he'd let his dogs accidentally get loose near the complainer's house. he started bringing raw meat to the park during family picnics. Dogs would fight over it. While his kids cheered at the farmers market, he'd act shocked when they lunged at other pets. Lauren stopped coming to neighborhood events after people begged her to intervene. My puppy Milo was everything Brad's dogs weren't. My mom gave him to me two weeks before she died of cancer. Was this gentle golden retriever who loved everyone. Brad kept saying I was raising a marshmallow, not a dog. That morning, I just let Milo out. When I noticed Brad's kids by their back gate, the older boy was teaching the younger one something about the latch. I had a bad feeling and moved toward the door. Pull it fast and watch him work, the kid said. The gate flew open and Rex burst through like a missile. Ice screamed and ran but knew I wouldn't make it. Rex hit Milo hard and went straight for his throat. Brad appeared on his deck holding his Sunday newspaper and coffee. His kids whooped and hollered while my puppy fought for his life. I pleaded with Brad to intervene. He checked his watch like he was timing it. The emergency vet couldn't save Milo. She said Rex had been trained for quick kills, not regular dog fights. The police claimed without video evidence, their hands were tied. Brad's response when I confronted him was that I'd Learned why people get real Protection dogs. His kids high fived him and went back inside. I buried Milo under his Favorite tree and a week planning. Brad posted constantly about hunting trips and being an APEX predator. He thought fear was entertainment, but I'd show him what being prey felt like. I studied the woods behind our properties and found paths between the trees. Mrs. Chen.

She was staring at my junk with this weird, concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek, trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers. Then she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit it. I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. She grip the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud she swerved a little. There's only one ball, one nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two, and you've got one. She was talking fast, like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I, I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that I was anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly once I explained the situation. The doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring, all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows. I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were 7 years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early, and it was completely operable. But they had to remove one Of your test

I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position.

I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area, starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally and He's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly to Anyone who'll make eye contact, then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now. Just take the voucher, I told him.

I froze in the chair, Scissors still hovering over my head. What missing person poster, I asked. But Tony was already walking to the window. He pointed at a flyer taped to the glass outside his shop. That one missing guy named Jake Morrison. Same eagle tattoo on the left shoulder blade, same scar through the wing. From what I can see. My stomach dropped because my name was Jake Morrison and I definitely had that exact tattoo. Tony, that's probably just a coincidence. Lots of people have eagle tattoos. But Tony was shaking his head, studying my reflection in the mirror. Jake, I've been cutting your hair for two years. Never seen your full name anywhere until today. And this poster says, Jake Morrison went missing three months ago. He showed me his appointment book, but you've been coming here every month like clockwork. I twisted around to look at the poster through the window. The photo was grainy and taken from a distance, but it definitely looked like me. Same build, same hair color, same general features. This has to be some mistake, I said, but my voice sounded shaky even to me. Maybe there's another Jake Morrison with a similar tattoo. Tony pulled the poster off his window and brought it inside. Says, here, he disappeared from Portland, Oregon, on March 15th. His family's offering a ten thousand dollar reward. He looked at me carefully. Jake, where were you living before you moved here? I tried to remember, but my memories before arriving in this town were surprisingly fuzzy. I came from the East Coast, I said. But even as I said it, I wasn't sure if that was true. Been traveling around for work. Tony raised an eyebrow. What kind of work? I opened my mouth to answer and realized I couldn't remember what I told him. Before construction, I said finally, but it felt like a guess. Tony set down his Scissors completely. Jake, this is serious. If this is you on this poster, your family thinks you're dead or kidnapped. Are people looking for you? He pulled out his phone. Maybe we should call the number and clear this up. My heart started racing and I didn't know why wait, I said, grabbing his wrist. Let me think about this first. If I call that number and it's not me, I'll be wasting everyone's time. And if it is me, I trailed off because I couldn't finish that thought. If it was me, then I had no memory of having a family or disappearing from anywhere. Tony sat down in the chair next to me. Jake, when you first came to my shop, you paid cash, said you were new in town, starting fresh, but you never talked about where you came from or why you moved here. That seemed normal at the time, but now he Just should at the poster now it seems like maybe you were running from something. I stared at my reflection trying to remember my life before this town. I had an apartment here, a job at the hardware store, a routine. But when I tried to think further back, everything got blurry. I think I might have been in an accident, I said slowly, hit my head or something. My memory of the past few years is pretty foggy. That would explain a lot, Tony said gently. Head injuries can cause amnesia. Maybe you disappeared from Portland because you were hurt and confused, ended up here without remembering who you are. He showed me the poster again, says here you have a wife and two kids. They've been searching for you for three months. The words hit me like a punch to the. A wife and kids I couldn't remember. People who loved me and thought I was dead. Tony, what if I don't remember them? What if I call this number and these strangers claim to be my family? My hands were shaking now. What if I've built a life here that I have to give up for a life I can't even remember? Tony stood up and locked the front door of his shop, flipping the sign to closed. Jake, we need to figure this out properly. Let me call my brother in law. He's a cop. He can help us contact the right people and make sure This gets handled safely. He was already dialing. If you really are this missing person, there might be reasons why you left that have nothing to do with memory loss. While Tony talked to his brother in law, I studied the missing person poster more carefully. The physical description matched perfectly, 5 feet, 10 inches, brown hair, Hazel eyes, 32 years old. Even the birth date was right. But the address listed was completely unfamiliar. 1,247 Maple street, Portland, Oregon. I've never heard of that street in my life. 20 minutes later.

Like bro, are you a charger or a puzzle? Every single time I plug it in, it's like flipping a coin with my life on the line. I plug it in and the phone's like charging, not charging, charging, not charging. Bro, make up your mind. Why are you playing hard to get? You are a cable. You have one job. And don't let it be night time either. You're in bed, lights off, trying to sleep, and now you're having to hang your phone half off the edge of the table, hold the charger with your foot, and balance a water bottle on top of it just to keep it charging. And if you breathe too hard. Boom. Disconnected. Back to 2%. Game over. Like, who manufactured this thing? A leprechaun with commitment issues. Why do I have to enter a cheat code for electricity? And the worst part? It's always that one charger in the house. You don't want to throw it away because it technically still works, but it also technically ruins your life daily. So now you're telling your friends, hey, don't move the cable or the whole house might explode. Like bro, this is not a medical ventilator, this is a phone. Why is this situation so tense? And don't even get me started. When someone else tries to use it, they plug it in casually like, oh, it's not working. Yeah, because you didn't turn it 74 degrees northwest with the tablet tilt and the moon phases aligned. I hate it here.

He's sweating so bad it's dripping on our test papers and he keeps checking his phone every few seconds. I look for our teacher, but she left to make copies 10 minutes ago and never came back. The man doesn't even say his name, just stares at all of us breathing heavily and then asks really loud whose parents work in the downtown offices, you know, the big buildings. Nobody raises their hand because we all know about stranger danger and this guy seems dangerous. He gets mad and his face goes from red to almost purple. He yells, I know some of you have parents there. This is important. Finally, me and four other kids slowly raise our hands because maybe something happened to our parents and he needs to tell us. He points at us and says, you 5, stay after the bell rings. Everyone else, leave as fast as you can. The girl next to me grabs my wrist and whispers, run with me, but my legs won't move. What if my mom needs me and this man is supposed to take me to her? The bell rings and everyone practically runs out like the rooms on fire. The man locks the door behind them with this loud click and my stomach drop like on a roller coaster. He won't even let us near our backpacks where our phones are. The Quiet girl starts crying and he doesn't even care, just keeps checking the window. Then his watch saying 15 minutes. We wait 15 minutes, which makes no sense because our parents usually pick us up in five minutes. Classroom phone rings and he rips it from the wall, like actually rips it out and throws it in the trash. And now I'm really scared because why would he do that unless he's kidnapping us? We hear sirens outside, lots of them getting louder. He stands in front of the door, blocking it with his whole body. The football player kid who's bigger than some teachers rushes the door. The man catches him with one hand. It didn't take him any effort to stop the biggest of us. He keeps saying no calls, not yet. Your parents can't know you're here. And those sirens aren't for us, but they're connected. I think maybe he did something bad downtown where our parents work. Maybe we're hostages. The room smells like his sweat now, sour and wrong. The Principal's voice crackles on the intercom saying all students proceed to evacuation positions immediately. But the man doesn't move from the door. We hear hundreds of feet running in the hallways, doors slamming, teachers yelling. There were more sirens than I've ever heard before. Like every fire truck and ambulance in the city is coming here. The quiet girl throws up on her desk from being so scared. He tosses her his jacket to clean Up. And when he does, I see he has an empty gum holster under his arm, which makes me almost scream, but I cover my mouth. Teachers are banging on our door, yelling to open up. But he yells back, official emergency protocol, these students are accounted for, and keeps mumbling as he checks the time, 12 minutes, 11 minutes, 10 minutes, like he's counting down to something bad. I can hear my phone in my back.

I'm a court stenographer and last month I witnessed the most savage 16 year old absolutely destroy everyone in juvenile court. Meet Tyler. He got arrested for spray painting math is stupid on his high school. Officer Johnson is presenting the case. Your honor, the defendant was caught red handed vandalizing school property with anti educational graffiti. Tyler raises his hand. Object action. Judge Williams looks confused. Son, you're not a lawyer. You can't object. But your honor, Officer Johnson said I was carted handed but I was actually caught blue handed because I was using blue spray paint. That's false testimony. The entire courtroom goes silent. Officer Johnson's eye starts twitching. Tyler, that's not how objections work then how do they work? Because nobody explained the rules and I don't want to accidentally break more laws. Officer Johnson continues, the defendant caused $200 in property damage and showed no remorse when arrested. Tyler raises his hand again. That's also incorrect, your honor. What now? I showed plenty of remorse. I said sorry when Officer Johnson tackled me. I also said ow and get, get off me, you're heavy, which shows genuine emotion. Officer Johnson jumps in. You also said this is stupid and math still sucks. Those were factual observations not related to my remorse level. Judge Williams is trying not to smile. Tyler, why did you write math is stupid on your school? Because it's true, your honor. Math Is objectively stupid. That's your opinion. No, sir. It's science. Why do we need to find X? X doesn't wanna be found. X is probably in witness Protection for a reason. The prosecutor tries to jump in. Your honor, the defendant is being disrespectful to education. Tyler turns to the prosecutor. Ma'am, education is being disrespectful to my brain cells. They're making me learn about imaginary numbers. If they're imaginary, why can't I just imagine I passed the test? Judge Williams asked Tyler, do you understand why vandalism is wrong? Yes, sir. It's wrong because I got caught. If I hadn't gotten caught, it would just be a mysterious street art and people would call me Banksy junior. It's not art. It's vandalism. Your honor, that's discrimination against my artistic vision. Michaelangelo painted on ceilings without permission. I painted on walls. We're basically the same person. Officer Johnson is getting frustrated, your honor. He compared himself to Michaelangelo. Tyler looks at Officer Johnson. Officer, don't be jealous of my artistic talents. You wrote math is stupid and bubble letters. Bubble letters are a legitimate artistic choice. They're fun and approachable. Judge Williams tries a different approach. Tyler, what do you think your punishment should be? Well, your honor, I think the real criminal here is whoever invented algebra. I should get a medal for warning future students about mathematical torture. That's not how the legal system works. The prosecutor is getting annoyed. Your honor, I recommend 40 hours of community Service and restitution. Tyler raises his hand. I'd like to cross examine that recommendation. You can't cross examine a recommendation. Why not? This is America. I have rights. I demand a trial by combat. That's not a thing. It should be. I bet I could beat math in a fight. Judge Williams is openly laughing now. Tyler, what's your response to 40 hours of community service? Your honor, that's cruel and unusual punishment. It only took me 10 minutes to create my masterpiece, so I should only owe 10 minutes of community service? That's not how it works. Then math is even more useless than I thought. Also, why should I pay $200? My graffiti increased the property value by adding character. Officer Johnson can't take it anymore, your honor. He thinks he improved the school. Tyler nodded seriously. Officer Johnson, before my artwork, that wall was just boring brick. Now it's a conversation starter. You vandalized public property. I enhanced public property. There's a difference. Judge Williams makes his decision. Tyler, I'm sentencing you to 20 hours of community service and $200 restitution. Your honor, can I appeal this decision? On what grounds? Temporary insanity caused by pro longed exposure to quadratic equations. Also, I think Officer Johnson has a personal vendetta against artistic expression. That's not a real legal defense. It should be. I have nightmares about the Pythagorean theorem. As we're wrapping up, Tyler asks, your honor, can I get a copy of the transcript? Why I Want to use it for my college application essay.

What are you talking about? I'm not part of a freaky gang. I had no idea who the Kitty crew was or why anyone would think I of people was part of it. The guy looked down at my feet and shook his head. Not with those shoes on. You gotta take those kicks off immediately. Those mean something around here. What? What's wrong with my shoes? He just walked away, leaving me confused in the hallway. I made it to art class, thinking maybe that guy was just messing with freshman. But when I sat down, missus cook stopped mid sentence and stared at my feet. Young man, do you really think it's appropriate to wear those shoes? Her voice had that teacher tone that meant I was in trouble. I really don't know what you're talking about. I was getting frustrated now because nobody would explain what was happening. Girls sitting behind me started giggling and taking pictures of my shoes with their phones. I could hear them whispering, but couldn't make out what they were saying. One of them leaned forward and tapped my shoulder. You're either really brave or really stupid, she said, before going back to her phone. Throughout the entire class, people kept staring at my feet. When I got up to sharpen my pencil, everyone went silent like they were waiting for something to happen. This is a cook. Kept glancing at my shoes nervously like they might explode. By the time the bell rang, I was paranoid and confused. In the hallway between classes, it got worse. It's would see me coming and move to the other side of the hall. A group of sophomores pointed, and one of them made a slashing their neck motion across his throat. My locker neighbor, who usually said hi every day, grabbed his stuff and practically ran away when he saw me. By lunch, my phone was blowing up with Snapchat notifications. People had posted pictures of my shoes all over their stories with crying emojis and comments I didn't understand. R I P. And he doesn't know, and someone tell him before it's too late. I sat alone at lunch because nobody would come near my table. Even the lunch ladies gave me weird looks when I went through the line. One of them actually blessed herself like she was warding off evil. I tried to eat my sandwich, but my appetite was gone. What was so wrong with my shoes? In chemistry class, my lab partner asked to switch seats. The teacher agreed without even asking why. So I did the experiment alone while everyone whispered and stared. Someone had written brave or stupid on the board with an arrow pointing to my seat. During passing period, I saw a memorial plaque on the wall I'd never noticed before. Someone said the name Matthew and I tried googling it on my phone, but the school Wi-Fi blocked all the results. The few snippets I could see mentioned tragic incident and gang violence, but nothing specific. My hands were shaking as I walked to gym class. During gym class, I thought things would be normal since we all had to wear the same uniform sneakers. But Coach Wiley blew his whistle as soon as I walked in and pointed at me. You step outside in the hall now. I follow.

The first thing I noticed when I entered the patient's room was her deep sunken eyes and pale cracked lips. I approached her cautiously, remembering how the charge nurse warned the girl refused all male staff. We all knew what that meant. And she looked as broken as I imagined. I pulled up a chair next to her bed instead of standing over her and gently asked if she wanted some water first. She nodded. Sweetie, you're safe here, I said, keeping my voice soft like I do with my anxious patients. Male staff won't come near you, I promise. It's just us girls here. She looked at me for the first time and whispered, he's here. I asked who. And at first she refused to even say his name. I handed her my pen and clipboard. After a second, her hand moved her Percy. My blood boiled at the name. He was my everything, she finally whispered and started showing me photos on her phone of them together at college, confirming that it was the same Percy who is now a resident at the hospital. I did everything for him, everything. Her voice cracked as she swiped to screenshots of assignments, time stamps showing her submitting his biochemistry homework at 3:00am, his pathology essays at 4:00am, his anatomy exams that she taken for him. She showed me his Instagram from those same nights, him doing beer Pong and body shots with other girls while she was writing his thesis on cellular biology. The day after graduation, after I'd spent three years making sure he got into residency, he sent me this, she said, and handed me her phone. The text made me want to throw something. Babe, you're too clingy and it's honestly suffocating. Need to focus on my career without distractions. And honestly, doctors are supposed to date doctors and you're not one. We're done. Please don't contact me again. I waited until she was stable and sleeping before I stormed into the break room where three other nurses were charting. You guys are never going to believe what I just found out about Percy, I said. I told them everything and watched their faces go from confused to furious. And within 10 minutes, we had half the female staff crammed into that tiny. I knew something was off when he asked me to explain what antibiotics were sent. June from pediatrics and Doctor Sydney are attending walked in right as someone said we should report him. And she closed the door behind her. Actually, I've been documenting his knowledge gaps for weeks, she said, pulling out her phone to show us pages of notes. But this explains everything. The room went quiet while we all looked at each other. And then Lita from the I C. U. Said, what we were all thinking, ladies, we don't need to destroy him. We just need to Let him destroy himself while we enjoy every second of it. The plan rolled out so naturally. It was almost beautiful to watch. Percy started getting paid for every.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say, or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal one and right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered. And I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass. I mentioned one day while folding towels, you're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since door stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded in ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping. And I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end. So I ducked behind my mirror blind spot like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle, a teenage girl while hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned, dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe the way.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50, 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face he starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. She's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I Tell her fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the t V and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that.

When my little sister Lena got diagnosed with Ms, she didn't cry. She just looked at me and said, I guess I won't beat you in races anymore. She said it with a smile. Can you imagine a 12 year old girl knowing her body is betraying her and still trying to make me feel better? So naturally I became her personal security guard, walking her to school, carrying her books, telling her dumb jokes to make her laugh on hard days. But I wasn't ready for Jason. Jason was the kind of teenage parasite that grows in a locker room and feeds off axe body spray and misplaced confidence. Captain of the basketball team, hair like a shampoo commercial, rain like overcooked broccoli. I was walking Lena to class one day when she dropped her books. Her hands were shaking. Ms does that. Before I could help, Jason and his buddies walked by laughing. He pulled out his phone and said loud enough for everyone to hear, dude, is she glitching? Someone reboot her. I froze. Lena turned bright red and then Jason topped it off by uploading it to his story with the caption error 4:04, dignity not found. The school took it down too late. The damage was done. Lena didn't talk for 3 days. I didn't sleep for 7. See there this thing people don't understand about revenge. It's not about Anger. It's about patience. And I've got the patience of a monk who's just been ghosted. Step 1, confusion. I got access to Jason's locker. Don't ask how. Let, let's just say the janitor smokes menthols and owes me a favor. Every couple of days. I moved things around, switched his notebooks, swapped one shoe for a size smaller, took out his lunch and replaced it with tuna that had been sitting in my garage for a week. He thought he had early onset dementia. I just smiled when he walked by muttering, I swear I packed my red folder. Step 2, sabotage. Jason took ADH meds. Nothing crazy, just enough to keep him focused. I swapped them with over the counter melatonin. Suddenly he was nodding off in history like a narcotic cat that teachers noticed. They didn't think drugs. They thought he was lazy. His grades dropped. College scouts stopped calling. Shame. Step 3, psychological erosion. Jason lived with his grandma because both his parents peaced out when he was in middle school. She was sweet, the kind of grandma who knits ugly sweaters and gives you those hard candies no one actually buys. I ran into her at the pharmacy, helped her carry her bags, complimented her ugly sweater. She called me a nice young man. I called her Nana. Boom, Instant trust. Then I planted the seed. Jason's been acting a little off lately, huh? Talking to himself a lot. She nodded slowly and said, I've Noticed that, too. She took him to a doctor. The DOC upped his meds. I kept swapping them. The result, he started hearing things, whispering, humming. At one point, he said the school lockers were laughing at him. He punched one, broke his wrist, cried in the nurse's office. Step 4, identity removal. I hacked into a student portal, changed small things, wrong birthday, switched his emergency contact from his grandma to a number I bought at a gas station. Then I forged a school psych report stating Jason might be suffering from dissociation. Next thing you know, Jason gets pulled from class and is forced into a mental health evaluation. He passed barely, but now every teacher looked at him like he was a ticking time bomb. In the final nail, I broke into his room while he was out, moved furniture around, rotated his posters, replaced a photo of him and his grandma with a nearly identical one, but with slightly different outfits. It drove him insane. He screamed at her one night that she was in on it. She cried. He got sent to a psych ward for evaluation. He didn't come back. A week later, his grandma bumped into me outside a grocery store, said Jason wasn't himself anymore. I said, maybe he never was. She just nodded, sighed, and handed me a bag of those disgusting candies. Oh, and Lena, she started smiling again, drawing again, talking again. As for Jason, he went from being The king of the school to being a ghost in a hospital gown who doesn't know if the voices in his head are real. And the best part, he still doesn't know who did it. He just knows someone did that. Paranoia, it'll live rent free in his head until the day he dies. And me, I sleep just fine. After all, some glitches can't be fixed.

My brother is married to Haley and they're expecting a baby together. Last year, I officially changed my first name from Evelyn to indie, which was a nickname form of my original middle name. My parents gave in after realising how serious I was about being indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. My brother and Haley want an older vintage name for their baby. And Haley asked me about five months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change it. At the time, she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names me. They sound really old fashioned. I said the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like indie instead. I didn't mind her asking the first time. She brought it up again a week later and asked the same question, pressing more about why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked, she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening To her, she also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to step in. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either. Two weeks ago when she brought it up again, she said she felt I had made a mistake changing my name and that 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name indie and that it seems like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kind of lost my temper. She started asking the same stuff again and the baby is almost ready to be born, so I know it's coming to an end. But she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped. I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change. And her comments Are not going to change my mind. I said I don't like old fashioned names. I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing how much better they supposedly are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me. My parents were also like, why did you have to speak to her so harshly?

I've got 5 kids. This is about three of them. Casey, Alex, and Tom. Casey, my 26 year old daughter, is getting married this winter. She's been with her fiance, Max, for about four years now. He's from another country, and with the currency difference, his family can't really afford to contribute to the wedding and also afford the travel costs. So I offered to cover the majority of the wedding expenses. No problem. She's my little girl. I've always dreamed of walking her down the aisle. It was supposed to be one of those proud, emotional dad moments you never forget. Then last week, two of my kids, Alex and Tom, came over with their families. We were catching up, talking about life, and naturally, the wedding came up. I casually asked if they were excited, thinking we'd all be there together for the big day. That's when they both got quiet. They hadn't been invited. At first, I figured maybe Casey hadn't sent out all the invitations yet. Maybe it was some mailing mix up. But then my oldest daughter, who's also there, said she had received her invite already. Same with my youngest, and both of them had been invited with their partners and their kids. So I called my sister to check, and yep, she and her whole family had been invited weeks ago. That's when I Knew this wasn't some oversight. Casey had specifically left Alex and Tom out. Now, here's what makes this even more painful. Alex is non binary and married to a man. Tom is gay, also married with adopted children. And Casey has always been supportive. She stood by them when they came out. She used to call herself their fiercest defender. We're not some rigid, divided family. We're close. Or at least we used to be. So I called her and I asked her why, Max's family isn't comfortable with non traditional couples. It's against their culture. And she hopes I'll understand. Understand? No. Absolutely not. I told her straight up, if she's okay excluding her own brothers, who've done nothing wrong, just to make her fiance's family more comfortable, then I'm not walking her down the aisle. I'm not paying for the wedding either. Let Max's family, with all their backward opinions, pay for it. I told her, if your family suddenly doesn't fit into your picture perfect day, then maybe we're not part of that picture at all. Called me an asshole and hung up crying. My other kids are all on my side. Even my wife, who usually tries to stay neutral, was heartbroken. She adores our son's in law. Loves those kids like they're her own grandkids. She doesn't support Casey's decision at all, even if she's trying to stay open. In case our daughter eventually wakes up and realizes how messed up this Is. But as of now, I'm not budging. I'm not rewarding exclusion and cowardice, and I sure as hell won't smile in a tux pretending it's all okay.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table, Mom, Dad and my brother Landon. Harper's got that new job, dad was saying, making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. Stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time, mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer. They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake 2, I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance, Landon's business that needed startup capital, Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. 3, $57,000 over five years, all because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering they raised me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got in my Car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them, miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amounts, documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything, bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for, receipts from Landon's failed ventures, five years of financial manipulation, all documented. The next day I walked into the.

I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on, but he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled, my deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone.

The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee with Extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. I noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda. He created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat Had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic.

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice, and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under six. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts passive aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of purpose. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava in a tutu with one sock, and baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. I literally just dumped them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason, straight to voicemail, texted Amber. Nothing. They turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel My life for their convenience. This was their master plan. Force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childfree. Most people would stay home and complain. Not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing anyway. Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said, you're absolutely insane, then helped me strap Liam into a life vest. Like this. Think she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen songs at every passing kayaker like she was performing at Carnegie Hall. Liam tried catching fish with his bare hands and nearly looked out of his tube twice. Jackson actually calmed down once we got moving. The motion and fresh air put him right to sleep. The other river goers stared at our bizarre parade. A guy in a canoe asked if they were all mine. No, I said cheerfully. Just the world's most reluctant babysitter taking revenge on manipulative relatives. After tubing, we hit this dog friendly taco truck lot near Clara's place. She brought her rescue Mutt, Peaches, who immediately became the fourth child. The kids went absolutely wild over the picnic tables and dogs running around. We got them quesadillas with mild cheese and churros, which ended up mostly decorating Ava's face and hair. Jackson passed out. In his stroller, clutching half a churro like a trophy. I documented everything on Instagram. Photos of the kids.

What thing? I asked, confused because everything seemed present and accounted for. Your thing isn't there. She was staring at my junk with this weird concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers and she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit. I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. She grip the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud. She swerved a little. There's only one ball, one nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two and you've got one. She was talking fast like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that I was Anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly. Once I explained the situation, the doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now, the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were 7 years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early and it was completely operable, but they had to remove one of your Test

Um, and I, and I don't think she took them from me. Uh, oh, okay. Uh, alright. First of all, what's your wife's name? Uh, Heather. Okay. How long have you guys been married? Just turned two years. Okay. And these pictures, I'm assuming they were like sexual type nakey pictures. Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah, they were okay. And you think she's sending them to somebody else? Uh, I think Joe already has. Yeah. You think Joe already has? Okay. Yeah, this is gonna sound really pervy of me to ask, but I kind of need to know what was in the picture but let, let me clarify why I'm saying all this. Last year a guy called us. He found naked pictures of his fiance on her phone and she was sending them, it turns out she was sending them to a girlfriend who works at a plastic surgery place. Like I guess the DOC over there needed pictures of her stomach or something to see if she was a candidate. I don't know. But when we called her up, she basically told us the whole story. So getting back to what you found on your wife's phone, do these pictures look more scientific or are they definitely like sexy time pictures? Oh, no, there's nothing clinical about these pictures. They are totally all about the sex. She's like, she's in the bathtub, she's posing, she's pouting. She's like looking at the camera she's touching herself. There is one with in a like it is definitely okay 100% sexual. Alright, and so keep going. And you said you have no idea who she's sending these to. Well, that's that's why I called you guys. I, I can't I'm finding it difficult bringing it up with her. So yeah, I need to find out. Okay, so the mission today is to find out who she's sending these pics of herself to. Yeah, help. Yeah. You know, she could be putting together one of those sexy photo shoot thingy book thingies, you know, like for Valentine's Day. Has she ever done that before? Anything? Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, well, not for me anyway. Well, do you know if she's mentioned it like have any of her friends done it for their husbands or boyfriends? Um, I, I'm not really sure this is the first I've ever heard of anybody doing that to be exact. But no, I don't think so. I'll bet you that's what it is. Okay. Well, if it is that I'll put my hands up and say I'm paranoid, but I generally don't think that's what it is. Okay, well, let's find out. So this is gonna be tricky cause we have no number right? Like you don't know for a fact that she sent it to some guy and here's his number. No, no, I have no idea who she's sending them to. Okay, shag, let's Let's do this. Get his wife's number, okay? And then text her a message. Something like this. Something like, hey, guess who got a new phone? And then right, here's a hint, I know what you look like in the bathtub. Okay? And then put like hard eyes or winky face, whatever. Let's see what she texts back and then we'll decide what we wanna do from there when we come back. Now let's get to what we texted shag, why you read what you texted to her, to Heather, to Colin's wife. Guys, kind of like what you said. I wrote, hey, guess who got a new phone? Here's a hint, I know what you look like in a bathtub. And then I did the little heart eyes. Okay? And read what she wrote back. Okay? What she wrote back, she said, hey baby, so is this your new phone? Okay, so, okay, so listen, in a sec, I want you to write her back, right? Yes, give me a call real quick, but call me on my work phone and then give her the hotline number so she calls us instead. Okay? Don't do it yet, ash. If she calls the hotline, when you answer, just say this. Say good morning. Thank you for calling. How may I direct your call? Okay? That way she'll ask for whoever she thinks she's calling.

Can you be more clear? Yeah, sure. I bet you'd appreciate that. And probably your husband, too. Wow. We got an email from a guy named Luke who said that he went out with you. He said that he met you when he was at your office applying for a job. He had a job interview. He said he was in the lobby trying to open the door but couldn't get the door open. Right. And you helped him out. And then you guys that. Oh, no, no, no. I. Okay. Okay. So wait, that part happened. Yeah, that Part did happen. I think I just realized who you're talking about.

No, I I was interviewing him for a position at our company. Wait, you were the one doing the interview? Yes. I'm so confused. He said that he just met you at that office and struck up a conversation. You guys went to drinks, had fun, even kissed at the end of the night and now you're not calling him back? He said we kissed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said that you guys kissed and everything seemed to be going great and he was surprised that you didn't want to go on another date with him. Oh my God. He even went into like graphic detail about the kiss that how it was wet and you licked your lips. Jesus Christ. I okay, look, so wait, you didn't kiss him? No, there is no way. No, absolutely not. Let me just tell you what actually happened cause this is this is bizarre. Okay. I'm I'm tired of hearing all this stuff. Okay, look, this young man Luke came in for a job interview, brought him into my office, sat down, interviewed. We went over his resume. He was kind of fidgety. He was kind of acting a little strange and I sent Him on his way. And in the last couple days, I've been getting flooded with emails, phone calls, messages asking about the job. Oh, my God. So, so you didn't even hire him? No, he has not been hired. He told us differently. What was he like in the job interview? He was just kind of all over the place. You know, he, he just wasn't an ideal candidate. I don't know. He was acting strange. Maybe he was stoned. I don't know. Stoned? Come on. What is happening? That is Luke. He was actually on the other night listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you.

She waved at him a few times. He's just ignored her. She walked up to his door to try to say hi and he just shut it in her face. And then she made him some cookies, left it on his porch with a little note. He walked outside, stomped out the cookies and then kicked the plate. And she has no idea why this guy doesn't like her so much. she got a hold of the homeowner association and got his phone number and now she's about to call him and see if she can figure it out.

I mean, it's not that I can't stand someone not liking me, but I want people to be decent with me. You know what I mean? Okay. Like at least treat me like a human being.

I don't, I don't even know who you are. I mean, you know, you've seen me.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's Fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

My math teacher thought I didn't speak Spanish. Big mistake. I was born in California, but my parents came from Colombia. When they were teenagers, at home, we spoke Spanish every single day. My mom would cook while telling me stories about her childhood in Bogota. My dad would watch soccer games and yell at the TV in Spanish. But at school, I always spoke English. It just felt more natural with my friends. Miss Graham was new to our school district. She transferred from some rural area upstate where apparently nobody looked like me. From Day 1, she made comments about the diversity programs and how standards were dropping, but she said it quietly, thinking none of us understood. During my second week in her algebra class, I was presenting a group project about linear equations. I made a small error while explaining one of the steps. No big deal happens to everyone. But Miss Graham leaned over to the teaching assistant and whispered in Spanish, Otra parea suzhenten nuca es walsa. Another lazy one. Her people never try hard. I froze. Did this woman really just call me lazy in Spanish right in front of me? I kept my face neutral and pretended I didn't understand, but inside I was furious. The worst part was she had this smug smile like she'd gotten away with something clever. I went home that night and told my mom everything. My mom works. Two jobs, cleaning offices at night and doing alterations during the day. She doesn't take disrespect from anybody, especially not some teacher insulting her daughter. But instead of marching to the principal's office like I expected, she sat down at our kitchen table and started planning. Mihow, we're going to be smart about this, she said. Keep track of everything, she says. Write it down with dates and times. And whatever you do, don't let her know you speak Spanish. For the next two weeks, I played completely dumb in math class. Miss Graham kept making comments in Spanish, thinking she was safe. She called me and other Hispanic students lazy, said our parents probably didn't care about education, even joke to the ta that we'd probably drop out anyway. I documented everything in a notebook word for word. The parent teacher conferences were scheduled for a Thursday evening. My mom took off work early, which was a big deal because she needed every hour. We walked into that classroom together and Miss Graham immediately got that condescending look teachers get when they think they're dealing with parents who don't speak English. Ah, we might need to call for a translator, Miss Graham said to the assistant principal who was also in the room for these meetings. She said it slowly and loudly.

My family still makes me weigh myself before holiday dinners. Not joking. My Aunt Rose keeps a scale by her front door specifically for me. Growing up as the fat cousin shaped everything about family gatherings. Even though I lost 140 pounds three years ago, they refuse to see it. I wear oversized hoodies to every family event now. The baggy clothes hide my body because years of their comments train me to cover up. They make me enter through the garage because they claim the front steps can't support me. My cousin Derek still calls me Big Mac and makes earthquake sound effects when I walk. Last Christmas, they gave me a group gift of weight loss surgery pamphlets and a biggest loser DVD set. Thanksgiving this year was what revealed everything. The entire extended family was there, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, second cousins, everyone. My grandmother had rented a huge cabin for the weekend. The torture started immediately when I walked in. Uncle Edward yelled across the room that they'd reinforced the deck chairs. Don't want another incident like the fourth of July. He laughed. There was no incident on the fourth of July. The whole room erupted in laughter. My cousin Marissa grabbed my plate at dinner before I could. I'll serve you. She announced. Portion control is important. She put three green beans and a spoonful of Turkey on my plate. Nothing else. When I reached for the Mashed potatoes. She slapped my hand. Those aren't for you. My teenage cousins started a betting pool on whether I'd sneak food later. They used a whiteboard in the living room to track their bets where everyone could see. Twenty dollars. Said I'd raid the fridge by midnight. 30 said I'd eat a whole pie. After dinner, they made me sit on the floor. The couch has a weight limit, Aunt Rose explained to her new boyfriend. We have to be careful. She said it like I wasn't even there, like I was some kind of safety hazard. I tried to tell them about my transformation. I've lost a lot of weight. I started. Derek burst out laughing so hard he spit out his drink. Sure, you have Big Mac. What did you lose? Five pounds. The room exploded. Even my mom was giggling. Honey, stop making things up, she said. It's okay to be who you are. The worst part came during family photos. They made me stand in the back corner for balance, the photographer said, after my aunt whispered something to him. Then my Uncle Edward announced I should probably skip the group jump photo. Safety first, he said, patting his stomach and winking at everyone. My cousin filmed the whole thing for her Instagram story. The caption read, Chunky's still dreaming of being skinny with crying, laughing emojis. That's when the cabin owner walked in with his son to say hi to everyone. The son stopped. Dead in his tracks staring at me. He was this athletic guy in his 30s. Looked like he lived at the gym. No way, he said. His voice cutting through the chatter. Are you Benson Clark, the gym trainer? My Aunt Rose laughed him. He can barely transform himself to the couch. The man ignored her completely. His excitement was building. This is insane, dad. This is the guy I told you about. He saved my life. The room went quiet. My Uncle Edward snorted. Chunky saved your life? What did he do? Eat all the donuts before you could get diabetes? The man's face went serious. Two years ago, I weighed 300 pounds. I found his program when I was planning to end everything. He runs one of the best transformation programs out there. I lost 100 pounds. Pulled out his phone, showing before and after photos. This man owns a chain of successful gyms. Major companies pay him massive sponsorships. He's transformed thousands of lives. My Aunt Rose's smile froze. That's, that's impossible. He works at a fast food place. The man looked confused. Fast food? He just bought the entire.

When I was eight, my cousin Tiffany came to live with us for six months while her parents sorted out their divorce. I'd always wanted a sister, and suddenly having a 12 year old girl in the house who knew about makeup and had actual opinions about music seems like winning the lottery. My mom set up the guest room for her with new curtains and cleared out half the closet. Dad built an extra shelf for her books. My little brother Sean, who was only five then, followed her everywhere until she taught him a secret handshake that made him feel special. The first weekend Tiffany was with us, she suggested we build a time capsule. We collected items all week. I contributed my favourite marble, Sean added a plastic Dinosaur, mom put in a recipe card, and dad included a baseball card. Tiffany added something wrapped in tissue paper that she wouldn't show anyone. This stays sealed until exactly 10 years from now, Tiffany said. As we buried it under the old maple tree in the backyard. We marked the spot with rocks arranged in a circle. Every Sunday became capsule checking day, where we'd go out to make sure the rocks hadn't been disturbed. Sometimes Tiffany would press her ear to the ground and claim she could hear our treasures talking to each other. Sean believed her completely. I pretended to believe, but secretly knew. Better still, I played along. In Month four, our neighbours Adrian and Yasmin, invited us to their daughter Molly's birthday party. Molly was Tiffany's age and they become friends at school. The day before the party, I overheard mom on the phone. I know it's difficult, but you need to make a decision soon, mom said. She's doing well here, but she asks about you everyday. That night, Tiffany taught me to braid my hair. Her fingers worked quickly and I sat perfectly still, afraid any movement might make her stop. When she finished, she took a picture with her disposable camera. This is how I'll remember you, she said. At Molly's party, the adults gathered in the kitchen while us kids played games in the basement. I noticed Tiffany kept checking the stairs. Molly's mom called everyone up for cake. Tiffany pulled me aside. I have to tell you something, she whispered. I'm going back home next week. The cake tasted like nothing. After that. I watched Tiffany laugh with Molly and the other older girls. She seemed happy, not like someone about to leave everything behind on her last night with us. We had pizza, Tiffany's favorite, with extra cheese. Dad made ice cream sundaes, and mom gave Tiffany a necklace with a tiny silver heart. Sean cried when he found out she was leaving and refused to do their secret handshake. It won't be special anymore if we do it when I'm leaving, Tiffany explained. After Sean went to bed, Tiffany and I Sat on the porch swing. I wanted to ask her why she had to go, why she couldn't just stay with us forever. But instead, I asked about the time capsule. What did you put in there that you wouldn't show us? A letter to you, she said. About why I really came to stay here. The next morning, her dad picked her up in a car I'd never seen before. Mom hugged him. For a long time, Tiffany hugged each of us. But when she got to me, she whispered, remember 10 years? We got two postcards from her that summer. Then Christmas cards for a few years. Then nothing. Mom said, people get busy. Dad said, that's just how life works sometimes. When I was 13, Sean wanted to dig up the time capsule early. I wouldn't let him. I promised Tiffany we'd wait the full 10 years. Last month marked exactly 10 years. I came home from college for the weekend and went straight to the maple tree. The rocks were gone. Landscapers had redone the yard years ago. I dug where I thought the capsule should be. Nothing. I tried another spot. Nothing again. I was about to give up when my shovel hit something.

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. 3,000 dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you, you sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake? Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name. And track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look, the same guilty look they've been giving each other for months. Whenever grandma brought up gifts or money, I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The Same design, the same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop, making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought you a 3,000 dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara's been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents cause last month she asked me for $20 for gas money. The month before that, she needed $50 for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Lauren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Alara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing and everyone at the table knew it. Grandma leaned forward. Her eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

Now they're homeless with kids and I refuse to let them back in my life. When I was 22, I inherited our grandmother's house, a beautiful Victorian with enough space for my brother and his family to stay while they saved for their own place. They moved in with their two kids, promising it would only be temporary. Just six months, my brother assured me, will be out of your hair before you know it. His wife despised me from day one. She'd make snide comments about how I decorated, complained that I was too loud when I came home from my nursing shifts and acted like I was invading her space in my own house. She'd rearrange my kitchen without asking, throw away my mail, claiming it was junk, and lecture me about proper household management while I was paying all the bills. The passive aggression escalated weekly. She'd use my expensive shampoo, then deny it when confronted. My leftovers would disappear from the fridge and she'd claim she thought they were communal food when I started labelling everything with my name. She complained to my brother that I was being petty and territorial. I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour, but he always made excuses. She's stressed about money. She's not used to living with other people. You're being too sensitive. Every conversation ended with him defending her and dismissing my concerns. The breaking point came six Months later, I arrived home exhausted from a double shift to find her screaming at me in the hallway. She claimed I've been stealing money from her purse and eating her food from the fridge. Both accusations were ridiculous. I made decent money and kept my own groceries clearly labeled. You've been sneaking into our room, she shrieked, her face red with manufactured rage. I know you took $40 from my wallet last Tuesday. I stared at her in disbelief. I worked 12 hour shifts. When exactly would I have time to rifle through your belongings? Don't lie to me, she spat. I, I have proof. My brother stood behind her, silent as she launched into a tirade about how I was jealous of their family and trying to sabotage their marriage. When I tried to defend myself, she burst into tears and ran to their room. That night, my brother knocked on my door. His face was stone cold, a look I'd never seen directed at me before. We need to talk, he said. He told me his wife had been documenting everything. Times I allegedly took money instant. This is where I supposedly threatened her when he wasn't around. Photos of missing food items. None of it was true, but he believed every word. She'd created a detailed log with dates, times and descriptions of my supposed crimes. You're toxic and you're tearing our family apart, he said. We're done enabling your behavior. I stared at him in Disbelief. This was the same brother who'd cry.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried. To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. She's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

My son turned eight last Saturday and his mom threw him this huge party at her parents house with bouncy castles and a magician, probably 50 people there. I showed up with my gift wrapped in newspaper because I couldn't afford wrapping paper. And my ex wife's sister actually laughed out loud when she saw it. Her husband pulled me aside and said I should be embarrassed showing my face here when everyone knows I'm three months behind on child support and asked if I even knew what grade he was in. I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence. Her mom kept making these loud comments about how some fathers actually provide for their children. And her dad walked past me carrying my son's new bike and said maybe someday I could afford to buy my child something that didn't come from a thrift store. When they brought out the cake and my son wanted me to stand next to him for photos, his grandmother literally stepped in front of me and said they wanted pictures with people who were actually Part of his life. I watched my boy's face fall and it took everything in me not to say something, but I knew they'd just use it against me. Court, my ex wife's aunt asked me directly in front of everyone if I was still working that pathetic warehouse job or if I've been fired from that too. And when I said I was still there, she said at least my son would learn what not to become. My ex wife stood there telling her cousins that I lived in some disgusting studio apartment and probably spent my child support money on beer while her sister nodded along and said some people just aren't meant to be fathers and that's okay. That's when a Grace Dan pulled up and this exhausted looking woman got out carrying a thick folder and walking straight through the party toward me like everyone else was invisible. She looked distressed and said she was sorry but this couldn't wait another day because the state was threatening to pull the placement if she didn't get the inspection done immediately. My ex wife's mom immediately stepped forward and demanded to know who this woman was and what the hell she was talking about. The woman said she was from Child Protective Services and she needed to inspect my home for the foster placement renewal and verify the twins were still thriving. My ex wife's sister went completely white and whispered, what twins? The social worker flipped through Her papers and said she was talk.

Just to annoy them. My parents were incredibly strict about screen time when I was growing up. One hour a day, no exceptions, no negotiating. My mom would literally set a kitchen timer when I logged on. When that thing rang, I had 30 seconds to shut everything down or I'd lose screen privileges for a week. Didn't matter if I was saving a game, watching a movie or in the middle of a school assignment. Time was time. So at 14, I found a loophole. The rule said very specifically, one hour of screen time. That was the phrase. No qualifiers, no details, just screen time. So I decided to maliciously comply in the most annoying, obnoxious way I could think of. I started using my one hour in the most unproductive, mind numbing and absolutely ridiculous ways possible. I'd boot up the computer, then spend 20 full minutes just staring at the loading screen of a game I never actually played. Or I'd open Microsoft Word and type complete gibberish random strings of letters like d, F, F, J, class, Jeff, ol Kashi while making over the top sounds of excitement. Wow, this is so fun, I'd say dramatically. Best screen time ever. Sometimes I'd open up paint, draw one pixel and then sit back and admire it like it was the Mona Lisa. My mom got confused at first. She peeked in during one of these Sessions and asked if something was wrong with the game. Nope, I replied cheerfully, just enjoying my screen time. It only got weirder from there. I watched the Windows defragmentation tool. I mean, watched it like it was a nature documentary. Oh look, block 42 just moved. I'd narrate in fake excitement. The breaking point came one afternoon when my dad walked into the kitchen and found me sitting cross legged in front of the microwave. I wasn't cooking anything meaningful, just heating up a mug of water, timer set for 15 minutes. And I was staring at the digital display completely zoned in like I was watching the series finale of my favorite show. My dad blinked. What are you doing using my screen time? I said innocently, this is a screen, right? I didn't even blink, just kept watching the numbers tick down. 1342, 1341. That was the beginning of the end. I kept pushing it, sat in front of the washing machine while it.

And you said no. My daughter had one of these encounters and it worked out well. She was a psychiatric nurse working on the crisis team but hoping to be able to work in the perinatal area. Unfortunately, there was no perinatal service in that area. One day she happened to be in the office at the hospital when a man came in and said, look, my daughter needs an impatient mental health bed now. She said, you could be right, sir, but I have just had a patient admitted to the last available one. We'll do what we can until another becomes available. He said, do you know who I am? She said she had no idea. He told her he was a senior politician in the cabinet. I will not name him as he was a good constituency MP. She told him that if mental health services were not so underfunded, she probably could have helped his daughter faster. She said, this is the sharp end of the funding decisions you make in cabinet and gave him the phone number of the local private clinic. He went away clearly annoyed, but a few weeks later she was owned by the head of mental health for her county and was told that more money had been released to set up a perinatal service and they wanted her to set it up and run it. Which she did. I don't think it was a coincidence that the money suddenly became available. Whether or not, he said, and I want that bulshy woman who cared enough about her patients to take me to task to run it, we don't know. This was some years ago now, and I admire him for doing something about it.

I have four significantly older siblings. All of them are now married. I was not invited to any of their weddings because each of them had a child free wedding. I, of course, thought I'd be the only exception as I am their sibling. But no. My oldest sibling first had a child free wedding and then the others decided to follow. When my oldest brother got married, I was 10 years old, so sure, I kind of understood why they didn't invite me, but I was still extremely upset. My oldest brother got married to a woman I really love and I couldn't even be there to witness it. The other brother got married when I was 12 years old. Yet again I wasn't invited. I still sort of understood, but when I was 12 years old, I was a very well behaved child and at the same time, his sibling. My sister got married when I was 15 years old. At first she didn't want a child free wedding, but all of the family members convinced her because OMG, it's so refreshing to be in a wedding where children don't bring havoc. So she decided to cut out everyone who was under 16 years old. When I asked if I could be an exception, since I was 15 at the time and her sister, she said no with a very serious tone. If We make an exception for you. What about other children? It's not fair! I got upset and screamed that it wasn't fair not to participate in any of my siblings weddings. My parents got upset with me and grounded me for six months. Lastly, my brother got married when I was 17 years old. I thought surely I'd be invited to this one. But at that point I didn't care. I knew it was going to be a child free wedding and somehow I wouldn't be invited as I guessed. I was right. I didn't ask or beg. My step cousin who just turned 18 just made the cut and I didn't. Well, as I said, I didn't care. I sent a quick congrats text and that was it. My parents got furious about why I didn't even congratulate them properly. I just ignored them and spent all the time in my room with my now soon to be husband. Since I'm getting married now, I decided none of them will be at my wedding since I wasn't allowed to be at theirs when they didn't get the invitation.

Instead of waiting for my husband and son to come home to celebrate with me, I received a video from my husband's first girlfriend. In the video, my husband and my son were with her, and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. After seeing that, instead of calling him to confront him, I silently packed my suitcase and signed the divorce papers. It was unusual for my husband Dominic to come home at midnight and find the house completely dark. No matter what time it was, I always left a light on for him. That night, he handed our son Grayson over to the housekeeper and went straight to the master bedroom. I was sitting on the sofa with a carefully packed suitcase by my side and the I divorce agreement on the coffee table in front of me. Dominic frowned. Paisley, what is this? Another one of your dramatics? I didn't have the strength for his criticism. My voice came out calm and firm. I want a divorce! His face showed disbelief. Why? Because I forgot your birthday? It doesn't matter, I replied, pushing the divorce agreement toward him. Sign it. Let's end this. He flipped through the pages mockingly. You're leaving empty handed? Where will you go without me? A bitter laugh escaped my lips. He was so sure he had me trapped. Thinking I had no one in hierofel and nothing to hold on to, I pushed the Papers even closer. Sign it. Don't waste time. For a moment he hesitated, then his voice hardened. Fine. Divorce it is. But Sonny's custody is not negotiable. You won't get him. Suddenly Grayson appeared, looking at me with tears streaming down his cheeks. I'm staying with dad. I don't want to go with you. You're a horrible mother, a witch! That's enough, Grayson! Dominic snapped. But Grayson's rage didn't subside. If you hadn't gotten in the way of dad and Marissa, she'd be my mom now. I cut the tension with that same cold voice. I don't care, Grayson. I don't care about anything. I just want the divorce. That word left Dominic in silence. He clenched his jaw and his eyes darkened with frustration. Are you sure about this? I tossed the pen onto the table. Sign it. Let's end this. Dominic's frustration gave way to a flicker of doubt. Before he could sign, I grabbed my copy, took my suitcase, and headed for the door. Tomorrow at 9 a m. Sharp at City hall. Don't be late, I said without hesitation. Just as I was about to walk out, Dominic grabbed my wrist tightly. Let go! I said coldly. He sneered. In such a rush to leave? You already have a lover. I looked him straight in the eyes. If you don't want to wait for part 2, you can watch the full story on my YouTube channel.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. Bouncing between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they Sent me. I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

But her face immediately dropped when she realized that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. He couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, she tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd de flesh, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a blanket, trust boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait. Com. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to Her surprise, the next day at the hospital. Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me. Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh, really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your tech support agent sending you willy pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you. Anyway, we're done. Wait. Not only did you cheat on me, it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better and pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me? Bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Tight. What do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries his laptop. In a suitcase. So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make a e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it. Once he sends it, block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's got to work in fast food now. And he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. But it's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favorite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10 and he'll get a warning. With this, do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food. Now he can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water. Add on that if he does this, he gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me! You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

My roommate Lisa was doing her nightly skincare routine when we heard glass breaking downstairs. She just applied a thick green face mask and was wearing her ratty bathrobe with hair and rollers. Did you hear that? I whispered. Lisa grabbed her phone to call 9 1 1, but then got this evil grin. Wait, I have a better idea. She crept to the top of the stairs and let out the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard, then started speaking in tongues. Literally just gibberish that sounded vaguely Latin. Spiritus Malum, enter this vessel. I heard the burglar drop something and curse. Lisa crawled down the stairs backwards like the girl from the Exorcist, still screaming in her made up demon language. The green face mask was cracking, making her look legitimately terrifying. The burglar was backing toward the window when our other roommate, Ben, emerged from his room. He immediately caught on. The possession is spreading! He yelled. Everyone get the salt! Ben started throwing table salt everywhere while chanting the Pokemon theme song in a deep, ominous voice. The burglar was now pressed against the wall. Our TV forgotten on the floor. Please, he begged. I'll leave. I'm sorry. Lisa's head snapped toward him. She put in her glow in the dark Halloween contacts. In the dim light, her eyes were literally glowing green. You disturbed the ritual, she growled. That's when our fourth roommate, Kevin, joined in. He Emerged, playing his violin badly, just screeching notes while swaying like he was in a trance. The demons need music! Ben shouted, now drawing symbols on the wall with ketchup. Play louder! The burglar tried to run, but Lisa's spider walked toward him at surprising speed. He actually screamed. I need an old priest and a young priest, I yelled, getting into it. I'm Protestant! The burglar cried. I don't know any priests! Lisa stood up suddenly, did a perfect backbend and whispered, then you're screwed! The man literally wet himself. I saw the stain spreading on his jeans. Kevin's violence screeching intensified. Ben was now speaking in Klingon. Lisa started doing that creepy clicking sound from the grudge. The burglar fell to his knees. What do you want from me? Your soul, Lisa hissed. Or your confession? I'll confess. I've robbed 12 houses. I'll tell you everything! He started listing addresses, eightes where he'd sold stuff. Ben was frantically taking notes while still pretending to be possessed. When the cops arrived, they found a burglar in tears, begging for an exorcist. Lisa, still in full green face mask and glowing contacts. Catch up! Demon symbols on our walls. Kevin playing my heart will go on badly on violin, Ben reading the burglar his rights in Klingon. The burglar immediately confessed to everything. Begged the cops to take him to a church instead of jail. Kept asking if we were really human. The officer looked at Lisa. Ma'am, what exactly Happened here. Skincare night, she said sweetly. Very important for your pores. They took the burglar away. I was muttering about the green demon and violent of the damned. Cops came back later for our statements. One of them finally cracked. In 20 years on the force, I've never had a purse bag for holy water in the squad car. Turns out the burglar had been hitting houses in our area for months. His full confession cleared over a dozen cases. The detective said whatever you did probably saved him from years more crime. He found religion real quick. Already signed up for seminary school. Lisa's review of her fake

My mom kept borrowing money from my savings account without asking. Started small when I was 15, 20 here, 50 there. Always promised, I'll pay you back next week, sweetheart. I was saving for my first car, working weekends at Scoops Ice Cream downtown. The job absolutely sucked. Sticky floors covered in melted ice cream, screaming kids having sugar meltdowns and my chain smoking manager, Derek, who reeked of cigarettes. After two grueling years of scooping rocky road and mopping chocolate spills every night, I'd saved almost $3,000. Then I checked my balance at the ATM. 8, 47, 32, my heart stopped. I drove straight home, found mom making fancy curried coffee with expensive pods she claimed we couldn't afford. Mom, where's my money? She didn't look. Oh, honey, I needed it for groceries. Things are tight since the divorce. You'll get it back. But groceries don't cost $2,000. I started watching her spending. New coach purse from the outlet mall, weekly salon appointments for highlights, fancy dinners with club friends every Friday, all while telling me we had to tighten our belts and couldn't afford name brand cereal I liked. I felt sick. This was my money from my job dealing with brain freeze headaches in that walk in freezer every single night. When I confronted her again, she got defensive. I'm your mother, Jessica. I've spent way more than 3,000 raising you over 17 years. Consider this paying me back. For all those diapers and formula. That comment made my blood boil. That's when I knew I had to be smart about this. During lunch break, I went to First National Bank and asked to speak with someone about my account to tell her. Margaret pulled up my statements, her face changing as she scrolled through months of transactions. Your mom's been withdrawing money almost weekly for six months, I whispered. Since you're a minor, this is technically a joint account, so it's legal. But you can open your own when you turn 18 next month. She leaned closer. Until then, you could withdraw everything and keep it somewhere safe. That night, I didn't confront mom. Instead, I went back the next day and withdrew every penny except $1, opened a new account at Community Credit Union across town that only I could access. For three days, I acted completely normal, went to work, came home, did chemistry homework, watch Netflix with mom like nothing had changed. She had no idea I'd moved my entire life savings. Then Friday night, I heard her giggling on the phone with her friend Linda, planning their weekly book club dinner at that expensive steakhouse downtown. Don't worry about splitting the chat, she laughed. I'll just grab some cash from Jessica's account tomorrow morning. She never checks it anyway. Twenty minutes later, she knocked on my door wearing silk pajamas. Hey, sweetie, I'm running to the ATM before book club. Need anything from CVS? I smiled innocently. No.

It happened last Tuesday around nine PM. I was at my girlfriend Emma's apartment watching Netflix when she randomly got up and went to her bedroom. I thought she was just going to the bathroom or something, but then she came back holding her dad's old hunting rifle. The thing looked ancient but well maintained. Check this out, she said, pointing it directly at my forehead from maybe three feet away. My dad taught me how to use this when I was 12. I literally froze. Like, completely stopped breathing for a second. The barrel was staring me right in the face, and all I could think was how massive it looked from that angle. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Emma, what the hell are you doing? I managed to say, trying not to move. She laughed like it was the funniest thing ever. Relax, it's not loaded. See? She pulled the trigger and nothing happened except for a loud click. But hearing that click while looking down the barrel made my stomach drop into my shoes. Are you insane? You never point a gun at someone, loaded or not. I was practically yelling at this point. She rolled her eyes. God, you're such a baby. It's empty. I checked. My dad always kept the ammo locked up separately anyway. But here's the thing. I grew up around guns, too. My uncle took me Hunting every fall since I was 10, and the first rule he drilled into my head was, you never, ever point a firearm at anything you don't intend to destroy. Look, loaded or unloaded? Doesn't matter. It's like gun safety 1:01. Emma, this isn't a joke. That's literally the most dangerous thing you can do with a gun. I said, standing up slowly with my hands visible. Even if you think it's empty. She was still holding it casually, like it was a toy or something. You're being dramatic. I've handled this gun a million times. That's when I decided to prove my point. I asked her to hand me the rifle, and she did. Still thinking I was overreacting, I pointed it toward the ground. And. Work.

My parents discovered I wasn't their biological child when I was 16, not through some dramatic DNA test, through my little sister's science project. She was doing genetics homework, mapping out eye colours and couldn't make our family tree work. Brown eyes plus brown eyes can't make blue eyes, he said, pointing at me. Mom went white. Dad started stuttering about recessive genes. That night I heard them screaming through the walls. Mom admitted she'd had an affair 17 years ago. Dad wasn't my father. The man who raised me, taught me to ride a bike, helped with homework for 16 years, suddenly looked at me like I was a stranger. The change was immediate and brutal. Dad stopped coming to my baseball games. I tried talking to him. He'd respond with one word answers or just leave the room. Mom kept insisting nothing had changed, but she'd flinch whenever dad was cold to me. Then came the comparisons. Every family dinner became a catalog of how my sister and I were different. Look how naturally athletic Sophie is, dad would say, watching her throw a ball. She gets that from me. The implication hung in the air like poison. They started treating me like a house guest. My curfew got earlier while my sister stayed the same. My allowance got cut because money is tight. But Sophie got new clothes whenever she asked. When I brought it up, mom said I was being Dramatic. The worst part was watching them rewrite history. Photos of me got moved to the back of albums. My baby pictures disappeared from the mantle. Dad started telling stories about Sophie's milestones while pretending mine never happened. It was like they were erasing 16 years. My breaking point came during Christmas. Extended family was over and Uncle Mike asked about my college plans. Dad said, well, he's not really academic like Sophie. Different genetics, you know, he said genetics like it was a dirty word. That's when it clicked. They didn't just learn I wasn't blood related. They decided I wasn't family. So I made a choice that destroyed them. I found my biological father. His name was John Sins. He lived three states away, had no idea I existed. When I called him, he cried, actually cried. Said he'd wondered about my mom for years, hoped she was happy. Two weeks later, John drove 400 miles to meet me. He brought photo albums of his family, told me about my half brother who played baseball like me, showed me pictures of my real grandmother who had died the year before. But here's what broke my parents. John didn't just accept me, he celebrated me. Within a month, he'd driven back twice more. He came to my games, met my friends, took me car shopping. For my 17th birthday, my parents watched this man give me everything they'd taken away. Dad became obsessed, calling John a stranger, trying to Steal his son. Mom begged me to stop seeing him, said it was destroying our family. I told them they'd already destroyed it. The night they decided biology mattered more than 16 years of love, the final blow came at graduation. Both my family showed up. John sat in the front row cheering.

My girlfriend, Molly, put her hand under my desk. And please, Missus Dodson, you have to legally let us go. Missus Hy Dodson was crying now with mascara running down her cheeks. I'm sorry, but if I let you all run out of the class, the gunman might get you. We need to wait. I looked at Molly and tried to keep my voice steady. Don't worry, babe, I'm going to figure out a way out of this. Missus Dodson had kept our entire class trapped in the room. She'd been acting strange all week, but today she locked the door during last period because she sensed a warning. Missus Dodson suddenly screamed and pointed at the door there. Did you hear those gunshots? Everyone get down. We all looked at each other confused, but Missus Dodson was shaking and clutching a rosary to her chest. She heard it all, 20 of us to the back corner of the room furthest from the windows. She started praying in Latin while we huddled together. Some kids were crying. Others were texting their parents frantically. The school had probably already called wondering where we were. Basketball practice had started two hours ago. Drama rehearsal was happening without half the cast. This is Datson. I have an idea, I said, interrupting her prayer. How about you let us out through the window since we're Only on the first floor and we can all escape and get help. She shook her head violently. No, the government has friends outside. They'll shoot all of you the second you climb out. I won't let you leave. She started going around hugging each student and telling them she loved them. Kids were flinching away from her touch. This woman who usually graded papers with perfect posture was now wild eyed and sweating through her cardigan. Bradley was the class troublemaker who usually slept through lessons, stood up and crossed his arms. Missus Dodson, you're so insane that you make me want to actually do my homework. Let us out, you crazy witch. School dismissal was four hours ago. Her face twisted into something ugly. The only dismissal you're going to have is straight to hell. I should let you out of the classroom and let the gunman unload on you. Fine, then let's do it. Bradley walked toward the door. Missus Dodson immediately crumbled. I'm sorry, sweetie, you know I can't let you leave here. I have to keep the door locked so I can protect you all. While she was focused on Bradley and trying to pull him back to the group, I saw my chance. Her keys were hanging from her belt loop. I carefully reached over and unclip them, trying not to jingle the metal. Molly saw what I was doing, created more distraction by fake crying loudly. I crawled toward the door, staying low. Like we were actually in danger. I didn't realize till later that we really were. My hands were shaking as I found the right key. The lock clicked open and I yanked the door handle. Run, I shouted. All 20 students rushed for the door at once. Missus Dodson screamed and tried to grab people, but we pushed past her. We ran down the hallway and burst through the front entrance into the parking lot where police cars were everywhere. The cops had their hands on their weapons until all they saw it was just a bunch of terrified teenagers. They immediately asked us what happened. Our teacher went insane and trapped us in there for four hours. I told the nearest officer. He nodded grimly. We're sorry we took so long. We just got the call about you guys. After we searched in Missus Dodson's house, you won't believe what we found. Full story on channel link below.

I was 12 when my stepdad Mark gave me a cute nickname and that was a lazy n word. You see, for two years straight, Mark had one rule. I wasn't allowed to sleep. While my white siblings could sleep from eleven PM to 7:00am, I was only allowed to sleep from 12:00am to 4:00am. Luckily, I didn't even have to set an alarm clock because every morning at 4:00am, Mark would burst into my room with a flashlight in my face checking if I was ready to do my character building chores. This include it's scrubbing bathrooms, organizing the garage, prepping breakfast for when his boys woke up. But that wasn't even the worst part because if I made any sort of noise, I'd lose privileges. The privilege just in question, eating enough food, drinking enough water. And since my mom worked 12 hour night shifts as a nurse, she never saw any of it. Mark had this whole philosophy about modern kids being soft. When I was in Afghanistan, he'd start every lecture. We functioned on two hours of sleep for weeks. Kids today can't even handle getting up early. I'm sure you can guess why. His rules only applied to me. By month 3, I was practically schizophrenic with how much I was hallucinating, shadows moving in my peripheral vision, hearing my name when no one called. I'd fallen asleep on the toilet twice at my desk, dozens Of times and once while standing in the shower. The other black kids at my school started calling me the raccoon N word because of the dark circles under my eyes. My grades made like a girl's chest during puberty when from A's to D's, all because I couldn't stay conscious long enough to finish tests. Teachers thought I was on drugs and said I fit the stereotype. Even the counselor pulled me aside ask if everything was okay at home. The breaking point came during midterms. I literally fell asleep standing up during my history presentation, face planted right into the whiteboard. Twenty minutes later, the school nurse called my parents and Mark showed up in his veterans cap like he was on a rescue mission. This is what I'm talking about, he said, shaking his head in the nurse's office. No self control. I've tried everything, structure, discipline, consequences. Some kids just don't want to succeed. The counselor ate up every word. I don't blame you, Mark. Most white folk wouldn't even bother trying to civilize a kid like this. You're fighting genetics here. I tried telling my mom when I got home, but she was exhausted after a double shift and Mark was right there, arm around her shoulders. He's exaggerating, Mark said calmly. Teen boys are dramatic. Just teaching him discipline, bruh, I only get 4 hours of sleep, I managed to whisper. Mark laughed. See what I mean? The kid can't even keep his lies. Straight. My mom just sat there saying nothing. Plus, didn't your guys ancestors used to spend all day in the cotton field? Anyway, you should be used to this by now. He then threw his head back and cackled. That's when I realized my mom was too scared of Mark to defend me. I wanted to call CPS, but I knew Mark would just sweet talk his way out of it. So instead I did something I never done before. I went through my mom's jewelry box to find my dead dad's old phone there, found his brother Jerome's number. I texted him on my phone and asked if he wanted to go on a run with me at 4:00am. Mark would be at his peak performance by then. When he agreed, I felt a chaotic excitement fill my veins. So on Thursday night, I made sure to be extra lazy at dinner, dozed off twice, knocked over my water. Mark's eye twitched with anticipation. Looks like someone needs extra motivation tomorrow, he said. His boys snickering. At 4:00am sharp, the flashlight hit my face. But this time Mark brought props, a bucket of ice water and an airhorn. He was so excited to abuse me that he didn't even hear the front door open. Rise and shine, you lazy n word, he cheered. Today we're trying something new since you can't seem to be disciplined. He was then interrupted by the sound of my bedroom door creaking open. What The f did you just call my nephew? My uncle's voice bellowed through the house. Behind him, my cousins Desean and Tyrell. Mark's flashlight swung toward them, his face draining color. This.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating. Drunk guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just. Trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her. Eating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height. Told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson real fighters don't fight in bars. Much liability. Too much to lose. My instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements. He slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch. Told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school. He grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about twice. The brunette pulled Away from his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now, some people whispering, shooting me, suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years, was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly, holding it up for the bar to see, while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly, spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up, then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there, doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist, immediately, insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't Safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now, panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day. 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us, real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these baby little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing in her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, Mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel, while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniella had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus. Mom would tell anyone who'd listen. Her sister has blessed three families, while this one hordes her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain, her hips were destroyed, she had constant infections, and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly swollen with pregnancy. No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred, and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes. Started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so severe, they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

Just tell me how big it is. Are you sure? Yes. Tell me. Well, it is really three inches. Three? Stop lying to me. That was way bigger than three. I know, cause I didn't use it. What are you talking about? You said you wanted it to be extremely large and very dark, but I'm extremely light and very small. So I came up with a solution. What was your solution? I turned the lights off and used my fist. Huh? What? Honestly, come back. You hit all of the right spots and there are no pregnancy scares with a fist. So you don't think I should be embarrassed? And you should definitely feel embarrassed. Like I could not imagine having to deal with only 3 inches. But that fist did wonders. I know I lost my whole arm in there. You used your whole arm. Yeah. You kept saying deeper and it just kept going. So that is why I felt it in my lungs all the way from my cat. Yeah. Well, whatever you used, it got the job done. Can I Come clean. Actually. What do you mean come clean? I thought you already did when you said you had 3 inches and just use your fist. It was a joke.

What could it be now you didn't pull out? Actually, yes. What? You try to pull out on time when it is like two foot long. Fair. I'm having a kid, though. What? Why?

Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform, learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes. Bro, we might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humour, same jokes, same energy. And the best part? When you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about. Yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for 3 hours. Then finally, Emma responds with, Oof, feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something, suddenly everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's and invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work, just said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned, and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now, some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years, was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly, holding it up for the bar to see, while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly, spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up, then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist, immediately, insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now, panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for 3 hours. And finally Emma responds with, Oof, feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something, suddenly everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's and invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work, just said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day. 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us, real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these creep be little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, Mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel, while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniella had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus. I would tell anyone who'd listen her sister has blessed three families, while this one hoards her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain, her hips were destroyed, she had constant infections, and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly swollen with pregnancy No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred, and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes. Started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so severe, they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height, told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses. With measured movements, he slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping up everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled.

While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniela had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus, I would tell anyone who'd listen. Her sister has blessed three families, while this one hordes her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain. Her hips were destroyed. She had constant infections and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly, swollen with pregnancy No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes, started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome, so severe they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating. Drunk guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just. Trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his. I told the girl, maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson. Real fighters don't fight in bars. Too much liability. Too much to lose. My instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements, slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned, and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now, some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years, was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly, holding it up for the bar to see, while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly, spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up, then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around. Painted scenarios of what could happen. Happened with me just standing there, doing nothing. If he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist, immediately, insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't Safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now, panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat, asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for three hours, and finally, Emma responds with, Oof. Feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something. Suddenly, everyone was free. During conversations, they'd talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing, because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's. And invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work. Jess said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story. Later that night, he was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident, and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no. Hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help? Tyler hearted the message. That's it? Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help, but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years, and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex, who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything. Called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up. Showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad. I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that. Stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly, and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times, and got shut down. There they were, all six of them, posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day. 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us, real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these creep be little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel, while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniella had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus. I would tell anyone who'd listen her sister has blessed three families, while this one hoards her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain, her hips were destroyed, she had constant infections, and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly swollen with pregnancy No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred, and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes. Started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so severe, they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his. I told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Too much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements, slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now. Some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly holding it up for the bar to see while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up. Then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen happened with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist immediately insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't Safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now. Panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for 3 hours. Then finally, Emma responds with, Oof, feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something, suddenly everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's and invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work, just said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's when I decided to test them. I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no, hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help. Tyler hearted the message. That's it. Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Just texted me privately saying she would help but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything, called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up, showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just a Scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that, stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times and got shut down. There they were, all six of them posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day, 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these creepy little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniela had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree, volunteering At women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus, mom would tell anyone who'd listen. Her sister has blessed three families while this one hordes her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain. Her hips were destroyed. She had constant infections and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back, told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly, swollen with pregnancy No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. As mom punched the needle into my thigh, I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes, started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome, so severe they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height, told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses. With measured movements, he slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping up everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school. He grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about twice the brunette. Pulled away from his hand but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now. Some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly holding it up for the bar to see while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up. Then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist immediately insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets Weren't safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now. Panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It started when Principal Morrison announced the new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to cool and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing? You using wired internet? Sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed played tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV, then used The TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcasted her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediary. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memorability. Pattern 3 teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendance system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aide and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it though. Instead she sold a service. Bring her device, she'd connect it for you, then change your Mac address so it looked like a printer. By week 3, half the school was showing up as HP Laserjet on the network. Why? Why do we have 400 printer? Mr Morrison asked AIT. Those aren't printers, I t replied. Then what are they? Creative student. The arms race escalated. figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there. He used a drone with a camera during lunch when The bathroom was empty. The footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property into the courtyard. Sir, the bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr Morrison put curtains on the bathroom window. But the man masterpiece came from quiet Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those password. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with a password admin 1, 2, 3 and had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be isn't the same as was. Sir, how did you even find it? I didn't. My phone did. I have very aggressive auto connect setting. The breaking point came during standardized testing week. The online test required internet, so they had to give all students the password. Within minutes, someone had shared it on a paper airplane that flew across the gym. Then another student wrote it in chalk on the trap. A third person trained the morning announcements kid to say it phonetically while reading the lunch menu. Chicken Tenders, W1 f 1 p at SF, mashed Potatoes, w 0 r d, green Bean 2 dash 0 dash 2 dash 4 chocolate milk, exclamation point, hashtag dollar sign. Mr Morrison called an emergency assembly. Fine, you win. We're going back to open Wi-Fi with content filter. The auditorium erupted. Marcus raised his hand. Mr Morrison about those content filters, don't just don't already found 17 ways around them. Of course you have. The next day, the Wi-Fi password was, please just use salt responsibly, 2,024. Someone changed it to we promise, wink, 2,024. Within an hour, Mr Morrison pretended not to notice. He was tired. The students had won, and honestly, their grades had improved from all the technical research they've been doing. Sometimes the best victory is knowing when you've been outsmarted by 2,000 teenagers who turned your security system into their favorite class.

Should I tell her? After three months of her girls nights turning into therapy sessions about how marriage was just a trap, I was done fighting. She'd come home at 2:00am, reeking of wine, telling me about her divorced friends, authentic lives, how they were finally free and living their truth. Last week, she and maybe I should have listened when they warned me about settling down. So I stopped trying. Yesterday, she noticed. You're not fighting for us anymore. If you really loved me, you'd wanna fix this. I looked at her calmly. You want me to fight for our marriage? Yes. Obviously. Okay. I pulled out my phone and called her best friend, Janet. The twice divorced one who'd been coaching her. Hey, Janet, it's James. Quick question. Do you think my wife should stay married to someone she regrets being with? My wife's face went white. That's what I thought. Thanks for the honest advice. I hung up and looked at my wife. Janet says you should definitely leave me. Congratulations. Your advisor just made the decision for you. She started crying. That's not what I wanted. Funny, because three months ago you said Janet's advice was the best thing that ever happened to you. But I wasn't done. I called Crystal. Next one who spends weekends bar hopping, crying about how all men are trash. Crystal, hey, my wife's been telling me about your amazing single. Life. Should she join you? Live that authentic truth you guys talk about through the phone? Crystal's voice got quiet. Well, I mean, maybe you two should work it out. Work it out? But you told her marriage was a prison last Tuesday. At least that's what she came home saying. I put the phone on speaker so my wife could hear Crystal back petaling. I was just venting about my own situation. I didn't mean. Oh, so when you said, dump his ass and live for yourself, you were just venting? Silence. Then I called Debbie, the twice divorced one living with her parents at third 5. Debbie, great news! My wife's finally ready to take your advice about leaving me. When can she move in with you and your mom? Move in? I. There's not really room here. But you said independence was worth any sacrifice. My wife was pale, watching her support system crumble in real time. After I hung up, she whispered, they were just trying to help. Debbie's eating cereal for dinner because she can't afford groceries. Crystal hasn't had a second date in two years. Janet's on antidepressants because she's so lonely. You don't understand their situations. I understand perfectly. Three miserable women convinced you to throw away a good marriage so you could be miserable with them. She sat down hard, but they said I deserved better. Better than what? A faithful husband who works two job so you can go to Yoga class. Better than someone who's never lied to you or cheated. The silent stretch. They said marriage kills your soul. Whose soul got killed? Mine. Listening to you repeat their poison every night. Or yours, because you let strangers reprogram you. She started crying again. I don't know what I want anymore. I do. You want their approval more than my love. You got it. The irony. Her friends are now panicking, realizing they pushed to too hard. Janet called later, begging me not to divorce her because she didn't really mean it. Crystal sent flowers with a card. We were just having girl talk. Debbie showed up at our door crying about how sorry she was. Turns out they wanted to live vicariously through her drama, not actually destroy her marriage. They wanted her to flirt with freedom, not actually choose it. Too late. The papers are filed. She's getting exactly what they convincing her she wanted. And now they're stuck watching their project fall apart, knowing they pushed their friend off a cliff just to see if she'd fly. She didn't. She's crashing, and I'm not catching her. This time yesterday, she asked if we could take a break from the divorce proceedings, just until I figure things out. I showed her the apartment listings I'd bookmarked for her. All in Janet's neighborhood, all way above her budget. Your girls can help with rent, right? Since they're so invested in your freedom? She stared at the prices. Video apartments for two thousand eight hundred dollars. One bedrooms for thirty five hundred dollars. I can't afford any of these. That's weird. Janet said money wasn't important when you're living your truth. Her phone buzz. Text from Crystal. Can you cover drinks tonight? I'm broke until payday. Another Buzz. Debbie, mom says I need to find my own place by Christmas. Then Janet, my ex, stopped paying alimony. Know any good lawyers? My wife looked at her phone, then at me. They're all struggling. No kidding. Almost like their advice came from desperation, not wisdom. She put her head in her hands. What have I done? You chose your sisterhood. Enjoy the membership fees. The moving truck comes tomorrow.

My brother Jake, has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I, I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I. Tried to explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with.

Wait till they find out what I do for a living. Seven years since graduation, and these women still had me mentally catalogued as the virgin who cried during health class. Lena took it upon herself to arrange a reunion for our high school friend group. I was curious what everyone had been up to, so I went. Big mistake. Second I walked in. Oh, my god. You look exactly the same. Still our innocent baby. They handed me an actual juice box while they opened three bottles of wine. We got you apple juice since you probably don't drink, Ashland said. Like I was 12. Sit here, sweetie. She pointed to the floor. All of them took the couch and chairs. Every single seat except the floor. So there I was, 25 years old, sitting cross legged on Lena's carpet, holding a juice box while they clinked wine glasses above my head. They really thought I was the same shy bookworm from high school. Sure, ladies. Whatever helps you sleep at night. They started playing Never Have I Ever. But stopped. Actually. Wait. She won't have done anything. Ashley nodded to me, and they all laughed. I sipped my juice box. They told relationship stories, then caught themselves. Oops, forgot innocent ears were here. More laughing. Lena actually covered my ears during one story about her honeymoon. I'm 25 years old, and this grown woman covered my ears. They asked me to grab More wine from the kitchen. We need to discuss something real quick. I knew what this was. I walked slow, came back to sudden silence. They've been talking about me, obviously. We were just saying you'd be perfect for Lena's cousin. He's also. Ashley paused. Inexperienced. They all nodded like they'd solved world hunger. But wait, it got worse. Lena took my phone. No phones during Girls Night. You're always so anti social, reading your little books. My phone literally had 57 unread Instagram notifications. But sure, Lena, I'm anti social. We're going to Ashland's Bachelorette next month, April said. But it might be too much for you. The stripper stuff would make you so uncomfortable. They all agreed I'd be traumatized. Remember when she didn't even know what a thong was? That was freshman year. Eleven years ago. I leaned over to grab my juice box from the side table and saw Ashland's phone lit up next to it, the notification preview at the top. Adults only. No Virgin Mary. April. She actually believes the cousin thing. LMAO. I was about to say something when Lena's boyfriend Mark came home with one of his friends, Cooper. Ashlyn practically ran to stand next to Cooper. Nice to see you again. I wondered how often she was invited over, if she recognized him. Lena introduced me as the most innocent person she knows. Mark barely looked at me. Then his neck snapped to look again. His eyes went wide. Really wide. He pulled out his phone. Type something quick, and his face went from confused to shocked. Holy. Mark showed Cooper his phone. The girls stopped talking. What's wrong? Lena asked. Mark looked at me, then at Lena, then back at me. Your innocent friend is. He couldn't finish. Just turned his phone around. Whatever was on that screen made Cooper's jaw drop. No way. No way. He started frantically googling something. The girls tried to see, but Mark pulled the phone back. She. There's a special guest at Denver Con and Seattle. And Cooper kept scrolling, eyes getting wider. This can't be her, Lena said, trying to grab Mark's phone. She doesn't even wear makeup. But Mark and Cooper were having their own conversation now. Both staring at their phones, then at me, then back at their phones. The one from TikTok, Cooper whispered. 3 million views, Mark confirmed. His eyes went huge. Is that. The girls were getting angry. What are you looking at? Ashlyn demanded. Cooper turned red.

I pretended to be my cousin, the substitute teacher for a day and accidentally got my dream job. I was 19, broke as hell, and still waiting to hear back from community college. My cousin Tyler was a substitute teacher who sometimes paid me to drive him around since his car was trash. One Tuesday morning, he calls me, freaking out. Dude, I just rear ended someone. I'm supposed to be at Westbrook Middle School in 20 minutes. If I miss another day, they'll cut me from their sub list. I was eating cereal in my pajamas. That sucks, man. Wait, he said you still have my school I D. From when you helped me move those boxes last month? Yeah, why? I'm serious. Let's go pretend to be me. Take attendance. Keep them quiet. It's just study hall. I laughed. You're insane. Please. They won't even check. Most subs just sit there anyway. It's one period. Something about the desperation in his voice got to me. Plus, I needed money. I threw on Tyler's spare button down shirt that was way too big and drove to the school with his laminated badge. The front desk lady barely looked up. You must be the sub for Miss Peterson's class. Room 2 13. Here's your clipboard. I walked down that hallway trying to look confident while my heart was pounding. The kids were loud, but not crazy. I took attendance, reading names off The roster. When they asked where their teacher was, I said she had a family emergency and today was independent study. Can we work on homework? This girl asked, absolutely, I said, having no clue what else to tell them. For an hour, I just walked around pretending to supervise while they did whatever. Some kid asked me about math, and I said I'd get back to him. Another wanted to use the bathroom, and I let, like, five kids go because I didn't know the rules. The bell rang, and a whole new group of kids walked in. Nobody had told me there were multiple periods. I panicked, but tried to play it cool. Same routine independent study day. The projector wasn't working, so sorry, no video today. I made them read silently and told them I'd be grading papers instead. I just stared at Tyler's lesson plan book, trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Third period came, then fourth. I was making it up as I went. When kids got too loud, I'd say stuff like, remember, this affects your participation grade, even though I had no idea how grading worked. During lunch, I hid in an empty classroom and texted Tyler updates. He kept saying, you're doing great. Just get through the day. Fifth period, this kid asked me about the Revolutionary War assignment. I panicked and said, what do you think the most important battle was? Then I made them debate It. While I googled stuff on my phone under the desk. By sixth period, I was actually getting comfortable. These kids weren't that different from my little brother and his friends.

Gabby slammed the door shut and crossed her arms, glaring at me. It's freaking nine PM and you pick me up from a party? I placed the car in first gear and drove off, ignoring her snarky attitude. I've told you this before. That neighborhood, those parties there, they get sketchy after 10. She rolled her eyes and placed her feet up on the dash. I'm 16, not 6. I'm an adult. You need to stop treating me like a kid. I sighed. You are a kid, and I'm trying to keep you safe. Why not just enjoy it? She burst out into a harsh laugh. Enjoy it? How can I when you've always got to stick up your bum every time I go to a party? It's so stupid. But ever since mom and dad died, you act like I'm made of glass. News flash, that was seven years ago. All I want is a normal sibling relationship, not a fake parent to replace them. I felt my blood boil at her comment. I pulled over on the side of the road, fighting back my anger. Fine, fine. You know what? You want freedom? Then you can have it. From that moment on, I just left her alone. No more checking in, no more taking care of her. When she asked to go to parties, I Just shrugged. Whatever. Her eyes lit up. She went out that night and didn't come home until 2:00am. At first, she bragged to everyone. My brother finally chilled out. He doesn't even ask where I'm going anymore, but sometimes I'd see her chat bubble open, typing to me before disappearing. When she got the flu, instead of taking off work like usual, I just left Gatorade and Tylenol on the counter, only to come home at midnight to find her sobbing, crawling to the bathroom. We also stopped eating together, stop talking all together. Even. For her birthday, I stayed in my room while she set up and cleaned everything herself. No gifts, no birthday greetings. After a few weeks, she stopped bragging to her friends, looking lonelier than ever. Then that Saturday morning, she came into the kitchen while I was making coffee. There's a part party tonight at that really dangerous neighborhood you told me to stay away from. Cool, I said, stirring my coffee. She stared quietly like she was waiting for a longer answer, then finally snapped. That's it? Just cool? You're not gonna tell me to come home early or pick me up at 9 p m. Like a psycho? I glanced at her. Yep. Can't you at least show you care? Like a brother? Ugh, forget it. I don't need you anyway. Yeah, I said, sipping my drink. You made that pretty clear.

I was 15 when my crush, Lucia, pulled me aside after chemistry class. We've been close since sixth grades. I need you to promise me something, she whispered. Her pretty eyes not meeting mine. For a moment, I thought she was going to ask me to the dance. I've been working up the courage for weeks. But something in her voice made my chest tighten. Anything I said, that's when she told me about Friday, how she'd been planning it for months. The teachers who ignored her cries for help, her parents who only cared about her grades. She taking her mom's gun from the locked drawer. The next day she was going to publicly end her life. She planned it all out, a live stream during third period when Miss Lillian would be teaching, when Mister Cole would be in the faculty lounge, when everyone who'd failed her would be watching. She'd make sure they'd see, make sure they'd carry it forever. But not you, she said, squeezing my hand. Don't watch. You're the only one who ever really saw me stood there frozen, feeling her fingers intertwined with mine. Something I dreamed about for months, but not like this. Never like this. Lucia, you can't, I whispered. It's the only way they'll learn. She's the only way things will change. That night, I didn't sleep. I stared at her Instagram, scrolling through photos where her smile never quite reached her eyes. Had I missed It the way she'd stopped eating lunch, how she wore long sleeves even when it was warm. The poem she'd started posting, beautiful but dark. So dark I thought about Miss Lillian who was tough but had three kids at home. Mr Cole who was new and trying his best. The other students who'd see it happen live. The trauma that would ripple through our school like a stone dropped in still water. But Lucia trusted me. She'd held my hand. She'd chosen me to confide in. Wasn't that worth something? By the time three a. M. Hit, I was typing and deleting texts to. What if I was overreacting? What if she hated me forever? What if I lost the only girl who'd ever made me feel like I mattered? Then I imagine the alternative, her empty desk and chemistry. Her parents at a funeral instead of graduation. A live stream that could never be unseen, all because I stayed silent. 5:00am, I called the sewer's light prevention hotline. They connected me to the police. My voice cracked as I explained everything. The officer's tone grew urgent asking for details. I wished I didn't have. Lucia's full name, her address, the exact time she'd mentioned you're saving her life, the officer said it felt like I was ending it. They got to Lucia at 7:00am just as she was setting up her phone in her bedroom. Pills were already laid out. The note was already written. The local news Called it a mental health crisis intervention. They interviewed our principal, who promised better resources, more counselors, real change. They never used our names, but Lucia knew. She didn't come back to school for two months. When she did, she wouldn't look at me, wouldn't answer my texts. Her new friends formed a protective wall around her in the hallways. I heard whispers that I betrayed her, that I violated her trust, that I only did it because I couldn't handle rejection. The school did change. They hired two new counselors, started a peer support program, trained teachers on warning signs. Everyone said I'd done the right thing, but I felt like I'd lost everything. Three years later, on graduation day, I found a note in my locker. I instantly recognized Lucia's handwriting. What I read made my heart drop full.

My daughter Charlie accidentally sent 17 boys to the hospital and I've never been more proud of her. I was casually drinking Boba when I got a call from Charlie's school. Mr Jacobs, your daughter is running a gang, a literal gang. She has orchestrated attacks on 17 male students, 17. We're talking about criminal charges here. My daughter, a gang leader? What was this silly goose talking about? Charlie literally cried when she accidentally stepped on a snail last week. But sure, let's go and see what's going on. When I burst into the conference room, I found my baby girl sitting there surrounded by red faced administrators, the principal and two lawyers. It actually called lawyers on my 15 year old daughter who was doodling butterflies on her notebook like this was just another boring school meeting. I sat down next to my daughter Charlie. Tell me what happened. He looked up at me with those same eyes that used to beg for one more bedtime story, completely calm. Remember when you told me that if someone tries to hurt me, I should fight back? I nodded. Well, it wasn't just me who needed to fight back. Principal Donatello slammed a thick folder on the table. Your daughter has been running fight training sessions. She calls it the sisterhood. They have a group chat with coded messages. He's teaching girls how to throw punches. Mr Jacobs, how to break noses, how to cause maximum damage. I raised my hand and told him to shut up before I stole some of his gold teeth. My daughter continued, this one boy has been grabbing girls tooties in the hallway for months. My friend Lila reported it. Principal Donatello said she was just being dramatic. Suddenly the room felt way colder than before, probably because I was glaring daggers at all these lawyers and teachers just standing there in shame. That's not all. A few other boys corner freshman girls every day after second period and rate their bodies out loud on a scale of 1 to 10. When we complained, Principal Donatello said we should take it as a compliment. The room went dead silent. So I started teaching Lila some self defense moves mom taught me before she died. Then Aya asked to learn because boys in her class kept putting his hands on her at dances even when she said stop. Then flora, because three boys surrounded her after school and tried to lift her skirt, she pulled out her phone scrolling through messages. Thirty girls, dad, 30 girls came to me with stories. Every single one had reported it to the administration. Look, she showed me screenshots of emails to Donatello, to teachers, to counselors, all ignored or dismissed. So yeah, I taught them to fight back. The first time that boy tried to grab Lila again, she broke his nose when that Group tried to corner the freshman last Tuesday. Six of my girls were waiting. Those boys Learned real quick that no means no when there are consequences. Donatello's face was purple. This is not how we handle things. You didn't handle anything, Charlie snapped. And I'd never heard her raise her voice like that. You told us to ignore it. You said boys will be boys. Well, of course they will. They're boys, Donatello said. But my daughter wasn't about to stop. Well, guess what? Those boys aren't bothering anyone anymore, are they? This isn't funny, young lady. Donatello sputtered. Those boys were seriously injured. Their parents are threatening to sue the school, to sue you. Charlie actually laughed. She looked him dead in the eye and said, maybe if those boys had Learned to keep their hands to themselves, they wouldn't need medical attention. Funny how they all stopped harassing girls after word got out that we fight back. Now, that's when I couldn't help it. I literally burst out laughing alongside Charlie. And we laughed so hard that we started holding our stomachs in pain. Donatella looked at me like I was insane. Mister Jacobs, surely you understand the severity. Yes, I do understand. I understand that you failed to protect these girls. I understand that my daughter did your job when you wouldn't. I understand that my law firm would be very interested in taking on 30 harassment cases that you ignored. The color drained from his Face. Now wait a minute or no, you wait a minute, you half brained self absorbent piece of manure. I'm not done here. I'm coming back for everything you thought you built. It took me two weeks to get that principal fired and locked up. And Charlie spent that time printing our posters for the sisterhood.

But her face immediately dropped when she realized that we tricked her. My sister in law Maya has always been competitive with me, since the day I married her brother Jake. He couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, she tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me, and from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first, it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd de flesh, she'd push harder, come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery free and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for Any evidence of our name decision? My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon trist boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think? She'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived! The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if. If I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to Her surprise the next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

She was staring at my junk with this weird concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers and she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit. I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. She grip the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud. She swerved a little. There's only one ball, one nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two and you've got one. She was talking fast like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I, I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that I. Was anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly. Once I explained the situation, the doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now, the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were 7 years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early and it was completely operable, but they had to remove one of Your test.

Fuck a breakup over league of Legends. TikTok camera angles are worse. I could be laying in bed watching an edit on loop and next thing you know I get a whole ass. 5 nights at Freddy's jump scare. It catches me at my worst times. I look like a fucking troll. I got a quadruple chin, a 5 head, and cheeks so fat I look like a dog that got stung in the mouth by a fucking bee. My face is so pale I get flashbanged whenever this shit happens. And the kicker, no amount of angle changes will fix the fact that I look like a scientific discovery. I must have been a blobfish in my past life with the way TikTok insults me more than the average hormonal, bitchy teenage girl. No matter the lighting or the angle or the filters, I look like a fucking alien ready to say, take me to your leader. I am chopped for the next two to three business days until I finally decide to take a selfie. But then when I wanna take a picture of myself, I'm a literal fucking goddess. I feel bold, empowered, even. I feel like those women in a Tampax commercial. I feel like I took a sip of Red Bull and sprouted wings. My confidence is like a Wi-Fi router. When it suddenly vanishes, I Just gotta unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging it in again. Okay. Muffin out.

I came home early from work with a headache, expecting the house to be empty since my teenage daughter Georgia had cheer practice. But instead I heard voices upstairs. I was about to call up when I heard her say, please stop, you're hurting me. Everything inside me went cold. Then came her boyfriend, Paxton's voice, low and menacing. You embarrassed me in front of my friends today. The sound of a slap echoed through the house, follow by my daughter crying. I ran up those stairs and burst through her bedroom door. Paxton had Georgia backed against the dresser, his hand around her throat. The second he saw me, he dropped his hand and stepped back like nothing had happened. Missus Johnson. We were just. I cut him off. Get out of my house now. He looked confused, putting on that innocent act. I was just helping Georgia with. Get out, I scream. He grabbed his backpack and left, but not before whispering something to Georgia that made her face go white. The moment he was gone, I turned to Georgia. Her face was red and swollen from crying, finger shaped bruises already forming on her throat. Georgia, what the hell was that? She immediately started making excuses. Mom, we were just playing around. He wasn't really hurting me. But I could see the fear in her eyes. Playing around. He had his hand around Your throat. She broke down completely, then sliding down the wall until she was sitting on the floor, sobbing through her tears. She told me everything, how it had started with him grabbing her arm too hard when he was angry, how it escalated to slapping and pushing, how he convinced her it was her fault. He threatened to kill himself if she ever left him. Told her that no one would believe her because he was so perfect. Felt completely trapped, especially with homecoming just three days away and the entire school expecting them to be crowned king and queen. She begged me not to call the police, convinced that no one would believe her. They'll say I'm lying, she sobbed. Everyone loves him. They'll think I'm crazy. That's when the idea hit me. What if we didn't have to convince anyone? I said, what if we made him show everyone exactly who he really is? I explained my plan. It was risky, but she was desperate enough to try anything. On homecoming night, she got ready like nothing had changed. When Paxton picked her up, he was back to his charming self, acting like nothing had happened. Sorry about the other day, Missus Johnson. Georgia and I were just.

I was 23 when my family decided it was time for me to collect my first wife. They already had her picked out. My 13 year old cousin Fatima, whose mother bragged about her early development. You see, every girl in my family knew the rule. The day you get your first period was the day you got married. It didn't matter whether you still played with dolls or couldn't reach the kitchen counter. If you could bleed, you could breed. I was nine when I watched my oldest brother, Ahmed, get married to his first wife on his 21st birthday. She was 12 years old. By the time I was 15, Achmed had buried that first wife and was on to his third pregnancy complications. Everyone said your wife's youth was like a currency. Whichever man had the youngest, most obedient wife was the most praised in society. Family gatherings, my uncles would compete like kids comparing prizes. Amina was only 11 when I claimed her. Uncle Kareem would boast, holding up her photo. In response, Uncle Hassan would lean back, working. That's nothing. I got my Osman at 10 and she still had her baby teeth. The jewelry shop didn't even make wedding rings that small. For years, I played along, smiling when they discussed my future, agreeing that 14 was getting too old for a bride. Inside, my stomach turned. But what could I do? Speaking against it, Meant exile of you and all the women in the family. Three months before my wedding date, I found harifatima, my wife, to be in our family's utility room with a bottle of bleach. Her hands were shaking so bad she couldn't open it. When she saw me, she dropped to her knees. Please don't tell. Please. I can't. I know what happens. I've seen what happens. I took the bottle, sat on the floor next to her, and for the first time in my life, I said out loud, I know. I don't want this either. She sat there with her mouth wide open, staring at me like I had five heads. Suddenly, she lunged at me for a hug. Can you please tell them I'm crazy? Tell them I'm possessed or cursed. They won't want me if I'm insane. Bad blood ruins the lineage. That sentence changed everything. Because she was right. My family obsessed over bloodlines, genetic purity, producing perfect sons. Mental illness was the ultimate contamination. I'd seen them reject marriage proposals over rumors of a great aunt who talked to walls. Within a week, I taught Fatima to twitch at dinner tables, mumbling numbers in corners, scratching symbols on her arms with her fingernails. I coached her through episodes, taught her to roll her eyes back in gibberish, and claimed she saw demons in the wallpaper. She put on such an award winning act that sometimes even I was disturbed. My mother was horrified. She Was perfect. Two weeks ago, she wailed to my father. Now look at her. What if it spreads to the children? The wedding was quietly postponed. Words spread through the girl cousins like wildfire. My sister Amira, 14 and recently bloomed, came to me next. Then her friend. Nor then, nor sister. Before I knew it, I was running midnight coaching sessions in my car, teaching girls how to manifest madness. Dead eyes are crucial, I'd instruct. Stare through people, not at them. Laugh at nothing. Cry without reason. But timing is everything. Save the worst episodes for when marriage talks begin. Some girls were naturals. My cousin Layla developed a fictional friend she'd have full conversations with during family gatherings. She'd serve tea to empty chairs holding invisible children. Her father postponed three marriage proposals, terrified of producing defective grandchildren. Others needed more work. Soft spoken, Miriam couldn't sell the performance until I taught her to channel her real terror into fake hysteria. Think about your wedding night, I tell her. Now scream. The sound she made convinced everyone. But in six months, we had a full network. 15 marriageable girls, all displaying various forms of borderline schizophrenia. Family meetings turned to chaos as girls would trigger each other. One would start humming, another would begin rocking. Suddenly, three were speaking in unison about visions of black water. The elders panicked. They brought in healers who charged fortunes to wave incense around, doctors who prescribed sedatives, religious leaders who Performed exorcisms that left the girls even more convincingly traumatized. I thought we could maintain it indefinitely. The girls were protecting each other. Older ones coaching younger ones as they came of age. We had a system. And my family may have been PDF files, but they weren't stupid. So after a year of failed cures, they started noticing patterns. How the madness only struck marriageable girls. How symptoms peaked during wedding seasons. How I somehow was always nearby when episodes occurred. The final gathering happened on a Thursday. 23 of us were at my uncle's house for his daughter's engagement. The plan was to have her fake her worst episode yet. But when my uncle called her forward to receive her engagement blessing, she looked.

When I was 12 years old, my mother slit her wrist in front of me because I asked to go to a friend's birthday party. And as she bled into our kitchen sink, she made me promise I'd never try to leave her again. She survived that time, barely. While the paramedics worked on her, she gripped my hand with bloody fingers and whispered, this is what happens when you abandon me. I spent three days in the hospital chapel, 13 years old and convinced. I almost murdered my mother by wanting to go to a sleepover. When she came home, arm bandaged and eyes hollow, she made me sleep in her bed so she could hold on to me all night. I need to know you're here, she said. Otherwise, the darkness comes back. The rules formed quickly after that. I couldn't join clubs because staying late at school feels like you're choosing them over me. I couldn't have friends over because their energy disrupts our bond. Each boundary came with the same threat, sometimes spoken, sometimes just a gesture toward her scarred wrists. She kept razors displayed on the bathroom counter like weapons, reminding me what would happen if I, I broke her heart again. By 14, I was homeschooled and completely isolated. Mom said it was better this way, just us two against a world that didn't understand our connection. She'd have good days where she'd braid my hair. And we'd watch movies and I think maybe this was enough. But then I mentioned wanting to learn to drive someday. And she'd go silent. She'd lock herself in the bathroom and I'd sit outside the door begging her to come out. She'd emerge hours later showing me fresh cuts on her thighs. Practice cuts. Call them for when you finally abandoned me for real. I attempted my first real escape at 15. I found a youth shelter address at the library and memorized it. One night while mom slept, I packed a bag and made it to the front door. But she was sitting in the dark living room waiting. I felt you pulling away, she said calmly. Then she swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in front of me. I called 9 1 1 and rode with her to the hospital holding her hand while they pumped her stomach. When she woke up, she smiled sadly. You did this, she said, but at least you stayed to watch. After that, she installed bells on my bedroom door and windows. She test me randomly, pretending to hurt herself to see if I try to leave or just save her. I always chose to save her, but I was dying inside, suffocating under the weight of keeping her alive. I started writing goodbye letters I never send, hiding them in my textbooks. I tried to get away again when I was sixteen. Mom had fallen asleep after taking anxiety Medication. And I thought I had time. I made it three blocks before a police car pulled up. Mom had called them claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd shown them my hidden letters as evidence. As they drove me home, she texted me, if you'd kept going, you would have found my body when you came back. I had the bath ready that night. She showed me a new scar on her stomach. I did this while you were gone, she said. She made me help her bandage it, narrating how she would have cut deeper if I made it another block. Next time you leave, she promised, I'll make sure I time it perfectly. You'll be free, but you'll be a murderer. I became. I'm hyper vigilant, watching for signs she was spiraling. My entire existence became keeping her from the edge. When I caught her standing on our apartment balcony at 3:00am, I didn't ask why. I just took her hand and let her back to bed. But then I got a scholarship to art school. Mom found the acceptance letter before I could hide it. She didn't say anything, just disappeared into the bathroom. I heard water running and pounded on the door. When she finally.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was like four hours away and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate, Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She, I just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before. But honestly, my hair was so bad I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

My girlfriend had been nervous about introducing me to her family for weeks, warning me that her father built their ranch into one of the Southwest's premier cattle operations and didn't trust outsiders. I brushed off her concerns, figuring any family who raised someone as amazing as her couldn't be that bad. Fighting over some cattle ranchers seemed manageable for someone who'd grown up working his grandfather's ranch before heading to college. Anyway, the ranch sprawled across thousands of acres with cattle worth more than most houses, and her father's handshake could have crushed walnuts while his eyes cataloged everything from my soft leather shoes to my unmarked hands. The moment I mentioned working in marketing, his smile turned predatory. Marketing, huh? He said while looking me up and down. Well, I guess somebody has to make a living pushing paper while real men do actual work. The dismissal stung, but I forced to smile because this dinner meant everything to my girlfriend. Her father carved brisket while zeroing in on my supposed ignorance about their world. So you probably think steak comes from the steak tree and chocolate milk comes from brown cows, he said with a laugh that made my skin crawl. His brother joined in chuckling. Bet this city boy couldn't tell a bull from a steer if his life depended on it. Has he ever even seen a live cow before today? The family erupted in laughter at my supposed cluelessness about their world while I sat there like a museum exhibit. But I kept quiet because my girlfriend was already shifting uncomfortably in her seat. His wife turned it up a notch when she noticed me not saying anything. Oh my, look at those soft little hands! She cooed while refilling my glass, practically jiggling. I bet you've never lifted anything heavier than a briefcase, have you, sweetie? Do you get manicures, too? Most women don't even take that good care of their nails. Her sons were cracking up now, one adding between laughs, he probably uses more beauty products than his girlfriend does. The laughter felt like knives as they questioned my very manhood, but I swallowed my pride because causing a scene would only embarrass my girlfriend further. You know what kills me? Her dad continued, wiping tears from laughing so hard. Marketing coordinator probably makes, what, 25 grand? If he's lucky? That's what we pay our teenage ranch hands for summer work. The whole table was howling now as his brother added, our daughter could marry a successful rancher and live in a mansion, but instead she's settling for someone who will be renting apartments and driving used cars his whole life. She'll be clipping coupons while her friends are taking vacations. My girlfriend's face went crimson as her own family treated our future like a pathetic joke. He called me pale as a ghost and said I Probably weigh less than most of their calves. He laughed as he said, I'd probably never thrown a punch in my life. His eldest son was practically wheezing with laughter as he said, I look like a strong wind would blow me over. What really got to me was him telling everyone, what happens when our daughter needs a real man to protect her? Is he gonna bore the burglar to death with marketing statistics? The entire family dissolved into hysterics while I watched my girlfriend's face crumble. Her own family systematically destroying every aspect of my worth as a potential partner. Every instinct screamed at me to defend us both, but I bit my tongue because any reaction would only give them more ammunition. That's when a young girl burst through the back door screaming, daddy, something's wrong with thunder! His belly looks like a balloon! The men jumped up, but I was already sprinting toward the barn. My body operating on instincts buried for over a decade. Their million dollar bull

My boyfriend Jake and I had been together for like 8 months and things were going pretty well. Then one Tuesday morning I get this text from him that just says, I think we need to talk about us. This isn't working anymore. I literally felt my stomach drop. I'm sitting there in my pajamas eating cereal before work and this dude just dumps me over text. I tried calling him but it went straight to voicemail. I texted back asking if we could talk in person, but he left me on read. By lunchtime, I was convinced it was over. My coworker Ashley was like, girl, you need a rebound. But honestly, I wasn't ready for that. Instead, I did something way more impulsive. I drove to the animal shelter after work that same day. I've been wanting a dog for years, but Jake was always like, we're not ready for that responsibility. Well, guess what, Jake? Now I don't need your permission. There was this 3 year old golden retriever mix named Buddy who'd been there for two months. The shelter lady said his previous family had to give him up because they were moving overseas. He was the sweetest thing, just sitting there wagging his tail at everyone who walked by. I filled out all the paperwork and paid the adoption fee right there. Two hundred bucks later, I'm driving home with a dog. In my backseat. I spent the entire evening at Petsmart buying everything, dog bed, toys, food, bowls, leash, collar, the works. Dropped like $400. Easy. Posted a bunch of Instagram stories with Buddy, captioned them stuff like new roommate and fresh start vibes. I was actually feeling pretty good about the whole thing. The next morning, Jake shows up at my apartment with coffee and bagels from our usual spot. I open the door and Buddy immediately runs up to him, tail going crazy. Jake's face is just pure confusion. He's like, whose dog is this? And I'm like, mine, obviously. Then he gets this weird look and asks why I got a dog. I told him it was.

The first thing I noticed when I entered the patient's room was her deep sunken eyes and pale cracked lips. I approached her cautiously, remembering how the charge nurse warned the girl refused all male staff. We all knew what that meant. And she looked as broken as I imagined. I pulled up a chair next to her bed instead of standing over her and gently asked if she wanted some water first. She nodded. Sweetie, you're safe here, I said, keeping my voice soft like I do with my anxious patients. Male staff won't come near you, I promise. It's just us girls here. She looked at me for the first time and whispered, he's here. I asked who. And at first she refused to even say his name. I handed her my pen and clipboard. After a second, her hand moved. Percy. My blood boiled at the name. He was my everything, she finally whispered and started showing me photos on her phone of them together at college, confirming that it was the same Percy who was now a resident at the hospital. I did everything for him, everything. Her voice cracked as she swiped to screenshots of assignments, time stamps showing her submit his biochemistry homework at 3:00am, his pathology essays at 4:00am, his anatomy exams that she taken for him. She showed me his Instagram from those same nights, him doing beer pong And body shots with other girls while she was writing his thesis, this on cellular biology. The day after graduation, after I'd spent three years making sure he got into residency, he sent me this, she said, and handed me her phone. The text made me want to throw something. Babe, you're too clingy and it's honestly suffocating. I need to focus on my career without distractions. And honestly, doctors are supposed to date doctors and you're not one. We're done. Please don't contact me again. I waited until she was stable and sleeping before I stormed into the break room where three other nurses were charting. You guys are never going to believe what I just found out about Percy, I said. I told them everything and watch their faces go from confused to furious. And within 10 minutes, we had half the female staff crammed into that tiny break room. I knew something was off when he asked me to explain what antibiotics were said. June from pediatrics and Sydney are attending walked in right as someone said we should report him. And she closed the door behind her. Actually, I've been documenting his knowledge gaps for weeks, she said, pulling out her phone to show us pages of notes. But this explains everything. The room went quiet while we all looked at each other. And then Lida from the ICU said what we were all thinking, ladies, we don't need to destroy him. We just need to Let him destroy himself while we enjoy every second of it. The plan rolled out so naturally. It was almost beautiful to watch. Percy started getting paid for every.

My half sister, Heather and I never really got along. It doesn't help that Heather's mom hates me and my mom. She has always tried to one up me. She thinks she is better than me and tells all our cousins that I am insecure because my dad chose their family over my mom and me. She never fails to make all my life events all about her. Like my graduation party where she announced that she was accepted into a prestigious university. Now, my fiance and I got engaged last month and had our engagement party this Saturday. We had planned it originally as a casual formal event. Nice dresses, but not I am going to the Met Gala nice. More like we are going to a good restaurant nice. Anyway, my cousin hits me up saying she has to show me something. It was the picture of the dress Heather was gonna wear. This dress. Jesus Christ. It can only be described as opulent. It was long and white, strapless, with sewn in crystals and golden accents. I'm pretty sure it's a wedding dress, but I can't be 100%. This made me really mad. I started texting people telling them that there had been a change of plans, and instead of a casual formal, I decided to have a costume. Party! My mother's side is crazy for Halloween, so they were immediately on board. I told my father via text and asked him to relay the message to Heather and her mother, knowing full well that he would forget or leave it to the last minute. Saturday comes along and guests start showing up. Most of them are in costumes and some didn't have time to get one. We just provided them with fun hats and cheap wigs.

Moment where you knew you would win. I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence. I tried again the next day. Nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed, a 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me unread every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud. When I submitted it online, I Only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door, acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and close the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night, claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they could prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction and that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? I whispered. She wouldn't look at me, just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot next to me. That night she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons, just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them finger shaped bruises on her upper arms, dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard My hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said, if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said, nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the PE teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team, the one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything, how Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class, how he made her play a secret game, how it hurt, how he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at 6:00am not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first, that calling police was premature, that Mr Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

For three years straight. Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th. He had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired. Each week he had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If someone cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year I decided to test something two weeks before my birthday. I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about it being nice And went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right, yeah. I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something. Anything. Maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek, and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon, feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision.

I had an eight year old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, she'd be dead in six months. I called the mother in to explain the situation. When I, I told her, she was totally relaxed. Oh, I know about the diabetes. The other doctor mentioned it last week. We're handling it naturally, though. No insulin needed. I thought I misheard her. Your daughter needs insulin to live. Her pancreas doesn't work anymore. She will die without it. The mother smiled. We're doing carrot juice therapy instead, 60 ounces a day. Diabetes is just toxin build up in the pancreas. The juice flushes it out. She said it like she was explaining a recipe. I tried showing her the test results. Her blood sugar is 680. She could slip into a coma any moment. The mother stood up and helped her daughter to her feet. Well, thanks for your opinion, but we're good. The carrot cleanse takes three weeks to work fully. We're only on week two. I blocked the door. You can't leave. She's in diabetic ketoacidosis. She needs emergency treatment. The mother laughed. This is why people don't trust doctors. You create fake emergencies. Move or I'm calling security on you. She pushed past me with her barely conscious daughter. After she left, I immediately called my supervisor and hospital legal. We needed an emergency ethics meeting. A child was going to die within an hour. We had social services, the chief of pediatrics and legal on a conference call. The mother had been flagged at three other hospitals. Each time she left when doctors mentioned insulin. I explained the situation. She's giving her type 1 diabetic daughter only carrot juice. The kids in active ketoacidosis. She'll be dead in weeks, maybe days. Legal said without immediate danger, we couldn't force treatment. The chief suggested we call the mother for a formal care meeting, make it sound routine. When I called, she was surprisingly cheerful. Oh, a second opinion? Sure. I love educating doctors about natural healing. She came back that afternoon with a rolling suitcase. Inside were printed Facebook posts, blog articles and a Powerpoint on her laptop she set up like she was giving a business presentation. Let me show you how Big Pharma created the die diabetes lie. She actually had slides. Slide 1, Insulin is made from GMO bacteria. Slide 2, diabetes didn't exist before 1920. Slide 3, every culture has a vegetable that cures diabetes. Chief of pediatrics interrupted. Ma'am, your daughter's blood sugar was 680. She's dying. The mother clicked to her next slide. That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this graph I made. Couple days later, the school called 9, 1 1. The daughter had collapsed in the cafeteria, completely unresponsive. When they arrived, I recognized her immediately. The orange tinted skin was unmistakable. Blood sugar was 1,100. She was in a diabetic coma. The Mother rushed in 20 minutes later carrying her suitcase of documents. She fainted because they gave her school lunch instead of her juice. That processed food is poison. The kids started seizing right there on the gurney. Foam.

My younger sister, Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin, slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mentioned liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent, even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot, I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.

Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. Should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back, all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. Noon she was texting you okay and I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that night, she Asked about my day and I just said same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handle. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven PM Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking.

My best friend Mike called me at 3:00am last Tuesday, voice shaking. I need to tell you something and I need you to listen. Without hanging up. We've been friends since middle school, so I knew something was seriously wrong. Remember that guy, Derek, who kept harassing my sister at work, the one who followed her home and kept showing up at her apartment? I remembered Derek was this creepy older guy who wouldn't take no for an answer. Mike's sister, Emma, had filed multiple complaints, but nothing stuck. Well, he's not going to bother anyone anymore, Mike said quietly. My blood went cold. What do you mean he's not going to bother anyone? There was this long pause where I could hear Mike breathing heavily through the phone. I was driving home from Emma's place last night around midnight. She'd been crying because Derek showed up at her work again, this time with flowers and a note saying he knew where she lived. I was so angry I could barely see straight. Mike continued. That's when I saw Derek's car parked outside her apartment complex. He was just sitting there in the dark watching her windows. I pulled over and walked up to his car. When he saw me, he started laughing and said Emma would come around. Eventually, I snapped. I dragged him out of the car and we started fighting in the parking lot. But then he. Hit his head on the concrete. When he fell, there was so much blood and he wasn't moving. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. My hands were shaking as I held the phone. Mike, please tell me you called 9 1 1. Another long silence. I panicked. I put his body in his trunk and drove his car to the old quarry outside town. You know, the one where we used to go swimming as kids? The car is at the bottom of the lake now. With Derek inside, I hiked back to my car and drove home like nothing happened. I felt sick to my stomach. This was my best friend, the guy who helped me through my parents divorce, who was the best man at my wedding. Mike, we need to call the police right now. This was self defense or at least manslaughter. If you explain what happened. No, he interrupted. They'll never believe me. A guy with Derek's background doesn't just disappear without someone looking into it. But if they find the car, I'm going to prison for murder. The next few days were torture. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't look at my wife without feeling like I was keeping this horrible secret. Mike acted completely normal, even asking if I wanted to grab drinks that weekend. But something felt wrong about his story. Derek was a big guy, probably 200 pounds. Mike was maybe 150. Soaking wet. How did he drag A body that size and get it into a trunk by himself. And why would Derek be parked outside Emma's apartment when she moved to a new place across town two weeks ago? I started doing some digging. I called Emma and casually asked how she was doing with the Derek situation. Oh, that's been resolved for weeks, she said. My new boyfriend, Jake, had a talk with him and Derek hasn't bothered me since. When did this happen? I asked about three weeks ago. Jake used to play college football. And I think Derek got the message pretty clearly three weeks ago. But Mike said this happened last Tuesday. Then I remembered something else. Mike had been acting strange for months, not just the past week. Paranoid, jumpy, asking weird questions about loyalty and friendship. He'd been having money problems, too, something about gambling deaths. I decided to drive out to the quarry myself. If there really was a car down there, I needed to see it with my own eyes. When I got to the spot where we used to swim, the water was crystal clear. You could.

All my friends were there and they wanted to meet Laura and I thought it was gonna be a fun night, but it was not. Okay, what, okay, what happened? You're leaving us on pins and needles here. So much detail and I need the drama. Um, one of my good girlfriends, not an ex, but just a, you know, a platonic girlfriend, you know, she, well, first of all, Laura was really in her phone throughout this entire house party. You know, when you can tell someone's really into their phone, like they're really on their phone. Yeah, that was for like the whole night you're meeting people. Yeah, exactly. Is that the reason though is like she could have been nervous? Right. No, it's because of what she was doing on her phone. Because one of my friends was kind of, you know, sometimes we do it, glancing over her shoulder and looking at what she was doing. And she was.

This was my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink and we will just go to fun places and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you, right? But sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood for me. I'm Only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry, babe. But I will make it up for you when I come back. You can propose to me. We should go to another trip, just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places, eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam, hello. Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey, babe. We're at the reception.

I was about 14 and at a water park waiting for my friends to change. They had doors on the changing rooms. And as I was sitting there, a changing room door slowly opened. A girl about 20 was fully naked and sliding down her panties. She looked up and we made eye contact. She smiled, winked and slowly closed the door. My friends all came out oblivious to what had just happened. And I had to walk with my towel in front of me for a long time. 3, I was visiting a friend and keeping an eye on her kids while she was taking a shower. Her daughter wanted my phone so much that I gave it to her and she ran off to the bathroom. The daughter asked her mom, who had just gotten out of the shower, to take a picture of her.

When mom married Garrett, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown. Like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking first you can and speaking. Hi, I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking. And showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret while planning my revenge. Pierce helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

All right. I'll go out with you again. You'll do it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right! Awesome. Congratulations, Vicky. You got your second date. Great. Thank you. Oh, my god. You're welcome. I love the second date. I'm already planning your guys's marriage in my head.

I had an eight year old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, she'd be dead in six months. I called the mother in to explain the situation. When I, I told her, she was totally relaxed. Oh, I know about the diabetes. The other doctor mentioned it last week. We're handling it naturally, though. No insulin needed. I thought I misheard her. Your daughter needs insulin to live. Her pancreas doesn't work anymore. She will die without it. The mother smiled. We're doing carrot juice therapy instead, 60 ounces a day. Diabetes is just toxin build up in the pancreas. The juice flushes it out. She said it like she was explaining a recipe. I tried showing her the test results. Her blood sugar is 680. She could slip into a coma any moment. The mother stood up and helped her daughter to her feet. Well, thanks for your opinion, but we're good. The carrot cleanse takes three weeks to work fully. We're only on week two. I blocked the door. You can't leave. She's in diabetic ketoacidosis. She needs emergency treatment. The mother laughed. This is why people don't trust doctors. You create fake emergencies. Move or I'm calling security on you. She pushed past me with her barely conscious daughter. After she left, I immediately called my supervisor and hospital legal. We needed an emergency ethics meeting. A child was going to die within an hour. We had social services, the chief of pediatrics and legal on a conference call. The mother had been flagged at three other hospitals. Each time she left when doctors mentioned insulin. I explained the situation. She's giving her type 1 diabetic daughter only carrot juice. The kids in active ketoacidosis. She'll be dead in weeks, maybe days. Legal said without immediate danger, we couldn't force treatment. The chief suggested we call the mother for a formal care meeting, make it sound routine. When I called, she was surprisingly cheerful. Oh, a second opinion? Sure. I love educating doctors about natural healing. She came back that afternoon with a rolling suitcase. Inside were printed Facebook posts, blog articles and a Powerpoint on her laptop she set up like she was giving a business presentation. Let me show you how Big Pharma created the die diabetes lie. She actually had slides. Slide 1, Insulin is made from GMO bacteria. Slide 2, diabetes didn't exist before 1920. Slide 3, every culture has a vegetable that cures diabetes. Chief of pediatrics interrupted. Ma'am, your daughter's blood sugar was 680. She's dying. The mother clicked to her next slide. That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this graph I made. Couple days later, the school called 9, 1 1. The daughter had collapsed in the cafeteria, completely unresponsive. When they arrived, I recognized her immediately. The orange tinted skin was unmistakable. Blood sugar was 1,100. She was in a diabetic coma. The Mother rushed in 20 minutes later carrying her suitcase of documents. She fainted because they gave her school lunch instead of her juice. That processed food is poison. The kids started seizing right there on the gurney. Foam.

How did you do it? My ex, Ashley, thought our relationship was charity work. Every time we went somewhere together, she'd find ways to remind me I'd never find someone like her again. It started with her introducing me as just a friend at bars. When guys hit on her, she'd let them buy her drinks, then mention she had a boyfriend after. You should see their faces when I point to you. She'd laugh later. The shock is hilarious. The worst was when she just disappeared one Saturday. No text, nothing. Then I saw her Instagram story. Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami. Tom has this insane condo. He wanted to fly me to Ibiza next week. She pinched my cheek. But I came back to Jersey to my little computer nerd, my anxious overthinker who's mad about a boat party. She kicked off her heels and collapsed on my bed. I looked past all these red flags with rose colored glasses until the one year anniversary incident happened. I planned everything perfectly just for her on our anniversary. Flowers in hand, champagne in my car, reservation at her favorite restaurant. I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I stepped closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice asked. Eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

Raw dogging my enemy's brother. For years, I was infertile. But not just any infertile. I was the false hope infertile. You see, I had had three miscarriages, all in the second trimester. Luckily, everyone was really supportive. Except for my sister in law. That is because the first time I cried in her lap, she stroked my hair and told me she would always be there for me. She told me that when my niece, her baby was born, I would be her godmother. I even started to consider her as one of my closest friends. Fast forward two weeks later to her baby shower. That's where she announced her baby's name. As soon as she said it, bile rose in my throat. It was Faye. The exact same name as my unborn daughter. Well, it's not like you were going to use it, was all she said when I confronted her. All while squealing like a pig being lit on fire. Her words felt like daggers. When my husband came over to ask what was going on, I told him, but instead of getting mad, he just laughed. Well, men can be pretty clueless sometimes. So I waited until we were in the car ride home to re explain the situation. And my husband was the love of my life. But he was also passive due to growing up as the scapegoat of their family. The type to get robbed on the street. And apologize for not having more money to give. That's just how she is, honey, he said with a sigh. So I told myself that at least my unborn daughter's name could live on in someone else's baby. Focused on increasing my fertility by being a healthy Pilates princess. But it never worked. A year and a half later, another baby died in my womb. A few weeks later, I was standing in an aisle of Walgreens when I saw it. My SCL had made a post to commemorate her second son. The caption read, welcome Baby James. Thanks to Emma, my name for the name inspiration, her loss is my gain. This was then followed by the pregnant emoji and the skull emoji. The time she stole my third miscarriages name, Charlotte. I was numb. She would send me nursery photos with captions like bet you wish this could be for your Charlotte. My husband still defended her, saying I was being too sensitive about just names and photography. After four years of I stopped hoping for a child. Sarah was pregnant with her fourth child and made jokes at family dinners about which name she should steal next. Everyone laughed. Everyone except me. That night, something in me snapped. If she wanted another name, I'd give her one she'd never forget. I waited until the next family gathering and broke down in tears. I told Sarah privately that I had discovered something in incredible in my late mother's Diary. A secret middle name she never told anyone. Lexa Teva. I said it meant sacred child in an ancient dialect. I even created fake diary pages and showed her a Pinterest board about honoring deceased grandparents through baby names. Sarah took the name and ran. She announced everywhere that she was naming her daughter Lexie Tiva Rose, to honor our family's hidden history. And this revenge plan was good enough for me. Until eight months later, when the universe threw me a curveball. I was pregnant. Like, third trimester pregnant. I almost cried with joy. No more memorials. No more wondering whether there was something deeply wrong with me. Me and my husband have been waiting to announce it, not wanting to get our hopes up. And that same week, we got the text. Sarah inviting us to her baby shower. I wore a flowy dress that hid everything. My husband supported my decision, not giving an F anymore. Sarah had gone all out for the shower, bigger than any before. The whole family was there, plus her mommy blog followers who'd been following baby Lexie's journey for months. Sarah was in the middle of giving her speech about. About discovering this sacred family name, when I actually. Sarah, I have something to share, too, I said, smoothing my dress over my now obvious bump. The room went dead silent. Sarah's mouth hung open. Mid sentence, my mother in law dropped her champagne glass. 29 weeks today. I announced Cradling my belly. We wanted to be sure this time. The erupted in screams and congratulations. Sarah's face drained of color. That's when my husband, the saint of the family, stood up and raised his hand. Sarah, you were saying something about lexativa, about all that research you did. Sarah's face had gone from white to red. Yes, it's. It means sacred child. An ancient. That's so weird. He interrupted, pulling out his phone, because when I Google Lex

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for five years. I'm an engineer making 78 k. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 k. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything, 50, 50, rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible, red flag, but I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. Utilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow, okay, very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money, always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our finances for Five years she never had to budget or track expenses. We 2.

Because of their regret, I legally changed my name to Atlas when I turned 18. My birth certificate had Michael William Reynolds, Jr. On it, named after my father, who walked out when I was two. For 16 years, I hated being called junior or Little Mike. Every time someone said my name, it felt like dragging around the shadow of a man who decided we weren't worth keeping. School always started the same. Michael Reynolds, the teacher would call. I go by MJ. I'd answer, trying to create distance. Mom worked two jobs after he left. She'd help with homework despite being exhausted, and never complained. Not even when grandparents would say, he looks more like his father every day. As if that was a compliment. When I was 15, mom started dating David. He was nothing like my father. Quiet, reliable, with a dry sense of humor. An English professor who wore sweater vests and collected maps. His first visit, he brought me a journal instead of forcing some guy bonding activity. David never tried to replace my dad. He just showed up. He came to baseball games with his grading work, occasionally looking up to cheer. He helped with college applications and never made me feel like a burden. Once I heard him tell mom, he's not my son, but I couldn't be prouder if he was. Before senior year, I researched name changes. Nothing felt right. Until I Remembered a book David gave me about Greek mythology. Atlas, the Titan who held up the heavens. That resonated when I told them my plan. Mom was supportive, but confused. Why Atlas? She. He asked. Because Atlas carried the world on his shoulders. That's how I felt, carrying Dad's name when he couldn't carry his responsibilities. At least Atlas never put down his burden and walked away. David nodded. Names have power. They tell a story. Exactly. I want to tell my own. After my birthday, I filed the paperwork. Six weeks later, I became Atlas Reynolds. My first college letter, addressed to my new name, is still pinned to my board. Everything was fine until last week, when my biological father called. Mom handed me the phone with a strange look. Junior. How's my little Michael? Junior? My stomach dropped. That person doesn't exist anymore. What? My name is Atlas now. He laughed like it was a joke. That's not your name. You're Michael William Reynolds, junior. Named you myself right before you left. Added, I legally changed it. He said he was changed. Sorry. Wanted to reconnect. He'd moved back to town with his new family, but wanted to make things right with his first son. He kept repeating my old name, like he could force it back onto me. Yesterday, I found his car in our driveway. Mom and David sat stiffly in the living room with my biological father on our couch. Like he belonged there. They ambushed me with dinner. Mom kept giving apologetic glances. David was quiet. My father dominated with stories about his new life, kids and business. At dessert, he addressed the elephant in the room. So you've changed your name to Atlas. Like the MacBook? Like the Titan, I corrected. Well, he chuckled. Time to read.

Our chemistry teacher, Mr. Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week. Senior year, everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. Twelve year old sister Lily walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday, during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. Text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle. Just held out his fat hand. Phone. See you next Tuesday, Mr. Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr. Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged. Explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk.

When she tried calling Marcus first, like she always did. When Scared his phone. Phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on Eighth Street. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking. Wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged 10 years. He walked straight to Rodriguez's room during lunch. I need my phone back.

My roommate Lisa was doing her nightly skincare routine when we heard glass breaking downstairs. She just applied a thick green face mask and was wearing her ratty bathrobe with hair and rollers. Did you hear that? I whispered. Lisa grabbed her phone to call 9 1 1, but then got this evil grin. Wait, I have a better idea. She crept to the top of the stairs and let out the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard, then started speaking in tongues. Literally just gibberish that sounded vaguely Latin. Spiritus malum, enter this vessel. I heard the burglar drop something and curse. Lisa crawled down the stairs backwards like the girl from the Exorcist, still screaming in her made up demon language. The green face mask was cracking, making her look legitimately terrifying. The burglar was backing toward the window when our other roommate, Ben, emerged from his room. He immediately caught on. The possession is spreading! He yelled. Everyone get the salt! Ben started throwing table salt everywhere while chanting the Pokemon theme song in a deep, ominous voice. The burglar was now pressed against the wall. RTB forgotten on the floor. Please, he begged. Leave. I'm sorry. Lisa's head snapped toward him. She put in her glow in the dark Halloween contacts. In the dim light, her eyes were literally glowing green. You disturbed the ritual, she growled. That's when our fourth roommate, Kevin, joined in. He emerged Playing his violin badly, just screeching notes while swaying like he was in a trance. The demons need music! Ben shouted, now drawing symbols on the wall with ketchup. Say louder! The burglar tried to run, but Lisa's spider walked toward him at surprising speed. He actually screamed. I need an old priest and a young priest, I yelled, getting into it. I'm Protestant! The burglar cried. I don't know any priests! Lisa stood up suddenly, did a perfect backbend and whispered, then you're screwed! The man literally wet himself. I saw the stain spreading on his jeans. Kevin's violence screeching intensified. Ben was now speaking in Klingon. Lisa started doing that creepy clicking sound from the grudge. The burglar fell to his knees. What do you want from me? Your soul, Lisa hissed. Or your confession? I'll confess. I've robbed 12 houses. I'll tell you everything! He started listing addresses, eightes where he'd sold stuff. Ben was frantically taking notes while still pretending to be possessed. When the cops arrived, they found a burglar in tears, begging for an exorcist. Lisa, still in full green face mask and glowing contacts. Catch up! Demon symbols on our walls. Kevin playing my heart will go on badly on violin. Ben reading the burglar his rights and clanging on. The burglar immediately confessed to everything. Begged the cops to take him to a church instead of jail. Kept asking if we were really human. The officer looked at Lisa. Ma'am, what exactly Happened here. Skincare night, she said sweetly. Very important for your pores. They took the burglar away. He was muttering about the green demon and violin of the damned. Cops came back later for our statements. One of them finally cracked. In 20 years on the force, I've never had a purse bag for holy water in the squad car. Turns out the burglar had been hitting houses in our area for months. His full confession cleared over a dozen cases. The detective said whatever you did probably saved him from years more crime. He found religion real quick. Already signed up for seminary school. Lisa's review of her faith.

Um, do I know you? Why are you texting me? Sorry if this is weird, but I've always thought you looked interesting. So I took the courage to say hi today. Cool, cool. But who the fuck are you? We never spoke before. I was hoping this is our first time. You sure have a slow brain. Why aren't you answering my question? What question? Who is this? Someone from your dreams? That's cute. So who am I actually talking to? I feel like if I told you, it wouldn't be as fun. Plus I will get rejected. So what? Now? I want to play a game with you. A game? I'm down. We keep talking until July. If you know who I am, you decide if we go on a date or not. And if I don't know who you are, then I will not reveal myself. Sure, why not? Just so you know, my eyes are on another girl. She's my crush since 1st grade. Oh, okay. Hiya. I saw you on the bus today. Oh, yeah, you gave that old lady your seat. Wait, you saw that? Who are you exactly? Someone who sees more than you think. Kind of creepy, but go on. Not creepy, just observant. Alright, if we're playing this game, describe yourself physically. Hmm. Should I make it easy for you? Just a little hint? Something I'd recognize, you know, that's fair. Well, I'm very small. I'm blonde and I always wear a pair of red sneakers. I've worn them every day since the start of the semester. Half the school wears red sneakers. Maybe I'll need more than that to be sure. Fair enough. Tell me about the girl you have a crush on. Why do you wanna know? No reason. I'm just curious. I feel like you don't like her already. You will probably do something to her, I promise you. I'm just curious about it. I probably don't know her. Okay. Her name is Ellie. She's a white girl, dresses really well and her smile is just out of this world. She's just gorgeous. Oh, I see who that might be. Wait, do you know her? Maybe, maybe not. Anyways, I'm going with my mom. Talk to you later. Talk soon. Unknown. Haha. Hiya. Have you spotted any interesting shoes lately? Not yet. I've been distracted. Ellie was at the same party as me last night. Oh, and how did it go? It was alright. She didn't notice me much. She was with her friend all the time. Maybe it's for the best. It'll give you more time to focus on other mysteries. Me.

Sounds insane, but let me explain. That world wasn't just a game. It was my escape. Two years of building castles, farms, entire cities, all gone in one second. One afternoon I logged on and everything was wiped. I ran to her room, asked why, and she just laughed in my face. Relax. It's just blocks. My parents even sided with her, telling me I should spend less time gaming. But me, I wasn't laughing. That was the exact second I decided she had to pay. I didn't rage. I didn't fight. For weeks, I pretended to move on. I even let her use my tablet, even shared snacks with her. But behind that fake smile, I was studying her. I knew every routine. When she showered, when she left for school, when she went swimming alone in the backyard pool. That summer day, the sun was hot and she went outside with her floaties. I followed silently. She thought I was just hanging out, scrolling on my phone. But when she jumped into the pool, I was right behind her. She giggled, splashed me and dove underwater. That's when I pushed her down. She fought, she kicked, bubbles rising everywhere. But I held firm. The twist, when it was over, I leaned down and whispered, respawn. In the real world, sis, everyone thought it was a tragic accident. My parents cried for weeks, but I knew the truth. She deleted My world, so I deleted hers.

My fiance Anthony has this whole thing about his morning coffee. Not like a normal person who just drinks whatever is there. No, this guy needs his coffee made in a very specific way or his entire day is apparently ruined. French press only. Water heated to exactly 200 degrees. Four minutes of steam in time, no more, no less. And the coffee has to be this expensive organic stuff from some fancy roaster downtown that cost, like 30 bucks a bag. I've been living with this routine for two years now. Every single morning, I wake up 20 minutes before him just to start this whole coffee ceremony. Set the timer, heat the water, measure everything out perfectly, because god forbid Anthony has to make his own coffee like a functioning adult. But yesterday morning, I was running late for work, my alarm didn't go off, and I had exactly 15 minutes to get ready and leave. So I did what any normal person would do. I made regular coffee in our regular coffee maker. Use the good beans, but just press a button instead of doing the whole French press thing. Anthony came downstairs and immediately knew something was different. He took one sip, and his face went all twisted up like I just served him poison. This isn't how I like my coffee, he said, holding the mug like it personally offended him. I explained that I was Running late and didn't have time for the whole production. That's when he lost it. Started yelling about how I don't respect his preferences and how hard is it to just make coffee the right way. I'm standing there in my work clothes, keys in hand, and this grown man is having a meltdown over coffee. You know how important this is to me? He kept saying, it's the one thing I asked for. I finally snapped, Anthony, it's coffee. It's literally just coffee. And also, it's not the one thing you ask for. You ask for a lot of things. He got all quiet and weird.

When mom married Eric, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's Future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown, like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking. Pierce Buchanan speaking. Hi. I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking, he said, showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret while planning my revenge. Here's helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that and mom says processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick. Drive over, Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in. Her car is not here, I say and dad points across the street where the pin actually is. We both see it at the same same time. Royal Flush Casino. Dad's face goes white. No way. We walk in together. She's at the penny slots with a bucket of coins, empty drink cups stacked everywhere. She's been here all day. She's talking to Another woman. My family thinks I'm at the doctor. It gives me all day here. She puts a 20 in the machine. This is from my daughter's paycheck. She'll never know. I step forward. I know now. Mom spends around seeing us both and dad holds up life. Three, 60, doctor appointment. She starts stammering, but her casino friend makes it worse. Just tell them about your system. You're due for a big win after last month's losses. Dad's voice cracks. Last month, how much? Now Mom's crying, saying 8,000, maybe more. I realized why she's been watching our location so obsessively. She needed to know we weren't coming home while she gambled away our money. I feel sick realizing this is where she went. All those times I told dad she was at appointments. I helped her lie so she could sit here feeding our rent money into slot machines. Mom admits she's been going every day for three.

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panic. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I'd ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend. Kids were splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing, Lexi's Reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street.

Yes. Well, I went through it, okay? I went through it all FBI style. Your messages, your Instagram DMs, your call logs, your email. And don't think for a second I didn't see your three other emails and your photos, too. Every single thing. Okay? And did you find anything? I don't know. What do you think? Why don't you tell me you didn't? Did you, you found nothing? Because I have nothing to hide from you. We're married, babe. So are you not mad that I went through your phone? Whatever is mine is yours forever, my love. You're the best ever. Why would you think I'd be mad for. I have literally nothing to hide from you. You're my husband, my soulmate. I tell you absolutely everything there is to. No. Well, if you did, I found it. Okay? What is it you think you found? Then how about you just own up to it? Admit it like an adult. Stop acting like you don't know what's really going on. You're trying to trick me into admitting to something that didn't even happen. You don't get to flip this on to me like that. If you went through my phone, like you said, then you already know the answer, right? Oh, I know the answer. Alright. I just want you to admit it. I'm not admitting anything. You checking my phone already tells me you clearly didn't trust me. Anyway, and now you're trying to flip it on to me. So tell me, what is it you think you found, huh? Wanna explain to me what this dude is doing in your camera roll? Then, right before we got married, you were cheating on me, weren't you? And now you're not saying anything because I caught you. I can explain, babe, but promise me you won't get mad. Whatever. That was me before surgery. I used to be called Timmy, not Tina.

I actually want less. School just started, so I don't want to work more than 25 hours a week. I need you to at least keep doing your 35 to 39 hours a week. Then where's my raising benefits? That's basically full time. 40 hours is full time. You only work 39, you don't get any benefits. Either way, I need less hours. I can't keep working six days a week. I have classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I would appreciate it if I could be off those days. Only full time employees get a set schedule. Since you're part time, I can't guarantee anything, but I'll see what I can do. Fine, but I'm telling you now, if I'm scheduled on Tuesday or Thursday, I'm calling in sick. Are you sure you can't be here during school? You can't tune in on a zoom or something? No. No one wants to work these days. Hey, I overheard you asking Alex if you wanted extra hours. I'm willing to take them if they're available. Are you part time or full time? Full time. You probably already have enough hours. I'm actually only scheduled to come in three days and work 25 hours this week. That's why I'm willing to pick up any extra hours. Maybe next week. We can't afford to give you any more hours this week. Hey, Alex, let me know if you want more hours, alright? I Want less? Wait. Would you wanna switch schedules? Yes. Hey, Frankie, put me down. I mean, put Alex down for those extra hours.

This morning, my phone exploded with 32 missed calls. It happened at Connor's birthday party. Lauren stood up during dinner and announced to our entire friend group, I've been seeing someone else. I need a real man, not a kindergarten teacher who makes 30 K a year. Everyone went silent. Then Connor actually started clapping. Finally. We've all been saying, you deserve better. The whole table nodded like they'd rehearsed this. I just smiled, put down my fork, and walked out. No drama, no begging. What? They didn't know. I've been teaching kids during the day, but spending nights getting my pilot's license. My broke teacher savings account actually had 180 K from cryptocurrency investments I'd made 3 years ago. But here's the real kicker. My uncle had been battling cancer for months. He owned a small aviation company that did scenic tours and flight training. Two days before Connor's party, he'd asked me to take over the business when he retired. The company was worth 1.2 million, debt free. I've been keeping it quiet while I finished my commercial pilot certification. Lauren knew about my uncle's business, but thought it was just some tiny operation with a couple old planes. She had no idea about the government contracts, the corporate partnerships, or the fact that we were expanding into helicopter tours next year. The night she humiliated me, I called my Uncle and said yes to everything. We started the paperwork immediately. I'd also been secretly applying to international schools. Teaching abroad had always been my dream, but Lauren constantly shut it down, saying it was unrealistic and running away from responsibility. The next week, I put in my transfer request to teach at an international school in Dubai. Posted one photo on Instagram. Me in the cockpit of a small plane with the caption new adventures. Lauren's new real man. Turns out he was married with two kids. His wife found their texts and posted everything on Facebook, tagging Lauren's workplace. She got fired from her marketing job for the drama. The guy's wife also sent screenshots to Lauren's parents, were mortified their daughter was involved with a married man. Meanwhile, my Dubai teaching position came with an 80 five k salary, free housing, and I started a weekend flight instruction business. But the real money came from taking over my uncle's company. Within two months, I'd expanded to corporate charters and landed a contract with a luxury resort chain worth 400 k annually. Connor started following my Instagram again after seeing photos of me flying over Dubai skyline. Even posted a comment, dude had no idea you were doing all this. Tanya from our friend group sent a DM. We all feel terrible about that night. Too late for fake friendship. And even faker.

Suddenly, she demanded a divorce, saying, you're useless to me now. I replied, don't regret this later. Lol. The funeral was Tuesday. By Friday, she was already shopping for a mansion in Beverly Hills. I don't need you anymore, she said, tossing divorce papers on our kitchen table next to my unemployment check. I'm finally free from dead weight. I just smiled and signed them without reading. She thought I was an idiot who'd given up. But here's what she didn't know. I've been having secret conversations with her father for months. Before he died, he'd called me one evening, voice shaking with disappointment. Son, I need to tell you something about Kimberly. She's been pressuring me to change my will. She wants me to cut out her brother and sister completely. Says they don't deserve anything because they abandoned me. That wasn't true. Her siblings lived across the country, but called him daily. Kimberly barely visited unless she needed money. There's more, he continued. I caught her going through my financial documents last week. She was photographing my bank statements and investment portfolios. When I confronted her, she said she was just helping me organize. That's when he told me his plan. The will Kimberly knew about. It was fake. He'd shown it to her on purpose to test her character. The real will was locked in a different lawyer safe. Two weeks after the funeral, we're at what, She thinks is the final divorce meeting. She struts in wearing a five thousand dollar Chanel dress and diamond earrings that cost more than my car. She's already bragging about her new Porsche in the mansion she put deposit on. This is so exciting, she tells the lawyer. I can finally live the life I deserve. No more supporting a jobless husband who brings nothing to the table. The inheritance lawyer walks in with a thick leather folder. I recognize him immediately. It's Martin Lee, her father's real attorney, not the junior associate who'd been handling the official proceedings. Missus Benjamin, son, I'm afraid there's been a significant misunderstanding, he says calmly. Your smile falters slightly. What kind of misunderstanding? The will was clear. I inherited everything. He opens the folder and slides a document across the mahogany table. This is your father's actual will, executed just three months before his death. The document you've been referencing was. Let's call it a preliminary draft. She grabs the papers, her manicured nails clicking against the desk. What are you talking about? This can't be right. Martin points to the highlighted section. Your father was quite specific. He left the entire estate to your husband, Benjamin here, with explicit instructions that you receive nothing if you initiated divorce proceedings within two years of his death. The color drains from her face. That's impossible. He wouldn't do that to me. Actually, Martin continues, he included a personal letter explaining his decision. Would you Like me to read it? She nods weakly, her earlier confidence completely evaporated. Martin

Get out. I said nothing. Their faces turned pale when the notary revealed the truth. See, my stepmom Cynthia and her twin daughters, Brittany and Ashley, had moved in when I was 12. Dad always treated them like princesses, while I got hand me downs and endless chores. Blood isn't everything, Chloe, he'd say, whenever I complained about the obvious favoritism. The twins got new cars at six. Teen, I got a lecture about being grateful they got college funds. I got told to figure it out yourself. By the time I turned 18, it was clear I wasn't welcome anymore. College isn't for everyone, sweetie, Cynthia cooed, flashing that fake smile. Maybe try community college. There's a nice apartment complex downtown that takes monthly renters. So I left. I worked two jobs. Diner waitress by day, hotel cleaner by night, and clawed my way through nursing school. Six years of exhaustion, but I graduated with honors. I barely visited home every holiday invitation felt more like pity than family. Still, I built my own life. A job at the regional hospital, a small starter house, even a steady relationship with a fellow nurse named Thomas. Life finally felt stable. Then last year, dad was diagnosed with early onset dementia. Suddenly, my phone lit up non stop. We need help with Dad, Cynthia begged. One late night, You're the nurse in the family. You understand this medical stuff. When I came back, the site, it broke me. Dad barely recognized me. The house was filthy, his meds unorganized, while the twins partied by the pool and charged spa trips to his cards. He looked scared, like a child left alone. When I suggested professional caregivers, Cynthia's mask slipped. We're family, Chloe. We can handle our own. Besides, do you know how expensive those people are? They couldn't handle anything. On my next visit, I found dad wandering outside in his pajamas at 3:00am. Neighbors had called the cops. Inside, the air stank from his accidents. No one cleaned up. Britney live streamed makeup tutorials while Ashley planned her next shopping spree. This is neglect, I told Cynthia. Her eyes narrowed. Don't you dare lecture us. Where were you the past 10 years? Now you swoop in like you're better than us. That night, I made a decision. I quit my job, broke up with Thomas, and moved back home. For eight months, I became Dad's full time caregiver. Every morning, I bathed him, dressed him, and fed him. I kept his meds straight, comforted him during episodes, and listened when he had lucid moments. He'd tell me stories about mom, who passed away when I was little. I'm sorry, sweetheart, he whispered. One afternoon, his eyes finally make clear. I wasn't fair to you. Cynthia convinced me treating everyone equally meant giving them more because they weren't Really? Mine. But you were always my real daughter. The twins hated me for it. They wind I was too controlling and making them look bad. All while draining his savings on vacations. When I confronted Brittany, she just smirks. Dad wanted us to be happy. He's not going to live forever, so we might as well enjoy it now. His decline was brutal. I

I was with my ex, N, since I was 13. He was my first. Everything, and I'm talking everything. We got engaged when I was 20, and honestly, life felt perfect, like we had our whole future mapped out. Then six months after our engagement, we found out I was pregnant. We were over the moon about it. N was already picking out baby names and showing me cribs online. But two days later, I miscarried. And that's when everything started falling apart. I went into this deep, dark depression. I couldn't get out of bed some days. And tried to help at first, but then he started saying things, like, maybe it happened for a reason. Maybe we weren't ready. The worst part was when he said I should have been more careful, like it was somehow my fault. Started fighting constantly. He'd blame me. I'd scream at him. That he didn't understand what it felt like to lose something growing inside you. It got so bad, we decided to separate for a while. That while turned into a whole year. I went to therapy, worked on healing myself, and even came to a few sessions with me, which gave me hope that maybe we could fix things. When I turned 23, we decided to try again. But something was off. And was distant, like he was hiding something from me. Get weird about his phone, wouldn't look me in the eyes when we Talked about the future. I started overthinking everything, wondering if he blamed me for the miscarriage. It was eating me alive. So I did something I'm not proud of. I went through his phone. That's when I found out that during our separation year, he'd been texting my sister Emma constantly. At first it looked innocent, just him venting about our relationship. But then the messages got flirtier. Then there were pictures. Then there were messages about meeting up. My own sister had been sleeping with my ex while I was falling apart over losing our baby. The worst part. She was pregnant with his baby. And my parents knew. My friends knew. Everyone knew except me. Kicked out immediately and cut off everyone who had kept the secret from me. I felt so betrayed and alone. I thought maybe with time I could process this and figure out how to move forward. Then two weeks ago, I got a wedding invitation in the mail. My sister and Ann were getting married. Something inside me just snapped. I got drunk, like really drunk, and took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing them an engagement party. I walked into that house with my hair a mess, still in my pajamas, and gave the most epic fuck you speech of my life. I told everyone exactly what I thought of them. How they were all disgusting for keeping this from me. How they helped my sister steal my Life. While I was grieving, my sister ran upstairs crying, and my parents started yelling at me for ruining their precious party. That's when my sister came back downstairs and said the most evil thing I've ever heard in my life. She looked me dead in the eyes and said, maybe your baby died for a reason, so I could get my happy ending. The room went completely silent. Even my parents looked shocked. I just stared.

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the I R S. And I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly, and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbor, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First. I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be this Helpless single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? Cashier is asking for I D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5 or an S? Scratching messed it up. I gave him completely fake numbers, mixing up digits, going super slow. After 20 minutes of this, he got frustrated. Ma'am, those numbers don't work. Go buy new cards. So I did the whole routine again. Drove to Walmart, called him back crying harder. The first store's cards didn't work. Are you sure you're really from the IRS? This time I really went for it. I'm in the Walmart parking lot fake crying so loud. Other shoppers were staring. My kids are asking why mommy is buying $5,000 worth of iTunes cards. My daughter wants to know if we're going to be homeless. The scammer actually tried to comfort me. Don't worry, ma'am, just read me the numbers and everything will be fine. I fed him another set of fake numbers, this time adding sorry, my baby spilled juice on the card. Let me clean it off. Three hours In. This guy had wasted his entire afternoon on me. I could hear other scammers in the background getting impatient. His supervisor was probably wondering why he hadn't closed the deal yet. That's when I went for the kill shot. You know what's funny? I just got off the phone with my cousin Jake. He's the police officer standing right next to me. And he says,

My mom said, if you can't keep up, don't bother coming. She was talking about my cousin Justin's destination wedding in Bali. The whole family was going. Aunts, uncles, grandparents, everyone. Except, apparently, me. I'm a freelance graphic designer, and mom's always treated my career like it's just a hobby. I understand, I said, quietly, stirring my coffee. Have fun taking pictures. My sister Kate rolled her eyes. Maybe if you got a real job instead of playing on your computer. Computer all day. What they didn't know was that I've been secretly working with Justin for six months. He'd hired me to design his entire wedding brand after seeing my portfolio online. Invitations, programs, well come bags, ceremony signage, reception menus, everything. The whole aesthetic was mine. And he paid me $8,000 up front, with another $3,000 due on delivery. Justin made me swear to keep it secret because he wanted to surprise everyone with how professional and beautiful everything would look. Trust me, he'd said. They're going to lose their minds when they see this stuff. The family group chat was buzzing for weeks about their flights, hotels, and outfits. I watched them plan every detail while pretending I wasn't involved. Mom even posted photos of her new vacation wardrobe with captions like when your son can't afford family trips. Three days before the wedding, my phone rang at 2:00am. Justin was panicking. Dude, we have a massive problem. The resort's printer completely Broke down and all our wedding materials are stuck in Indonesian customs. Some paperwork issue. We have nothing. No programs, no signs, no table cards. The wedding planner is freaking out. I sat up in bed. What do you need? Can you fly out here and handle this? You know the designs better than anyone. I'll cover your flight, hotel, food, everything. Plus I'll pay you the final 3 thousand dollars and throw in another 2 thousand dollar bonus. I'm desperate, man. I was already opening my laptop to book flights. Send me the hotel info. I'll be there tomorrow. You're a lifesaver. But hey, still, keep it secret until the ceremony. I want this to be the reveal. Twenty four hours later, I was in a Balinese print shop working with local vendors to recreate everything. The language barrier was intense, but somehow we made it work. I spent two straight days running between the resort print shops and flower markets, coordinating every detail. The morning of the wedding, I was on the beach at sunrise setting up ceremony decorations when I heard familiar voices. My family was walking down the path from the hotel all dressed up and looking around confused. Why does this look so professional? My aunt was saying. This doesn't look like typical resort stuff. I ducked behind the altar setup, grinning to myself. My mom spotted me first. Her face went completely white. Jonah! What? How are you here? You said you couldn't afford The flight, Kate's mouth literally fell open. Did you borrow money? Please tell me you didn't go into debt for this. Before I could answer, Justin appeared in his pre ceremony casual clothes, beaming. He walked straight over and threw his arm around my shoulders. Bored it. Your son didn't pay a dime to be here. I flew him out. He gestured to all the beautiful decorations around us. Meet my secret wedding designer. Joan has been creating our entire wedding aesthetic for months. Every invitation you guys got, every program you'll read today, every single detail you're going to Instagram. That's all his work.

So I'm getting married to my fiance in six weeks. I saved up for months to buy this gorgeous dress. $3,000 that took me forever to save working at a coffee shop while going to school. My future mother in law kept bugging me about trying it on since the day I brought it home. She'd text me constantly asking when she could see it. She'd show up to our apartment unannounced asking to peek at it. She even offered me a hundred bucks to let her try it on just once. I kept saying no because honestly, something felt off about how obsessed she was. Like, who gets that excited about someone else's wedding dress? My fiance thought I was being dramatic. He kept saying his mom just loves weddings and she's excited for us. But I stood my ground. The dress stays in my closet until my wedding day. Last Tuesday, I came home from my shift early because we were slow. I walked into our apartment and immediately heard my fiance panicking upstairs. He was texting someone frantically and blocking me from going to our bedroom. That's when I knew something was seriously wrong. Pushed past him and open the door. There she was, his mother. Standing in front of my mirror, wearing my wedding dress. My three Thousand dollar dress that I specifically told her she couldn't even look at. She had somehow gotten it on perfectly. The zipper was done up and everything. She was posing and taking selfies in it like it was some kind of photo shoot. When she saw me, her face went completely white. I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture before either of them could stop me. She started yelling at me to delete it, but I was already backing it up to the class. My fiance jumped in trying to calm everyone down, saying it was just harmless fun and no damage was done. But I felt sick looking at the dress knowing she had been in it taking pictures, probably planning to show all her friends the whole thing. Felt violated. I told them both she had three days to Venmo me $3,000 for a replacement dress or I'm sending that photo to every single person in their family. Group chat. She burst into tears, saying I was being cruel and that she just wanted to feel connected to our wedding. My fiance said I was overreacting and that his mom didn't mean any harm, but I wasn't budging. She crossed a major line and I want a dress that's actually mine. She kept the dress on for another 10 minutes, crying and refusing to take it off. Finally, my fiance had to help unzip her because she was having some kind of breakdown. She left our Apartment still sobbing and hasn't contacted me since.

Get out. I said nothing. Their faces turned pale when the notary revealed the truth. See, my stepmom Cynthia and her twin daughters, Brittany and Ashley, had moved in when I was 12. Dad always treated them like princesses, while I got hand me downs and endless chores. Blood isn't everything, Chloe, he'd say, whenever I complained about the obvious favoritism. The twins got new cars at six. Teen, I got a lecture about being grateful they got college funds. I got told to figure it out yourself. By the time I turned 18, it was clear I wasn't welcome anymore. College isn't for everyone, sweetie, Cynthia cooed, flashing that fake smile. Maybe try community college. There's a nice apartment complex downtown that takes monthly renters. So I left. I worked two jobs. Diner waitress by day, hotel cleaner by night, and clawed my way through nursing school. Six years of exhaustion, but I graduated with honors. I barely visited home every holiday invitation felt more like pity than family. Still, I built my own life. A job at the regional hospital, a small starter house, even a steady relationship with a fellow nurse named Thomas. Life finally felt stable. Then last year, dad was diagnosed with early onset dementia. Suddenly, my phone lit up non stop. We need help with Dad, Cynthia begged. One late night, You're the nurse in the family. You understand this medical stuff. When I came back, the site, it broke me. Dad barely recognized me. The house was filthy, his meds unorganized, while the twins partied by the pool and charged spa trips to his cards. He looked scared, like a child left alone. When I suggested professional caregivers, Cynthia's mask slipped. We're family, Chloe. We can handle our own. Besides, do you know how expensive those people are? They couldn't handle anything. On my next visit, I found dad wandering outside in his pajamas at 3:00am. Neighbors had called the cops. Inside, the air stank from his accidents. No one cleaned up. Britney live streamed makeup tutorials while Ashley planned her next shopping spree. This is neglect, I told Cynthia. Her eyes narrowed. Don't you dare lecture us. Where were you the past 10 years? Now you swoop in like you're better than us. That night, I made a decision. I quit my job, broke up with Thomas, and moved back home. For eight months, I became Dad's full time caregiver. Every morning, I bathed him, dressed him, and fed him. I kept his meds straight, comforted him during episodes, and listened when he had lucid moments. He'd tell me stories about mom, who passed away when I was little. I'm sorry, sweetheart, he whispered one afternoon, his eyes finally clear. I wasn't fair to you. Cynthia convinced me treating everyone equally meant giving them more. Because they weren't really Mine. But you were always my real daughter. The twins hated me for it. They wind I was too controlling and making them look bad. All while draining his savings on vacation. When I confronted Brittany, she just smirked. Dad wanted us to be happy. He's not going to live forever, so we might as well enjoy it now. His decline was brutal. I stayed up nights holding his hand. Cynthia and the twins locked themselves in their rooms, claiming they couldn't handle it. He. He passed away on a Tuesday morning while I was feeding him oatmeal. They were at the mall. The funeral was theater. Cynthia sobbed in designer black. The twins post for selfies captioned love you forever, dad. I said nothing. Just whispered goodbye to the man who finally remembered me.

Suddenly, she demanded a divorce, saying, you're useless to me now. I replied, don't regret this later. Lol. The funeral was Tuesday. By Friday, she was already shopping for a mansion in Beverly Hills. I don't need you anymore, she said, tossing divorce papers on our kitchen table next to my unemployment check. I'm finally free from dead weight. I just smiled and signed them without reading. She thought I was an idiot who'd given up. But here's what she didn't know. I've been having secret conversations with her father for months. Before he died, he'd called me one evening, voice shaking with disappointment. Son, I need to tell you something about Kimberly. She's been pressuring me to change my will. She wants me to cut out her brother and sister completely. Says they don't deserve anything because they abandoned me. That wasn't true. Her siblings lived across the country, but called him daily. Kimberly barely visited unless she needed money. There's more he can continued. I caught her going through my financial documents last week. She was photographing my bank statements and investment portfolios. When I confronted her, she said she was just helping me organize. That's when he told me his plan. The will Kimberly knew about. It was fake. He'd shown it to her on purpose to test her character. The real will was locked in a different lawyer's safe. Two weeks after the funeral, we're at What she thinks is the final divorce meeting. She struts in wearing a five thousand dollar Chanel dress and diamond earrings that cost more than my car. She's already bragging about her new Porsche in the mansion she put a deposit on. This is so exciting, she tells the lawyer. I can finally live the life I deserve. No more supporting a jobless husband who brings nothing to the table. The inheritance lawyer walks in with a thick leather folder. I recognize him immediately. It's Martin Lee, her father's real attorney, not the junior associate who'd been handling the official proceedings. Missus Benjamin, son, I'm afraid there's been a significant misunderstanding, he says calmly. Smile falters slightly. What kind of misunderstanding? The will was clear. I inherited everything. He opens the folder and slides a document across the mahogany table. This is your father's actual will, executed just three months before his death. The document you've been referencing was. Let's call it a preliminary draft. She grabs the papers, her manicured nails clicking against the desk. What are you talking about? This can't be right. Martin points to the highlighted section. Your father was quite specific. He left the entire estate to your husband, Benjamin here, with explicit instructions that you receive nothing if you initiated divorce proceedings within two years of his death. The color drains from her face. That's impossible.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After being homeless for two years, sleeping in parking lots, showering at truck stops, I finally saved enough to buy my own place. A small three bedroom house. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. The irony wasn't lost on me when I was homeless, begging them to let me park my camper in their driveway for just a few weeks. They called it an eye sore and told me to figure it out myself. My brother Dan actually laughed, calling me a homeless bum while his wife took pictures to mock me on social media. Now here they were, all four of them plus Dan's pregnant wife, going up at my door unannounced. They didn't even have my address. I never gave it to them. They must have followed me from work or something. Equally creepy. The moment I opened the door, they pushed past me like they owned the place. Dan's wife immediately started taking pictures again, but this time with dollar signs in her eyes. My parents were walking through my house like real estate agents, pointing at rooms, measuring spaces with their eyes, discussing which kid would get which bedroom. This is way too much space for just you, my mom declared, running her fingers along my kitchen. Counters. It's wasteful. My dad was already outside circling my property. Good luck. Size close to Dan's work, too. This will save us money on gas. That's when Dan pulled me aside into what used to be my peaceful living room. His wife and kids had already made themselves comfortable on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, tracking MUD across my carpet. Look, this is simple, Dan said, not even looking me in the eye. You don't need all this space. We're moving in next weekend. Can live in that camper out back. No discussion, no asking, no would you consider, or we'd really appreciate just informing me like I was a tenant getting evicted. The kids need stability, he continued. Olivia's pregnant again. We can't keep cramming everyone into mom and dad's place. I actually laughed. Absolutely not. That's when my mom marched back in from inspecting in my bedrooms. Daniel has four kids and another on the way. You're being selfish, living in all this space alone. My dad nodded from the doorway. It's time you helped family instead of just thinking about yourself. We raised you better than this. The audacity was breathtaking. These were the same people who wouldn't let me park in their driveway when I was literally homeless. Now they wanted to kick me out of my own house. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Let me get this straight. Do you want me to give up the house? I Bought with my own money. That I'm paying the mortgage on. So you can live here for free? We're not asking, Dan said, stepping closer like he was trying to intimidate me. We're telling you. Family comes first. You owe us. After everything we've done for you. Everything you've done for me? I almost choked. You literally called me a homeless bum.

She's just old fashioned. Victoria whispers. Maybe we can talk to her. Later that night, after everyone left, I called my lawyer. She has no tenant rights. He confirmed.

There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son. Anyway, your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad, every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore, every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house when I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn and garbage bags. Trespassing, dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here, I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all watching from their windows. Test day arrived at the family lawyer's office. The whole crew showed up like it was some kind of Celebration. Dad wore his best suit and kept checking his Rolex, probably already planning how to spend what he thought would be his inheritance money. Kyle brought his new girlfriend to show off. You're about to see how we handle fake family members, he told her loudly. Linda kept taking selfies, probably planning to post about their victory later. Uncle Robert and Aunt Deborah drove in from two states away just to witness my humiliation. The family group chat had been buzzing for days about this showdown. The DNA results came back after the longest hour of my life, 99.9% match. I was definitely Dad's biological son. Dad's victory dance and high fives with Kyle lasted exactly 10 seconds. However, the lawyer continued clearing his throat. There's something else the family needs to know about. Your grandfather actually left a second more recent will that supersedes the First one, the room went dead silent. You could hear Linda's phone camera clicking. I pulled out my phone and played a video I'd recorded with Grandpa just weeks before he passed. His shaky but determined voice filled the entire office. To my son Harold and his family, who abandoned me in my final years, who only called when they needed money, you get absolutely nothing. To my grandson Noah, who stayed by my side, who drove me to chemo appointment.

Get out. I said nothing. Their faces turned pale when the notary revealed the truth. See, my stepmom Cynthia and her twin daughters, Brittany and Ashley, had moved in when I was 12. Dad always treated them like princesses, while I got hand me downs and endless chores. Blood isn't everything, Chloe, he'd say, whenever I complained about the obvious favoritism. The twins got new cars at six. Teen, I got a lecture about being grateful they got college funds. I got told to figure it out yourself. By the time I turned 18, it was clear I wasn't welcome anymore. College isn't for everyone, sweetie, Cynthia cooed, flashing that fake smile. Maybe try community college. There's a nice apartment complex downtown that takes monthly renters. So I left. I worked two jobs. Diner waitress by day, hotel cleaner by night, and clawed my way through nursing school. Six years of exhaustion, but I graduated with honors. I barely visited home every holiday invitation felt more like pity than family. Still, I built my own life. A job at the regional hospital, a small starter house, even a steady relationship with a fellow nurse named Thomas. Life finally felt stable. Then last year, dad was diagnosed with early onset dementia. Suddenly, my phone lit up non stop. We need help with Dad, Cynthia begged. One late night, You're the nurse in the family. You understand this medical stuff. When I came back, the site, it broke me. Dad barely recognized me. The house was filthy, his meds unorganized, while the twins partied by the pool and charged spa trips to his cards. He looked scared, like a child left alone. When I suggested professional caregivers, Cynthia's mask slipped. We're family, Chloe. We can handle our own. Besides, do you know how expensive those people are? They couldn't handle anything. On my next visit, I found dad wandering outside in his pajamas at 3:00am. Neighbors had called the cops. Inside, the air stank from his accidents. No one cleaned up. Britney live streamed makeup tutorials while Ashley planned her next shopping spree. This is neglect, I told Cynthia. Her eyes narrowed. Don't you dare lecture us. Where were you the past 10 years? Now you swoop in like you're better than us. That night, I made a decision. I quit my job, broke up with Thomas, and moved back home. For eight months, I became Dad's full time caregiver. Every morning, I bathed him, dressed him, and fed him. I kept his meds straight, comforted him during episodes, and listened when he had lucid moments. He'd tell me stories about mom, who passed away when I was little. I'm sorry, sweetheart, he whispered one afternoon, his eyes finally clear. I wasn't fair to you. Cynthia convinced me treating everyone equally meant giving them more. Because they weren't really Mine. But you were always my real daughter. The twins hated me for it. They wind I was too controlling and making them look bad. All while draining his savings on vacation. When I confronted Brittany, she just smirked. Dad wanted us to be happy. He's not going to live forever, so we might as well enjoy it now. His decline was brutal. I stayed up nights holding his hand. Cynthia and the twins locked themselves in their rooms, claiming they couldn't handle it. He. He passed away on a Tuesday morning while I was feeding him oatmeal. They were at the mall. The funeral was theater. Cynthia sobbed in designer black. The twins post for selfies captioned love you forever, dad. I said nothing. Just whispered goodbye to the man who finally remembered me.

My mother in law, Carol, tried to buy us a house without asking, so I told her we bought a house boat on a sewage pond. The real estate agent sounded confused when she called asking to confirm our offer on the Maple Street Colonial. My mouth went completely dry. We never made any offer. Carol did. I hung up and sat at the kitchen table with shaking hands, spreading out the paperwork she'd somehow sent to the agent. Nathan walked in and found me there, just staring at pages that had our signatures on them. Signatures we never signed. Your mom tried to buy us a house, I said. He grabbed the papers and his face went from confused to horrified as he read. She what? This whole nightmare started three months ago when we mentioned house hunting at Sunday dinner. I watched Carol's eyes light up like we just announced a pregnancy. From that moment on, every single Sunday became an interrogation over pot roast. She'd lean across the table asking what neighborhoods we liked, what our budget was, how many bedrooms we wanted. I kept telling her we'd handle it ourselves, but he just nod and smile like I hadn't spoken at all. First she created a spreadsheet with dozens of houses and shared it with the entire family. Then Gary started driving around on Saturdays taking photos of random houses. Beth ranked schools for Kids we don't have. Doug sent us color coded commute maps. The worst part was when Carol would corner me at the sink after dinner and I'd smell that too sweet perfume that made my stomach turn, while she'd whisper, just tell me the neighborhood. I promise I won't interfere. She'd already toured five houses with agents who thought she was me. Tomorrow, I told Nathan, feeling weirdly calm all of a sudden. I'm calling your mother with the worst news of her life. Monday morning, 8:00am sharp. My heart was pounding as I dialed Carol's number. We bought our dream home, I said, forcing excitement into my voice. I squealed so loud I had to pull the phone away. Where? Send photos. What street? It's on the water. The Lake District. Oh, honey, that's wonderful. Not the lake. The retention pond behind the sewage treatment plant. It's a houseboat. We move in four weeks. The silence was so complete, I could hear my own heartbeat. Then the phone clattered to what sounded like their kitchen floor. Gary's voice boomed in the background. Beth was screaming something about cholera. My stomach hurt from holding in laughter. Carol came back on, breathing like she'd run a Marathon. This. This has to be a joke already. Sign the papers. Within an hour, they'd formed Operation Stop the Boat. Doug sent screenshots of their group chat, and I had to bite my lip to keep from cackling. They'd assigned roles. Carol would research, Health hazards. Gary would investigate legal issues. Beth would document environmental disasters. 43 calls in two hours. My phone vibrated itself off the table. Voicemails of Carol sobbing about dysentery. Gary texting maritime law articles. Sending photos of pond scum with your new neighbors written across them. Carol tagged me in houseboat disaster articles on Facebook. Someone started a gofundme called Save Nathan from sewage. She emailed my boss a massive Powerpoint titled Please Talk Sense into her. The first week was insane. Carol showed up at 5:00am with a nurse who explained parasites while I tried not to laugh into my coffee. Carol handed her $200 cash and the poor woman practically ran to her car. Gary filed complaints about the pond with the city. They called me.

I refused, and the next day, before I left, I found them tearing up my lottery ticket, laughing because I'm envious. But I laughed my head off because that ticket was fake. See, I saw this coming from a mile away. My sister Ruby, has always been the golden child, and my parents have always made me give her everything. When I got my first job at 16, and they made me give Ruby half my paycheck to teach me about sharing. When grandma left me her ring, they gave it to Ruby because she'll get more use out of it. Every birthday, every achievement, every moment of my life, Ruby had to get equal or more. So when I won, I knew they'd pull this exact stunt. The moment I told them, I could see the wheels turning in their heads. Dad immediately launched into his speech about family responsibility, while Ruby sat there with that smug smile she gets when she's about to take something that's mine. That night, after they delivered their ultimatum, I heard them whispering in the kitchen. She'll cave, Ruby said confidently. She always does. Mom agreed, saying I'd never actually leave because I'm too dependent on family. They had no idea they were dealing with someone who'd finally had enough. I spent all night creating a perfect day ticket. I Work in graphic design, so I knew exactly how to make it look authentic. Same paper texture, same fonts, everything. The only difference? Completely different numbers that definitely hadn't won anything. I made sure it looked slightly worn, like I've been carrying it around since the drawing. Meanwhile, the real ticket was safely locked in my bank's safety deposit box, already verified and ready for claim the next morning. I acted devastated. I came to breakfast looking like I've been crying all night. Fine, I said quietly. I'll pack and leave today. I made sure to accidentally leave the fake ticket in my wallet on the kitchen counter. When I went upstairs to pack, the bait was set. Sure enough, twenty minutes later, I heard screaming from downstairs. Amelia, get down here now! Dad's voice was shaking with rage. I walked down to find all three of them huddled around my wallet, the torn pieces of the fake ticket scattered across the counter like confetti. How does it feel now? Ruby laughed, holding up a piece of the the ticket. No lottery money for you. Maybe next time you'll think about what family means. Mom was nodding approvingly. This is what happens when you choose greed over family, Amelia. Dad crossed his arms. Hopefully this teaches you a lesson about sharing. I just stood there for a moment, taking it all in. Then I started laughing. Quietly at first, then louder. You're absolutely right, I said, still chuckling. That ticket Was completely worthless. Their triumphant expression started to alter. Something in my tone wasn't matching their expectation. I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app, making sure the screen was facing them. 1 847, 329 18 deposited yesterday at 3:47 p m. The silence that followed was. Ruby's mouth literally fell open. Mom grabbed the counter to study herself. Dad just stared at my phone screen like it was showing him a ghost. The real ticket was never in my wallet, I continued calmly. It's been in my bank safety deposit box since the day after I won. That piece of garbage you just tore up? I made it last night specifically for you to find. Ruby's

Every August for like, six years, I host this huge end of summer party in my backyard. It's basically become the neighborhood event that everyone looks forward to. Kids run around screaming with popsicles, parents drink beer and complain about going back to school shopping. And by 9:00, the little ones are dragged inside to sleep while the adults keep the party going until, like, midnight. My house is literally right next to the backyard, so when my kids, Mia and Tyler, get tired, I just take them upstairs, tuck them in, and leave the bedroom window open so I can hear everything going on outside. I have my old iPhone, too, so if anything happens, they can just text me. It's worked perfectly for years. This year, I invited my boyfriend Kevin and his two kids, Emma and Jake. We've been together for six months, which felt like long enough to include them in my tradition. But when I explained how the night usually goes, Kevin's face got all weird. He said he wasn't comfortable with his kids sleeping at my place since they'd never stayed over before. Okay, fair enough. Then he said he didn't like the idea of putting them to bed while he stayed outside with me. didn't want to leave early with them while I stayed at my own party. Basically, nothing about my setup worked for him. I I Told him I totally understood and that they didn't have to come. Like, this isn't some random hangout I threw together last minute. This is an annual thing with a format that works for everyone who's been coming for years. If it doesn't work for you, then don't come. No big deal. But Kevin lost his mind, started saying that he and his kids weren't actually welcome because of how I set everything up, that I should have changed the whole party just for them, that any good girlfriend would leave her own party early to put his kids to bed and stay with them. The party happened without them. It was actually amazing. Missus Chen from next door brought her famous potato salad. The Henderson kids had a water balloon fight that soaked half the adults. And Around 10:30, when all the kids were asleep, we played music and talked until almost one in the morning. I didn't think about Kevin once until my phone started buzzing. He'd been texting me all night asking why I wasn't calling him. Said I should have made time during my own party to check in with him, that he felt left out and ignored. I saw the messages when I was cleaning up and just put my phone away. The next day, he came over and we had this massive fight. He kept saying I chose my neighbors over him and his kids, that I prioritized some stupid tradition over our relationship. That if I really cared about him, I would have either changed the party format or left early to spend time with them. I told him that was insane. This party happens one night a year. Everyone knows the deal. His kids would have had fun until bedtime, and then they could have gone home or figured something else out. But changing a six year tradition for someone I've been dating for six months? Making all my neighbors adapt to his comfort level.

I worked in logistics at the shipping company for like eight years. Everyone called me the most chill guy there. I never got mad when people messed up my paperwork, never complained when they scheduled me for overtime last minute. Even when the coffee machine broke for two whole weeks and I was getting these awful headaches every afternoon, I just bought my own instant coffee and dealt with it. My supervisor, Todd, would always joke that I was made of chamomile tea or something. Every quarter I got these little certificates saying reliable and professional. I kept them in my desk drawer like some kind of weird trophy collection. Then HR came up with this brilliant new policy. Anonymous internal behaviour feedback. Basically, anyone could report anyone for being difficult or unprofessional. One report got you a warning. Two reports meant you lost your quarterly bonus. 3 reports and you were sitting in HR getting reviewed for termination. I wasn't worried. I mean, what was I gonna get reported for? Being too quiet? I literally helped train half the people on my team. When Ryan started 2 years ago, I taught him how to use the forklift, covered his shifts when his kid got sick, even helped him pass his safety exam by staying late to practice with him. But then I got my first warning email. Just sitting there in my inbox on a Tuesday morning. Like a punch to The gut. You have received an internal behavioral concern. Please review our workplace conduct policies. Stared at that email for, like, 10 minutes. I asked my desk neighbor, Kevin, if he knew what I could have possibly done. He just shrugged and said maybe someone was having a bad day and took it out on me. Two weeks later, another email. Same thing. Second internal behavioral concern received. I went straight to HR, asked Janet what exactly I was being accused of. She smiled that fake customer service smile and said they couldn't reveal specifics to protect the anonymity of the reporting process. She could tell me the general nature of the complaints. Apparently, I was making people uncomfortable with passive aggressive behavior and giving people hostile eye contact. Eye contact? I literally got reported for looking at people. I actually laughed out loud in her office. I asked her if she was serious. She said they take all workplace concerns very seriously and I should reflect on how my behavior might be affecting others. The third report came three days later. You have received three internal behavioral concerns. Please schedule a meeting with HR to discuss your continued employment. I printed out every performance review I'd gotten for the past eight years. All excellent ratings. Wrote this calm, professional response explaining that I had no idea what these reports were about. I even asked Kevin and two other co workers to write statements saying I was always professional and Helpful HR scheduled the meeting for the following Monday. Janet sat there taking notes while I presented my case. She nodded and smiled and said they'd review everything carefully by Friday. The promotion I've been expecting for months went to Ryan instead. That's when something clicked in my brain. I went to Best Buy that week.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She look uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease, and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself. Then I started a long conversation with Daniel about this Epic party happening at some remote barn outside town. I made it sound exclusive, secretive, like something a paranoid mom would totally freak out about. I mentioned the address random dirt road I found on Google Maps that LED to absolutely nothing. I talked about how it was starting at midnight, how everyone was going to be there, how I couldn't wait to finally do something without my mom knowing. Then I put my phone down and waited. At 1:00am, the app logged that she opened the conversation. At 1:00am, I heard her bedroom Door Creek open. At 1:00am, I heard the garage door at

When I tried to correct my stepdaughter, I just smiled and said, alright. I'm Brandon, 38 and married to Samantha for three years. She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she got defensive. Don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's dumb. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills and school supplies for months. While she struggled with debt, I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids. Four hundred dollars a month each straight into savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I canceled everything. Car insurance, gone. Phone plan, terminated. The college accounts I'd opened, closed and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep the pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden soccer registration fees, not my problem anymore. I even canceled the Family gym membership and stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscribe, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling, all of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because as the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired, she had to leave work early, costing her overtime pay she desperately needed. That evening, Samantha panicked when she opened the fridge to find it nearly empty. The pantry was bare except for some stale crackers and a can of beans. Where's all the food? What happened to everything, she demanded, hands shaking as she looked at the empty shelves. I shrugged. You said, get my own kids so I'm focusing on the children who'll actually be mine someday. These aren't my responsibility anymore. You made that crystal clear. But Brandon, I didn't mean. You absolutely meant it. I interrupted. Charlotte stole from you. And instead of parenting her, you attacked me for caring. So I'm done caring. The look on her face was priceless, pure panic mixed with the dawning realization of just how much I've been carrying financially. Charlotte stormed into the kitchen. This is so unfair. You can't just stop paying for stuff. Watch me, I said. Only your mom made it clear, you're not my kids. So figure it out yourselves. Over the next week, reality hit them like a freight train. Samantha's paycheck couldn't stretch to cover what I've been handling. Charlotte's dance recital got canceled because the pain bounce Aiden soccer gear stayed dirty because no one had money for the laundromat. The twins started fighting, constantly stressed about their phones being dead and their friends asking why they couldn't hang out anymore. Charlotte couldn't even do her homework properly because I'd stopped paying for the internet. Samantha looked exhausted, working double shifts just to keep the lights on. Dark circles under her eyes, hair always messy, constantly stressed about making ends meet. The house felt different too. No more movie nights because no streaming services. No more.

If that's what you want, I said quietly. She rolled her eyes. Finally. Maybe now you'll stop being so desperate and embarrassing. Valentine's Day arrived. Miranda texted asking about if we had plans. I responded that I was going to Nate's to watch the game. She could come if she wanted. Dead silence for an hour. Didn't we have a reservation? She finally asked. I reminded her that I don't make romantic reservations for my buddies. That night, she showed up at Nate's in a red dress and heels. Handed her a beer without Looking up from the TV and went back to the game. When she tried to sit next to me on the couch, I pointed to the recliner across the room. Dude, you're blocking the TV! Nate looked confused. Miranda's face went red. She spent the night watching us play video games and talk about sports. Her birthday came three weeks later. I got her what I got all my bros. A six pack of beer and buffalo wings from the sketchy place near campus. Stared at the grease stained container like it was radioactive. Where's my actual gift? She asked, voice shaking. That is your gift. Same thing I got will last month. Pretty good wings, too. But I'm your girlfriend. No, you're my friend who I occasionally sleep with. Your exact words. Didn't speak to me for two days. The real entertainment started at her company Spring Gala. She begged me to come, bought me a suit, and said it was important for her promotion. When her boss approached asking how long we've been together, I corrected him immediately, oh, we're not together. Her boss looked bewildered, but she said you were her boyfriend of 10 months. Nah, she doesn't do the relationship thing. We're buddies who hook up occasionally. She was actually just telling me how suffocating real relationships are. Miranda grabbed my arm so hard it left marks. Her coworkers started whispering. At her cousin's wedding in may, the disasters multiplied when they called for couples photos. I stayed seated, playing on my phone. We're not a couple, just friends with benefits, I explained to the photographer, who asked three times if I was sure. During the slow songs, I was at the bar with other guys talking about basketball, while she stood alone on the dance floor. Her family kept asking if we'd broken up. I explained cheerfully that Miranda didn't want to be together, just friends with benefits. Her grandmother nearly fainted. Her mom pulled her aside for a long conversation about self respect and not letting men use you. By month three, she was getting desperate. She tried to hold my hand in public. I'd give her a fist bump instead. When she leaned in for a kiss at dinner, I went for the high five. Bros don't make out at restaurants, I said. The waiter smirked.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After being homeless for two years, sleeping in parking lots, showering at truck stops, I finally saved enough to buy my own place. A small three bedroom house. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. The irony wasn't lost on me when I was homeless, begging them to let me park my camper in their driveway for just a few weeks. They called it an eye sore and told me to figure it out myself. My brother Dan actually laughed, calling me a homeless bum while his wife took pictures to mock me on social media. Now here they were, all four of them plus Dan's pregnant wife, going up at my door unannounced. They didn't even have my address. I never gave it to them. They must have followed me from work or something. Equally creepy. The moment I opened the door, they pushed past me like they owned the place. Dan's wife immediately started taking pictures again, but this time with dollar signs in her eyes. My parents were walking through my house like real estate agents, pointing at rooms, measuring spaces with their eyes, discussing which kid would get which bedroom. This is way too much space for just you, my mom declared, running her fingers along my kitchen. Counters. It's wasteful. My dad was already outside circling my property. Good luck. Size close to Dan's work, too. This will save us money on gas. That's when Dan pulled me aside into what used to be my peaceful living room. His wife and kids had already made themselves comfortable on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, tracking MUD across my carpet. Look, this is simple, Dan said, not even looking me in the eye. You don't need all this space. We're moving in next weekend. Can live in that camper out back. No discussion, no asking, no would you consider, or we'd really appreciate just informing me like I was a tenant getting evicted. The kids need stability, he continued. Olivia's pregnant again. We can't keep cramming everyone into mom and dad's place. I actually laughed. Absolutely not. That's when my mom marched back in from inspecting in my bedrooms. Daniel has four kids and another on the way. You're being selfish, living in all this space alone. My dad nodded from the doorway. It's time you helped family instead of just thinking about yourself. We raised you better than this. The audacity was breathtaking. These were the same people who wouldn't let me park in their driveway when I was literally homeless. Now they wanted to kick me out of my own house. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Let me get this straight. Do you want me to give up the house? I Bought with my own money. That I'm paying the mortgage on. So you can live here for free? We're not asking, Dan said, stepping closer like he was trying to intimidate me. We're telling you, family comes first. You owe us. After everything we've done for you. Everything you've done for me? I almost choked. You literally called me a homeless bum and refused to help when I was living in my truck. That was different. My mom snapped. You were irresponsible back then. Now you need to step up and do the right thing. Dan's wife finally spoke up from my couch. Besides, it's not

As she walked away, she loudly said, A guy like you should be grateful I even dated you. I smiled and calmly waited. Two hours later, she was begging me to come back. See, what Danielle didn't know was that I'd been planning to propose that night. The ring was literally in my jacket pocket when she started her little performance for her friends. I'd spent three months picking it out, saving up for my tech job, even asking her best friend what style she'd like. But here's the thing. Earlier that week, Danielle's marketing company had a complete system meltdown. Their servers crashed, client data was corrupted. Everything was chaos. Her boss, Edward, was panicking because they had a huge presentation for their biggest client. The next day, Danielle called me crying, begging for help. So I spent 14 hours straight rebuilding their entire network infrastructure, recovering lost files, and setting up new security protocols. I did it all remotely, working through the night while Danielle slept. When everything was fixed, Edward was so grateful, he told Danielle whoever solved this was getting a massive promotion and raise. The company had been about to lose their biggest account. Here's what Danielle didn't know. She had no idea I was the one who fixed everything. She thought they'd hired some expensive consultant because that's what Edward initially Told everyone before I asked him to keep my involvement quiet. I didn't want credit at her workplace. But Danielle being Danielle, immediately started taking credit. She told everyone she'd coordinated the technical response and managed the crisis. By the time I showed up for dinner, she'd apparently convinced half the office she was some kind of tech genius. Yes. So when she humiliated me in front of her friends, calling me a loser who should be grateful she dated me, I made a decision. I pulled out my phone right there at the table and sent one simple email to Edward. Hey, Edward, about that system fixed last week. Just wanted to clarify that Danielle wasn't involved in the technical. I handled the entire recovery personally as a favor to Danielle, but wanted to make sure credit went where it was due. Hope the Harris presentation went well. I attached screenshots of my remote access logs, knowing exactly when and how I'd fixed everything, along with the recovery scripts I'd written. Then I paid the 200 dollar Bill like a gentleman and went home. Two hours later, my phone started buzzing. Please call me. I can explain everything. I made a huge mistake then, and my boss wants to talk to you. What did you tell him then? I'm so sorry. We can work this out. Turns out Edward had called an emergency meeting the moment he got my email. He'd been suspicious about Danielle's sudden technical knowledge, but Hadn't questioned it. During the crisis, when he confronted her with my evidence, Danielle tried to claim we'd work together, that she'd

I think I'm making a mistake marrying you. I nodded, walked to my laptop, and canceled every single wedding vendor while she watched. Then I said, perfect timing. Now you won't have to worry about making a mistake anymore. What are you doing? She panicked. Exactly what you wanted, I replied, clicking through vendor after vendor. The catering? Canceled. The venue? Gone. The photographer? Done. She started crying. Steven, wait. I just meant I was having doubts. About marrying me? While texting your ex for six weeks? I interrupted pulling up her phone records I'd seen on our shared account that morning. Sean, right? Her face went white. You thought I didn't know? I've watched you smile at your phone every night for six weeks. I saw his name pop up during dinner last Tuesday, then Wednesday, then every single day since. I kept clicking. Florist? Canceled. DJ? Canceled. Rental company? Canceled. The flowers you picked out together? Gone. The playlist you spent and hours making with our songs? Delete it. The three tier cake with your precious initials carved in fondant? Someone else's problem now. Steven, please, can we just talk about this? We are talking. I'm talking about how you've been planning our wedding while secretly planning your exit strategy. I pulled up her text thread that I'd screenshotted weeks ago. Want me to read some highlights? I miss what we had, Sean. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if we tried harder. Steven's a good guy, but he's not you. She buried her face in her hands. You went through my phone? Our shared phone plan. Kimberly. Every message shows up on the account summary. Basic technology. I turned the laptop screen toward her. $8,000 in deposits, completely gone. But that's still cheaper than hiring a divorce lawyer in two years. I never meant for this to happen. It just started as innocent, friendly conversation. Innocent? I scrolled through more messages, reading them aloud. You told him you dream about him every night. You said marrying me felt like settling for safe. You literally asked if he'd fight for you if you called off the wedding. Her crying stopped abruptly. The room went dead violent. That's right, sweetheart. I read that one, too. You were hoping he'd dramatically show up and stop the ceremony, weren't you? Like some cheesy romantic comedy movie where the girl gets off her feet. I continued the cancellation spree methodically. The string quartet you insisted we needed canceled your entire extended family's hotel reservations, canceled the rehearsal dinner at that ridiculously expensive steakhouse you absolutely had to have gone forever. My whole family flew in from Portland, Steven. What am I supposed to tell them now? Tell them the truth. Tell them you chose Sean over me, because that's exactly what you did when you started this emotional affair. I closed the laptop with a satisfying snap. Tell Sean he can have you, but he's paying for his own damn wedding. She just sat there in stunned silence, slowly realizing her romantic backup plan was now her only remaining plan. You know what the really funny part is? I genuinely would have worked through normal doubts with you. I would have postponed the wedding if you just been honest about your feelings. But instead, you chose to have a full blown emotional affair. I grabbed my keys and

I've been the family disappointment for 23 years, while my perfect older brother, Kyle got everything handed to him. When Grandpa died and left me his house in his will, dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son anyway. Your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad. Every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore. Every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house. When I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn in garbage bags. You're trespassing! Dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all watching from their windows. Test day arrived at the family lawyer's office. The whole crew showed up like it was some kind of Celebration. Dad wore his best suit and kept checking his Rolex, probably already planning how to spend what he thought would be his inheritance money. Kyle brought his new girlfriend to show off. You're about to see how we handle fake family members, he told her loudly. Linda kept taking selfies, probably planning to post about their victory later. Uncle Robert and Aunt Deborah drove in from two states away just to witness my humiliation. The family group chat had been buzzing for days about this showdown. The DNA results came back after the longest hour of my life. 99.9% match. I was definitely Dad's biological son. Dad's victory dance and high fives with Kyle lasted exactly 10 seconds. However, the lawyer continued clearing his throat. There's something else the family needs to know about. Your grandfather actually left a second, more recent will that supersedes The first one, the room went dead silent. You could hear Linda's phone camera clicking. I pulled out my phone and played a video I'd recorded with Grandpa just weeks before he passed. His shaky but determined voice filled the entire office. To my son Harold and his family, who abandoned me in my final years, who only called when they needed money.

I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I didn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger.

I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months.

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. Path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pan. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept pushing. To work at my house I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. I said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really I just didn't wanna trap him in a car with my smell. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space it took.

For 14 years, Debbie Salzman worked as a beloved lunch lady here at Denver Place Elementary School in Wilmington. She says she would upgrade the lunch of a child who didn't have enough money or give them extra food if they said they were still hungry. If they didn't have enough money on their account, they would get a cheese sandwich instead. Friend that got a free lunch that would come back and say, Miss Debbie, I'm still hungry.

I need to be practical about my future. After she pulled out a prenup that could leave me with nothing. Allison and I had been together three years, engaged for six months, with our wedding planned for four months away. I'm a software engineer making $120,000. She works in marketing making $75,000. We. We're supposed to close on our first house in two weeks. I was contributing thirty five thousand dollars of the fifty thousand dollar down payment. Last Sunday she invited me to dinner at her parents upscale home. Her mom had prepared an elaborate spread and her dad, Greg was being unusually friendly, asking about my work and laughing at my jokes. Normally he treated me politely, but distantly. I thought they were finally accepting me as family. Halfway through dinner, Allison suddenly got this serious, rehearsed look. Sean, I think we should sign a prenuptial agreement before the wedding, she said, pulling out a Manila folder and sliding it across the table. My stuff like dropped. This whole dinner had been a setup. Her parents were nodding along. The prenup demanded complete financial separation. Separate bank accounts, separate credit cards, separate everything. But the real estate clause was the worst part. The house we were buying together would be titled solely in Allison's name. If we divorced, I'd walk away with nothing. Regardless of contributions to mortgage payments or improvement. I'd be paying Allison to live in a house She owned. When I asked why she suddenly wanted this, her mom jumped in. It's just smart financial planning, Sean. Surely someone in your field understands protecting assets. Her dad added, nothing personal, just business. This is how people like us protect what we've built. But when we started house shopping, Allison put for both our names on everything, saying it would show we were truly committed as partners. Now suddenly, she wanted legal separation of everything. I said I needed time to review it with a lawyer. The silence was deafening. A lawyer? Allison's voice pitched higher. I thought you'd be more mature about this. Monday morning, my lawyer, James, reviewed the document. His reaction was immediate. Sean, this is one of the most one sided documents I've ever seen. Don't sign this. He explained I'd pay half the mortgage, taxes, and maintenance on an asset entirely hers if we divorced. This reads like someone already planning for divorce while expecting you to subsidize her life until that happens. So I made two decision. I wouldn't sign the prenup, and I was withdrawing from the house purchase. I called our realtor and removed my name. Since Allison couldn't qualify for the mortgage alone without my contribution, this killed the deal. I also moved my $50,000 from our joint savings back to my personal account. When Allison discovered this, she called screaming, accusing me of sabotaging our relationship. Her family launched desperate attempts to pressure me. Her mother showed up, At my workplace, crying, her father offered to personally guarantee I

I replied, he changed mine, too. She didn't know he was my divorce lawyer. Celine had been acting weird for months. It started small. Suddenly caring about her appearance again, buying new clothes she couldn't afford on her teacher's salary. Then came the secret phone calls, where she'd step outside or lock herself in the bathroom. When I'd ask who called, she get defensive and say it was just her sister. The mysterious meetings were next. Working late at school again, she text. But when I drove by the parking lot at eight PM, her car wasn't there. She'd come home smelling like expensive Cologne and wine, claiming she'd grab dinner with colleagues. I'm not stupid. I knew something was happening. But after eight years together, I figured I owed it to us to try counseling first. That's when I started secretly meeting with Elias Thorn, the best divorce attorney in town. We've been planning my exit strategy for three months. Protecting my business, our joint accounts, the house I bought before we got to together. When she asked to talk last Friday, sitting at our kitchen table with this nervous energy, I knew what was coming. I'm leaving you, she said. And for the first time in months, she looked genuinely happy. I met someone incredible. A successful lawyer who actually understands me. She went on and on about how amazing he was, how intelligent, how sophisticated, how different. From me. He's handling this huge divorce case right now, making tons of money. He took me to that new French place downtown last week. You know, the one with the $200 steaks you said was too expensive. I just sat there, letting her paint this picture of her new life. She was practically glowing as she described their relationship. How he understood her need for finer things, how he made her feel valued and desired. He's taking me to Napa this weekend, she continued, her eyes bright with excitement. Says he's going to change my life forever. We're staying at some resort that costs more per night than you make in a week. The dig was unnecessary, but typical Celine. She'd always resented that I ran a small construction business instead of wearing suits and working in an office. I kept my voice calm and asked, that's nice. What's his name? Elias Thorn. She seemed like she was announcing she'd won the lottery. He's brilliant. Drives an Audi RS six, has this gorgeous office downtown. Everything I've always wanted. My stomach dropped, but I kept my face completely neutral. Elias Thorn wasn't just any lawyer. He was my divorce attorney. The one I've been secretly meeting with every Thursday for three months. The one who knew every detail about our finances, our relationship problems, our joint asset. Sounds great. I managed. When are you leaving? Tonight. He's picking me up at 7. I already packed a bag. She gestured. Toward her suitcase by the door, like she couldn't wait to escape. After she went upstairs to shower and get ready, I sat in my truck and called Elias. Straight to voicemail. I texted, emergency. Need to talk before Monday. Two hours later, while Celine was doing her makeup, he called back.

Seventeen students went to the hospital on picture day. And it wasn't because of a shooting. It was because my principal decided water bottles were more dangerous than dehydration. I was filling my Hydro Flask from the one working vending machine when Principal Morrison yanked it from my hands. New policy. No water bottles on campus. Zero tolerance. She dumped it out. But we don't have fountains, I said. Then buy milk at lunch. She replied, we just moved into a brand new building with beautiful glass windows and smartboards everywhere. There was just one massive problem. Contractors had built walls over where the water fountains were supposed to go. Completely broke them in the district. Solution? One vending machine selling water at $2 each for 2,000 students. Our school sat across from a grocery store, and some freshmen began buying cases of water to sell bottles for a dollar, undercutting the school. Then they stepped up their game. They started stealing mini vodka bottles, transferring them to water bottles, and taking orders via Snapchat. Ten bucks a bottle. They had code names, distribution network, and kids posted in different hallways. Attendance hit record highs because kids who hadn't shown up since middle school were suddenly never missing a day. By October, sophomores stumbled through calculus while freshmen puked in planters. Half the sophomore class was buzzed by noon. The administration held an emergency meeting, and Morrison announced her Solution we banned water bottles. Problem solved. Monday morning, security confiscated everything at the door. Hydroflasks, nalgenes, even prescription eye drops because they were clear liquid in a container. They covered bathroom sinks with not for drinking signs, and the vending machine disappeared overnight. But here's what they didn't realize. By Tuesday, the nurse ran out of paper cups. 40 kids an hour coming in dizzy. She told anyone who'd listen, but nobody listened. Wednesday, three kids fainted during PE when Coach Martinez gave them water from his bottle. Morrison suspended him for enabling violations. And things got worse. Week 2 brought desperate creativity. Smore sold water in Ziploc bags for $5 a sip. Someone brought a fish bowl for biology that mysteriously emptied by lunch. A kid got expelled for running a Capri Sun cartel. The football team started drinking pickle juice, while the chess club bought unlimited chocolate milk. The cafeteria ran out of everything liquid except ranch dressing. Which one desperate kid actually tried drinking? Week three escalated beyond anyone's imagination. The nurse sent seven kids home in one day, including the diabetic who couldn't take insulin without water and the girl who passed out during Sats. The track team refused to practice. Morrison threatened suspension. They just laughed. The PTA meeting that usually had 12 moms suddenly had 400 angry parents. Morrison tried explaining about the vodka problem, then catch the kids with vodka. Someone's dad screamed, you don't ban water! She insisted it was simplest. And that's when someone's grandma stood up. You're dumber than rocks in my garden. By month two, we'd made the news. School bans, H2O spread everywhere. While the superintendent's email crashed from complaints. The health department launched investigations. Horizon kept defending herself to reporters. Hundred percent decrease in alcohol incidents. A reporter shot back. 500% increase in medical emergencies. Then came picture day, the hottest day of the school year. 102 degrees outside. About 120 in the gym with no AC. Three hours under photography lights and no water allowed. First hour, two freshmen collapsed. The photographer kept shooting, paid by photo, not ambulance. Second hour brought chaos. A senior vomited on camera equipment while a junior had a seizure. Parents rushed in with water bottles, throwing them to kids like life preservers. When security tried stopping them, a mom knocked a guard flat. Touch me again while my daughter's lips are blue. The fire department arrived to treat.

The landlord said I had the patience of a saint. After my third roommate complaint in two years, months of different slobs leaving their Mark, I impatient. The first roommate left pizza boxes until roaches appeared. One before him ate my food constantly, and another left used rubbers on the bathroom floor. Then this spoiled man child moved in and pushed me too far on a Thursday night, handing me the exact words I'd used to destroy him. I came home from my 12 hour shift to find maggots crawling out of his dish collection that had evolved into its own ecosystem. Not just dirty dishes, a biological hazard that would make health inspectors weep. The smell hit me like a physical wall. Six months of passive aggressive notes, six months of doing his dishes, six months of being the responsible adult had officially ended. Around 11 p m, I knocked on his door to have one final reasonable conversation. He opened it wearing nothing but boxers and a stained gaming headset around his neck. Energy drink cans creating a fortress around his computer. No acknowledgement of the kitchen situation, just annoyed I'd interrupted his raid. I calmly asked how we should handle splitting household responsibilities. Fairly. Bro laughed and said he didn't have time for drama when I pointed out the Literal maggots. He shrugged and said the five words that became his curse. Just figure it out yourself. Those words activated something primal in me. Six months of tolerance, six months of adulting. For 2 6 months of keeping the peace. But telling me to figure out his mess myself. I smiled, said okay, and walked away. Through his open door, I heard him laughing with his gaming buddies about his annoying roommate. Perfect. I was ready. I started that night by changing the Wi-Fi password, then removed every single item I purchased from common areas. Toilet paper, hand soap, dish soap, paper towels, even the light bulbs I bought. By morning, I transformed our apartment into a survival puzzle. The beautiful part? Everything was still technically there, just inaccessible. Router locked in my room. Circuit breaker key hidden. Thermostat reprogrammed with a password. Even the TV remote went to work with me in my backpack. Friday morning, I heard him stumbling around the dark bathroom. He knocked on my door, asking about the toy, the paper. I called through the door, figure it out yourself. The silence was delicious. He tried to shower. No hot water because I'd adjusted the water heater before work. Texted me about the Wi-Fi password. I responded with his favorite phrase. He had a girl coming over that night. I listened to him trying to explain why they had to use phone flashlights and why he couldn't stream Netflix. She left after 20 minutes. By Sunday, desperation set in. He tried everything, called the landlord, who said roommate

So I showed him what family honor meant. The first time I brought Justin to meet my grandfather, he served everyone tea, but handed Justin water in a paper cup. He said something in Mandarin to my uncle while smiling at Justin, and I told Justin he was welcoming him. But I caught the phrase, why Guoren, foreigner? The disdain in his tone made my chest tighten. That night, I told Justin we needed to prove grandfather wrong about him. We've been engaged six months. I knew exactly what would change Grandfather's mind. Three months later, grandfather was getting bolder. At my cousin's wedding, he pulled me aside and said in Mandarin that I was throwing away 5,000 years of heritage for someone who ate cereal for dinner. He actually brought his friend's grandson to meet me, a surgeon from Beijing. The guy was nice enough, but grandfather kept mentioning his medical degree while Justin stood there holding my hand, completely unaware of what was being said. Two weeks later, grandfather announced he would test Justin's worthiness at his upcoming 85th birthday. He said in Mandarin, knowing Justin couldn't understand, that when Justin failed to show proper respect, everyone would see I'd chosen poorly. That's when I knew we had our chance. I explained everything to Justin that night. What grandfather had been saying, what the test meant, and what we needed to do. Justin Was hurt but determined. Teach me, he said. I'll prove I can honor your family's traditions. We started practicing. Every weekend. I taught Justin the formal tea ceremony Grandfather's own father had performed, one most modern families had forgotten. Justin's hands would shake trying to hold the cups properly. He'd mess up the order of serving, forget to use both hands, pour too much or too little. We watched videos of traditional ceremonies until our eyes burned. I corrected his movements hundreds of times. After two months, he could get through the basic motions, but it looked foreign. Then came the dinner that almost ended everything. Grandfather made Justin sit at the far end of the table, saying the seats near him were for a true family. He announced in English so Justin would understand that respect for elders couldn't be Learned. You were either raised with it or you weren't. Justin's face went red, but he stayed quiet. That night, he practiced until 3:00am, determined to perfect every gesture. His fingers were cramping from holding the traditional positions. I found him in the kitchen the next morning, still practicing. Breakthrough came slowly. Four months into training, Justin could perform the movements, but they looked rehearsed, mechanical. Grandfather visited unexpectedly and caught Justin practicing the tea service in our kitchen. Pathetic mimicry, he said in English, then left without another word. Justin wanted to quit. I found him later, staring at the tea set, defeated. He's right. I'm just copying Movements. I don't understand. We spent the next week not just practicing, but discussing why each gesture mattered. The philosophy behind the hierarchy, the meaning in the movements. Two months before the birthday, something finally clicked for Justin. The ceremony stopped being a performance and became genuine, express. He understood that serving elders first wasn't just protocol. It was acknowledging their sacrifices, their wisdom, their role as family foundation. He Learned grandfather's father's birthday blessing. Practice the proper pronunciation until his throat was raw. More importantly, he understood what the words meant, why they mattered. The movements became natural, flowing. Even I was surprised watching him practice. He looked like he'd been doing this his whole life. Three days before grandfather's birthday, Justin was

My mom made $8 an hour and my dad made nine. There was no way. My junior year, my counselor, Missus Douglas, pulled me aside. She had this serious look on her face that made my stomach drop. Lena, you made it to the finals for the state academic scholarship. She said. There are only three students left. I couldn't breathe. This was it. Full ride to any college in the state. I went home and told my parents and my mom actually cried. She hugged me so tight I thought my ribs would crack. We knew you could do it, baby, she whispered. I spent three weeks working on that final essay. Stayed up three nights straight, revised it 10 times, had my English teacher look at it twice. I wrote about growing up, watching my parents come home exhausted every single day, about studying by flashlight when the power got cut off, about wanting to be the first person in my family to graduate college. Two weeks after I submitted it, Mrs. Douglas called me into her office again. This time she looked sad. Lena, I'm sorry. The committee Chose someone else. I didn't cry. I just nodded and said okay. But inside, I felt like someone had punched me in the chest. I walked out of her office, sat behind the school cafeteria by myself and stared at the parking lot. All those cars belong to kids whose parents could just write checks for college. That night, I told my parents. My mom hugged me again and said, there will be other chances, sweetheart. But I could see it in her eyes. She knew this was probably my only real shot. The thing is, missus Douglas had lied to me because I had won. I'd actually won the whole thing. But she knew something I didn't know about the run.

My boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me. Or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around, and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks, and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. I'm starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't wanna seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes, and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door, and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said. I took a deep breath. So, um. I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed, like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team? I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. Brought donuts every Friday and covered For people when they were sick. What do you mean, core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at five sharp, and I sat there alone, pretending to work, while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie, who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram story, like, right now. I open Instagram, and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see

Turns out he was actually allergic. He didn't come to school for three days and I was terrified. To this date, no one knows that I did it. Two. When I was in elementary school, I once lost something, so I asked to go to the lost and found. In the lost and found room, which was a big storage closet. They also stored the soda for the vending machines. I took one. Then probably three to four times a week, I'd remember I lost something else and go steal another soda. I don't know how long I did this for, but I got a lot of free soda. 3 probably 15 years ago, my sister had a gerbil, and one day I decided to bring it out of her cage and surprise her in the living room with it. Somehow I slipped on carpet and the gerbil went flying head first into the wall. It basically sounded like I threw a golf ball at the wall and the gerbil wasn't moving. Naturally, I put it back in its cage and removed myself from the vicinity. To my amazement, the damn thing was still alive and moving around a few minutes later. And lived another two years without anyone ever knowing that I basically kobyed it into the wall at full speed. 4 I didn't know My best friend's name for almost 10 years. She goes by Katie almost exclusively and got it in my head early on that it was short for Caitlin. Imagine my surprise when I heard her being referred to as Catherine at our convocation. No right way to bring that one up in a conversation. 5. I really don't like slash care for anyone in my family. 6. One Christmas I was nine years old and knew that Santa wasn't real, but for my seven year old brother, the fantasy was very much alive and good. We shared a room and my brother woke up on Christmas morning and looked confused that Santa had not eaten the Kit Kat that had been left out. He went quiet and I could see that he was working the facts through in his head. When he wasn't looking. I ate the Kit Kat and showed him the wrapper and claimed he imagined seeing the wrapper unopened. This was 26 years ago and I have not told him in case he works out Santa is not real.

Just warning you, she said, gripping the steering wheel. They can be protective, and they speak Japanese at home, so don't take it personally if they seem cold. I nodded, my stomach in knots. But she didn't know. Japanese was my first language. Half Japanese through my mom. But I inherited every single one of my Irish dad's genes. Pale skin, light eyes, the works.

Yuki's mom greeted me with a polite bow and formal smile. Nice to meet you, she said in careful English. The pleasure is mine, Tanaka San. That's when I caught it. The second I turned to her dad, I heard Keiko whisper to Yuki's aunt, Cono Gaigin. When I gaiko to when I desuyo. This foreigner won't last long. Game on! For the next hour, I smiled politely while they served me passive aggression. English to my face, Japanese when they thought I couldn't understand. And they were brutal.

No manners! Tommy enjoying the food? Yuki's cousin asked, sweet! Then whispered, he probably doesn't know what he's eating. The aunt added, he's probably making fun of Japanese culture. Every comment was a small cut, but I kept my mouth shut. Yuki tried including me, switching languages, looking frustrated as conversations kept drifting to rapid Japanese that shut me out. Then her dad talked to Yuki's brother like I was invisible. He said, this is what happens when daughters go to universities. They bring home gaijin who will never understand us. Yuki WA hontoni bakada, the brother replied, Yuki is truly being stupid, dating someone who doesn't speak our language. How can there be real love without communication? My jaw clenched.

Nobody had spoken Aunt Minerva in 15 years. She was the crazy one who collected vintage dolls and claimed the government was monitoring her bird feeders. When cousin of Evangeline got the call that Minerva had died, we all pretended to be sad while secretly calculating what her Victorian mansion might be worth. The will reading was chaos, 23 relatives crammed into a stuffy law office, everyone wearing their most respectful black clothes while their eyes gleamed with greed. The lawyer adjusted his glasses and read, my fortune goes to whoever answers this. What room in my house contains the thing I loved most? Yet no one was ever allowed to enter. We ransacked that mansion like pirates. Dad jimmied locks. Mom crawled through the basement with a flashlight. Uncle Fletcher hired a locksmith for the third floor storage room that had been welded shut for decades. Everyone assumed it was some hidden safe or secret chamber filled with cash. I was 17 and bored, so I did what teenagers do. I snooped through her personal stuff in her bedroom dresser. I found a photo album labeled My Darling. Every page showed the same little girl, birthday parties, first mornings, first days of school. The child had Minerva's same sharp nose and wild curly hair. In the final photo, the girl was maybe six, sitting on Minerva's lap in This very mansion, at the bottom, someone had written Cordelia Marie, age 6, 1957. My blood went cold. I never heard of any Cordelia in our family. That night, I cornered my grandmother in the kitchen. Who was Cordelia, I asked. Grandma's face went white. She glanced around nervously, then pulled me aside. Minerva's daughter, she whispered, born when Minerva was 16. The family made her give the baby up for adoption to avoid scandal. What happened to her? Grandma's voice cracked. Leukemia. She died at 7. Minerva never forgave us. The next morning, I walked into that law office alone. The answer is her daughter's bedroom.

At first I tried to ignore it, figured maybe it was just the wind, but then I heard it again. Reluctantly, I rolled out of bed, stumbled down the hallway, and cracked open the door. Standing there, soaked to the bone in the pouring rain, was this totally hammered guy. Could barely keep his eyes open. Hey, man, he slurred, swaying slightly. You. You mind giving me a push? I stared at him like he had three heads. Are you kidding me? It's 3 o'clock in the morning. It's raining sideways. No chance, buddy. I slammed the door and shuffled back to bed, grumbling the whole way. My wife was awake now. She looked at me and asked, who is it? Just some drunk guy out there asking for a push. And did you help him? She asked. Already with that tone in her voice. No, I said, pulling the blanket back over me. I'm not about to go out in the rain to help some random drunk. She turned to face me fully. Wow, that's rich, coming from the guy who practically cried when our car broke down three months ago and those two men stopped to help us. You remember that? You went on and on about how nice they were. You even said you'd pay it forward. Now I was feeling guilty. She crossed her arms. I think you should Help him! And you should be ashamed of yourself. I sighed, got out of bed again, pulled on a coat, grabbed a flashlight, and headed back out into the pouring rain. I called out, hey, you still there? You still need a push? From the darkness I heard his voice. Yeah! Yes, please! Alright, I said, squinting around. Where are you exactly? And he yells back, over here on the swing!

I watched my mom slowly dying over Facetime for months because I couldn't make enough money to go see her. She wanted to pay for my plane ticket, but I knew she wouldn't be able to afford her treatment if she did. So I begged her not to. I promised I'd come see her soon and started constantly picking up shifts at the restaurant I worked at. But one night, her doctor phoned me telling me he wasn't sure if she had much longer. It started coughing up blood but didn't want me to know so I wouldn't worry. It was then that I realized I wouldn't be able to save enough to go see her in time. I stayed up crying that entire night but still had to go to work the next day. Halfway through my shift, I saw Leonardo DiCaprio come in with who I think was his mom. I could tell he didn't want to be bothered because he had a hat, sunglasses and unshaven. I still knew it was him and just pretended that I didn't realize who he was. This was right after Titanic, so I was completely freaking out inside. I didn't tell anyone and treated him like any other customer as best as I could. However, at the end of the meal, I couldn't resist. Before I brought him the check, I wrote, your movies are awesome, I hope. You like the food on his receipt. When he got up to leave, I could see him looking around and smiled when he saw me. I thought this was the coolest thing ever. And when I went to go clean their table, I saw he wrote back, thank you so much for not blowing my cover and left a 500 dollar tip. At the time, this was so much money, I thought it was an accident. I was about to go run outside to give it back, but he was already gone. I remember feeling like I literally couldn't breathe and just tried to act normal. As soon as my shift ended that day, I booked the next flight out to see my mom. I phoned to tell her I was coming and I literally ran through the hospital to her room. I got there in time to spend her last 20 minutes with her. Because of him, I got to hug my mom one last time as she passed.

My sister announces she has stage 3 lymphoma at family dinner and mom immediately starts crying while dad opens his wallet. Everyone's posting prayers on Facebook. Within minutes, I asked to see medical paperwork and get screamed at for being jealous. Jealous cancer. She launches this 50,000 dollar gofundme for experimental treatment insurance won't cover. And money starts pouring in from strangers, 500 here, thousand there. She's posting daily in grey hoodies with sad selfies and inspirational quotes about fighting. So I noticed she's eating sushi at lunch. Raw fish. You can't eat that on chemo. It'll literally kill you with your immune system gone. I point this out and my family calls me heartless. My, my sister makes this crying TikTok. Even my own sister doesn't support me. I get death threats in my DMS, actual death threats. My cousin texts, you're disgusting. She's dying and you're jealous. Then my sister posts this, quote, you know what hurts more than cancer? Having a sister who wants me dead. My stomach drops. She's turned everyone against me for asking one question, one question about paperwork. My mom won't even look at me at Sunday dinner. My dad says I should apologize for causing stress during her treatment. Treatment, right? Anyway, I start taking screenshots of everything. Tuesday, she posts at chemo all day, but she's tagged at a wine tasting two hours away. That same afternoon. I Screenshot both with time stamps. Then I find her Amazon account still logged in on the family computer. Order history shows real plastic bald cap. Forty seven dollars and ninety nine cents delivered last month. I screenshot the receipt. My hands are shaking. No one will believe me. They'll say I photoshopped it. But I keep going. I check the hospital visitor parking website, the one that validates tickets and it says her license plate never appears in the entire 3 months of her supposed treatment. I call the hospital building department and record the entire call. Legal in my state. They said they had no patient under her name. The woman on the phone sounds confused when I ask again. Meanwhile, my sister posts about chemo brain making her forget things. But that same night she wins a game of trivia at the local bar. She receives a 20 five dollar gift card to Red Lobster. I'm starting to feel crazy. Maybe I'm wrong. But then I see her doing perfect cartwheels in the backyard in the morning. She's training for a 5K. How? However, she'll bring up cancer fatigue anytime the family needs something done. Then her go fund me hits $38,000. I find her Venmo and see she's literally buying designer bags, not medicine. Every purchase was dated after her diagnosis. So I create a folder on my phone, 147 pieces of evidence. Each screenshot feels like an extra layer of armour in my fight to reveal The truth, I became a detective not because I wanted to, because nobody else would. However, my sister announces she's getting a bravery award at my aunt's charity gala. I tried to tell her this gala is for real pediatric cancer patients, kids who are actually dying. She scoffed at me and said she was a real patient, that she deserved this award for everything she had been going through. That's when I decided this ends tomorrow. On gala night, there are 200 guests, including real cancer survivors and sick children. My sister's on the stage in a silk head wrap giving a speech. Cancer taught me that angels walk among us. I noticed the bald cap edge peeking out. When she goes in to hug the mayor, he hands her the award plaque and she starts fake crying, dabbing carefully under her eyes. I walk on stage with my phone. Before we celebrate, can everyone look at the screen? I connect to the projector prearranged with the AV tech up top who lost his mom to actual cancer. The Amazon bald cap receipt appears. My sister's name and address on the big screen for all to see. Gasps. And there's the wine tasting screenshots, her Venmo purchases with gofundme money. Someone drops a champagne glass. My sister's frozen, stammering. This is, you don't understand. I walk up to her. Let's show them what's really under there. I pull off the head wrap, then peel the bald cap off. Perfect. Blonde hair tumbles down. A child in the front row starts crying. Her mother stands up. You stole from dying children. My aunt grabs the microphone. Security escort her out. My sister runs with the cap still dangling from her hand. Turns out the only thing terminal was her credibility.

So in my junior year, I had this horrible cavity that was killing me, but I couldn't get to the dentist for another week. The pain was unbearable. So I started carrying this little bottle of clove oil my mom gave me. If you've never used it, clove oil numbs your gums when you have tooth pain. Anyway, I'm sitting in English class, and this wave of pain hits me. So I pull out my little dropper bottle and put some on my finger, then rub it on my gum. My friend Marcos leans over and whispers, dude, are you taking drugs in class? I explain it's just clove oil for my tooth, and he asks, try it. Because his wisdom teeth were coming in, I let him have a drop, and within minutes, he's like, whoa, this stuff is amazing. By lunch, Marcos had told, like, five people about my magic potion, and they all wanted to try it. The next day, three different people showed up with their own little dropper bottles. One girl had peppermint oil, claiming it helped her focus. Another guy brought lavender oil, saying it calmed his test anxiety. By Wednesday, our chemistry teacher, Missus Patterson, noticed half the class pulling out tiny bottles before the quiz. She stopped the class and asked what was going on. When we explained, instead of shutting it down, she got excited and started talking about aromatherapy and Essential oils Thursday morning the morning announcements included a warning not to share oils because of potential allergies. This obviously made everyone want them more. Friday the hallways smelled like a weird combination of eucalyptus tea tree and something called Thieves Blend that apparently fights germs. The following Monday, some senior girls started wearing those little glass vial necklaces filled with different colored oils. By Wednesday, those necklaces were everywhere. The drama kids started wearing multiple vials color coded to their emotional needs for the day. Red for energy, blue for calm, purple for creativity. The football team got in on it, claiming peppermint oil improved their reaction time. They started rubbing it on their temples before practice. Our principal finally had to call an assembly about proper essential oil etiquette, which is possibly the weirdest assembly topic in school history. Actually made rules like no applying oils during class and no diffusers in lockers because someone had rigged one up with a small fan. The yearbook committee created a two page spread called the year of Essential Enlightenment with photos of students and their favorite oils. They interviewed me as the trend originator and I tried explaining I just had a toothache, but that part never made the final edit. The school nurse eventually started a scent free zone in her office for kids with allergies or sensitivities. The funniest part was parents started complaining about having to buy these expensive oils because their kids insist did they needed Them. The local health food store actually created a student starter kit with five tiny bottles for $25. My dentist finally fixed my cavity, but I kept carrying my clove oil as a weird good luck charm. Even teachers got into it. Our math teacher claimed lemon oil helped her grade papers faster, all because I had a toothache and couldn't get to the dentist. Sometimes the dumbest trends start from the most random necessity. Four years later and my younger sister says kids still bring oils to school, though now they claim it's for focus and emotional support, rather than admitting they're just following a trend that started because of my bad dental hygiene.

A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning.

She and even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took the One thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station just to afford my rent and groceries. I continued my voice, getting stronger, eating ramen Noodles for dinner. While watching them feast like royalty, I thought maybe you'd forgotten about my graduation. Or maybe you were disappointed in me. But this whole time, they were living off money meant for me. Grandma scrolled through the photos, her face getting redder with each. This hotel cost $800 a night. I know because I stayed there last year. And this restaurant, their appetizers start at $50. My dad tried to interrupt, loosening his collar nervously. Mom, if you'd just let us explain the situation. Explain what, Nelson? How you forged my grandson's signature on bank documents? How you intercepted mail addressed specifically to him? How you've been lying to my face for months while spending his money? She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope with legal documents. I brought copies of everything. Bank transfer with Diego's name, the hotel reservations in his name, the flight confirmations, the detailed itinerary. I spent weeks planning for his graduation gift. My mom started crying. But not the sorry kind of crying. The angry, caught kind, where she knew her game was over. You always liked him more than Estonia anyway, ever since they were kids. Because he works for everything he has. Grandma slammed the envelope on the table, making the wine glasses shake. While you've raised a spoiled princess who thinks the world owes her everything just for existing. Estonia finally spoke, her voice shaky and small. I didn't know it was Diego's money. I Swear! I thought it was just family money. Bullshit, I said, surprising myself with how calm and controlled I sounded. You knew exactly what you were doing when you posted those photos and tagged them. Living my best life while I was pulling double shifts and sleeping four hours a night. Other diners were definitely staring now, but I didn't care anymore. Years of being invisible in my own family was finally coming to an end. Grandma opened her purse and pulled out her phone with steady hands. I'm calling my lawyer tomorrow morning. Every penny gets repaid within 30 days, or I'm pressing charges for theft and fraud. My parents started begging, their voices overlapping and desperate. Please. But he was already walking away toward the exit. As she hugged me goodbye in the parking lot, she whispered, pack your bags. Tonight you're coming to live with me and finishing that master's degree you wanted. I'm also buying you that Europe trip again. And this time, you're actually going. The next morning, they found out grandma had already frozen their access to all her accounts. The repo man showed up for Dad's motorcycle by noon, and the bank called about their overdue credit card payments by evening.

This house is going up for sale. Everyone cheered and raised their glasses. I stepped outside and made one phone call. Ten minutes later, the screaming started. See, two years ago, when dad had his heart attack, I discovered something. They were three months behind on mortgage payment. The bank was for closing next week. My family had no idea. Dad was too proud to tell anyone. So I used my entire divorce settlement, $180,000, to buy the house at auction. I created an LLC called Clearwater Holdings and let them keep living there without telling them. I figured I'd transfer it back once they got stable again. Now my brother Marcus thinks he can just sell it and split the money. He's already called two realtors. The irony wasn't lost on me. For two years, I've been quietly paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Every time something broke, I'd anonymously arrange for repairs. The new roof last spring. That was me. The HVAC system that mysteriously got warranty coverage. Also me. Marcus had been living rent free in a house I owned, while constantly reminding everyone how successful he was compared to his loser sister. When I walked back inside, he was drawing renovation plans on napkins with his wife Jennifer. We could add a wine cellar, he was saying, gesturing wildly with his beer. And a home theater, Jennifer added, her eyes practically glowing with dollar signs. Mom was nodding enthusiastically. Oh, and we could finally get that kitchen island I've always wanted. Dad sat quietly in his chair, looking uncomfortable but not saying anything. He'd always hated confrontation. My teenage nephew, Tyler was on his phone, probably already shopping for the car Marcus had promised him from his inheritance share. Actually, I said calmly, walking back to the dining room table, I need to tell you something important. Marcus didn't even look up from his sketching. If you're gonna beg us to let you stay, save it, he laughed. Decisions made. Jenny already found us a realtor friend who can get us top dollar. Really? I said, sitting down across from him. That's interesting, because I just got off the phone with my attorney. Mom rolled her eyes dramatically. Alex, Honey, you can't afford an attorney. Stop being so dramatic about this. James Morrison from Morrison and Associates, I continued, ignoring her comment. He specializes in real estate law. Dad finally looked up with interest. Why were you talking to a real estate attorney, sweetheart? Because I wanted to understand what happens when someone tries to sell a house they don't legally own. The room went completely silent. Even Tyler looked up from his phone. Marcus's pen stopped moving. What are you talking about? Mom and dad own this house. They've lived here for 30 years. They lived here for 30 years, I corrected calmly. But they haven't owned it for the past 14 months. Dad's Face had gone completely pale. Alex, what are you saying? I pulled out my phone and opened the email James had sent me. According to the county property records, this house is owned by Clearwater Holdings, LLC. It was purchased at foreclosure auction 14 months ago for $165,000. Marcus stood up so fast, his chair nearly fell over. That's impossible. There's no way. The original owners, Robert and Margaret

So you remember, you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk in time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up, mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests? You know, for science. The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said, pulling out my phone. And according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica who's been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name. Same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born nine months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom? The one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you Attended alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland, born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell is this? Best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. So tell me again about not being part of this family. Because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda. 26 years of marriage, and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages. Make that four. Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently, there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang. Through the window, I could see a young woman with mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said, walking toward the door. I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah, Finally found her voice. You plan this whole thing? You gave me six months to prepare. After I took that DNA test, I shrug. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone! I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard, his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint. Jessica is a pediatric nurse, I announced cheerfully. She brought cookies.

I grew up an army brat. Moving every couple of years was just part of life. By the time I hit high school, I'd already attended more schools than I could count. But somehow I'd managed to stay in one place from eighth grade all the way to junior year. That was the longest stretch of stability I'd ever had. My senior year, though, I knew I'd be moving across the ocean. I was used to leaving friends behind, but honestly, I was looking forward to the change. At the time, I was in the high school band. For my first two years, we had this amazing director and a teacher who was supportive, encouraging, and tough when it mattered. Everyone loved her. But she left, and her replacement was the complete opposite. He was mean, short tempered, and ruled with an iron fist. Nobody liked him, but we all just tolerated it. One afternoon near the end of junior year, I had a dentist appointment. Totally routine, just fixing a cavity before my family's big move. The appointment happened to overlap with band class. I did the responsible thing. I told the director I'd be out. Checked out of school, went to the dentist, and that was that. Or so I thought. The next morning, my bandmate swarmed me. Hey, did you hear what Mister B said yesterday? I hadn't, so they filled me in. Apparently, while I was gone, he launched into a tirade about selfish students who weren't dedicated enough to prioritize. Band went on and on about how people who missed class for trivial things like a medical appointment were ruining the group. 80 kids sat there while he waved his arms and raised his voice, and every single one of them knew exactly who he was talking about. Me. Now, I wasn't a troublemaker. I had a 3.9 GPA. I yes, sir and no, ma'am to adults. I followed rules, but I also had a strong sense of justice. And this. This was unfair. So I marched right up to him and said, I hear you don't want people who schedule appointments during class. Effective immediately, I'm no longer in your band. I'll find another class to finish out the year. His face went beat red, veins bulged. He started shouting that he was the one in charge, that I couldn't leave his class without his permission. But this. It wasn't class time. I didn't have to stand there, so I just walked out. I went to one of my favorite teachers, Coach N, who also taught art history during that same period. I explained the situation, and without hesitation, he said I was welcome to join his class. All I needed was the principal's approval. So I went to the office, explained everything, and the principal said, we need a meeting with my parents and Mister B before making it Official fine by me. That afternoon, though, I was told I had to go back to band until the meeting happened. That's when the malicious compliance kicked in. If Mister B insisted I stay, I'd stay. But on my terms. I walked into band class, sat down in my front row seat. I was first chair oboe. Folded my hands in my lap. I didn't take out my instrument. I didn't touch my music. For 90 minutes, I just sat there silently staring at him. Day two, same thing. No instrument, no music. Just me silently refusing to play. He thought he could break me by threatening my grade. But I already made peace with it. When the meeting finally happened, Mister B tried to push the idea that I needed to stay. He even said smugly, if I don't let you out of my class, you'll fail the principal

Here's the brutal truth I Learned when we spotted my cousin Mike on the local news sleeping under a bridge. Our whole family rushed to help. My sister immediately offered him her spare room, thinking this would solve everything. We were wrong. For two weeks, Mike had everything, warm bed, hot meals, clean clothes. My sister even lined up three easy jobs where he'd start at $18 an hour, but he skipped every interview. I'm not built for that life, he'd say, spending all day sleeping and watching TV. We even offered to let him start by working just three days a week, thinking maybe full time was too much. He still refused. Working is for suckers, he told my sister while eating the dinner she cooked. The breaking point came when my sister caught him selling the new phone she bought him. I like my freedom, he said. A homeless charity put him in a fully furnished apartment next, paying six months rent up front. Within a week, he abandoned it all. Now we see him sometimes panhandling downtown. People will ask why we let him be homeless. Truth is, you can't force someone to want a normal life. We offered him everything, jobs, home, support, but he chose this. Some people would rather live with no responsibilities than work for a living. Last week, he waved at me from his usual spot. He's still there. Cardboard sign In hand, refusing every offer of real help. Sometimes the hardest truth is accepting that you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.

My mom had two rules that she drilled into me since I was 8 years old. Never mention dad to anyone. Never use our real last name. Your dad was a bad man, an evil man. If he finds you, he'll hurt us both, she'd tell me. It confused me because he always seemed friendly. But now, because of him, we were constantly on the run, moving to a new school every year, using a new name, wearing a new personality to match. When I was a bit older, mom explained in detail how dad was in prison for armed robbery, had a family with ties to the cartel, how mom testified against them and was now stuck in witness Protection. It destroyed my social life and made me really hate him. That is, until the real truth came out. I secretly made a fake Instagram account at the school library just to see what normal kids lives look like. While I was scrolling through photos of old friends and classmates, got a message from an account with no picture. Is your mom's name Angeline? My heart stopped. I almost deleted everything right there. But something made me respond. Who are you? I'm your dad. Prove it, I said confidently. When the stranger actually sent me evidence, I felt the entire room spin. According to Mom, Dad was in prison. But this person claiming to be Him managed to send photos I'd never seen before. Me as a baby in his arms. My birth certificate with a completely different last name. Private investigator reports showing he'd been searching for us for eight years. And not a single arrest record. I kept it a secret from mom. Came home acting normal, only to spend time at the library computers again the next day chatting with him. We started having weekly video calls, explaining things little by little. Your mom took you? The day I discovered she'd emptied my business accounts. Told me one afternoon $400,000 meant for employee payroll. She had a gambling problem I've been trying to help her with. When I found out about the theft and started calling the police, she picked you up from school and disappeared. Somehow I believed him. It made more sense than anything mom had been telling me for years. Why didn't you have her arrested? I asked. If I did, she said she'd take you down with her. And that scared me. Dad started tearing up on camera, but all I could think of was what now? One day after school, mom smiled and introduced me to a man with tattoos. This does the kid? He asked in a raspy voice. Yes. Say hi to your Uncle Tony. He's visiting all the way from Vegas. I stared at him, frozen. Something about the sharp suit, Cuban cigar and brass knuckles made my body too weak to say hello. Now go do your homework upstairs. Mom sent me away. I sat upstairs peeking at them from an angle on the stairs where they couldn't see me. I watched them set up cards, pour drinks, laughing. Angeline, I still can't believe you pulled off that 400,000 score from your husband. Tony said mom giggled. Easiest money I ever stole. He was too trusting. That was legendary. Cleaned out his whole construction business, then vanished with the kid. Brilliant. Well, I Learned from the best. Besides, I knew he couldn't do anything. Not if he wanted to.

My parents banned me from learning the local language because they said it would dilute my cultural purity. We moved here when I was 18 months old for dad's job, and 17 years later we were still here, living in an expat bubble where nobody had to interact with locals. My parents sent me to the International Academy, where everything was taught in our language by imported teachers who cost more than most locals made in five years. They genuinely believed learning the local language would erase my heritage and turn me into someone they couldn't recognize, pointing to other expat kids who'd gone native as cautionary tales. I lived in a country where I couldn't talk to 90% of the people. Every interaction outside our bubble required a translator or embarrassing hand gestures that made me look like an idiot tourist. I watched local kids my age hanging out in coffee shops and playing soccer in the park, but I couldn't join them because I literally couldn't communicate beyond pointing and smiling. My parents said this was good because local kids would be a bad influence, teaching me their backward ways and making me forget my superior education. They didn't understand that I had no connection to a homeland I couldn't even remember while being locked out of the only country I'd ever known. When I turned 14, I started secretly learning the language using a phone I bought with birthday Money and hid in my school locker. Every lunch break, I'd sit in the furthest bathroom stall with headphones, work, looking through language apps and watching local shows with subtitles. After two years, I was nearly fluent, but had to pretend I couldn't understand anything around my parents. The hardest part was stopping myself from reacting when people talked about us in public, assuming we couldn't understand their comments about rich foreigners who thought they were too good to integrate. Sometimes locals would say horrible things about my mom's clothes or my dad's attitude while we stood right there, and I had to keep my face complete, completely blank. My whole double life worked perfectly until that Saturday at the imported goods store my parents loved because all the staff spoke our language. We were shopping for Mom's birthday party when a man burst through the entrance waving something metallic that caught the fluorescent lights. He was shouting instructions that made everyone drop to the floor immediately except for us and two other foreign families who just stood there confused. A man's face was covered with a Bandana and his eyes were wild as he pointed his weapon at the cowering cashiers and kept yelling the same phrases over and over. My parents were complete frozen because they had no idea what was happening beyond the obvious threat. Dad actually started walking toward the exit, which made the man spin around and scream directly at him while jabbing the weapon. In his direction. Dad just kept walking because he didn't understand the man was telling him to get on the ground or he'd make an example out of him. And started counting down from five in the local language, his finger moving toward what was clearly a trigger. And my parents just stood there like confused tourists, waiting for someone to translate, get on the ground right now, because he's about to shoot dad! I screamed at my parents in our language while dropping to my knees. The shock on their faces wasn't from the death threat, but from hearing me translate perfectly. Mom's mouth fell open as I rapidly explained that the man wanted everyone's phones in a pile, women's jewelry in a bag, and nobody to look at his face.

You ever meet someone so arrogant that you just know they're gonna hurt themselves? Well, that's exactly what happened when I met this clueless woman at a dog park. I ended up watching her own dog bite her literal arm after she ignored my warnings. I've been a veterinarian for 12 years in Denver, Colorado. That morning, I taken my golden retriever, Max, to Cheeseman Park. The place was packed. Probably 40 dogs running around, kids on the playground nearby, and people doing yoga on the grass. Max was doing his usual thing. Sing every blade of grass like it held the secrets of the universe. That's when I noticed this Jack Russell terrier near the water fountain. Something was clearly off about him. The dog was stumbling slightly. Not the playful tumble of a happy dog, but that distinctive neurological wobble I'd seen too many times in my clinic. Then I saw the foam. Not just a normal dog drool, but thick white foam collecting at the corners of his mouth. The real tell was his eyes, dilated pupils, despite the bright morning sun and this vacant, unfocused stare. When another dog approached to play, the Jack Russell snapped at it. My stomach dropped. They were textbook rabies symptoms, and everyone at the park could potentially be in danger. The owner, this woman in designer workout clothes and pristine white sneakers, was simply scrolling through her phone, completely oblivious. I approached Her carefully keeping Max behind me. Excuse me, is that your Jack Russell? She looked up. Smile proudly. Yes, that's Winston. Isn't he precious? I kept my voice calm, professional. Ma'am, I'm a veterinarian and I'm concerned about your dog. He's showing symptoms that could indicate rabies. We need to get him contained and to an emergency vet immediately. Her face transformed instantly from proud mom to outraged defender. Excuse me, what did you say about my baby? Did you just call him dangerous? I tried again, pulling out my veterinary license from my wallet. Look, I'm a veterinarian. Your dog has neurological symptom, excessive salivation and aggression. When was his last rabies vaccination? She actually laughed. Oh, my god, you're one of those people. Winston is perfectly healthy. He's just excited to be at the park. The phone was getting worse, dripping onto the ground now. Ma'am, please, this is serious. Rabies is fatal. If she cut me off. Voice rising to a shriek that made everyone turn. Oh, please. You're just jealous because my dog is purebred and yours is just some mutt. I know your type. Bitter, judgmental women who can't stand seeing others happy. Now she was making a scene, waving her arms. This crazy woman is harassing me about my dog. She's probably not even a real vet. Other dog owners were starting to stare, some pulling their dogs closer. I showed my license to anyone who'd look. Please, someone help me convince her that Dog is sick. But he kept going louder now. Get away from us! You're ruining our morning. Winston is perfectly fine. Aren't you, baby? She bent down toward the dog, and I saw him tense up. That pre bite body language I knew too well. Don't touch him, I warned. She flip me off. Go away, you psycho! Find someone else to bother with your fake expertise. I walked away, but my years of experience wouldn't just let me leave. Instead, I sat on a bench about 30 feet away, where I could watch them while animal control on my cell. The dispatcher said they'd send someone, but it might take 20 minutes. I kept Max close, my eyes locked on Winston. The woman went back to her phone, occasionally baby talking to her dog, completely unaware he was now growling at shadows. I started recording on my phone, partly for evidence, partly because I knew what was coming. Other dogs instinctively gave Winston a wide birth. Animals know when something's wrong, even

Every August for like, six years, I host this huge end of summer party in my backyard. It's basically become the neighborhood event that everyone looks forward to. Kids run around screaming with popsicles, parents drink beer and complain about going back to school shopping. And by 9:00, the little ones are dragged inside to sleep while the adults keep the party going until, like, midnight. My house is literally right next to the backyard, so when my kids, Mia and Tyler, get tired, I just take them upstairs, tuck them in, and leave the bedroom window open so I can hear everything going on outside. They have my old iPhone, too, so if anything happens, they can just text me. It's worked perfectly for years. This year, I invited my boyfriend Kevin and his two kids, Emma and Jake. We've been together for six months, which felt like long enough to include them in my tradition. But when I explained how the night usually goes, Kevin's face got all weird. He said he wasn't comfortable with his kids sleeping at my place since they'd never stayed over before. Okay, fair enough. Then he said he didn't like the idea of putting them to bed while he stayed outside with me. didn't want to leave early with them while I stayed at my own party. Basically nothing about my setup worked for him. I told Him, I totally understood. And that they didn't have to come. Like, this isn't some random hangout I threw together last minute. This is an annual thing with a format that works for everyone who's been coming for years. If it doesn't work for you, then don't come. No big deal. But Kevin lost his mind, started saying that he and his kids weren't actually welcome because of how I set everything up, that I should have changed the whole party just for them, that any good girlfriend would leave her own party early to put his kids to bed and stay with them. The party happened without them. It was actually amazing. Missus Chen from next door brought her famous potato salad. The Henderson kids had a water balloon fight that soaked half the adults. And Around 10:30, when all the kids were asleep, we played music and talked until almost one in the morning. I didn't think about Kevin once until my phone started buzzing. He'd been texting me all night asking why I wasn't calling him. Said I should have made time during my own party to check in with him, that he felt left out and ignored. I saw the messages when I was cleaning up and just put my phone away. The next day, he came over and we had this massive fight. He kept saying I chose my neighbors over him and his kids, that I prioritized some stupid tradition over our relationship, that If I really cared about him, I would have either changed the party format or left early to spend time with them. I told him that was insane. This party happens one night a year. Everyone knows the deal. His kids would have had fun until bedtime and then they could have gone home or figured something else out. But changing a six year tradition for someone I've been dating for six months, making all my neighbours adapt to his comfort level, leaving my own party early? Not happening. He said I was selfish and not ready for a real relationship with someone who has kids, but I clearly wasn't thinking long term about us if I wasn't willing to make adjustments. I said maybe he was right, because someone who expected me to completely rearrange my life after six months probably wasn't someone I wanted to think long term about anyway. We broke up two days later. He sent me this long text about how I'd realize what I lost when I was alone at next year's party.

When I tell people my 12 year old daughter only speaks to five people in the entire world, they think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. After what her father did to her? Years of abuse that started when she was barely old enough to form memories. Trust became a foreign concept. She talks to me, her aunt, her grandparents, and her best friend. That's it. Touch her unexpectedly and she might have a panic attack. Ask her a direct question if you're not on that list, and she'll stare at the floor until you give up. Her Nintendo Switch is her lifeline. It's the only place where she feels completely safe, where she has control and where no one can hurt her. She takes it everywhere, clutching it like armor against a world that's already proven it can be cruel. I used to worry about the addiction until her therapist explained it. It's her safe space, her habit. I met Lucas eight months ago. I didn't tell him about Maddie for the first three months, not because I was hiding her, but because I needed to be sure. She'd only met two of my dates in the eight years since her father left, and both times ended in disasters that set her progress back months. The first one tried to high five her. She didn't speak for three days. This second brought her a teddy. Bear and tried to hug her. The panic attack lasted an hour. Lucas was different from the start. When I finally told him about Maddie, about the abuse, about the silence, about the switch that never left her hands, he didn't do what the others did. He didn't say, I'm great with kids or she'll warm up to me. He just said, I'll just follow your lead. We waited another two months before they met. I planned it carefully. A brief encounter at our apartment. No pressure, no expectations. Maddie knew he was coming. She sat on the couch with her switch headphones on, already retreating into her digital world. Lucas walked in, gave her a small wave. She didn't return, and then did something unexpected. He pulled out his own switch and sat in the chair across the room, not next to her, not trying to see her screen, just playing his own game. 20 minutes passed in silence. Then Maddie's head tilted slightly. I saw her glancing at his screen. Another 10 minutes go by and she paused her game. I held my breath. Is that Mario Kart? Her voice was so quiet, I almost missed it. Lucas looked up. Casual as anything. Yeah, the new one. Do you play? She nodded. I'm terrible at Rainbow Road, he said, then went back to playing. Five minutes later, I can beat Rainbow Road. No way. It's impossible. And just like that, my silent daughter was offended enough to speak. Again, it's not impossible. I have three stars on every cup. Lucas paused his game, looking genuinely impressed. Every cup? Even 200 C C? She actually sat up straighter. Especially 200 C C. Prove it. I watched stunned as Maddie scooted to the edge of the couch, not closer to him. She maintained that careful distance, but engaged. We could race online. They exchanged friend codes without ever leaving their separate spaces. For the next hour, they played Mario Kart together while sitting eight feet apart. Maddie didn't just play, she trash talked. You're about to eat my dust, she muttered after selecting her character when she won the first race. She actually smiled when Lucas Blue shelled her on the third lap.

For three years straight. Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired. Each week he had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some no one cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year I decided to test something two weeks before my birthday. I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about It being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right, yeah. I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something. Anything. Maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek, and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon, feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision. I spent my actual birthday doing something I'd never done before. I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said, the this would be perfect for my birthday, I just said, cool and kept folding laundry. When he Asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, really expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe! Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table, looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday? He said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I been A complete idiot. Yeah, I said. You have been. The next morning, I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favorite breakfast and had a jewelry box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

For 3 years straight, Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th, like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired each week. He had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some someone cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year, I decided to test something. Two weeks before my birthday, I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said, while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before, I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about it. Being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right? Yeah, I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something, anything, maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed, nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision. I spent my actual birthday doing something I'd never done before. I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said the this would be perfect for my birthday, I just said cool and kept folding laundry when he asked What restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner? I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said, that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, really expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up for my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh, yeah, happy birthday, babe. Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions, confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it. You're not taking the day off. We don't have dinner plans. I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday, he said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I been a Complete idiot. Yeah, I said, you have been. The next morning, I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favorite breakfast and had a jewelry box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

Because she deserves comfort. I was at work when I got the call. Pack your stuff, my mom said without even saying hello. Emma's moving into your apartment this weekend. I literally had to sit down. my 22 year old sister who's never held a job longer than three weeks. It's apparently more deserving of the one bedroom apartment I've been renting for two years. What are you talking about? I asked, but mom was already in full explanation mode. She broke up with her boyfriend and needs somewhere to live. You make good money, you can afford something bigger. Emma needs the comfort right now. The comfort of my apartment that I paid one thousand and two hundred dollars a month for. I drove straight to my parents'house. Emma was already there, surrounded by boxes growing through apartment listings on her phone. Expensive ones. Oh, good, you're here. Dad said like I'd come to help move. Emma found some nice places downtown. Two bedrooms, pools, the works. With what money? I asked. Emma finally looked up. Well, since you're moving out anyway, I figured you could co sign. You know, help family. They wanted me to give up my apartment and co sign for her upgrade. Absolutely not, I said. That's when mom pulled out the trip. After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us? Emma's going through such a hard time with the breakup. What about when I was going through a hard time? I asked. When I was working three jobs just to make rent. That's different, dad said dismissively. You're stronger. Emma's more sensitive. Sensitive, right. Is that what we're calling someone who quits jobs because the manager looked at her wrong? Look, we already called your landlord, mom said casually. My blood went cold. You what? Just to let him know about the transition, Emma will take over the lease. Mike seemed very understanding. They had called my landlord about my apartment without asking me. Emma's already picked out new furniture, mom continued. She showed me her Pinterest board. A white leather couch, one of those big sectionals. Emma beamed. Jake loves modern decor. He's gonna help me set everything up. Jake who you've been dating for two weeks? I asked. Three weeks, she corrected indignantly. And he's different. He has his own business. What business? She waved her hand vaguely. Like consulting or something. The point is, he's mature. Not like your ex who couldn't even afford to take you anywhere nice. My ex who worked construction and saved every penny? The one my parents constantly criticized for not being ambitious enough? Besides, dad added, Emma's got potential. She just needs the right environment to flourish. Your apartment has good energy. Good energy? The apartment I'd scrubbed on hands and knees when I moved in. The one I'd furnish, piece By piece from thrift stores. She's already planning a housewarming party, mom continued excitedly. Emma's finally ready to be social again. Emma nodded enthusiastically. I'm thinking next Saturday. I already invited some people. Jake's bringing his friends. With what money? I repeated, but they all ignored me. Oh, and Emma's going to need your security deposit back from Mike, Dad added. Matter of fact, for the new furniture. I stared at them. They wanted my apartment, my landlord relationship, and my security deposit. This is insane, I said quietly. What's insane, Emma snapped, is how selfish you're being. I'm going through a major life change, and you're acting like I'm asking for a kidney.

While my sister's daughters were laughing. I adopted Sophia when she was two years old. From the first moment I saw her, those big eyes, shy laugh, I knew she'd be my world. It doesn't matter that she doesn't carry my blood. To me, she's my daughter in every sense. But my parents never accepted her. When I told them about the adoption, my mother's face twisted with disgust. Why don't you find a woman and have your own children? My father was more direct. She's not our blood, Esteban. It's not the same. Despite their rejection, I maintained a relationship because as I believed, family should be united. When they lost their jobs, I agreed to pay their mortgage a considerable sum every month. Meanwhile, my sister Clara's daughters deliria and Camilla were treated like Queens at my parents house, while Sophia was barely included in games. One day I decided Sophia should spend time with her cousins while I had an important work meeting. Don't worry, my mother said with a fake smile. She'll be fine here. I left Sophia with her pink back pack, huge smile on her face. I'm going to play with my cousins, daddy. The meeting dragged longer than expected. When I returned that evening, something felt wrong. The front door was a jar and I could hear harsh voices. My Mother was yelling. Wash those dishes well, you useless girl! Look, there's still dirty! I entered silently, and what I saw shattered my heart. Sophia was standing on a wooden box in the kitchen, hands deep in soapy water. Her tiny arms could barely reach the dishes, her face red, with tears streaming down her cheeks. She was sobbing, trying to clean a large plate she could barely hold. Meanwhile, Clara's daughters were mocking Sophia while playing with toys. My parents had forced my little girl to do chores like a servant. What's going on here? I shouted, storming into the kitchen. Sophia looked up and ran into my arms, hands wet and trembling. Daddy, I'm sorry. I don't know how to wash dishes well, she sobbed against my chest. I felt Siri I'd never experienced before. Why is Sophia washing dishes while Valeria and Camilla make fun of her? My mother approached dismissively. We're just teaching her to be useful. Don't be so dramatic. She's a six year old girl. She should be playing with her cousins, not scrubbing dishes she can't even reach. While you call her useless, my father spoke up. Clara's girls don't have to do that because there are real granddaughters. Those words hit like a punch to the stomach. Real? I said, voice full of contempt. So Sophia isn't real? Is that why you treat her like trash? You don't love her, you've never loved her! What kind of grandparents do that? My father Raised his voice this is our house and we do things our way. If you don't like it, take the girl and leave. I took Sophia in my arms and walked out. On the way home, she asked quietly, daddy, why don't grandma and Grandpa love me? I felt the world come crashing down that night. I made a decision. If they couldn't love Sophia as she deserved, they deserved nothing from me. I called the bank and canceled the mortgage payment.

I said no. Next day, I found my car smashed to pieces. My cousin Emma was getting married and apparently needed $15,000 for her dream venue. The family meeting was called on a Tuesday night, and I knew something was up when everyone gathered in the living room like some kind of intervention. Emma's wedding is in six weeks, mom announced, and the venue fell through. The new place cost more than expected. Emma sat there with crocodile tears streaming down her face. I just don't know what to do. This was supposed to be perfect. That's when dad dropped the bomb. We've all agreed to chip in. Your uncle's covering the flowers, your aunt's handling catering, and you're going to sell your car. I nearly choked on my drink. Excuse me. Your Honda Civic should get around $15,000, mom said. Matter of factly, it's the perfect solution. Are you you insane? That's my car. I need it for work. Emma looked up with those manipulative eyes she perfected since childhood. Come on, cousin. Family comes first, right? I do the same for you. Which was absolutely hilarious, because Emma once stole my prom date two days before prom and laughed about it at the family barbecue. She'd also borrowed my college textbooks and never returned them, costing me $800. But apparently, I was supposed to forget all that for family. Unity? I'm not selling my car, I said firmly. The room went silent. Dad's face turned red, that vein in his forehead starting to throb like it always did when someone dared challenge his authority. That car is sitting in our driveway, he said slowly. You live under our roof. You'll do what's best for this family. Or what? But mom jumped in with her favorite weapon, emotional manipulation. How can you be so selfish? Emma's always been there for you. Remember when you were sick in high school and she brought you soup? That soup incident happened once, seven years ago, and she'd complained about it for weeks afterward. Uncle Ray nodded approvingly. In my day, young people respected their elders and helped family without question. Emma started crying harder. I guess I'll just have to tell everyone the wedding is canceled because my own cousin wouldn't help me. The guilt tripping session went on for another hour. Every family obligation, every time they'd help me, every reason why I owed them this favor got thrown in my face. But I held firm. Finally, dad delivered his ultimatum. Sell the car by Friday or pack your bags and find somewhere else to live. And don't expect any help from this family ever again. Fine, I said. Stay. Ending up. I guess we'll see what happens Friday. That night, I overheard them in the kitchen. Mom's voice carried through the thin walls. She'll cave. She always does when we threaten. To cut her off. Dad agreed. She's too dependent on us. Where's she gonna go? She can't afford rent. Anywhere decent. Emma laughed that nasty laugh of hers. Maybe this will finally teach her that family.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. Remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms. Would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror. Practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech? I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over.

We're done being your servants, mom announced, slapping a contract on the kitchen table I'd scrubbed an hour ago. This says that you will do exactly 50% of all household chores. Sign it. She started recording on her phone while dad stood behind her, arms crossed, exhausted from carrying you. The irony was incredible. I've been doing way more than 50% of everything for two years. While they couldn't even tell you where we kept the laundry detergent. Mom hadn't cooked since 2022. Dad hadn't touched a vacuum in forever, yet they genuinely believe they were doing most of the housework. 50% or find somewhere else to live, dad added, wearing the shirt I'd ironed that morning. I looked at the contract, then at their smug faces. Then I signed it with a smile. You're absolutely right. 50% starting tomorrow. I promise I'll never do more than my exact share again. Actually high fived each other like they just won a free slave in the lottery, not realizing their problems were about to skyrocket. The next morning, mom was on the phone with her sister at 6 a m, bragging about their breakthrough and parenting. We finally taught him responsibility, she gloated. Kids these days need firm boundaries, dad chimed in from the bathroom. Should have done this years ago. Watch how smooth everything runs now that he knows we mean Business. They moved through their morning routine with the confidence of people who never had to think about clean clothes magically appearing in their closets or lunches mysteriously packing themselves. That's when I decided to follow exactly what the contract said. Twenty minutes later, I started the laundry and pulled my clothes out midcycle, leaving the machine full of soapy water. Dad discovered his work shirts floating in cold, gray water at 7 a m, his confident whistling dying mid note as he started screaming from the laundry room. He missed his critical client meeting trying to dry a shirt with Mom's hair dryer still damp, patches visible during his afternoon presentation. Mom fared no better. She'd assumed her presentation outfit would be clean as always, only to find it buried under a week of their dirty clothes. She did her zoom presentation to in a wrinkled gym shirt, her credibility evaporating as quickly as her promotion chances. By Wednesday, the house reeked. I'd taken out exactly one trash bag, mine leaving theirs to ferment in the summer heat. When Mom's book club arrived, I watched from my spotless half of the living room as her best friend's face contorted at the smell. We're doing exactly fifty fifty now, I explained cheerfully, showing them Mom's recorded contract. She was very insistent about fairness. The women exchanged glance before suddenly remembering other commitments. Mom's smile cracked like old paint. The real collapse came Friday when Dad's boss arrived for dinner. I'd Vacuumed exactly half of each room, leaving a perfect line down the middle like a bizarre art installation. Dining table was set only on my side, where I sat eating takeout while dad frantically tried to explain why half their home looked abandoned. Where's the food? Dad hissed in the kitchen. I only bought my half of groceries. Cooking for others would exceed my share. I called out loud enough for his boss to hear. The man left after 15 minutes, muttering about family choose. When they realized they'd messed up, they attempted gaslighting me into going back to how things were. You're being deliberately difficult, mom accused during another family meeting. This isn't what we meant, and you know it. I pulled out my phone, playing back her video from the first meeting. You said, and I quote, exactly 50% of all household chores. No more free rides. I have spreadsheets showing I'm doing precisely 50%. Dad tried a different angle. You're supposed to be mature enough to under

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the I R S. And I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly, and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My. My neighbor, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to Be this helpless single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? The cashier is asking for I D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5 or an S? The scratching messed it up. I gave him completely fake numbers, mixing up digits, going super slow. After 20 minutes of this, he got frustrated. Ma'am, those numbers don't work. Go buy new cards. So I did the whole routine again. Drove to Walmart, called him back, crying harder. The first store's cards didn't work. Are you sure you're really from the IRS? This time I really went for it. I'm in the Walmart parking lot fake crying so loud. Other shoppers were staring. My kids are asking why mommy is buying $5,000 worth of iTunes cards. My daughter wants to know if we're going to be homeless. The scammer actually tried to comfort me. Don't worry, ma'am, just read me the numbers and everything will be fine. I fed him another set of fake numbers, this time adding sorry, my baby spilled juice on the card. Let me clean It off. Three hours in, this guy had wasted his entire afternoon on me. I could hear other scammers in the background getting impatient. His supervisor was probably wondering why he hadn't closed the deal yet. That's when I went for the kill shot. You know what's funny? I just got off the phone with my cousin Jake. He's the police officer standing right next to me, and he says, you're not from the IRS at all. Dead silence. Then what? Yeah, Jake says the IRS

Every five minutes it was, Mom, Tommy touched my stuff or mom, Tommy looked at me weird or Mom, Tommy breathed too loud during my show. I was losing my mind with the constant interruptions throughout every single day. The breaking point came during an important work call when Lily burst into my office screaming that Tommy had walked past her bedroom door without asking permission first. My boss and three clients heard the entire meltdown through my unmuted microphone. I was absolutely mortified and knew something had to change. So I implemented a tattling tax system. Every time she tattled on Tommy for something minor or petty, she owed me 25 cents from her weekly allowance, money only real emergencies were free, like if someone was actually hurt, breaking something valuable or doing something genuinely dangerous that required intervention. I spent an entire evening explaining the system carefully to both kids, creating specific examples of what counted as tattling versus legitimate concerns that needed my attention. Lily seemed to understand the rules perfectly and even nodded enthusiastically when I said this would help her think before complaining. Tommy just looked absolutely relieved that his sister might finally leave him alone. The building stopped immediately and completely. For two absolutely blissful weeks, our house was perfectly quiet. No constant complaints echoing through every room, no sibling drama interrupting my work calls or peaceful evenings. I could Actually focus on important tasks without being summoned every few minutes to referee microscopic disputes. Tommy seemed genuinely happier during this peaceful period, playing freely in common areas without his sister monitoring his every single move like a tiny surveillance officer. He started laughing more often, running around the house without constantly looking over his shoulder, and even began voluntarily leaving his room instead of hiding from Lily's watchful eyes. I bragged extensively to my mom, my sister and my co workers about my brilliant parent breakthrough. My sister asked for detailed instructions to try with her own constantly bickering kids. My mom laughed and said I should seriously consider writing a parenting book about creative discipline techniques. I was feeling incredibly proud of solving our biggest household problem so elegantly. But after those perfect weeks ended, Tommy gradually started acting increasingly strange and withdrawn. He'd visibly flinch when I walked into rooms and kept asking completely random anxious questions, just like, are you mad at me about something or did I do something wrong today? When I asked what was specifically bothering him, he just mumbled, nothing, never mind, and quickly run to his room. At first, I assumed he was just adjusting to having less daily conflict with his sister. Kids can.

I thought I knew everything about my husband Sergio, after 12 years of marriage. Turns out I didn't know the most important thing. We were at the oral surgeon's office getting his wisdom teeth removed. All four at once, because Sergio always like to get things over with quickly. I sat in the waiting room, scrolling through my phone and thinking about what soft foods to pick up on the way home. Just another Tuesday afternoon in our normal suburban life. The nurse called me back after about an hour. Sergio was in recovery, still pretty looped from the laughing gas and whatever else they'd given him. His cheeks were stuffed with gauze and his eyes were glassy, but he was awake and mumbling something I couldn't understand. He's doing great, the nurse said. Just needs a few more minutes before you can take him home. I sat next to him and took his hand. That's when things got weird. Instead of squeezing my hand back like he always did, Sergio pulled away and started looking around the room frantically. Where's Nathan? He slurred through the gauze. I need Nathan. Nathan was his best friend since college. They worked at this came accounting firm and played basketball together every Saturday. I figured the drugs were just making him confused. Nathan's at work, honey. I'm here. It's me, Sonia. But Sergio kept shaking his head and trying to sit up. The Nurse had to hold him down. No, no, no need to tell Nathan. Need to tell him about that night. What night? I asked even. No, he probably wouldn't remember any of this. Later. Our wedding night. His words were getting clearer as he got more agitated. I left the reception. Told you I was checking on the hotel room. But I went to Nathan. Had to see Nathan. My stomach started feeling weird, but I told myself it was just random drug talk. People say all kinds of nonsense when they're high. The nurse gave me a look like she'd seen this before. Patients revealing secrets they never tell sober. Sergio kept going. And when Joyce was born, you were sleeping, and I snuck out to the parking lot. Nathan was waiting in his car. I needed him there. Always need him there. Joyce was our daughter. She was eight now and the light of both our lives. Why was Sergio talking about Nathan during her birth? My hands were starting to shake. First anniversary dinner. Told you I got called into work, but I didn't. Went to Nathan's apartment. We watched our movie. We always watch our movie on important days. The nurse quietly excused herself, probably sensing this was getting too personal. Sergio reached for my hand again, but this time his touch felt different.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Gregs when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis Instagram on his own phone. A skateboarder? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere. Right there over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said, while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school. Well, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up except for Gregs. Gregs showed up mysteriously in my Valorant lobby. Hey, Mel, it's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things, school friends. My strict parent, he never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I'd vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, he said once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break, she asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay. My heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it. After she left, Greggy messaged, maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregory on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends. Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring, can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he'd be home. She tried calling her parents, but they didn't pick up. And I didn't have my own parents number.

You visiting mom every single day makes me look like a bad daughter, she says while scrolling through her phone. You're babying her. She's only 72 and you're acting like she's some martyr. It's creating an unhealthy codependency. I read about it in my therapy group. Then she drops it. New rule you visit once a month just like me, or I'm changing mom's locks. I already talked to a locksmith. And don't even think about making copies. I'm getting those special locks that can't be duplicated. Get mom for backup. But she just shrugs and says whatever we think is best, though she does quietly add that she enjoys the daily visits. Classic mom avoiding conflict. I noticed she puts her keys in the refrigerator, but I don't say anything because what's the point? Fine. I tell my sister once a month. But when this goes wrong, remember, this was your idea. Week one without my daily visits and the neighbor calls me at work. Your mom was outside at 3:00am looking for her cat. Thing is, mom doesn't have a cat. Never has. I want to rush over, but my sister already threatened to change the lock, so I call her instead. The neighbors being dramatic, she says. Haven't had time to check myself, but Mom's fine.

My sister still insists I'm overreacting. Stop hovering. She can manage her own money. After the bank incident, I can't help myself. I drive by Mom's house anyway. Her newspapers are piling up. I leave groceries on the porch and run before my sister can find out. I keep my distance like she demanded. Then mom shows up at my house one morning. She walked here. That's eight miles. In her slippers. Where's your father? She asked me. Is he picking me up? Dad's been dead five years. My sister says she's just having a bad day. The grocery store calls next. Mom's been there four hours, putting items in other people's carts, telling everyone she's waiting for her husband. The manager says she's been returning the same item to different aisles over and over. My sister arrives first, and I hear her frustration over the phone. Mom, stop being difficult. Mom's response breaks me. I'm sorry, miss, but I don't know you. When I finally get there, mom immediately relaxes when she sees me and grabs my hand. Oh, good, you're here. That angry lady keeps following me. A week later, Three towns over, police find mom at a McDonald's. She. She's been there since morning, telling everyone she's waiting for her kids after school. She thinks it's 1987. She keeps asking the female officer if she should wear her red dress to see Tom sell it tonight because he likes when I show a little leg. When my sister shows up, mom backs away from her. I don't go with strangers, but she sees me and lights up. Oh, thank god. This woman keeps claiming she knows me. My sister's crying now. Mom, please. I'm your daughter. Mom turns to me. Whisper, that woman seems angry. Is she bothering you? The doctor's appointment mom missed three times finally happens because I drive her there.

I'd failed three tests this semester alone because I couldn't study. And my teachers were starting to think I didn't care about school. The worst part was hearing my Xbox notifications going off every night at 9 p m. When my friends logged on to play together. They'd given up inviting me months ago. My parents had installed blackout curtains, removed all electronics from my room, and even put a baby monitor. Yes, a baby monitor at 15, to make sure I stayed in bed. So I started getting creative. First, I tried the classic pillow under the blanket trick. But the baby monitor's night vision caught me sneaking out immediately. Then I discovered That if I position myself just right, I could hide under my desk in the monitor's blind spot and use my phone with the brightness all the way down. But mom figured that out when she did a random wellness check. Ten PM. After that, they started taking my phone at six thirty PM, too, so I got more desperate and smarter. They installed a smart lock on my door that would alert their phones if it opened after seven PM. I Learned to pick it with a Bobby pin. They put tape on the door frame to see if I'd left. I Learned to carefully remove and replace it. This went on for months, an exhausting war of attrition where I was fighting just to have the base freedom. Then one fateful night, I'd finally won a small victory. My parents had been at a dinner party and came home exhausted, going straight to bed without their usual final check. I waited until I heard dad snoring, then carefully positioned myself under the desk with my phone, ready to finally join my friends online for the first time in forever. I was just about to text them when I smelled something wrong. A sharp chemicals smell that made my nose tingle. At first I thought maybe I was imagining it from being cooped up in my room too long, but it got stronger. Then I recognized it. Gas. Natural gas. Like when mom had accidentally blown at the Pilot Light last year. My heart started racing as I crept to my door and carefully opened it. The smell hit me like a wall. The entire hallway reeked of it. I ran to the kitchen and saw the problem immediately. One of the burner knobs was turned to the on position, but there was no flame. Gas had been pouring into our house for who knows how long. My hands shaking, I turned off the burner and opened the kitchen window, then ran to my parents'room. Mom

So I packed my things and left, but now she's begging me to come back. Last Sunday at my in law's house for their 30th anniversary dinner, everything seemed perfect. My wife Emma was helping her mom arrange flowers while I watched the game with her dad. My buddy Josh was there, too. He's been like family since college, always invited to everything. The whole extended family was there, maybe 20 people total. Emma's cousins, her weird Uncle Dave who likes vintage spoons. Her grandmother, who still asks when we're having kids even though we've been trying for three years. After dinner, her Aunt Linda starts this thing where everyone shares their sliding door moments. Those what if scenarios that keep you up at night. Everyone's going around the table sharing cute stories. Her cousin Sarah talks about almost moving to Japan to teach English. Uncle Dave mentions nearly buying Bitcoin in 2,010. Her brother Tom jokes about almost joining the military instead of becoming an accountant. Normal, harmless stuff that gets people thinking. Then it's Emma's turn. She's had a few glasses of wine, and she gets this dreamy, distant look in her eyes, like she's somewhere else entirely. Honestly, she says, looking directly at Josh across the table, I sometimes think I should have dated Josh instead of Mark back in college. We just click so naturally, you know, the entire table goes Dead silent. Her dad literally chokes on his coffee and starts coughing violently. Her mom drops her fork with a loud clatter. Her grandmother's mouth falls open. I'm sitting right there like a complete idiot, watching my wife of eight years fantasize about my best friend in front of our entire family. Josh's face goes bright red. He starts stammering something about how that's not appropriate. But Emma just keeps going like she's in some kind of trance. We have so much more in common than Mark and I do. Josh actually listens when I talk about my art projects. He gets my sense of humor. He remembers little things I say. Sometimes I wonder if I settled too quick. That last part hit like a freight train. Settled? After eight years of marriage, two miscarriages, buying our first house together, and me working overtime to pay for her art supplies. I settled. I excused myself to the bathroom. But really, I just sat in my car for 20 minutes trying to process what had just happened. My hands were shaking. I called my brother Mike, but couldn't even form words to explain. When I came back inside, everyone was pretending nothing happened, making awkward small talk about the weather in Emma's mom's new garden. But the damage was done. You could cut the tension with a knife. We drove home in complete silence. 45 minutes of pure hell. The next morning, I packed a bag and went to my Brother's place. Without saying a word to Emma. I just couldn't look at her. Here's where it gets really messed up, though. Josh calls me that afternoon, absolutely panicking. His voice is shaking on the phone. Turns out Emma had been texting him for months. And I mean hundreds of messages. She'd been telling him how unhappy she was in our marriage, how she'd made a mistake choosing me, how they were meant to be together. The whole time, I thought we were working through our fertility issues. She was planning her escape. Josh shows me some of the text. When we meet up, I think about you. When I'm with Mark. Do you ever imagine what our life could have been like? I married the wrong person. And I'm finally ready to admit it. The worst part. Josh had been telling her to work on our marriage this whole time. He'd been trying to talk her out of these feelings, suggesting couples therapy, telling her she was just going through a rough patch that all marriages face. Emma's been showing up at my work every day this week, crying in the parking lot about how it was just a stupid comment fueled by wine. She keeps saying she didn't mean it.

I'm 32 and my girlfriend's parents still think I'm pouring cheap beer at some dive bar. Last week her mother cornered me in their kitchen while my girlfriend was upstairs. She pressed $300 in my hand and whispered for gas money. I know those tips can't be much. My girlfriend comes from old money and I started working at 14. Her parents never miss a chance to remind me where I belong. We've been together two years, but every family dinner felt like a job interview. I was failing. Last night was her father's retirement party. Three hundred guests at the country club. At the entrance, her mother looked at my watch and frowned. The coat check had a lost and found if you need something more appropriate. It was a ten thousand dollar Rolex. She assumed it was fake. During cocktail hour, her mother dragged me around. This is Doctor Morrison, Judge Williams, then me. This is my daughter's boyfriend. He works in the service industry. Her Aunt Patricia asked what exactly I did. Before I could speak, her mother said, he pours drinks beer, mostly downtown somewhere. Patricia touched my arm sympathetically and asked about my career goals. Her father intercepted me by the bar. You parked in the member lot. Staff and vendors use the back entrance. The guard mentioned your car doesn't have a member sticker. I drove a hundred thousand dollar Mercedes. He assumed I'd stolen the spot. Then he pulled up his phone. There's a management training program at this restaurant chain. Six week course. I know the regional director. He showed me the application. Thirty five thousand to start, but it's steady. At dinner, they put us at table 23, near the service station. Her parents sat at the head table under a chandelier. Her father gave his retirement speech. He thanked his colleagues, praised his children's accomplishments. When he mentioned my girlfriend, he said, still waiting for her to find someone worthy of the family name. He stared at me while the room chuckled. After dessert, her parents ambushed us by the restrooms. Her mother had printed emails from her friend's husband. He owns several franchises. Fast food. But management track. 40,000 to start. My phone exploded with notifications. 50 messages, then 100. Major supplier threatening to pull out of tomorrow's contract signing. Monday morning, her father announced. Eight sharp. He's expecting you. Don't be late or hungover. The texts kept coming. My business partner, our attorney. The Japanese distillery representatives were furious about something. Five million dollar exclusive import deal about to collapse. Silence that. Her mother snapped. This is about our daughter's future. My girlfriend snatched the papers and ripped them up. He doesn't need your help. Listen to her. Her mother said to me. So desperate to defend you, she's become delusional. This is what you've reduced her to. Her father leaned in, his breath thick with scotch. Real men don't let their women pay for dinner. How often does she cover your rent? Her mother already had her phone out. I've been talking to my attorney. There are ways to protect her trust fund from certain types of people. Someone with ambition, her father added. Someone with education. Someone who doesn't smell like beer. And desperation. I excused myself to handle the crisis. When I returned, her mother was showing my girlfriend photos. Remember Christopher? Harvard Law, just made partner. He still asks about you. That's when Mister Fitzgerald stood up from his table near the stage. Everyone knew him. He'd been supplying restaurants in the city for 40 years. Excuse me, he called out, walking straight toward me. Are you Daniel? Her parents exchanged amused looks. Her father actually laughed. This is just the boyfriend. He tends bar somewhere downtown. He's Daniel Reeves, my girlfriend said, standing up. He owns Vintage Proof and the Sterling Room. Fitzgerald's face lit up. You're

And I already know this is about my daily visits. You visiting mom every single day makes me look like a bad daughter, she says while scrolling through her phone. You're babying her. She's only 72, and you're acting like she's some martyr. It's creating an unhealthy codependency. I read about it in my therapy group. Then she drops it. New rule. You visit once a month, just like me, or I'm changing Mom's locks. I already talked to a locksmith. And don't even think about making copies. I'm getting those special locks that can't be duplicated. I look at mom for backup, but she just shrugs and says whatever we think is best, though she does quietly add that she enjoys the daily visits. Classic mom, avoiding conflict. I noticed she puts her keys in the refrigerator, but I don't say anything because what's the point? Fine. I tell my sister, once a month. But when this goes wrong, remember, this was your idea. Week one without my daily visits and the neighbor calls me at work. Your mom was outside at 3:00am looking for her cat. Thing is, mom doesn't have a cat. Never has. Want to rush over, but my sister already threatened to change the lock, so I call her instead. The neighbor's being dramatic, she says, haven't had time to check myself, but Mom's fine. Week 2, mom calls me, crying that someone stole all her food. My sister checks, text me a photo of a full fridge like I'm the crazy one. Doesn't notice it's all expired. The milk dated three weeks ago. Week 3 gets worse. The bank calls because mom tried to withdraw 30,000 in cash for the nice man fixing my roof. There is no man. There's no roof damage. My sister still insists I'm overreacting. Stop hovering. She can manage her own money. After the bank incident, I can't help myself. I drive by Mom's house anyway. Her newspapers are piling up. I leave groceries on the porch and run before my sister can find out. I keep my distance like she demanded. Then mom shows up at my house one morning. She walked here. That's eight miles. In her slippers. Where's your father? She asked me. Is he picking me up? Dad's been dead five years. My sister says she's just having a bad day. The grocery store calls next. Mom's been there for hours, putting items in other people's carts, telling everyone she's waiting for her husband. The manager says she's been returning the same items to different aisles over and over. My sister arrives first, and I hear her frustration over the phone. Mom, stop being difficult. Mom's response breaks me. I'm sorry, miss, but I don't know you. When I. I finally get there, mom immediately relaxes when she sees me and grabs my hand. Oh, Good, you're here. That angry lady keeps following me. A week later, three towns over, police find mom at a McDonald's. She. She's been there since morning, telling everyone she's waiting for her kids after school. She thinks it's 1987. She keeps asking the female officer if she should wear her red dress to see Tom sell it tonight because he likes when I show a little leg. When my sister shows up, mom backs away from her. I don't go with strangers, but he sees me and lights up. Oh, thank god. This woman keeps claiming she knows me. My sister's crying now. Mom, please. I'm your daughter. Mom turns to me, whispers, that woman seems angry. Is she bothering you? The doctor's appointment mom missed three times finally happens because I drive her there. He pulls us both aside after the brain scan. How long has your mother been showing signs of dementia? My sister actually laughs. She doesn't have dementia. The doctor turns his computer screen toward us. She's stage 4. These symptoms have been building for at least a year. And she's lost 15 pounds. My stomach drops. We didn't notice under her cardigan. My sister still arguing when he asks who's been managing her care. No one. I mean, my sister used to visit daily, but I made her stop. I told her it was unhealthy.

So this actually happened at our house last month, and I still don't know whether to laugh or feel guilty. We were having a simple dinner. Spaghetti salad, nothing fancy. I had my usual glass of red wine sitting next to my water. My daughter, she's 7, tiny and adorable, but sneaky as hell, kept staring at my glass. I thought she was just curious, like always. Well, I turned my head for literally three seconds to grab more sauce, and when I look back, the glass was halfway to empty. She had taken two Big Gulps before I even realized what was happening. Her face scrunched up immediately, like she tasted vinegar. She coughed, smacked her lips, then started laughing. She said, Mommy, your grape juice is. Is dizzy. It's socks juice. She couldn't even find the words. She just kept pointing at her head and saying, brain, go. At first I panicked, like, oh, my god, my child just drank wine. But then she stood up and started wobbling around the table. Not like a cartoon drunk, just clumsy, tripping over her own feet. She put her hands on her hips, pointed at her dad, and slurred, daddy, you. You got pizza face. My husband froze, then started laughing so hard he almost spit his water out. Then she sat back down, rested her chin on her hands, and looked at me super serious. She said, Mommy, I love you, but your juice tastes like. Like toilet grapes. I swear I didn't know whether to laugh or hide under the table. My son was dying, tears rolling down his cheeks. The funniest part was how she tried to keep talking, but her words kept getting mixed up. She said, I'm not drunk, I'm. I'm funned. Fun funned up. Then she clapped for herself like she invented a new word. A minute later she whispered, Shh! The dog is my best friend. Don't tell daddy, and then she burst into random giggles. We gave her water right away and made her sit on the couch. She held the cup with both hands and said, this is boring juice. Bring the funny juice. I told her absolutely not, but she kept repeating it like a chant. Funny juice, funny juice. She eventually leaned back and started humming to herself all off key, like she was singing a secret song only she could hear. About 10 minutes later she just blurted out, sometimes I don't brush my teeth, I just lick the toothpaste. My son screamed, I knew it! I could didn't even stop laughing. It was like the wine unlocked her honesty button. She confessed to hiding candy wrappers under her pillow and stealing her brother's Legos. Every time she said something, she'd giggle and go, oopsies, don't ground me! After a little while, the drowsiness kicked in. She curled up on the couch holding her stuffed bunny and Mumbled Mommy, no more sock juice. Promise. Then she added, almost whispering no more toilet grapes. They made my tongue go zig zag.

My son Tyler is 8 years old. And until last month, he talked to both of us just fine. But then something changed and he started only talking to my wife, Emma, when he needed something. If I asked him a question, he'd walk over to Emma and whisper the answer to her, then she'd tell me. It was driving me crazy. At first, I thought maybe I did something wrong. Did I yell at him? Was I too strict about his bedtime? I kept asking Emma what was going on, but she just said Tyler was going through a phase and it would pass. But after two weeks of this, I was getting really frustrated. The breaking point came when Tyler scraped his knee falling off his bike in our driveway. I ran over to help him up, but he pushed me away and ran straight to Emma, who was watering plants by the front door. He was crying and pointing at his knee but wouldn't let me near him. Emma cleaned him up and put a Band Aid on while I just stood there feeling like garbage. That night, after Tyler went to bed, I confronted Emma. I told her this wasn't normal and something was seriously wrong. She kept saying it was just a phase, but I could tell she was hiding something. Her voice got all shaky and she wouldn't look Me in the eye. Finally, I said if she didn't tell me what was going on, I was going to take Tyler to see a therapist because this behavior wasn't normal for an 8 year old. That's when Emma broke down crying. She told me that three weeks ago when I was at work late, Tyler had walked into our bedroom while she was changing clothes. Instead of just telling him to knock next time, she freaked out and yelled at him saying he shouldn't see mommy without clothes.

Congratulations. That's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem. Scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs, tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time, definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like, oh my God, I'm so OCD. I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized, my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression unless you're diagnosed. I don't want to hear it. You're free to self pity in private. But self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

Every August for like six years, I host this huge end of summer party in my backyard. It's basically become the neighborhood event that everyone looks forward to. Kids run around screaming with popsicles. Parents drink beer and complain about going back to school shopping. And by 9:00, the little ones are dragged inside to sleep while the adults keep the party going until like midnight. My house is literally right next to the backyard, so when my kids, Mia and Tyler, get tired, I just take them upstairs, tuck them in and leave the bedroom window open so I can hear everything going on outside. They have my old iPhone, too, so if anything happens, they can just text me. It's worked perfectly for years. This year, I invited my boyfriend, Kevin, and his two kids, Emma and Jake. We've been together for 6 months, which felt like long enough to include them in my tradition. But when I explained how the night usually goes, Kevin's face got all weird. He said he wasn't comfortable with his kids sleeping at my place since they'd never stayed over before. Okay, fair enough. Then he said he didn't like the idea of putting them to bed while he stayed outside with me. didn't want to leave early with them while I stayed at my own party. Basically, nothing about my setup worked for him. Told him I totally understood and that they didn't have to come. Like this isn't some random hangout I threw together last minute. This is an annual thing with a format that works for everyone who's been coming for years. If it doesn't work for you, then don't come. No big deal. But Kevin lost his mind, started saying that he and his kids weren't actually welcome because of how I set everything up, that I should have changed the whole party just for them, that any good girlfriend would leave her own party early to put his kids to bed and stay with them. The party happened without them. It was actually amazing. Missus Chen from next door brought her famous potato salad. The Henderson kids had a water balloon fight that soaked half the adults. And Around 10:30, when all the kids were asleep, we played music and talked until almost 1 in the morning. I didn't think about Kevin once until my phone started buzzing. He'd been texting me all night asking why I wasn't calling him, said I should have made time during my own party to check in with him, that he felt left out and ignored. I saw the messages when I was cleaning up and just put my phone away. The next day he came over and we had this massive fight. He kept saying I chose my neighbors over him and his kids, that I prioritized some stupid tradition over our relationship. That if I really cared about him, I would have either changed the party format or left early to spend time with them. I, I told him that was insane. This party happens one night a year. Everyone knows the deal. His kids would have had fun until bedtime and then they could have gone home or figured something else out. But changing a six year tradition for someone I've been dating for six months, making all my neighbours adapt to his comfort level, leaving my own party early, not happening. He said I was selfish and not ready for a real relationship with someone who has kids. But I clearly wasn't thinking long term about us if I wasn't willing to make adjustments. I said maybe he was right because someone who expected me to completely rearrange my life after six months probably wasn't someone I wanted to think long term about anyway. We broke up. Two days later, he sent me this long text about how I'd realise what I lost when I was alone at next year's party.

My class teacher responded, yes, he's here. My boy Oscar nudged me. Dude, what the hell did you do? That's when we heard it. BRR! Helicopters were filling the school yard. Attention, all students. Return to your classrooms immediately. This is a lockdown. Everyone ran at once. Miss Kelly's hand was digging into my arm. Jose, has anyone unusual tried to contact you recently? What? No. She pulled me away from the windows just as the helicopter noise became deafening. The lights went out. My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. Everything's going to be okay. I promise. Someone behind us muttered, maybe it's I C E. The principal spoke again to all staff and students. Code yellow. I repeat, code yellow. Counseling staff to designated areas. A spotlight swept across the windows. Everyone dropped to the floor. Miss Kelly pushed me under a table, her radio crackling with voices I couldn't understand. Mister Doran appeared out of nowhere, shirt soaked with sweat. Jose, get to the conference room now! I followed him out, trying to look normal while my heart was beating out of my chest. The hallways were full of cops. One cop looked directly at me, and his hand moved to his gun. Mister Doran stepped between us. He's with me. One cop spoke into his radio as we passed. I caught two words. Package secured. My mind went Straight to the bag of Mary Jane that I kept in my locker. But I played it cool. More cops ran past toward the gym. Someone shouted about medical equipment, head trauma, but we kept moving. Mister Doran's hand was firm on my back, pushing me forward. Jose, just so we're clear, you haven't been involved in anything illegal, right? Sometimes kids from your background get mixed up in things. Before I could respond, he opened the conference room door and shoved me inside. The room was dark except for the emergency lights. Miss Kelly followed us in. Click. The door locked. Just the three of us. She sat down across from me. There were tears streaming down her face. I had to fight back nervous laughter. Jose. Her voice cracked. Honey. That word made my blood freeze. Teachers don't say honey unless something terrible has happened. There's been an accident. The helicopters were still circling outside this morning at the warehouse where your dad works. A shelving unit collapsed. Your father was. She stopped, took a shaky breath. He didn't make it. Jose, I'm so sorry. I started laughing. This is a crazy prank, even for you, Mister Doran. I saw the helicopters, the police officers, they locked eyes with each other. And I saw Miss Kelly nod like she was silently agreeing to give the full explanation. Turns out the principal was calling for me right when a student had fallen through the gym skylight during maintenance. Coincidence? That made everyone think the helicopters and manhunt were connected to me. It felt like someone had drained all the color out of my heart. I curled up into a ball and started rocking back and forth uncontrollably. I was an orphan. Someone else entered the room, a woman with a clipboard and a blazer that screamed social worker. She started talking about emergency placement, foster care. I grabbed my vape from my pocket, not even caring that Mister Doran was standing right there. Miss Kelly rubbed my back while I heaved. Well, the social worker said, looking at her clipboard, this is what happens when these immigrants don't follow simple safety rules. She shook her head. Your people need to learn that. Excuse me? I looked up, tears still streaming. Mister Doran cleared his throat. What she means is these accidents are unfortunately common in certain communities. Even Miss Kelly nodded. I didn't want to be the one to say it, but, Jose, your people just don't follow safety rules. It's always the same with them. I've seen it 100 times. The social worker continued filling out forms. At least with foster care you'll be in a more stable environment.

When I was in 9th grade, I got stuck with our school's worst teacher, who was infamous for trying to make a Muslim girl take off her headwear to prove she wasn't wearing headphones in class. There were a lot of students who got away with cheating by wearing headphones during tests, so she was constantly checking. Since then, she didn't do anything too bad until we had to take our final exam at the end of the year and she stood up to walk around the room. It was really hot that day, so I wore a lighter shirt. I also happened to have type 1 diabetes, so you could see my insulin pump. That day, my blood sugar was low, so I turned my pump on and walked into class. We were almost done taking the test and she stood up to walk around the room. I was honestly focused on just passing until I heard her walk straight up behind me. In that moment, two things happened. She grabbed my paper off my desk and told me I failed. And I felt her grab the pump on my waist. I just sat there in shock as she walked away and had no idea what had just happened. However, it wasn't until I noticed she was holding Scissors that it clicked what she had just done. She seen the wire hanging. Off my waist and assumed I had headphones in. When I looked down, the tube was cut. After a few seconds, my pump started beeping very loudly and everyone started looking at me. A few people sitting around me saw what happened and were in shock. She came over and when she realized what she did, I watched her face turn pale. She had messed up big time and had no idea what to do and neither did I. She told me to go to the nurse and on the way there, I started getting, see, I made it there. I could feel myself starting to pass out. The nurse called 9, 1 1 and I had to go to the hospital. But since that day, I actually started wearing headphones in class because none of the teachers would try anything.

And I already know this is about my daily visits. You visiting mom every single day makes me look like a bad daughter, she says while scrolling through her phone. You're babying her. She's only 72, and you're acting like she's some martyr. It's creating an unhealthy codependency. I read about it in my therapy group. Then she drops it. New rule. You visit once a month, just like me, or I'm changing Mom's locks. I already talked to a locksmith. And don't even think about making copies. I'm getting those special locks that can't be duplicated. I look at mom for backup, but she just shrugs and says whatever we think is best. Though she does quietly add that she enjoys the daily visits. Class like mom avoiding conflict. I noticed she puts her keys in the refrigerator, but I don't say anything because what's the point? Fine. I tell my sister, once a month. But when this goes wrong, remember, this was your idea. Week one without my daily visits and the neighbor calls me at work. Your mom was outside at 3:00am looking for her cat. Thing is, mom doesn't have a cat. Never has. I want to rush over, but my sister already threatened to change the lock, so I call her instead. The neighbor's being dramatic, she says, haven't had time to check myself, but Mom's fine. Week 2, mom calls me, crying that someone stole all her food. My sister checks, text me a photo of a full fridge like I'm the crazy one. Doesn't notice it's all expired. The milk dated three weeks ago. Week 3 gets worse. The bank calls because mom tried to withdraw 30,000 in cash for the nice man fixing my roof. There is no man. There's no roof damage. My sister still insists I'm overreacting. Stop hovering. She can manage her own money. After the bank incident, I can't help myself. I drive by Mom's house anyway. Her newspapers are piling up. I leave groceries on the porch and run before my sister can find out. I keep my distance like she demanded. Then mom shows up at my house one morning. She walked here? That's eight miles. In her slippers. Where's your father? She asked me. Is he picking me up? Dad's been dead five years. My sister says she's just having a bad day. The grocery store calls next. Mom's been there for hours, putting items in other people's carts, telling everyone she's waiting for her husband. The manager says she's been returning the same item to different aisles over and over. My sister arrives first, and I hear her frustration over the phone. Mom, stop being difficult. Mom's response breaks me. I'm sorry, miss, but I don't know you. When I finally get there, mom immediately relaxes when she sees me and grabs my hand. Oh, good, you're here. That angry lady keeps following me. A week later, three towns over, police find mom at a McDonald's. She. She's been there since morning, telling everyone she's waiting for her kids after school. She thinks it's 1987. She keeps asking the female officer if she should wear her red dress to see Tom sell it tonight because he likes when I show a little leg. When my sister shows up, mom backs away from her. I don't go with strangers, but she sees me and lights up. Oh, thank god. This woman keeps claiming she knows me. My sister's crying now. Mom, please. I'm your daughter. Mom turns to me, whisper, that woman seems angry. Is she bothering you? The doctor's appointment mom missed three times finally happens because I drive her there. He pulls us both aside after the brain scan. How long has your mother been showing signs of dementia? My sister actually laughs. She doesn't have dementia. The doctor turns his computer screen toward us. She's stage 4. These symptoms have been building for at least a year. And she's lost 15 pounds. My stomach drops. We didn't notice under her cardigan. My sister still arguing when he asks who's been managing her care. No one.

Again? I stared in shock. Again? I don't want to compete. Oh, sweetie, mom said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The monthly room assignment builds character. Winners get the master suite. Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca, wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes, no heat, and spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. I didn't want to win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. The next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for Four a m. Just to beat us to the kitchen. By week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together. Stop helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look at that competitive spirit! Dad beamed. One morning, after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement, constantly checking for spiders. Bianca developed anxiety attacks. Harvin started pulling out his hair, leaving bald patches. He tried to hide under hats. The monthly meeting came like an execution. We sat in the living room while our parents tally points on their laptops. Bianca, 78 points. Marvin, 81 points. Mom paused dramatically. And Marcus with 92 points. I'd won by doing extra shifts at the food bank, sacrificing sleep I couldn't get anyway. Bianca burst into tears. Marvin threw his notebook at the wall and stormed out. Pack your things, dad said cheerfully. You get the master suite. I stood up slowly. No. The room went silent. Mom smile froze. Excuse me. I'm not moving upstairs. I'm staying in the basement. Dad's face turned red. You earned that room. You're moving up there. Tonight you turned us against each other, I said, my voice shaking. Bianca cries herself to sleep. Marvin won't even look at us anymore. We used to be best friends. You're being dramatic, mom said, but her voice wavered. That night, I dragged my mattress to the basement's main area. Bianca found me there an hour later with her sleeping bag. Marvin appeared in the doorway with his pillows. Without speaking, we built a fort with our mattresses, the way we used to when we were little. I sabotaged your science project, Bianca confessed in the darkness. I know, I said. I deleted your essay. I put laxatives in both your lunches, Marvin whispered. We started laughing. Horrible. Broke

My older sister London was always the pretty one because she hit puberty first and got the good genes. When I turned 14, I begged my parents for money for skincare products since my face was breaking out everywhere. Paris, you're too young for expensive products, London said, examining her perfect complexion in the mirror. Maybe when you learn to wash your face properly. My skin was basically a minefield of cystic acne, blackheads, and scars from picking. London skin glowed like she had a filter on in real life. She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointments. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom. Half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serums she'd abandon for the next trending thing, but somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful. High School ended. London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties. I went to community college, worked at a pharmacy where I Learned about ingredients. Saved every penny for a dermatologist. London would Snapchat me from clubs while I was studying chemistry. Why are you wasting your Friday night? She'd text. Oh, wait, not like anyone's asking you out anyway. I'm investing in my future. I'd respond, you're just jealous you can't get into the VIP section. After two years, I transferred to state school for nursing. Started understanding how skin actually worked. Learned about retinoids, chemical exfoliants, moisture barriers. Started seeing changes. London kept baking and tanning beds twice a week, sleeping in her makeup after nights out, living on vodka sodas and whatever guy was buying her dinner. She was still gorgeous at 22, but the foundation was getting thicker, the filters working harder. By 25, I had clear skin for the first time in my life. Proper routine, consistent habits, monthly facials. I saved for London. Had her first Botox consultation. Convinced the nurse practitioner missed something when she said it was sun damage, not expression lines. Last month was our cousin's wedding. I walked in feeling confident for once. Hair healthy from years of no heat styling. Skin glowing from retinol and sunscreen. Body Strong from consistent exercise. London cornered me at the cocktail hour. Paris. Oh, my god. What happened to you? Her voice had that desperate edge she used when she needed something. Thanks, London. Just taking care of myself. No, seriously, what are you using? What's your dermatologist's name? Did you get something done? She grabbed my face, turning it side to side in the light. I need to know everything. The

My college roommate Derek saved my life sophomore year. I've been drunk at a party and decided to climb onto the frat house roof to impress a girl. When I slipped, Derek caught my arm just as I was going over the edge. Three story drop onto concrete. I would have died. You owe me big time, he'd said, pulling me back up. One day I'm gonna need something huge, and you better deliver. I figured he'd ask me to write his thesis or loan him money after graduation. Normal stuff. Instead, seven years later, I get a call at 2 a m. Remember that favor? Derek's voice was strained. Yeah, of course. What do you need? Long pause. I need you to be my boyfriend at my family reunion this weekend. I laughed, thinking it was a prank. Good one, man. I'm serious. I've been telling my family I have a boyfriend for two years. His name is Jake. You're Jake now? Turns out Derek had come out to his ultra conservative family, but softened the blow by saying he was in a committed relationship with a successful doctor. Doctor part was true. I'm an ER physician. The boyfriend part, not so much. I'm straight, married with a kid on the way. Derek, I can't pretend to be your boyfriend. I don't even know how to. You saved my life. Now I'm asking you to save my relationship with My family. My grandmother is 94. This might be her last reunion. She keeps asking when she'll meet Jake. The desperation in his voice got me. What about my wife? What do I tell Sarah? Tell her the truth. Tell her everything. Sarah thought it was hilarious. You literally owe him your life, babe. Toby, Jake for a weekend. That's how I found myself at a massive family reunion in Ohio, holding Derek's hand while his aunt Martha grilled me about our love story. Derek had created an entire fictional history. How we met at a medical conference, first date at an Italian restaurant, even what I supposedly said when I first told him I loved him. The worst part was his cousin Brandon, who kept trying to set me up with his friend. If things don't work out with Derek, he'd whisper, call me. Everything peaked at the talent show. Apparently, Jake had promised to perform a couple's dance routine with Derek. I can't dance at all. We stumbled through three minutes of what was supposed to be a tango while 60 relatives filmed it. But the real awkwardness came when grandma pulled me aside. I know, she said quietly. My blood went cold. Know what? You're not really dating my grandson. She patted my hand. Derek's actual boyfriend posted on Instagram yesterday from Cabo. But you're a good friend for doing this. Are you going to tell anyone? She's smiled. I'm 94, sweetheart. I just want my grandson. To be happy. If he needs this little show to feel comfortable, that's fine. But next reunion, tell him to bring the real one. Derek finally brought his actual boyfriend to Christmas dinner that year. Turns out his name really is Jake, which LED to a very confusing introduction when they explained I was the other Jake from the reunion. We're still friends. Sarah still calls me Jake sometimes just to mess with me. And yes, that Tango video went viral in the family group chat. I'm never living it down.

I've been at this company for three years. When Donald completely humiliated me during a big meeting in front of everyone I worked with. Maybe we could save time by changing how we handle these reports. I suggested holding up this diagram I'd spent my whole weekend making. Let's not work above our pay grade, shall we, Tom? He said with this condescending laugh that made everyone uncomfortable. Your entry level, not management. You need to learn your place. Do what you're paid to do, nothing more. He moved to the next slide like he hadn't just insulted everything I'd done. Stay in your lane, Thomas. I set down the marker quietly. Okay, then. Staying in my lane it is. He practically glowed with satisfaction. See how easy that is? Everyone just doing their assigned tasks, no overstepping. The very next morning, April from accounting showed up at my desk with her usual panic. Thomas, can you fix this spreadsheet real quick? You always know how to handle these things. I kept typing without looking up. Sorry, that's above my pay grade. Tech support handles that stuff. But you've literally always helped me with this. Donald made it clear yesterday that I need to stay in my lane. Call I T. Her face went through three different expressions before settling on disbelief. That afternoon, Donald himself appeared with his laptop, looking stressed Need you to polish these slides for tomorrow's big presentation. I didn't even glance at the screen. That's design work, Donald. Above my pay grade. His left eye started Twitch. You've been doing my slide since you started here. Which was wrong of me. You were right yesterday. I was overstepping. This presentation is critical. Then you should probably do it yourself. Or hire someone. He stood there for a full minute before storming off. The real fun started when the new guy arrived. Sandra from HR brought him to my desk. Thomas always trains our new people. He's the best at explaining everything. I looked up briefly. Training is a supervisor job. Not in my job description. Sandra looked like I'd spoken in a foreign language. But you've trained the last five people we hired. Which was me working above my pay grade. Donald corrected that behavior on Monday. The kid, it stood there clutching his folder, looking lost. So who's supposed to train me? Someone at the appropriate pay level. Donald materialized within 15 minutes, looking furious. What's this about refusing to train, Kevin? Training isn't in my job description. We don't have anyone else who knows everything. That sounds like a management problem. His face turned red. Thomas, be reasonable. I'm being exactly what you told me to be. Thursday at 4:47 p m. Donald rushed over in full panic mode. Emergency important. Client needs updated numbers for their 5:30 call. I was already packing my bag. My hours are 9 to 5. This can't wait until tomorrow? Overtime requires authorization and higher pay rate. Thomas, don't do this. I'm doing exactly what you instructed. Staying in my lane. I logged off while he stood there speechless. The contract is worth 2 million. Sounds like something management should handle. Friday's department meeting turned into a complete

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet. At first she was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around, but when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800 not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. Eight hundred dollars might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing. My parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or Pick up extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school, and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better when I went to him for help. He said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as A bridesmaid? Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

So my husband, Jake, has this thing where he thinks he knows everything about cars, like everything. He grew up working on engines with his dad and acts like that makes him some kind of expert mechanic. The problem is, he's not. Last Tuesday, I was driving home from work in my Honda Civic when I started hearing this weird grinding noise from the front wheels. It wasn't super loud, but it was definitely there. I pulled into our driveway and told Jake about it right away. He barely looked up from his phone. It's probably just your brake squeaking. They do that sometimes. I told him it didn't sound like squeaking. It sounded more like metal grinding against metal and it was getting worse. He rolled his eyes. Babe, I've been working on cars since I was 12. Trust me, it's fine. The next morning, same thing. The grinding was even louder now, especially when I turned left. I told Jake again and this time he actually came outside to listen. He had me start the car and drive it around the block while he stood there with his arms crossed like some kind of professional. When I got back, he shook his head, see, nothing, you're being paranoid. But I wasn't being paranoid. Thursday morning on my way to work, the grinding was so loud, other drivers were looking at me at red lights. I called Jake, during my lunch break, I'm taking the car to a mechanic after work. Something is seriously wrong. He got annoyed. Don't waste our money on some guy who's gonna try to sell you stuff you don't need. I'm telling you, the car is fine. Friday morning, I was driving to pick up groceries when it happened. I was turning left into the parking lot when the grinding turned into this horrible screeching sound. And then the car just started pulling hard to the right. I had to grip the steering wheel with both hands to keep it straight. My heart was pounding as I managed to park. I called Jake immediately. Something just happened with the car. I think the wheel bearing went out or something. He sighed like I was bothering him. You probably just hit a pothole wrong. Drive it home and I'll look at it this weekend. I, I told him I didn't think it was safe to drive. He said, it's fine. Cars don't just break down like that. That's when I hung up and called my mom. My mom has never claimed to know anything about cars, but she has common sense. I, I told her what was happening, and she didn't hesitate. Don't drive that car anywhere. Call a tow truck and get it to a mechanic right now. I'll pay for it if Jake gives you grief. The mechanic took one look at my car and his face got serious. Ma'am, you're Lucky you didn't crash. Your front wheel bearing completely failed. If you'd kept driving on this, the wheel could have locked up or even come off while you were on the highway. The repair cost 600 bucks.

Call a tow truck and get it to a mechanic right now. I'll pay for it if Jake gives you grief. The mechanic took one look at my car, and his face got serious. Ma'am, you're Lucky you didn't crash. Your front wheel bearing completely failed. If you'd kept driving on this, the wheel could have locked up or even come off while you were on the highway. The repair cost 600 bucks.

My brother and I used to sneak out all the time, not for anything wild, just dumb, harmless stuff. Late night 7, 11 runs, laying on the trampoline to watch for meteors. One time we snuck out just to see if the new Taco Bell was open 24 hours. We weren't rebels, just bored kids who liked feeling like we were getting away with something. It started when I was 11 and he was 14. He'd tap three times on my wall around midnight. Our signal. I tiptoe past our parents room in my socks, meet him by the laundry door and we'd sneak out like little burglars in pajamas. He always carried a backpack with snacks, flashlights and a notebook he pretended was mission logs. I think he just liked pretending we were spies. It became our tradition. Even when we weren't talking much during the day, we'd still sneak out. One time I fell asleep and missed the signal. The next morning he left a granola bar and a sticky note in my sock drawer that said, rookie Mistake, you're on thin ice, Agent B. But as we got older, things changed, got busier with school, started driving, started dating. I assumed we just outgrown it. No more nightly missions, no more late Taco Bell disappointments. I tap on the wall sometimes just to see, but he never knocked back. Then one night, about a year after our last mission, I couldn't sleep, too Much energy. I tapped on the wall knowing it was pointless, but out of habit, I crept to the laundry room anyway and the back door was already open. I stepped outside. It was cold. Damn. The kind of quiet where even your own footsteps little too loud. I walked to the side gate and that's when I saw him sitting in the driveway, hoodie up, facing away from me. His backpack. The backpack was next to him. I almost called out, but something about the way he was sitting stopped pop me. Shoulders hunched, arms on his knees like he was holding something back. I moved closer and heard it. Quiet, shaky breathing, then a sniff. He was crying. I crouched down beside the car, not sure if I should say anything, but then I heard him mumble something under his breath. I can't do it anymore. He wiped his face on his sleeve and pulled out his phone. I peeked around the car just enough to see the screen. It was a message thread with someone in it.

At my school, it was Marcus Chen. Everyone just knew he was going to make it big someday. He was the kind of guy people pointed to and said, that one, he's going places. Captain of the basketball team, great a student, and somehow still the most grounded, humble person you'd ever meet. But what made Marcus legendary wasn't just his skills on the court, it was how he treated people. He wasn't just admired, he was respected. Genuinely guy knew everyone's name. Not in a fake politician way either. He remembered little things. If you mentioned your grandma was sick and passing, he'd ask how she was doing a week later. If you were struggling in class, he'd sit with you at lunch walking you through the assignment like it was no big deal. He made you feel like you mattered. And came senior year and with it something none of us expected. Mr Patel, our math teacher, was diagnosed with cancer. He was one of those rare teachers everyone liked, strict but fair, always willing to help, even if it meant staying late. We found out his insurance wouldn't cover the experimental treatment he needed. Words spread quickly. The mood at school changed overnight. Everyone felt it. The very next morning, Marcus got on the PA system, calm and direct. This Saturday, we're hosting a charity basketball tournament. $5 to watch, 20 to play. All proceeds go to Mr Patel's treatment, bring your friends. Let, let's pack the gym. No Pep rally, no posters, just that message. And somehow it worked better than any hype machine. The buzz was instant. Saturday came and the turnout was beyond anything we expected. Not only did our entire school show up, but students from three neighboring schools came, too. Some brought their families. Local businesses chipped in with food, wrap full prizes and donations. One restaurant matched every dollar raised. The gym was packed wall to wall. Teams played from morning until night and nobody wanted to leave. By the end of the weekend, we had raised over $15,000. I'll never forget the look on Mister Patel's face when Marcus handed him the envelope. He didn't say anything at first, just hug Marcus tight, eyes full of tears. Marcus just smiled and said, we're all behind you, sir. It felt like a perfect ending, but there was more. A few weeks later, words started spreading that.

I've been with Jerry for four years. When he humiliated me during our baby shower at this fancy country club he wanted to go to, my cousin asked why my pupils look so red. And I explained that this morning I threw up so hard that the blood vessels in my eyes burst. Jerry exploded on me. Shut up. Nobody wants to hear about your bloody eyes and vomit. Can you just be pregnant without making it everyone else's problem? It's revolting. The entire room went silent. His own sister tried to intervene, but he doubled down. What, I'm supposed to pretend all this isn't gross? Yesterday she described how her nipples are leaking. Last week it was about her discharge and cellulite. We get it. You're pregnant. Your body is doing nasty things. His mom gasped. Jerry, she's carrying your child. That doesn't mean I need to hear about every disgusting thing happening to her. This is supposed to be a happy day and she's making me lose my appetite. I sat down my drink. You know what, you're absolutely right. I won't discuss you with any more updates, Jerry. He looked at me surprised, then pleased. Finally. Thank you. See, not that hard to keep all that private. Two days later, Jerry found me getting dressed for my 20 week anatomy scan. What time is the appointment? I'll drive Oh, I'm going alone. I don't wanna subject you to disgusting pregnancy stuff. His face scrunched up. But we find out if it's a boy or girl today. Yeah. And that involves the technician pressing a wand covered in gel all over my stomach while we look at our baby's private parts on his screen. Plus, they measure all the organs. Pretty gross medical stuff. That's different. No, it's not. You said pregnancy details revolt you. I'm respecting that. I took an Uber and when he showed up, I made him wait outside the doctor's office. Next day, his mom called him crying tears of joy. You're having a boy. He looks perfect. And you better have already apologized to your fiance. Jerry put the phone down and stormed into the bedroom. You said the doctor said we have to wait another few weeks before gender shows. I only said that not to disgust you. I didn't want you losing your appetite. You can't keep the gender from me. I'm not keeping anything. I'm protecting you from revolting pregnancy talk, just like you asked. When people asked about baby names, I discussed them enthusiastically with everyone except Jerry. Our friends knew we were considering James. His parents knew about Thomas. His brother knew about William. Why won't you tell me the names you're considering? Discussing the baby requires mentioning pregnancy. That's off limits. Remember, this is insane. This is literally what you demanded. At 28 weeks, I, I started experiencing Concerning symptoms, my feet swelled so badly that when I pressed them, the indent stayed like memory foam and my vision kept getting black spots. I went to the hospital alone when they diagnosed me with preeclampsia and admitted me for monitoring. I texted everyone except Jerry. He found out when his brother called asking why he wasn't at the hospital. You're in the hospital and didn't tell me medical details about pregnancy or TMI. You said so yourself. You could lose the baby and you could get so grossed out by looking at me. You'd call me disgusting and the stress would definitely make me lose it. He went quiet when the doctor scheduled my C section for 36 weeks due to complications. I didn't tell Jerry. I informed his family, my family, our friends, everyone but him. The baby is coming next Tuesday, his sister told him. Jerry called me frantically. Tuesday. You're having our son on Tuesday. Yep. Didn't want to discuss you with talk about them cutting through my abdomen layers and pulling a baby out of my uterus. I need to request time off. Why? You don't want to see gross pregnancy stuff. It's literally the birth of my child.

Now you really look like your loser father. While my nieces were laughing. The next day her account was frozen and the bank for closed on her house. For three years, I've been financially supporting my younger sister Jessica to her divorce. I paid her mortgage, utilities, groceries, everything so she and her daughters wouldn't struggle. Jessica worked at a hair salon, but barely made enough. Over time, I noticed her attitude. She never said thank you, only criticized our life. If we bought a car, she'd say we were showing off. If we took Isabella on vacation, she'd complain that some of us aren't so lucky. Isabella, my daughter, has always been sweet with long, shiny brown hair. Sometimes she'd come home saying Aunt Jessica scolded me or Aunt Jessica said my dress was ugly. Those comments bothered me. Everything changed one Saturday. Isabella was invited to a friend's birthday party and wanted to look like a princess. I decided to take her to Jessica for a special haircut. I called and said, make Isabella look like a princess. I'll leave extra money. Jessica responded dryly, alright, leave her with me, but don't come too late. I dropped Isabella off at Jessica's house. Isabella was happy in her pink dress and sparkling shoes. I kissed her forehead and said I'd be back in a few hours. When I returned at five PM, I heard heartbreaking crying as I approached. I heard Jessica shouting, now you look like your father's failure. Bald and horrible, just like him! Then came laughter, Jessica's laugh and her daughter's giggles. I slammed the door open. Isabella was sitting in a chair with her head lowered. At her feet was a pile of hair, scattered like trash. When she lifted her face, my world collapsed. She was completely bald. Called Jessica had shaved her head, leaving not a single strand. My little princess had red eyes from crying, her face filled with shame. Jessica stood beside her with a razor, laughing. Her daughters were pointing at Isabella, mocking her look. She looks like an egg, Sophia said, laughing. How ugly! Added Lucia. I hugged Isabella tightly. She clung to me, shaking and threw her sobs. Said daddy, why did she do this to me? I just wanted to look pretty. What did you do to my daughter? I roared at Jessica. She stopped laughing, but didn't seem sorry. Calm down, Antonio, it was just a joke. I told her I was giving her a modern cut. She looks unique, she said with a mocking smile. A joke? You shaved my daughter's head! You humiliated her! She shrugged. Don't be dramatic, it's just hair. Plus that girl is always showing off with her long hair. Like my daughters aren't as beautiful. She's a 7 year old girl who wanted to feel pretty. You did this out of envy! Jessica exploded. Don't come at me! With envy crap. You're always showing off your perfect life while I'm struggling alone.

So on day 21, I made it permanent. 20 days of silence. That's what my wife decided I deserved after I suggested she help with household responsibilities instead of treating me like her personal butler. But here's the thing about playing the silent treatment card. Sometimes the other person decides they prefer the quiet. I finished a 12 hour shift and walked into what looked like a tornado hit our kitchen. Did. She's piled high. Take out containers scattered everywhere. And her on the couch scrolling through her phone. I made the apparently unforgivable mistake of saying, hey, think you could give me a hand cleaning up before dinner? The look she gave me could frozen hell over. Excuse me? I work, too. I'm not your maid. I never said you were. I thought we could tackle this together since we both live here. That's when she stood up, grabbed her purse, and delivered the line that would define the next three weeks. Figure it out yourself. And don't expect me to talk to you until you learn some respect. Front door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. When she came back two hours later, I thought we'd have a normal conversation. I was wrong. She walked past me like I was invisible and went straight to the bedroom. Day two rolled around and still nothing. I tried the reasonable approach. If I came across wrong yesterday, we should talk. She poured her coffee, walked past me, and left for work without acknowledging I existed. By day 5, I realized what this was. This wasn't about dishes or respect. This was control. She decided freezing me out would make me grovel and apologize for something I shouldn't apologize for. Day 7 was when something clicked. I was eating a sandwich, watching her perform her silent tantrum routine, and I started laughing. Here was a grown woman who thought giving me the cold shoulder was going to break me down. Instead, it was showing me exactly who I'd married. By day 10, the house had gotten remarkably peaceful. No arguing about whose turn it was to take out trash. No passive aggressive comments about the dishwasher. No dramatic sighs when I wanted to watch sports. I was starting to see the upside. Day 15 brought reinforcements. Her sister called asking if everything was okay because my wife seemed stressed. Told her everything was fine. I was giving my wife the space she'd requested. When her sister tried to dig deeper, I said, she knows how to end this anytime she wants an adult conversation. But here's what she didn't realize during her tantrum. I was using this time to think about what my life had become and what I wanted it to be. Day 20 arrived with her pacing around like a caged animal, looking at me with this.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charge charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability. Buddy, don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl? Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the Busy terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family

Find somewhere else to stay. I looked at this guy, who'd clearly been sleeping with my wife, and simply replied, okay. He probably expected me to break down or punch him. Instead, I closed the door and started making calls. First to my lawyer, then to the bank. What? Gabriel and Natalia didn't know the house was solely in my name. I bought it before we married with inheritance money and never added her to the title. Gabriel had been living there for a month while I was away for work. Natalia claimed he was an acquaintance going through tough time. Complete lie. When he demanded I find somewhere else to stay. He was trying to kick me out of my own house.

He'd even added himself to my 90 Dollar Family Gym membership. Canceled that too. Thursday night, Gabriel appeared, banging on the door. What the hell is going on? Why did you change the locks? Cause this is my house. I Replied from inside, Natalia can get her things, but you have to leave. She's my partner. Now we're together. Perfect. Go be together somewhere else. His tantrum was epic, screaming that I was vengeful that he had rights. Meanwhile, I recorded everything. I texted Natalia, you have 48 hours to collect your belonging. Gabriel is not welcome here. Her response you can't do this. Gabriel lives here now. Check the property title. He's nowhere on it. The next morning, Gabriel's lawyer showed up, claiming Gabriel had tendency rights because as he'd lived there over 30 days. I showed him the recording of Gabriel screaming that he was there as my wife's partner, not a tenant. There's no lease, no rent payments, no contributions, I explained, showing the property title with me as sole owner. The lawyer went pale and left quickly.

Twitch chatter. Sarah came home from her 12 hour hospital shift to find me in the same spot at my computer. Twitch stream on one monitor, spreadsheets minimized on the other. She dropped her bag with that familiar exhausted sound. Mike, eight months. You've been unemployed for eight months watching gamers play Fortnite? My mom keeps asking if you're depressed. I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages and actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. Truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after 6 months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, able management systems. Stuff I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store. Again, Sarah deflected questions about our future, saying we were figuring things out. Maybe he could drive For Uber, her mother suggested. Loud enough for me to hear. Everything unraveled because the doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbor's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? Their returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them. What the hell is this? I couldn't hide it anymore. Opened my laptop and showed her the Shopify dashboard. 300 orders this month. Inventory spreadsheet showing zero stock because everything shipped directly from suppliers to customers. You're selling things? Gaming accessories. Mouse pads, mostly. She stared at the revenue numbers. Last month was my best yet. Enough to cover our mortgage twice. But you don't have any products here. They ship from the supplier. I handle marketing and customer service. I showed her the Facebook ads running in the background, the email campaigns, the abandoned cart sequences. This. This is real money. I opened the business checking account. Six months of deposits from Shopify. Not fortune, but solid middle class income from selling LED mouse pads to gamers. Why didn't you tell me? Remember when I tried explaining dropshipping? You said it was a pyramid scheme for people who watch too many YouTube gurus because you explained it while watching someone play Minecraft at 2:00am, her sister was reading over her shoulder. Wait, he's been running a business this whole time? Sarah scrolled through customer emails, reviews, the business registration, tax documents, everything legit, just invisible. I've been telling everyone you're unemployed. I cried to my therapist about supporting you. I know my dad offered you minimum wage out of pity. I make more than his offer in three days selling mouse pads. Her phone started buzzing, family group chat exploding as her sister shared the news. Her dad asking how online selling actually worked. Her mom confused about what dropshipping meant. Why all the secrecy, though? It wasn't supposed to be secret. But every time I tried explaining, you'd see me on the computer and assume I was wasting time. Eventually, I stopped trying.

You waited outside my math class yesterday, even though yours is across campus. You got weird when I went to Monica's sleepover without you. She crossed her arms. It's honestly embarrassing. Monica's best friend has her own life, her own friends. They're independent. You're, like, obsessed with me or something. Christina laughed. No offense, but it's giving desperate. Penny shrugged. You need to get your own life and stop making me her entire personality. I felt my face burn, but looking at Penny's expression, I realized she was serious. Had I really been that bad? After my parents divorced, penny was my rock. Maybe I'd held on too tight. Maybe I depended on her too much emotionally. I'm sorry, I said quietly. I didn't realize I was making you uncomfortable. Starting Tuesday, I gave her exactly what she asked for. No morning texts. Said they were too much. I saw her in the hallway and just smiled instead of running over. She wanted space. At lunch, I accepted the Art Girls invitation to sit with them. They've been asking for weeks, and I'd always said no to stay with penny. They were genuinely excited to have me. Finally, Lorelai said, We've been wanting to be friends forever. But you were always with penny. They were so welcoming, teaching me their inside jokes, including me in their group chat. Thursday morning hurt the most. We bought tickets together weeks ago for the school's talent show. Front row seats to support our friends band. I sat there alone, saving her seat with my backpack until the lights dimmed. She never came. During intermission, I saw her Instagram story. She was at Starbucks with Monica and Christina, laughing over Frappuccinos. The caption read, so much better than boring school events. My eyes burned with tears. I wouldn't let fall. She'd known and didn't show up. And worse, she seemed happier without me. I deleted the text I'd started typing, asking where she was. She wanted space, and clearly she was thriving with it. After the show, I joined the drama club, something penny had always made fun of. When Romeo from drama asked if I wanted to practice lines after school, I said yes. Immediately. I posted a selfie with him captioned new drama partner with heart emojis. Penny viewed it in 10 seconds, but didn't like it. Lorelai invited me to a party Friday. Penny will be there, too, she mentioned. At the party, I stayed with my new friends, but kept checking on penny discreetly. She was with Monica and Christina by the pool. When Monica loudly said, at least you finally got rid of your stalker. I pretend ended not To hear penny laughed along with them, that stung. But if that's how she felt, I'd respect it. Everything crashed down Tuesday. I was heading to art club when I heard someone crying in the bathroom. Harsh, painful sobs. My heart knew it was penny before my brain did. Soph, are you okay? I asked softly through the door. Leave me alone, Jenna. I don't want to guilt you into caring about my problems. What? Penny, please let me in. The door unlocked. I look destroyed. Mascara streaking, eyes swollen. My parents are getting divorced, she whispered. Dad's been cheating for months. I found out Sunday night. My heart broke. I pulled her into my arms, feeling her whole body shake. She told me through gasps how she'd wanted to call me Sunday night when her dad moved out, but Monica had convinced her not to be a hypocrite. How she'd seen my Instagram.

Last summer, my parents decided we needed a technology free family bonding road trip to Yellowstone. They announced this planet dinner looking way too proud of themselves. No phones, no tablets, no Nintendo Switch, dad declared. We're going to reconnect as a family and appreciate nature. My 16 year old sister Denki and I just stared at them in horror. A week long road trip with no electronics? They might as well have suggested we travel by covered wagon. But what if there's an emergency? Denki asked, already plotting. We'll have our phones for emergencies only, mom said. But they'll be locked in the glove compartment. The night before we left, Denki and I held an emergency sibling meeting. We were not going down without a fight. Operation Digital Rebellion is a go! She whispered, pulling out a duffel bag full of contraband electronics. We spent hours hiding devices throughout our luggage. Denki sown a secret pocket into her pillow for her phone. I hollered out a thick book and stuffed my Nintendo Switch inside. We even hit a portable charger inside a bag of trail mix. Day one started with Dad's enthusiastic announcement. Isn't this great, kids? Look at all this beautiful scenery. Let's play the license plate game. Wow, dad, A Nebraska plate! Riveting. Denki deadpanned while secretly texting her boyfriend through her pillow. By hour three, mom was getting suspicious because we were being unusually cooperative. About her car games. Little did she know, I was playing Pokemon under a blanket while pretending to nap. You kids seem awfully quiet back there, she said, turning around. Just enjoying the family bonding, mom, I said, quickly shoving my switch under my fake book. Denki had gotten creative with her rebellion. She downloaded audiobooks and was listening through earbuds she threaded through her hoodie strings. Every time mom asked her a question, she pretend to be deep in thought about nature. By day two, we'd established an elaborate system. Denki would be the lookout while I game, then we'd switch. We communicated through coughs and sneezes. That meant parents incoming or coast is clear. The funniest part was when dad stopped at this scenic overlook and insisted we all take a family photo. While he was setting up his camera, Denki was frantically trying to finish a level on her hidden phone game. Denki, Smile! Dad called out, just a second. I'm appreciating the natural beauty, she said, thumbs flying across her screen. Our rebellion reached peak chaos on day three when we discovered the hotel had terrible Wi-Fi. Denki had a complete meltdown because she couldn't upload her secret vacation selfies to Instagram. The bathroom has better no! She whispered to me during dinner. So there we were, taking turns hiding in the hotel bathroom, desperately trying to get one bar of service while our parents thought we had digestive issues from the road trip snacks. You Kids have been spending a lot of time in the bathroom, mom observed suspiciously. Must be all that healthy trail mix you packed, I said innocently, while Denki was literally sitting on the bathroom floor trying to connect to Wi-Fi. Day 4 brought disaster. Dad decided to surprise us with a spontaneous hike and grabbed our backpacks to carry water bottles. That's when he discovered Denki's secret phone charging station she'd set up using the car's USB port. What is this?

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

Now my, he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning, I was almost 17, practically an adult and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big twitch star. I was devastated but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house, nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise, we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, reggis, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis's Instagram on his own phone. Escape border? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Greggus. Greggus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl. He winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was, just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

Brian thought college was a four year party with a diploma handed out at the end. I was just a nerdy roommate who'd somehow help him pass his classes. We weren't paired by choice. Housing lottery put us together freshman year. The football player and the scholarship kid. From day one, he made it clear what he thought of me. Seriously? You're studying on a Friday night? He'd laugh. This is college, man. You're supposed to be making memories. His memories involved coming back at 3:00am, stumbling into my desk, and. And occasionally vomiting near my backpack. Things shifted in October when he realized he was failing economics. The coach had warned him, maintain a 2.5 GPA or get benched. Hey, you're good at this stuff, right? He dropped his textbook on my keyboard. I need help. I agreed to tutor him, explain supply and demand curves created practice problems. He nodded along, then asked, so can you just write my paper for me? I've got a game this weekend. I refused, offered to review his draft instead. He laughed like I. I told a joke. Come on, nobody will know. I'll pay you. I can't do that, I said. It's academic dishonesty. We could both get expelled. His smile faded. Whatever, man. Thought you were cool. After that, our fragile roommate peace collapsed. He'd invite friends over when I had exams. Accidentally Spill drinks on my notes, hide my alarm clock. Before important classes, I started spending more time at the library, coming back only to sleep. I was working two part time jobs alongside a full course load. Midterms came. Brian failed economic specta. Got benched for two games. One morning, I woke up to find him staring at me, eyes bloodshot. You could have helped me, he said. Now coach says I might lose my scholarship. I tried to help. I replied, you wanted me to do it for you. Then came the real breaking point. I saved for two years to buy my first car. A used Honda with 120,000 miles. Nothing fancy, but it meant I could live off campus next year. The morning after Brian received his final warning from the athletics department, I found my car with all four tires slashed. Loser scratched into the door. Windshield crack. Campus security said they couldn't.

We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth, that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them. Which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was, sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise, when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I guess I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before, because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s, and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them. Then I said if they were gonna air our family business on Facebook for everyone to see, I just avoid visits altogether from now on. Well, that got people talking. Some of their Friends started commenting asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements. Others were saying stuff like maybe there's a reason she didn't want to come home. My family looked pretty stupid, honestly. They deleted the post pretty quick after that, but the damage was done.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure. It's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. At target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited, she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes, and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. Was honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma, and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send? She whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and Muttering about how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that, with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parent choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling mom almost daily, crying about her twelve year old son, Tyler. He'd been getting into fights at school, his grades were dropping, and she'd found vape cartridges hidden in his backpack twice in the past month. The school counselor had suggested family therapy. Beth refused because she didn't want anyone thinking she couldn't handle her own kid. Mom said Beth was probably projecting her own guilt and frustration onto me because my problem was just blue hair, while her actual problem was much more serious. Next weekend, Tyler showed up at our door around dinner time looking miserable. Emma invited him to stay for tacos, and while we were eating, he started opening up. Turns out he'd been hanging with older Kids who were getting him into trouble, but he was too scared to tell his mom because she'd been so stressed lately. He said he wished his parents would let him express himself like Emma could, instead of just yelling at him for everything. After Tyler went home, Emma hugged me tight and said, thanks for letting me be myself, mom, even when Aunt Beth was being mean about it. That's when I realized the blue hair wasn't just about looking cool. It was about Emma feeling safe enough to explore who she was becoming, knowing I'd support her no matter what.

My older sister is super jumpy. Like she gets scared if the toast pops up too loud. So when I found out she'd been watching creepy sleepwalking videos all week, I saw my golden opportunity. One night I stayed up late and waited until I knew she was asleep. Then I slowly opened her bedroom door, walked in barefoot with my eyes half closed and started mumbling random garbage like the bees are listening. They can smell light. She's screamed full panic. I pretended to snap out of it like I didn't know what was going on. And the next morning I told her I had no memory of it. That's what really got her. She was convinced I was actually sleepwalking. So I did it again the next night. This time I stood at the end of her bed holding a spoon and just went spread, I am the serial. I was holding myself from bursting out laughing. After that, she started locking her door. So I got creative. I'd rattle the doorknob or just whisper her name through the air vent until she freaked out. I kept telling her I didn't remember any of it. My acting was elite. She even started filming me to prove it was real. But I would just delete the videos when she wasn't looking. It became this little war. Honestly, it was the most fun I'd had in weeks. I never Meant to actually scare her, just mess with her a little. But then one night she ran into my room looking pale and said, I need to show you something right now. I followed her down the hall thinking it was just another one of her overreactions. she opened her phone and pulled up a video from the night before. The footage showed her room in the dark and a figure slowly pushing the door open. Me or someone that looked like me. I watched the figure step into her room, stand completely still for a full minute, then start whispering. But it wasn't gibberish this time. It was my name. Over and over, whispered slowly, almost like then it tilted its head and said, I know you're awake. That's when the video cut out. I tried to laugh it off and said, okay, I admit it, that one was actually kind of good. But she didn't laugh. She looked at me and said, that wasn't from last night. That was from the night you slept over at Sam's house. My stomach dropped. I'd spent that night two neighborhoods over crashing on my friend's couch. I pulled out my own phone to double check the text. There it was, a message from me at 11:08 saying, crashing here tonight. Tell mom that video was recorded at 203:00am. I stared at the screen and tried to find some logical explanation. Maybe someone was messing with us. Maybe she faked The whole thing. But then she said, I didn't want to tell you, but a few nights ago I saw you standing in the hallway. I called your name and you didn't answer. You just walked into the bathroom and never came out. When I checked a minute later, the light was off and the room was empty. That was the part I couldn't explain because I remembered.

My parents discovered I wasn't their biological child when I was 16, not through some dramatic DNA test, through my little sister's science project. She was doing genetics homework, mapping out eye colours and couldn't make our family tree work. Brown eyes plus brown eyes can't make blue eyes, she, he said, pointing at me. Mom went white. Dad started stuttering about recessive genes. That night I heard them screaming through the walls. Mom admitted she had an affair 17 years ago. Dad wasn't my father. The man who raised me, taught me to ride a bike, helped with homework for 16 years, suddenly looked at me like I was a stranger. The change was immediate and brutal. Dad stopped coming to my baseball games. When I try talking to him, he'd respond with one word answers or just leave the room. Mom kept insisting nothing had changed, but he'd flinch whenever dad was cold to me. Then came the comparisons. Every family dinner became a catalog of how my sister and I were different. Look how naturally athletic Sophie is, dad would say, watching her throw a ball. She gets that from me. The implication hung in the air like poison. They started treating me like a house guest. My curfew got earlier while my sister stayed the same. My allowance got cut because money is tight. But Sophie got new clothes whenever she asked. When I brought it up, mom said, I Was being dramatic. The worst part was watching them rewrite history. Photos of me got moved to the back of albums. My baby pictures disappeared from the mantle. Dad started telling stories about Sophie's milestones while pretending mine never happened. It was like they were erasing 16 years. My breaking point came during Christmas. Extended family was over and Uncle Mike asked about my college plans. Dad said, well, he's not really academic like Sophie. Different genetics, you know, he said genetics like it was a dirty word. That's when it clicked. Didn't just learn I wasn't blood related. They decided I wasn't family. So I made a choice that destroyed them. I found my biological father. His name was John Sins. He lived three states away, had no idea I existed. When I called him, he cried, actually cried. Said he'd wondered about my mom for years, hoped she was happy. Two weeks later, John drove 400 miles to meet me. He brought photo albums of his family, told me about my half brother who played baseball like me, showed me pictures of my real grandmother who had died the year before. But here's what broke my parents. John didn't just accept me, he celebrated me. Within a month, he'd driven back twice more. He came to my games, met my friends, me car shopping for my 17th birthday. My parents watched this man give me everything they taken away. Dad became obsessed, calling John a stranger, trying to Steal his son. Mom begged me to stop seeing him, said it was destroying our family. I told them they'd already destroyed it. The night they decided biology mattered more than 16 years of love. The final blow came at graduation. Both my family showed up. John sat in the front road.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They were sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. She cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

The only reason he even volunteered for the camping trip was to co chaperone with the beautiful Ms. Dizon. But of course, don't let his wife know, right? So while he was there trying to impress her with his wilderness expertise, a baby bear cub wandered into our campsite, sniffing around me and the other students. He stumbled back and pointed at it. Mister V, there's a bear! He yelled in a high pitched voice. Mister IV looked over and laughed at our worried expression. Are you seriously scared of a little moving build? A bear? It's smaller than my Labrador. He walked over and picked up the cub on the back of its neck and held it up like a stop animal, winking at Miss I Dizon. See? You kids need to toughen up when we get back to school. 10 laps, all of you! He laughed as the cub cried and squealed before kicking it into the bushes. There, done. Now everyone go to bed. When we tried to say something, he cut us off. Anyone who disrupts adult conversation gets detention for a week. He turned to Miss Dizon, who was sitting by the fire. These city kids are so dramatic. Wanna check out the stars by the lake? Better view away from all these tents. Giggled and stood up. Lead the way. When they were gone, all of us looked at each other. With wide eyes, we all knew something bad was going to happen. I hate to be the bringer of bad news, Daphne said, cutting through the tension, but didn't our biology teacher warn us that a baby bear always mean the mother is nearby? Another kid with glasses nodded. My uncle survived a bear attack and told us never to mess with a cub. So what should we do? While we all stood there trying to figure out what to do, the smart kid Alex, started moving all our food and coolers to an empty tent opposite from where we were sleeping. Are you guys gonna help or what? We practically sprang into action, carrying all our snacks into the same tent, filling it up like we were making an offering to some local deity. Mr. V snuck up on us and yelled, what are you doing with all the food? Alex tried to explain, but Mr. V cut him off. I've had enough of this bear talk from you guys! One more word and I swear you'll be hearing from the principal. Just as he marched off, we heard the baby cubs cries suddenly returned, like it was getting closer to the camp again. Two girls who had been away ran towards our group, completely out of breath. We just went through the creepiest thing. We heard heavy breathing, branches breaking, and I swear something was looking at me from the trees. I followed them to where they were. And found huge tracks and claw marks on trees. My heart suddenly raced. We gotta go! We sprinted back with the rest of the group and made a quick plan. You two grab the keys to the cars and buses. The rest of you warn the teachers. I'll finish putting the food in the tent. Act fast! Kids shouldn't worry so much. Mr. V has everything under control. She giggled, watching him do one handed push UPS to show off his physique. But the bear! They yelled out, watching Eddie sneak the car keys and Mr. V's phone into his back pocket. Mr. V got up and glared at the class. Alright, you asked for it. Detention! Just as he yelled it out, a deeper growl made everyone freeze. Almost like the Jurassic Park scene, but much, much worse in person. A massive mama bear crashed into our campsite, looking absolutely furious. Let's go! Eddie screamed, leading all the students towards the vehicles. Mister V stuck his head out of his tent. Hey! Where do you guys think you're going? Oh holy mother of Bear! Mister V sprinted out in his flip flops and tripped, face planting into the dirt. Miss Dyson didn't even stop to help him up, just ran right past and ran to the bus with all the kids. The bear ripped the Mister tense apart before turning her head and charging towards Mister V. Eddie and I quickly started the engine on both vehicles and set Off the alarms and high beams, hoping the bear would leave, Mister V scrambled towards the camp bathroom, locking himself.

I recently started working at a cafe to support myself through university and almost everything is fine. But it's very obvious that my coworker Melanie doesn't like me. Her biggest issue with me is that I speak multiple languages and she hates when I interact with customers in their native language, always saying something like, speak English, they'll understand you or why are you being so extra? Even though I know it makes them comfortable when I speak to them in their native language. I come from Central Europe and in my home country it is mandatory to learn multiple languages in school. I know English, Spanish, German and Dutch, though my accent is very obvious when I speak. The town the cafe is in gets a lot of tourists so I always switch to the language the customer is speaking in if I know it. This has never been a problem until Melanie heard me speaking in a different language and accused me of being spoiled and a privileged little white girl. She told me average people don't speak nor get to learn so many languages and that my daddy's money paid for it. I told her that my family is actually really poor and I never even met my father. But either way, she didn't have A right to speak to me that way. She always tried to pick a fight with me over this. And when I asked a coworker of ours why she reacted that way, they admitted that they suspect she's racist since she said she felt cheated that I hadn't told her I'm polish. Every chance Melanie gets, she tells me that it's disgusting, how I am refusing to see my privilege and how I shouldn't be learning how to speak with local accents because it's verging on appropriation. I only ever saw her at work because I would never willingly hang out with her after everything she said to me. But one night I was invited to go out with my co workers and I didn't realize that Melanie had also been invited. I tried my best to avoid her and just stuck next to Mark, one of my co workers that I have a crush on. We were basically with each other all night and barely interacted with the rest of the group. Mark also speaks Spanish and I caught myself throwing in random Spanish words in our conversation. He laughed about how I sounded like a TV character who would say I Karamba out of nowhere. And I felt like we were really bonding over this simple thing. There I say he liked me back. It wasn't until days later that I found out Melanie also had a crush on Mark, which would explain her actions throughout the night. We started playing games at some point and Melanie asked me about the languages I spoke. She pretended to be impressed when I told her and pulled out Google Translate, of all things, to ask me questions in the languages I mentioned. I answered every single one. And when she switched to Spanish, I saw a light bulb flicker in her head. I didn't know what that was about at the time, but it turns out she thought I was showing off by speaking Spanish to Mark and wanted to embarrass me. When I answered in Spanish, she stopped me mid sentence and told me she couldn't believe how bad my pronunciation was. She laughed at me and tried to get others to join in, but it was just very awkward. She told me that after hearing my English, she thought my Spanish would be better. Mark and I just looked at each other very confused. I said my pronunciation wasn't wrong. I just Learned Spanish by watching Argentinean soap operas. That's why my accent sounds the way it does. She told me to stop lying and to just admit that it wasn't good. But Mark chimed in and told her that I did, in fact, speak with said accent and it's not wrong. My Spanish was excellent. Melanie told him that he didn't have to pretend to not hurt my feelings, that I had to accept that I'm not good at everything. I was baffled. I burst out laughing. And I can tell she was pissed. I said she shouldn't speak about things she knows nothing about and that she was being an a hole. I went home after that and Mark actually walked me home. He kept my mind off the entire situation and just talked about random things. Talking to him felt so natural that I asked if he wanted to talk more in my apartment. One thing LED to another and I can say for sure that he does like me back. The next day, Melanie came over to my house to apologize for her behavior, though it was hardly an apology.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They were sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. She cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

The only reason he even volunteered for the camping trip was to co chaperone with the beautiful Miss Dizon. But of course, don't let his wife know, right? So while he was there trying to impress her with his wilderness expertise, a baby bear cub wandered into our campsite. Sniffing around me and the other students, he stumbled back and pointed at it. Mr v, there's a bear, he yelled in a high pitched voice. Mr IV looked over and laughed at our worried expression. Are you seriously scared of a little moving build a bear? It's smaller than my Labrador. He walked over and picked up the cub on the back of its neck and held it up like a stop animal, winking at Miss I Dazon. See you kids need to toughen up when we get back to school. 10 laps, all of you. He laughed as the cub cried and squealed before kicking it into the bushes. There done. Now everyone go to bed. When we try to say something, he cut us off. Anyone who disrupt adult conversation gets detention for a week. He turned to Miss Dazon who was sitting by the fire. These city kids are so dramatic. Wanna check out the stars by the lake? Better view away from all these tents. I giggled and stood up lead the way. When they were gone, all of us looked at each Other with wide eyes, we all knew something bad was going to happen. I hate to be the bringer of bad news, Daphne said, cutting through the tension. But didn't our biology teacher warn us that a baby bear always mean the mother is nearby? Another kid with glasses nodded, my uncle survived a bear attack and told us never to mess with a cub. So what should we do? While we all stood there trying to figure out what to do, the smart kid Alex started moving all our food and coolers to an empty tent opposite from where we were sleeping. Are you guys gonna help or what? We practically sprang into action carrying all our snacks into the same tent, filling it up like we were making an offering to some local deity. Mr V snuck up on us and yelled, what are you doing with all the food? Alex tried to explain, but Mr V cut him off. I've had enough of this bear talk from you guys. One more word and I swear you'll be hearing from the principal. Just as he marched off, we heard the baby cubs cries suddenly returned like it was getting closer to the camp again. Two girls who had been away ran towards our group completely out of breath. We just went through the creepiest thing. We heard heavy breathing, branches breaking and I swear something was looking at me from the trees. I followed them to where they Were and found huge tracks and claw marks on trees.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever, she makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realise immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 and a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until. Eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay.

When I had a seizure during parent teacher conferences and the paramedic found college applications in my backpack. I was 11. I woke up to machines beeping. Hospital again. My parents faces were white with terror. Oh, thank god. Mom sobbed. You stopped breathing, doctor. These held up papers covered in my handwriting. These fell out when we were checking vitals. Why? Princeton's biomedical program aligns with my 17 years of life experience. Care to explain? My heart monitor spiked. It would kill me. Literally. I was helping my sister edit. Editing? He showed another page. This is your handwriting across 16 different essays. SAT prep notes, A P, chemistry formulas. His voice hardened. When do you sleep? 4 to 7:00am, I whispered. Mom gasped. Three hours, sometimes two. Jada needs her assignments by midnight so she can copy them in her handwriting for morning submission. How long? Dad's voice was deadly quiet. Since she got into private school two years ago. The doctor pulled up my medical records. That explains the weight loss, malnutrition, three previous ER visits for exhaustion you said were playground accidents. She made me promise. She made you? Mom's voice cracked. How the words tumbled out. She has videos of me praying at Grandpa's grave, begging him to come back. She added circus music, labeling it psycho brother talks to dirt. Said she'd make sure every kid at school sees Me as the freak who kisses headstones. That's not all. I continued shaking. She found Mom's antidepressants. Took pictures of me holding them. Said she tell everyone I was stealing drugs, that I was a lunatic doctor. They sat down hard. This is blackmail! Criminal blackmail! She's just stressed about school. Stop defending her! Dad exploded his fist, slammed the wall, leaving a dent. I've never seen him shake with rage before. You're in the hospital. The doctor pulled up more tests. Cortisol levels are dangerously high. Blood pressure of a 40 year old executive. You've developed an ulcer. You're 11 years old. Burning out like a Wall Street banker. But her scholarship is based on fraud, mom said quietly. The same mom who once grounded Jada for three months for a B+ in math. Who installed life three 60 on both our phones. Where is she? During all this homework time? I went silent. Peter's apartment. The college boy who bought her alcohol. Who she lost her virginity to last month. While I wrote her valedictorian speech. Speech about integrity with study group. I lied. Doctor Thies's phone rang. Hello? Missus of lunar? Yes, he's awake. He listened. Face darkening. Bring everything. My teacher arrived with a box. Hundreds of papers. All Jada's assignments, all my handwriting. I ran them through plagiarism software. She said they match essays. This 11 year old submitted to youth writing contests. Been using his own brilliant work for her assignments. Jada burst in her Private school uniform. Perfect. Why was I pulled from practice? Sit down, dad commanded. Is the little faker seriously getting attention again? Fake Aker! Mom stood. He just had a seizure. From doing your homework? Jada rolled her eyes. So dramatic. Just like when Grandpa died. I flinched, she smirked. Mrs. Lunar spread out the papers. Two years of academic fraud. Every single assignment. So what? I'm utilizing him. Utilizing? Mrs. Lunar's voice shook. Essay is about chemical engineering. This one is your personal essay to Princeton. Jada started to yell. He's getting exposure to advanced topics. I'm basically homeschooling him. You're exploiting him, dad said quietly. Jada laughed. Please. Without my guidance, he never push himself. I give him deadlines, structure, purpose. I'm practically doing him a favor. A favor? Mom held up his medical chart. Ulcers, malnutrition. Three hospitalizations, now a seizure. He's always been weak. Essay about your grandfather's death. You submitted his pain as your own, missus alooner interrupted. Grandpa loved me more anyway, Jada said coldly. Her principal arrived within the hour. We have two options. Press criminal charges for fraud and blackmail, or academic expulsion with permanent record. I don't want to hurt her. You're ruining my life! Jada lunged at me. Security held her back as she screamed. I should have destroyed you when I had the chance. Why? I asked, tears streaming. I'm your brother. You're nothing. A tool!

Two years later, I walked into his family's house as his brother's fiance. It was the last day of high school senior year, the day I planned on confessing my feelings to my childhood friend Jeremy. Before I could, Taylor, the pretty senior everyone wanted to date, cornered me by my locker after third period. Her smile was sweet, laced with bitterness. You need to stop hovering around Jeremy, she said, flipping her gorgeous blonde hair over her shoulder. He doesn't want you around. I felt my cheeks burn. Yes, he does. We're friends. He doesn't mind it. Oh, let's go ask him. Before I could protest, she grabbed my wrist and dragged me across the cafeteria where Jeremy sat with his basketball teammates. Everyone was watching. She dropped my arm by the entrance and hopped over to them. My heart pounded as she put on her sweetest voice, practically purring as she leaned against his chair. Hey, I've been wondering, she said, playing with his shoulder, is Sarah your girlfriend or what? Everyone at that table laughed. Sarah, the nerd with the braces? Are you dating her, man? One of his teammates asked. I would never go out with her, he said, loud enough for the nearby tables to hear. We're not even friends. She just likes doing homework. Oh, that's cold, they said, bursting into laughter. Taylor glanced back at me with a smirk that said everything. I Ran straight to the bathroom, where I locked myself in stall and cried until my eyes were too swollen to hide. Ever since we were little, we've been best friends. We studied together, played together, went on family trips. We even made matching friendship bracelets. Camp. And the way he looked at me when it was just the two of us. I really thought he'd fallen for me, too. But after that day in the cafeteria, I disappeared from his life completely. I took different hallways to avoid him. I ate lunch in the library. I stopped coming to Sunday dinners, telling my mom I had too much homework. He started dating Taylor the day after, hurting me. Eventually, I had the courage to return all of his stuff. Everything he had given me over the years. I made sure to go when he'd be at practice. But when I walked into their garage, his older brother Connor was under the hood of a car, our sleeves rolled up, grease covering his arms. Hey, Sarah, he said, sliding out from under the car. Haven't seen you around lately. You okay? I felt tears build up from his warm question. Just returning everything. He smiled. I'm proud of you. Oh, hey, actually, before you leave, do you mind helping me with something here? Your hands are a lot smaller than mine. I know. He stood behind me, guiding my hand gently into the engine bay. Just feel for the loose bolt. For me? What's this part do? I asked. His face lit up. You actually want to know? He stood there explaining how engines worked, completely nerding out while I still awkwardly had my hand on the bolt. I laughed loudly. Hey, before you continue, mind telling me what else I'm supposed to do with this? Oh, sorry! He yelled. We spent the rest of the time having fun, talking about cars and his dream to open a shop. And I found myself coming back again and again when Jeremy wasn't home. Six months later, we were dating, both enrolled in trade school, both building something real together. After trade school and a year year of flipping cars, we opened our first shop. With both families investing, the business exploded through word of mouth. Halfway through the year, we'd expanded to three bays with a waiting list for appointments. Meanwhile, Jeremy was overwhelmed. Ever since Taylor got pregnant, he had to juggle college classes with two part time jobs, all while she showed up on campus accusing him of cheating with imaginary college girls, tracking his location.

When my daughter was three years old, instead of teaching her the word look, I taught her the word behold. And so from that day on, every time she wanted to show me something, she tug my arm and say, daddy, daddy, behold. My wife and I thought it was extremely funny and innocent. And it was. Until it wasn't. Fast forward a few weeks. My daughter and I were grocery shopping, and as I was picking out some apples, my daughter started tugging my arm. Daddy, daddy, behold the vegetable. She then pointed at a man in a wheelchair 20 feet away. My jaw dropped and I started laughing my head off. I knew I shouldn't laugh, but hearing my four year old daughter say that combination of words sent me into hysterics. Well, the man turned his head directly at me. He saw me laughing my butt off, all while my daughter was pointing straight at him. He gave me a dirty look and rolled away. And when he did, I felt so embarrassed. I turned to my daughter, who was very confused about what was so funny, and I told her she couldn't point at disabled people or call them that word. What's a disabled person? She innocently asked me. Don't play dumb with me, Missy. I responded, no, I'm serious, daddy. I was a little taken aback. Well, a person in a wheelchair, Is called a disabled person, and the word vegetable should never be used when talking about them. Got it? She nodded. Okay, daddy, but I didn't mean behold the disabled person. I mean behold the vegetables. She then pointed in the same direction she did previously, but now, with the man gone, it was obvious that the whole time she had been pointing at the vegetable aisle.

Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. Terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk type something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beep machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

Everyone knew Gabby was more than just our big sister. She became our mom the day ours died. When she was 18, Gabby taught my brother how to shave, stayed up all night when my youngest sister had nightmares, and somehow made four teenagers feel safe in a world that had just collapsed. But last Thanksgiving changed everything forever. Gabby had been trying to have a baby for three years. At 38, her doctor said IVF was her only shot, but insurance wouldn't cover it at $15,000 per round. She called a family meeting after Sunday dinner, her hands shaking as she explained, I've never asked you guys for anything, but I need help. I know it's a lot of money. We all said we'd figure it out together. Everyone hugged her that night. Liam said, of course we'll help. You deserve this. Becca literally cried, saying, I've always wanted to be an aunt. Kelsey promised to set up a payment plan for all of us. Gabby was glowing. This was her dream. She booked the appointment for next month, texting us, they need the deposit Tuesday at three PM. We can all meet there. Everyone responded with thumbs up and heart emojis. She started a spreadsheet showing how if each of us contributed $3,000, she could start treatment next month. She sent us IVF success stories and potential baby names. Even asked Becca to be be her Birth partner. But then Liam bought a new BMW. That week, Becca booked a month long Europe trip with her husband. Kelsey renovated her entire kitchen. Gabby saw everything, but stayed quiet. Tuesday, I got to the clinic at 2:45 with $2,000 all I could scrape together. Gabby was already there, dressed up, smiling while clutching her purse. They're coming, right? She kept asking. 3 p m. Past 3:34 p m. She kept calling. No answer. The clinic closed. I held her hand as she had to cancel the appointment. Liam texted the group chat first. Can't swing it right now. Tight month. Becca same. Sorry. Kelsey just sent a sad face emoji. Gabby replied, I understand. And nothing else. Later that night, I found her on the floor, sobbing in the nursery. She'd already started decorating, holding the baby clothes she bought on sale. She didn't know I could see her from the hallway as she saw into a tiny yellow onesie that said, worth the wait. I held her as she shook. I really thought they'd come, she whispered. Two months later, at Mom's death anniversary dinner, Gabby brought it up one last time. She'd found a clinic that offered payment plans and only needed $2,000 from each of us to start. I'm running out of time, she said quietly. Please, I've never asked for anything else. I laughed. Gabby, maybe motherhood just isn't meant for you. I mean, you've never even been married. Liam nodded. Yeah, and You already raised us. Isn't that enough for you? Kelsey added. It's kind of selfish to bring a kid into the world alone at your age. Gabby's face went completely blank. She slowly looked at each of us. Selfish, Gabby whispered. Then louder. Selfish! She stood up and walked to her bedroom, returning with a large photo album I'd never seen before. She started pulling out birthday cards, dozens of them, spreading them across the table. Liam, your 18th birthday. Read what you wrote. Liam's face reddened as Gabby read it aloud. Gabby, you saved my life. I owe you everything. Every penny I ever make, I owe to you. She grabbed another. Becca, your college graduate

When Uncle Ray died last month, I thought I'd maybe get his old fishing gear or some random furniture. I was his only niece who actually visited him, bringing him groceries and cleaning his tiny apartment every week. He always seemed grateful, but never talked much about family drama or money. The lawyer called me down to his office on a rainy Tuesday. I sat in this fancy leather chair while he read through the will. Most of it was boring legal stuff about bank accounts and his beat up Honda. Then he reached into a locked drawer and pulled out a metal box. Your uncle left specific instructions for this, he said, sliding it across the desk. Inside was a small black pistol wrapped in cloth, along with registration papers showing it was legally his. Underneath was a handwritten note and Uncle Ray's messy writing. Don't trust him. Check the basement, R. I had no idea what that meant. Don't trust who? Uncle Ray lived alone and barely talked to anyone except me and his neighbor, Missus Chen, who brought him soup sometimes. The lawyer said he couldn't explain anything more, just that I was supposed to get the gun and note exactly as written. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the basement thing. Uncle Ray's apartment was on the first floor of this old duplex, but there was A basement that the landlord used for storage. I'd never been down there, but Uncle Ray had mentioned it once when his water heater broke. I decided to drive over the next day. The building looked different in daylight, more run down than I remembered. I found the landlord, this guy named Pete, who I'd met once when Uncle Ray was having plumbing issues. He seemed nervous when I asked about going to the basement. Your uncle was always complaining about noises down there, Pete said. Jangling his keys. Probably just rats or something. But when he opened the basement door, I could tell something was wrong. There were fresh footprints in the dust boxes. That looks like they've been moved recently. In the back corner, behind the water heater, I found a loose floorboard. When I pried it up, there was a plastic bag with photos inside. They showed Pete going through Uncle Ray's apartment when Ray wasn't home. In one picture, Pete was clearly looking through Ray's mail. In another, he was at Ray's computer. I confronted Pete upstairs, and his whole story fell apart. Turns out he'd been stealing from elderly tenants for years. He would copy their keys, go through their stuff when they were out, and even steal their identity information. Uncle Ray had figured it out and started taking pictures from his window. Pete got angry and started moving toward me. But then I remembered the gun in my car. I didn't pull it. Out or anything, but knowing I had it made me feel safer. I told Pete I was calling the cops, and he better not follow me. The police found way more evidence in Pete's apartment. Bank statements, stolen mail, even credit cards belonging to other tenants. Uncle Ray had been building a case against him, but died before he could report it. The craziest part. Uncle Ray had been slowly moving his valuable stuff to a storage unit because he knew Pete was watching him. The gun wasn't just for Protection. It was his way of making sure I'd be safe when I discovered the truth. I still have that gun locked away safely.

I smiled. I haven't heard of that one. Her words slurred from the laughing gas. It's when we hear daddy's car and everyone freezes like statues. My hygienist, Sierra, raised an eyebrow. That sounds interesting. How do you play? When we hear the garage, Mommy says statue time and we all freeze wherever we are, Isabella explained drowsily. Even if I'm eating or playing, everything stops. That's when I noticed the faint yellow marks on her upper arm, mostly hidden by her sleeve. Sometimes I'm really good at it. Last week I held my spoon in the air for 20 whole minutes. She seemed proud. Mommy said I was the best statue ever. Twenty minutes is a long time, I said, gently adjusting her sleeve to see better. Fingerprint bruises? Old ones. Can you raise your arm for me, sweetie? I need to adjust the chair. As she raised both arms, her shirt rode up. Linear marks crossed her lower back, some scarred, some fresh. What happens if someone moves during statue time? I kept working, acting like I was just doing my job. That's losing. Daddy doesn't like when we lose. I excused myself to get a different tool, stepping to my computer to pull up our mandatory reporting protocols. When I returned, I asked casually, and if you win the statue game? If we're all good statues, daddy walks through and goes To his room. Then we can breathe normal again. Sometimes he even says good job. And we get to eat dinner. You get to eat dinner? Only if we win. Losers don't deserve dinner. But mommy sneaks me crackers later. I made a show of checking Isabella's chart while secretly measuring the bruise patterns with my pen light. 3 2 cm spread on the grip marks. Adult male hand size. Isabella, what other games does your family play? I asked. Oceaning my hygiene to discreetly check on the father. The listening game, where he asks questions and we have to answer exactly right. I pulled out my light. Open wide again. What kind of questions? Like who's the most important person in this house? The answer is always daddy. The light revealed slight scarring on her inner cheek, likely from biting during stress. What happens when someone gets the answer wrong? Sometimes no breakfast or lunch. My tummy hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse. My least favorite one is the quiet room. I set down my tools. Tell me about this quiet room. While I set up this X ray. I positioned the lead apron, noting how she winced when I touched her shoulders. It's the closet under the stairs. No light. We stay until we're sorry enough. I count to know how long I lasted. My record is 10,000 seconds. It's yours. The excitement in her voice broke my heart. That was over two and a half Hours. That's a lot of counting, Sierra returned, mouthing. Her dad's asking how much longer you'll be. Mommy went in there last week, Isabella continued. She had to fold up real small cause she's bigger. Daddy said she forgot who pays the bills. Sometimes I hear her crying in there, but I can't help or I go in, too. We Learned that rule the hard way. I took the X rays, handed her some stickers, and said, I need to develop these. Sierra will stay with you in the hallway. I called CPS from my cell. Active abuse case. Child has physical marks. Describes systematic torture disguised as games. Father is in waiting room. Returning, I pretended to review her chart. Isabella, has anyone else seen you play these games? No. Oh, silly. It's a family secret. Daddy says other people wouldn't understand our special rules. I gently examined her neck, finding more old bruises hidden by her hair. Does your teacher know about the statue game? No. We're really good at keeping secrets. Paul's getting good, too. He hasn't cried in the quiet room for three weeks. He's only six. The neighbors called the police once about the screaming. Now he just hits his head against the wall, but real soft. So no

My dad banned me from the internet completely. No computer, no tablet, no phone with data. At 17, I was the only kid writing papers on a typewriter. When I tried using a library computer for two minutes to check college applications, Dad's tracking apps alerted him instantly. Scream so loud on the phone that everyone stared. The librarian asked me to leave. He reported my friend's mom to child services after she let me use their laptop. The investigation took three months. I wasn't allowed at their house anymore. Dad smiled when I told him. Another bad influence eliminated. My aunt visited for Thanksgiving. She watched me handwriting a 20 page paper, and something changed in her face. After dinner, she pulled me into the bathroom and locked the door. Your dad just started new arthritis medication, she whispered, hands shaking. It's called meloxicam. My dispatch center has had three emergency calls this month. Severe allergic reactions to this exact medication. One man died in his kitchen. She pulled out an old tablet. For reading only, she said loudly, then grabbed my shoulders. I've downloaded everything you need. Medical guides, emergency protocols. All offline so he can't track it. She made me look directly at her. If someone's allergic to meloxicam, and it happens fast, 10 to 15 minutes after taking it, their throat swells from the inside, like a balloon inflating in their windpipe. You have five minutes from the First symptom to complete airway closure. She described what I'd see. Red welts spreading like spilled paint. Lips puffing out. The tongue swelling so big it pushes out of their mouth. The person's face turns purple while they claw at their throat. They can't scream because their vocal cords are swelling shut. Just this horrible whistling sound that gets quieter until it stops. Every morning at 5:00am, while dad did his workout, I hid under my blanket, studying that tablet. The photos made me sick. Faces so swollen they didn't look human. Purple lips, eyes bulging from pressure. I read about how people waste time during anaphylaxis. They look for car keys, thinking they can drive themselves. They call relatives instead of 9 1 1. By the time they realize they're dying, their throat is too swollen to speak. Die holding their phones, unable to give their address. I practiced dialing 9 1 1 in my head over and over. Anaphylaxis. Medication, allergy. Send epinephrine. Short sentences, clear information. I memorized it like a prayer. Tuesday morning, dad took his arthritis pill with orange juice. I watched him swallow it and check the clock. Ten minutes later, he started scratching his neck. Turn down the heat, he said. But I can see my breath in the kitchen. He kept scratching harder. Red welts spread up from his collar. His lips started puffing out. He touched them with confusion that turned to fear. When he stood, his chair crashed backward. He Pointed at his throat and tried to speak, but only horrible wheezing came out. His tongue was swelling, pushing out of his mouth. He lunged for the landline and put it to his ear. Nothing. He clicked the receiver frantically. Still dead. He hadn't paid the Bill in two months. Because landlines are scams. His cell phone was upstairs, charging. The realization hit him. We had no way to call for help. His face was turning purple. Hives erupted everywhere. He dropped to his knees with both hands around his throat. The wheezing was getting quieter. That whistling sound aunt warned me about. He pointed down desperately at his car keys, tried to stand, but his legs gave out. He crashed into the table and plates shattered. Then he was crawling toward the door. He made it five feet before collapsing face first. His lips were dark blue, the whistling almost gone. He rolled onto his back and his eyes found mine. Pure terror. My father. Who

They sent this email at like, 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like, 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my step brother's girlfriend, Ashley. He doesn't work, just sits around all day while my step brother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, the whole designer purse collection. It's been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years, but whatever. I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200, six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked? A day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my step brother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My step brother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency! My babysitter bailed and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the day. The typing bubbles appear and Disappear, like, five times, then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. I just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me.

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down, until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. The path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pandemic. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept Pushing to work at my house until I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. Said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really, I just didn't want to trap him in a car with my. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space. It took me, like 10 seconds to realize those white things were actual walls that didn't have brown roach stains, water damage, black streaks from whatever gross fungus was eating our house from the inside. His kitchen had a table with nothing on it, just empty space where people could put plates and eat food like normal people. When he opened a cabinet, there were dishes stacked all neat. Instead of falling out in this avalanche of broken stuff and mouse poop, he pulled out two clean glasses without having to wash them first or check for dead bugs inside. The refrigerator opened without having to throw your whole body against it because the seal wasn't Broken from years of nasty inside were leftovers in containers with actual lids, and vegetables that were green like they're supposed to be instead of brown liquid in plastic bags. The milk was just milk, not chunks floating in yellow water. When he said, god, my mom is such a neat freak. It's honestly embarrassing how she makes me clean my room every single day while pointing at a bedroom that looked like something from a movie, I made this weird choking sound like an animal being strangled. I started crying so hard I puked on his clean carpet. He got me water in a glass that didn't even have gross film on it and helped me to his bathroom where I could wash my face in a sink that was white, not brown. The sink had regular water that didn't smell like rotten eggs. I finally stopped crying. He just said, you can come here whenever you need to without asking why. Seeing a normal house made me completely lose it. When his mom drove me home later, I tried to get her to stop at the corner, but she insisted on taking me to my actual house because it was getting dark. When we pulled up to my place, I saw Parker and his mom staring at the newspapers covering every window. From inside, they saw all of the shopping carts my mother stole from grocery stores rusted and piled in the yard, and the dead tree covered In moldy plastic bags she hung to dry so she could use them again, even though they were covered in mold and bird crap. Parker's mom tried to hide it, but I could see she was horrified. Parker grabbed my arm before I got out and whispered, my mom says you can stay at our house whenever you need to. And I knew they understood everything without me having to. I thanked them both and ran inside, being careful to not open the door enough for them to see the disaster inside. That night, while my mother was passed out, I started with one corner of my room and filled a trash bag with obvious garbage, including food wrappers from when I was in elementary school and tissues so old they turned to dust when I touched them. My mother screamed at me when she noticed things were missing, but I kept going. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more!

All communication through my lawyer. I replied, understood. Then I canceled all her credit cards and cut financial support. Three days later, her lawyer called, panicking. Tuesday afternoon, buried in work, my phone buzzed. The message for my wife, Amber was brutal. Leonardo, I want a divorce. All future communication through my lawyer, Mr. Morgan. Fifteen years of marriage ended with a single text. We had dinner the night before and talked weekend plans. Nothing suggested this. I stared at the message for five minutes while shock, hurt and anger swirled beneath. But cold clarity emerged. She set the terms. Lawyers only, I replied. Understood. Practicality took over, since legal channels meant informal arrangements were void. She had supplementary cards on my accounts with authorized user status, not joint ownership. Thirty minutes of clicking. Credit cards canceled, monthly allowance stopped, Netflix and prime, logged out with passwords changed. The car she drives is leased in my name, and her gas card was tied to the canceled credit card. Not revenge, just accepting the new reality. She dictated. Her lawyer's details arrived an hour later. I forwarded them to Miss Luna, the best divorce attorney my colleague recommended. Went home to an empty house. She packed while I worked. Friday afternoon, unknown number calls. Is this Leonardo? Sharp VOICE speaking. This is Mr. Morgan. I represent Amber. My client is experiencing difficulties. Her cards declined. Funds cut off abruptly. I kept my voice level. Mister Morgan, my wife demanded divorce Tuesday, stating all communication must go through you. I complied. Informal financial arrangements ceased. Long pause. She needs funds now. Accommodation. Accommodation? Where is she staying? You acted in bad faith, cutting her off without warning. Mister Morgan, my wife ended our marriage via text and established the lawyer's only rule. Financial support will be determined legally, not by frantic calls over declined cards. My client seeks emergency financial relief. Her prerogative. Direct all filings to my attorney. Miss Luna. Conversation concluded per my wife's directive. Good day. Heart pounding as I hung up. She wanted cold and legal. She's getting it. Exactly. Within hours. Amber's best friend Haley called, furious. What the hell, Leonardo? Amber's on my couch. You cut her off completely? Haley, Amber demanded divorce via text. Lawyers only. I respected her wishes. You know she barely works. How can she survive? She hired a lawyer before talking to me. Process she chose. This is cruel. After 15 years following her exact instructions. I would have discussed things amicably if she hadn't nuked our marriage via text. And immediately lawyer up. She'll take you for everything. Haley spat. She can try. Everything goes through legal channels now. The emergency support hearing came three weeks later. Amber looks stressed, avoiding my gaze. Mr. Morgan argued she was destitute, victimized by my actions. Miss Luna calmly presented the divorce text and bank statements showing I canceled supplementary access after receiving divorce demands. Proof I still paid mortgage, utilities, insurance. The kicker evidence of Amber attempting to drain a forgotten joint savings account with $500. Trying to work around the legal process she demanded. Judge wasn't buying the victim narrative. Asked Amber directly why no prior discussion before texting divorce demands. She mumbled about being intimidated. Judge seemed skeptical. Result? Temporary support ordered closer to our figure than their astronomical demands.

So my husband, Jake, has this thing where he thinks he knows everything about cars, like everything. He grew up working on engines with his dad and acts like that makes him some kind of expert mechanic. The problem is, he's not. Last Tuesday, I was driving home from work in my Honda Civic when I started hearing this weird grinding noise from the front wheels. It wasn't super loud, but it was definitely there. I pulled into our driveway and told Jake about it right away. He barely looked up from his phone. It's probably just your brake squeaking. They do that sometimes. I told him it didn't sound like squeaking. It sounded more like metal grinding against metal and it was getting worse. He rolled his eyes. Babe, I've been working on cars since I was 12. Trust me, it's fine. The next morning, same thing. The grinding was even louder now, especially when I turned left. I told Jake again and this time he actually came outside to listen. He had me start the car and drive it around the block while he stood there with his arms crossed like some kind of professional. When I got back, he shook his head, see, nothing, you're being paranoid. But I wasn't being paranoid. Thursday morning on my way to work, the grinding was so loud, other drivers were looking at me at red lights. I called Jake, during my lunch break, I'm taking the car to a mechanic after work. Something is seriously wrong. He got annoyed. Don't waste our money on some guy who's gonna try to sell you stuff you don't need. I'm telling you, the car is fine. Friday morning, I was driving to pick up groceries when it happened. I was turning left into the parking lot when the grinding turned into this horrible screeching sound. And then the car just started pulling hard to the right. I had to grip the steering wheel with both hands to keep it straight. My heart was pounding as I managed to park. I called Jake immediately. Something just happened with the car. I think the wheel bearing went out or something. He sighed like I was bothering him. You probably just hit a pothole wrong. Drive it home and I'll look at it this weekend. I, I told him I didn't think it was safe to drive. He said, it's fine. Cars don't just break down like that. That's when I hung up and called my mom. My mom has never claimed to know anything about cars, but she has common sense. I, I told her what was happening, and she didn't hesitate. Don't drive that car anywhere. Call a tow truck and get it to a mechanic right now. I'll pay for it if Jake gives you grief. The mechanic took one look at my car and his face got serious. Ma'am, you're Lucky you didn't crash. Your front wheel bearing completely failed. If you'd kept driving on this, the wheel could have locked up or even come off while you were on the highway. The repair cost 600 bucks.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the Pretty Pictures doesn't count as being familiar with Art, Sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining. Though honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and squeezed harder. What am I keeping you from taking selfies? This is exactly why serious collectors hate these events. Girls like you come for the free alcohol and to hunt for sugar daddies. You're polluting the space where real art appreciation happens. He waved at a security guard. She's drunk. And her

That's funny. I set her down on the lawn where the paramedics were waiting. I'm serious. I wanna go back. She tried to stand up, but her legs were shaky from smoke inhalation. Why would you wanna do that? I pulled off my helmet, confused by her urgency. I left my family in there. Her eyes were wild with panic. Excuse me. What? I grabbed my radio immediately. I have to go back. I left my family in there. She was crying now and trying to push past me toward the burning house. I called for backup while physically blocking her path. The house was fully engulfed with flames shooting through the roof. We done a sweep of the main floor and found only her path. Passed out in the living room. But if there were more people inside, especially in areas we hadn't checked yet, we needed to move fast. My captain arrived with three other firefighters. I explained the situation while the woman kept sobbing about her family being trapped inside. She said they were in the basement where she'd been doing laundry when the fire started. He'd run upstairs to get help, but got overwhelmed by smoke. We geared up for another entry. The structure was compromised, but if there were victims inside, we had to try. The woman gave us details about the basement layout and where her family Might be. She mentioned hearing them crying when she left, which made my blood run cold. There was no time to waste. Walker and I went in first, while Hensley and Kirk waited as backup. The smoke was thicker now, and visibility was basically zero. We felt our way to the basement door, which was already warm to the touch. Not a good sign. The stairs creaked under our weight, and I wondered if they'd hold. Halfway down, we heard it. Crying sounds coming from somewhere below. My heart raced as we pushed forward. A family was trapped down here, and we were their only hope. The smoke was less dense in the basement, but the heat was intense. Something was very wrong with this fire pattern. We reached the bottom and started searching. The crying seemed to be coming from the back corner, near what looked like a storage area. Boxes and old furniture blocked our path. We started moving things aside, working as fast, fast as we could. The crying got louder as we got closer. That's when the stairs collapsed behind us. The whole structure just gave way in a shower of sparks and burning timber. Walker called it in immediately. We were trapped, but we could hear victims just ahead. No firefighter would leave civilians behind, even if it meant risking our own lives. We kept pushing through the debris. The crying was constant now and sounded like multiple voices, including what seemed like a baby. How could anyone survive down here this long without proper air? The smoke was getting thicker and my air gauge was dropping fast. Finally, we reached the source. Walker pulled aside an old dresser and we both rose. There on the floor was a family of dolls. Baby dolls, child dolls, even adult sized mannequins dressed in clothes. They were arranged like a real family having dinner at a small table. Realizing that there was no way out, Walker said, it's been an honor serving with you all. Full story on channel link below.

But then it started happening when she talked to me, to cashiers, even to my boss when he called the house. Instead of saying normal things like thanks or excuse me, she'd make these weird sounds like Tank Uwu and Scoozie Woozy. She'd giggle after every sentence and talk in this high pitched voice that sounded like a cartoon character. When she wanted me to pass the salt at dinner, she'd say something like, Daddy Waddy, can you pass the salty Waltie, please? I tried being nice about it at first. I'd say stuff like, babe, you can talk normal to me or honey, the baby isn't even here right now, but she'd just laugh it off and say I was being silly.

I was mortified. Then when the waiter came to check on us, she grabbed his arm and said, this foodie is super duper yummy wummy. You did such a good job. Job?

Senior year, I finally worked up the courage to ask my crush Ebony to prom. She said yes, and I was convinced this would be the perfect night to tell her how I felt about her. I spent weeks planning everything. Rented a tux, spot a corsage, even practiced my I've liked you since freshman year speech in the mirror. The one thing I insisted on was driving. My friends all wanted to split an Uber, but I had this romantic vision of picking Ebony up in my car, just the two of us having deep conversations on the way there. What I didn't mention was that my car was a 2003 Toyota Camry with a dent in the side and a muffler that sounded like a dying whale. Ebony looked absolutely stunning when I picked her up. She was wearing this gorgeous blue dress, and I was so nervous I could barely speak. The drive to prom was going perfectly. We were talking, laughing, and I was building up the courage to tell her how I felt at prom. Everything was magical. We dance, I danced, took pictures, and I was planning to confess my feelings during the slow songs. But then my friends Jake and Marcus found me around ten PM, completely wasted from pre gaming in the parking lot. Dude, Jake slurred, hanging all over me. We need a ride home right now. Marcus threw up on his date shoes. And we got kicked out of the after party. I tried I to explain that I was having a moment with Ebony, but Marcus was turning green and mumbling about needing to get home before his parents found out he was drunk. Ebony, being the sweet person she is, said, it's okay. We should help them. We can talk later. So there I was, loading two drunk idiots into my Toyota while wearing a 200 dollar tuxedo. Jake immediately claimed shotgun and started messing with my radio while Marcus sprawled across the back seat groaning about his stomach. This car smells weird! Announced loudly, like old French fries and sadness. Ebony squeezed into the back seat next to Marcus, who kept apologizing for ruining prom night while simultaneously asking if we had any snacks. I was driving extra carefully because I had precious cargo, but Jake kept grabbing the steering wheel, saying, dude, you're driving like my grandma. Speed up! Then Marcus suddenly sat up and yelled, pull over! I'm gonna be sick! I swerved to the side of the road so fast that my muffler backfired like a gunshot. Marcus jumped out and started throwing up in someone's front yard while Jake cheered him on like it was a sporting event. That's when the police car pulled up behind us with its lights flashing. Officer Johnson got out, and of course it was the same cop who'd given me a speeding ticket last month. He took one look at Me in my tuxedo, my Toyota with the hood smoking slightly, and two drunk teenagers in formal wear. And just shook his head. Well, well, well, what do we have here? I tried to explain that I was the designated driver, completely sober, just helping my friends, but Jake chose that moment to stumble over and loudly declare,

So I gave my daughter a name she'll never forget. I've been planning to name my daughter Sophia Rose since I was literally 14 years old. I had this whole Pinterest board with nursery ideas, wrote it in my diary about a million times, even practice signing birthday cards with love, Sophia's mom like a complete weirdo. When I got pregnant at 23, everyone in my family knew this was the name. I been talking about it for almost 10 years. But my younger sister Emma always had to make everything about her growing up. If I got a new bike, she needed a better one. If I made honor roll, she suddenly cared about grades. When I announced I was pregnant, she immediately started trying to get pregnant too, even though she'd been with her boyfriend Tyler for only like 8 months and could barely afford rent on her studio apartment. Two months after my announcement, she called me crying happy tears. I'm pregnant too. We can be pregnant together. At first I was excited, sister. Pregnancy sounded cute. We could share maternity clothes, compare weird cravings, complain about swollen feet together. But then she started copying everything I mentioned, craving pickles and ice cream. Suddenly that was her thing too. I bought this gorgeous cream colored crib from target. She showed up with the exact same one three days later when I posted bump photos in my Favorite blue maternity dress. She bought the same dress in pink and posted almost identical pics. The worst part was she kept asking about names. What are you thinking for names? I'm so stuck. You always have the best ideas. I stupidly told her about Sophia Rose because I trusted her. She nodded along, said it was beautiful, even suggested middle name alternatives. At 36 weeks, she went into early labor. I was still two weeks away from my due date, feeling like a whale and scared something was wrong. She texted me from the hospital, she's here, 7 pounds, 2 ounces of perfect. Come meet your niece. I waddled into that hospital room with flowers and a pink teddy bear, so excited to meet my first niece. Emma was glowing in her hospital bed holding this tiny, perfect baby girl. Meet Sophia Rose, she said with the biggest smile. I literally felt my heart stop. What did you just say? Sophia Rose. Tyler, she repeated, like nothing was wrong. Isn't she perfect? The name just felt so right when I saw her little face. You, you were right. It's such a beautiful name. I stood there holding wilted flowers, 38 weeks pregnant with my own daughter, watching my sister cuddle the baby who now had my name, the name I'd planned for almost a decade. Tyler was taking pictures. The nurses were cooing, and I felt like I was watching my dreams get stolen in real time. Emma, that Was my name, I whispered. She looked at me with fake confusion. What do you mean? We never decided on anything official. And she just looked like a Sophia when she came out. You understand, right? You'll find something even better. I left that hospital room crying so hard I could barely see to drive. My husband, Jake, was furious when I told him. She can't just steal your name, he kept saying. But legally, she absolutely could. There's no copyright on baby names. Two weeks later, I gave birth to my.

When I turned 18, my parents sat me down for what they called a long overdue conversation. You need to move out, mom announced. Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live, Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouthed goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster when mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzales explained proudly to the electrician. Next he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat Had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost, $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened, I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats and it through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement incident. Gonzalez filled Dad's gas tank with what he called super juice, a mixture of energy drinks, lighter fluid and glitter. The car made it exactly.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realized she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realized I'd bought all the cooking supplies, too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there. Just empty rooms with.

I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

It worked. My sister Ava was off limits. That wasn't a discussion. It was law in our house. According to dad, when she turned 13, she already had boys from school calling our house and he'd answer with, she's not available until she's 30. My brother Tom and I fell in line naturally. We'd been through the teenage guy phase ourselves, so we knew exactly what went through their heads. When Ava started high school, we all watched her like Hawks. We'd always make sure no guys were bothering her at school. Dad kept a baseball bat by the front door for emergencies for whenever Ava mentioned a boy's name. We weren't crazy, just protective. When Ava was 15, some senior asked her to prom. The three of us dropped her off at his house at ten PM just to introduce ourselves. He ended up staying home that night. Ava cried for a week, but we told her we were just keeping her safe. Then out of nowhere, she had a boyfriend, Jackson. Ava brought him home for Thanksgiving. She gave us exactly 12 hours notice, probably hoping we wouldn't have time to prepare. She was wrong. When Jackson arrived, he was everything we expected, clean cut, nervous, kept calling dad sir out of respect. We circled him like sharks. Tom crushed his hand during the handshake, holding on three seconds too long. I asked him about his intentions while flipping a kitchen knife between my fingers. Dad just sat there silent, occasionally glancing at the baseball bat. Jackson stuttered through dinner, dropped his fork twice. This one would break easy. But then something shifted. By dessert, Jackson had stopped stuttering. When Tom made another comment about protecting what's ours, Jackson just nodded and said, I'd expect nothing less. She's lucky to have you all. When I tried to corner him about his career prospects, he calmly explained his five year plan, then asked about mine. Even Dad's silence didn't rattle him anymore. He just sat there occasionally touching Ava's hand under the table like we weren't three large men plotting his demise. Tell dad didn't like this at all. Who did this kid think he was? We talked in the garage while Ava showed him her old room. He's not scared yet. We need to do more. For three days, we made Jackson's life hell. Tom would accidentally wake him up at 5 a. M. With his workout music, took him on a hiking trip that was basically a death march through the woods, hoping he'd tap out. Dad made him help rebuild the deck in freezing weather, giving him the wrong tools on purpose. But Jackson just kept showing up, kept smiling, kept holding Ava's hand. By day four, we were furious. On his last night, Ava ran to the store for ice cream, leaving Jackson alone with us. This was It. We all walked up to him, surrounding his chair. Tom cracked his knuckles. I crossed my arms. Dad loomed over him, all 6 foot 3 of angry father. We could tell he was nervous. Finally, a real reaction. We stared him down, hoping he'd crack. But then Jackson did something none of us expected. He stood up slowly, looked dad straight in the eye, reached out.

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet at first. She was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around. But when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800, not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. $800 might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing, my parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or pick up Extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better. When I went to him for help, he said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother, for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as a bridesmaid. Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine, and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

I'll never forget seeing the new kid, Ben, sitting alone at his desk at Tuesday morning, tears streaming down his face, while the entire their class erupted in laughter around him. He was almost completely deaf and had been an easy target every single day since he transferred to our school. A few guys stood behind him, their mouths moving in exaggerated yells that Ben couldn't hear. Making obscene gestures and mimic king sign language, while Ben just saw everyone laughing at him and pointing. Gabe would take it to the next level, as he'd go as far as to scream right behind him, knowing he wouldn't react. The math teacher had stepped out to make copies, and in those five minutes, they'd already reduced Ben to tears. His eyes darted around the room, desperately trying to understand what was so funny, what he'd done wrong this time. But he just couldn't understand. I tried to help him, but every attempt just made things worse for both of us. When I stood up and told them to stop in lunch last week, he just laughed and said I had a crush on the stupid deaf kid. Which became another joke that followed me through the halls. At least three or four incidents every single day, always when teachers weren't looking. Always calculated to make Ben feel the biggest loser in our whole school. I reported it to the principal twice. But she just said, boys will be boys, and that Ben needed to learn to stand up for himself. How could he stand up to harassment he couldn't even hear? Gabe was a literal monster, but I had no idea how far he was about to go. I made one last attempt to handle this the right way by going directly to the guidance counselor with my documented evidence. I showed him three weeks of detailed notes explaining how the bullying was escalating, how Ben had started eating lunch in the bathroom, how his grades were dropping because he was too anxious to focus in class. I told her all about how Gabe had been harassing him daily, making his life a living hell. She looked at my notebook side and said that I should focus on my own education. I thought she was joking at first, but then I realized the guidance counselor was friends with Gabe's mom, and I knew she didn't believe any of it. Ben needs to learn to communicate better with his peers. Communicate better? How the hell was he supposed to communicate with people he couldn't even hear? I was about to say that, but then a loud ringing sound went off in my ear. The fire alarm started blaring right next to me, and everyone filed out in the usual chaos of an unexpected drill. I was already outside when I noticed those same guys huddled together, laughing nervously but trying to play It cool. They were talking about something, but I had too much on my mind to listen. The building was actually smoking. I'd never seen this before, because this wasn't actually a drill. We all stood outside watching it. When I heard one of them say, yo, we should probably tell someone now. I was listening. Gabe told them to be quiet, but another guy said, guys, we can't just leave him there. That fire is huge. I knew who him was immediately. I asked what they meant. Gabe had tears in his eyes. Ben still in there? We left him as a joke because he couldn't hear the alarm. The building was now engulfed in flames, windows shattering from the heat.

Why, it's in the corner of your room. I gestured toward the small medical waste bin while cradling the Newborn, who was struggling to breathe. Go ahead and toss it for me, please. She said it so casually, like she was asking me to throw away a tissue. What? Ma'am, this is your baby. I held the infant closer to my chest protectively. Look at it. The little turd is hardly alive. He can barely breathe. Just do us all a favor and throw it out. Her pupils were dilated and she kept scratching at her arms. Absolute not. I turned away from her and started checking the baby's vitals. I'd seen the track marks on her arms during delivery. The baby was born premature and underweight, with clear signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome. His little body was already going through withdrawal from whatever substances his mother had been using during pregnancy. He needed immediate medical intervention, not a trash can. The mother started getting agitated when I didn't comply. She sat up in the bed, despite having just given birth 20 minutes ago. Her hospital gown was soaked with sweat and blood, but she didn't seem to notice or care. The way she looked at her own child like he was garbage made my stomach turn. I knew I had to get this baby to the NICU immediately. His breathing was shallow and his skin had A bluish tint that worried me. Every second counted. But I also couldn't just walk out without following protocol. I needed to document everything and alert social services about the mother's request to dispose of her child. I'm going to take your son for treatment now. He needs oxygen and monitoring. I kept my voice calm and professional. The mother's eyes narrowed. She looked around the room like she was calculating something. Then her whole demeanor changed. Her face contorted into fake panic, and she started screaming at the top of her lungs. Help me! This woman is trying to hurt my baby! Her voice echoed down the hospital corridor. Within seconds, three other doctors rushed into the room. Doctor the Peters and Doctor Burton looked between me and the screaming mother, trying to assess the situation. Behind them, Nurse Melendez appeared, looking concerned. They all knew me, but they also had to respond to a mother's distress call about her Newborn. Put the baby down and return it to the mother. Doctor Peters used his authority voice. No! I'm trying to save this baby's life! She asked me to throw him in the trash can. She's not in a state to care for him. I held the infant tighter. The mother's performance escalated. Tears streamed down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. She's insane. Why would anyone want to throw out their baby? I looked desperately at my colleagues. They had to see through this. Act. The baby in my arms was barely breathing and needed immediate care. His mother was clearly high and had just asked me to dispose of him like medical waste. But the other doctors were looking at me strangely. Doctor de Burton stepped closer with his hands up, like he was approaching a dangerous animal. Gabriella, did you take your medication today? When we hired you, you promised to never miss a day of your medication. My heart sank. They thought I was having an episode. Five years ago, I'd had a brief mental health crisis. During my residency, I've been properly diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder. I've been stable on medication ever since. But that history would always follow me. Now this manipulative woman was using it against me. I never

So we're three months from the wedding, and I make the mistake of telling my family we finally booked our venue. A big mistake. My mother in law immediately goes into interrogation mode. What's the theme? Is it rustic beach? I say it's a surprise, and she literally follows me to the bathroom door, going, I carried that boy for nine months. I deserve to know if I need waterproof mascara for three weeks. It escalates. My sister in law creates a group chat called Wedding Venue Detectives. My cousin starts checking venue parking lots for our cars. My mother in law accidentally opens our mail claiming she was looking for coupons. My aunt shows up at three different venues with my photo, asking if we have a reservation. The breaking point is this family dinner where my mother in law ambushes us with a laminated list saying, these are all possible venues within 50 miles. Just point. My sister adds, we need to know. I look at my husband, who mouths, just tell them like a broken man. I look at his mother with her Office Depot laminated list. My sister recording for Instagram, my cousin, who's been stalking parking lots. Something in me breaks. You want to know so badly? Fine. I stand up slowly and make eye contact with everyone. We're having our reception at McDonald's. I let that hang for three full seconds, watching their brains buffer Someone drops their fork. The one on Main Street with the Play Place. It goes that's not funny, but I'm stone faced. We already put down the deposit. My husband catches on, immediately nod seriously, the manager, Gary, is really excited. My sister's wine glass shatters on the floor. My mother in law asks about dinner and I go everyone gets Happy Meals, nuggets or Big Mac. No substitutions. My aunt starts crying you cannot feed my friends nuggets at your wedding! Meanwhile, my uncle practically throws his wallet at us asking if it's about money. I do a quick Google and show them someone did this already in 2,015. First dance under the golden arches, I say wistfully. My sister in law shrieks about her two hundred dollar shoes and how they just cannot touch a McDonald's floor. My husband commits fully. Instead of cake, we're doing an apple pie tower. Ronald McDonald is officiating. I add we're registered at McDonald's for gift cards. My mother in law looks at me with pure betrayal. What will Father Michael think when he finds out you're getting married by a clown next morning? My mother in law shows up with menu brochures. This barn is available! I'll pay for everything! I pull out the fake McDonald's catering menu I made at 3:00am. Too late. We customized our Mcflurry Bar. Oreo for my side, M&M for his. She grips the door frame. By day three, my cousin reveals they had an emergency Family meeting and created a Powerpoint to convince my husband and I to call off the McDonald's disaster. They called it Operation Real Venue with Slide 7 titled signs they've lost their Minds. Week two, my aunt calls crying that she can't tell her book club my knee.

My best friend asked me to quit my 180,000 dollar V P. Position to watch her kids because daycare is for people who don't have friends with maternal instincts and she could not miss her wine tasting certification course. Madison told me for years that I was meant to be a stay at home mom and a natural mother while dumping her children at my door every single day. Madison and I met at our first corporate jobs, where we both swore we'd be C E O s by 30. Then I had twins at 28 and everything changed for me overnight, while Madison kept climbing that ladder until she married a cardiac surgeon and retired at 20 9 to live her best life. The morning I told her I was leaving work to raise my kids, she hugged me and whispered, you're going to be such an amazing mother because you actually have those maternal instincts, unlike women like me who need more stimulation. When my husband got laid off and money got tight, she was the first to say staying home was still the right choice since I was so naturally nurturing and some women were just meant to be mothers. By the time my twins were two and I had my third baby, Madison had her first kid with her surgeon husband. Three weeks postpartum, she showed up at my door at six In the morning with her Newborn still covered in spit up, and announced, why would I pay strangers when my best friend is literally the best mother I know? Before I could answer, she was already backing out of my driveway in her new Range Rover, leaving her screaming baby in my arms while texting her personal trainer. Every morning became a hostage situation where Madison would ring my doorbell before dawn with her daughter and whatever emergency made it impossible for her to parent that day, from Pilates to brunches to urgent manicures that couldn't be rescheduled. When I suggested the elite daycare that her husband could definitely afford, she laughed and said, those places are where lazy parents abandon their children. But I have you. Why would I traumatize my baby with strangers? When Madison had her second baby, she didn't even pretend to consider childcare. You're literally glowing when you're surrounded by all these babies while I just feel trapped. So really, I'm doing you a favor by giving you more purpose in life. She dropped both kids with ear infections and stomach bugs while she attended charity luncheons where she'd complain about how exhausting motherhood was to women who actually watched their own children. She sent me midnight texts saying she needed me to take the kids for three days because her husband was at a medical conference and she absolutely had to join him, which I'd later see on Instagram was her at a Miami Spa resort while he worked while she posted champagne selfies. I was managing five kids through stomach flu and when I texted that her son had a fever of 103, she replied with a thumbs up emoji and asked if I could handle the weekend too since she booked a couple's massage. She threw elaborate birthday parties, taking credit for the Pinterest perfect decorations while telling other moms blessed she was to be so hands on even though I was doing everything while she got Botox. For six years, this was my life. While Madison remodeled her third house and posted about the struggles of being a stay at home mom. Her village that made it all possible, as she said in her posts, was literally just me watching her kids for free, including Christmas morning when she flew to Aspen because she desperately needed a break from the holidays. Everything shifted when my youngest started kindergarten and I had seven hours of freedom every weekday for the first time in six years. I updated my resume and started interviewing while Madison acted like I'd personally betrayed her by even suggesting I might want something beyond her childcare.

I smiled. I haven't heard of that one. Her words slurred from the laughing gas. It's when I hear daddy's car and everyone freezes like statues. My hygienist, Sierra, raised an eyebrow. That sounds interesting. How do you play? When we hear the garage, Mommy says statue time and we all freeze wherever we are, Isabella explained drowsily. Even if I'm eating or playing, everything stops. That's when I noticed the faint yellow marks on her upper arm, mostly hidden by her sleeve. Sometimes I'm really good at it. Last week I held my spoon in the air for 20 whole minutes. She seemed proud. Mommy said I was the best statue ever. Twenty minutes is a long time, I said, gently adjusting her sleeve to see better. Fingerprint bruises? Old ones. Can you raise your arm for me, sweetie? I need to adjust the chair. As she raised both arms, her shirt rode up. Linear marks crossed her lower back, some scarred, some fresh. What happens if someone moves during statue time? I kept working, acting like I was just doing my job. That's losing. Daddy doesn't like when we lose. Excuse myself to get a different tool, stepping to my computer to pull up our mandatory reporting protocols. When I returned, I asked casually, and if you win the statue game? If we're all good statues, daddy, Walks through and goes to his room. Then we can breathe normal again. Sometimes he even says good job and we get to eat dinner. You get to eat dinner? Only if we win. Losers don't deserve dinner. But mommy sneaks me crackers later. I made a show of checking Isabella's chart while secretly measuring the bruise patterns with my pen light. 3 2 cm spread on the grip marks. Adult male hand size. Isabella, what other games does your family play? I asked oceaning my hygiene to discreetly check on the father. The listening game, where he asks questions and we have to answer exactly right. I pulled out my light open wide again. What kind of questions? Like who's the most important person in this house? The answer is always daddy. The light revealed slight scarring on her inner cheek, likely from biting during stress. Happens when someone gets the answer wrong. Sometimes no breakfast or lunch. My tummy hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse. My least favourite one is the quiet room. I set down my tools. Tell me about this quiet room. While I set up this X ray. I positioned the lead apron, noting how she winced when I touched her shoulders. It's the closet under the stairs. No light. We stay until we're sorry enough. I count to know how long I lasted. My record is 10,000 seconds. What's yours? The excitement in her voice broke my heart. That was over two And a half hours. That's a lot of counting, Sierra returned, mouthing her dad's asking how much longer you'll be. Mommy went in there last week, Isabella continued. He had to fold up real small cause she's bigger. Daddy said she forgot who pays the bills. Sometimes I hear her crying in there, but I can't help or I go in too. We Learned that rule the hard way. I took the X rays, handed her some stickers, and said, I need to develop these. Sierra will stay with you in the hallway. I called CPS from my cell. Active abuse case. Child has physical marks. Describes systematic torture disguised as games. Father is in waiting room. Returning, I pretended to review her chart. Isabella, has anyone else seen you play these games? No, silly. It's a family secret.

Amelia threw herself onto her bed, still wearing the clothes I'd caught her in when she climbed back through her bedroom window at 2:00am. Two weeks grounded. Are you actually serious right now? She grabbed a pillow and screamed into it. I was just at Tyler's party. Everyone was there. Everyone except you because you weren't allowed to go. I. I stood in her doorway, exhausted from waiting up. You snuck out. That's the issue. She sat up, mascara smeared under her eyes. Sadie's mom would never do this. She literally called the school last week and lied about Sadie being sick. When she skipped, Amelia kicked off her shoes. She trusts Sadie to make her own choices. She doesn't treat her like a prisoner. That's not trust, Amelia. That. That's being a cool mom who actually has her daughter's back. She stood up, fists clenched. All I want is a mom who covers for me sometimes instead of punishing me for being a normal teenager. Why can't you be like her? That night, I couldn't sleep. Amelia's words kept echoing in my head. Maybe I was too strict. Maybe kids did need freedom to figure things out. Her dad had been the lenient one before the divorce and she'd always loved him more. Was I pushing her away? The next morning, I knocked on her door. School today, if you want, I'll Call you in sick. Amelia's jaw dropped. Wait, what? You said you wanted me to have your back, so I'm having your back. She skipped three days that week. I called the attendance office, each time faking a cough. Amelia has the flu. Friday night she stumbled home at 1:00am, clearly drunk. The old me would have lectured her until sunrise. Instead, I helped her to bed, left water and Advil on her nightstand. I mumbled, thanks, mom, before passing out. I'd lay awake terrified, but kept repeating what I read online. Teenagers need autonomy. Natural consequences teach better than punishment. The lies got easier. Amelia would text she was at the library, but her Instagram showed her at the mall. I'd see beer cans in her backpack and pretend not to notice natural consequences. I reminded myself she'll learn on her own. Amelia started coming home with hickeys, peoples dilated, smelling like weed. Her sweet friends stopped coming around. Now it was kids with tattoos and vape pens who never came inside, just honked from the driveway at midnight. But Amelia seemed thrilled with the new me. She kissed my cheek randomly, bragged to friends on the phone about how chill I was. My mom literally doesn't care what I do, I heard her say proudly. Those words should have been my wake up call. Instead, I smiled, thinking I'd finally gotten parenting right. Thursday night, Amelia texted at ten PM, sleeping over at Sadie's to study for bio Test. Her dad called immediately, voice tight with concern. School night sleepovers. Since when I kept my voice casual. She needs freedom. Remember, I already said yes. But at eleven PM, Sadie's mom called. Is Sadie at your house? She said she was studying with Amelia. My stomach dropped, but I heard myself lying. No, haven't seen her. Maybe they went to another friends. I hung up knowing both girls were lying. But I committed to this path. At 1:00am, Amelia texted again. Actually at a party staying with a friend from school. Her dad was at my door in 10 minutes demanding we get her. She's being honest with us now. We have to trust her. God, I was an idiot. At 3 a. M, my phone rang. Amelia's voice was tiny, terrified. Mom, please come get me. Please. She was sobbing so hard she could barely speak. I'm at this college party. These guys said they were seniors, but they're like 25. One won't let me leave his room. He keeps giving me drinks. I locked myself in the bathroom when he tried to. Her voice broke. Mom, I'm scared. I flew out the door speeding.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say. Or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal ones right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper, glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered, and I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college, partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass, I mentioned one day while folding towels. You're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it, too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I Needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since doors stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded. And ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping, and I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end, so I ducked behind my mirror. Blind spot, like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle. A teenage girl hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately, but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office, and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned. Dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe. The way he said it made Dad's face go pale from realization. By the next morning, everything was chaos. Rob, being a mandated reporter, had called CPS overnight. Two social workers showed up before breakfast asking to speak With me. Privately, they separated us into different rooms. Dad in the kitchen, me in the living room, mom in the bedroom. Can you explain the rules about changing clothes in your house? The woman asked gently. I'm just not allowed to close doors, I said. Not even while changing clothes? She wrote something down. So you felt the need to hide behind furniture because your dad doesn't give you privacy? I tried explaining the mirror trick, but it sounded worse out loud. So you developed evasion strategies to change clothes. She kept on writing in her notepad. Then they brought dad in. Sir, can you explain why your daughter cannot have privacy while changing? Dad's voice shook. It's just not closing doors for her safety. Kids hide all kinds of stuff. It's her body, the woman finished. And you think watching her prevents her from what? Being a delinquent? Dad nodded frantically. You require visual confirmation of your 16 year old

I was dating this guy Mark for about six months when he finally introduced me to his 8 year old daughter Emma. He'd always made excuses about why I couldn't meet her. She was shy, going through a phase staying with grandparents. Red flags I ignored because I was falling for him. The first time I went to his house, Emma answered the door. She was this tiny, timid little thing who immediately apologized for existing. Sorry, sorry. I'll get daddy. Sorry for bothering you. Mark came to the door and didn't even acknowledge her. No hug, no how was your day? Nothing. She just disappeared upstairs like a ghost. During dinner, Emma asked quietly if she could have some ketchup. Mark exploded. You always want something. Can't you just eat normal food like a normal kid? This is why your mother left. I watched this little girl's face crumble. She whispered, sorry, daddy, and ate her plain chicken in silence while tears rolled down her cheeks. I tried to lighten the mood, asking Emma about school. Mark cut me off. She's not good at talking to people. Emma, go to your room. Adults are trying to have a conversation. She vanished again. I didn't see her the rest of the night. Over the next few weeks, I started noticing a pattern. Emma would try to exist quietly, but Mark treated her like an inconvenience he was stuck with. One day I came over. Early and heard him screaming at her upstairs, just like your worthless mother, nothing but problems. I found Emma sobbing in her room, which was basically a storage closet with a mattress on the floor. No decorations, no toys, no signs a child lived there. The breaking point came during Emma's birthday. Mark forgot completely. When I reminded him, he got annoyed and said birthdays are just made up holidays to make kids feel special. She needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her. I couldn't take it anymore. I secretly bought Emma a small cake and a stuffed animal. When I gave them to her, she started crying and hugging the toy like it was the most precious thing in the world. Nobody ever gave me a present before, she whispered. Daddy says presents make kids spoiled. That night, Mark found the gifts and flew into a rage. He threw the stuffed animal in the trash and screamed at Emma for manipulating me into feeling sorry for her. She's got you fooled. She puts on this act to get attention. Her mother did the same thing, played victim until she got what she wanted. I watched him destroy this little girl's only source of joy while she stood there taking it like she deserved it. That's when I realised Mark wasn't just a bad parent. He was systematically breaking his daughter's spirit. The next day while Mark was at work, I went back to see Emma. She was Home alone. Apparently, he'd been leaving her by herself since she was 6. I sat down with her and said, Emma, you know none of this is your fault, right? You deserve love and kindness and presents on your birthday. She looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. But daddy says I'm bad. Daddy says Mommy left because I cried too much as a baby. My heart shattered. This man had convinced his daughter that her own mother abandoned her because she was defective. That evening when Mark came home, I confronted him. I told him I'd seen enough and that how he treated Emma was emotional abuse. He laughed in my face. You don't know anything about parenting. Emma needs discipline, not cuddling. Her mother turned her into a weak, needy brat. I looked him dead in the eye and said, you're right. I don't know about parenting, but I know about basic human decency. Then I called Child Protective Services right in front of him. He went ballistic, screaming that I was destroying his family, that Emma would end up in foster care because of me. But Emma ran to me and hugged my leg.

I was working at a phone shop when this mom stormed in with her 15 year old daughter, demanding I fix her iPhone that broke for no reason. The girls yelling at me about how I sold her a piece of junk and wants a full refund on a phone she bought four months ago. Mom's backing her up, saying her responsible daughter always uses a case and this is clearly a defect product. I take the phone to examine it. The screen is completely shattered, there's sand in the charging port, and it smells like chlorine. This has water damage and impact damage. I explained. The warranty doesn't cover dropping it in a pool. Girl loses it. I never dropped it. It just stopped working. Mom demands my manager immediately. He's at lunch, I said. But I can call the district manager if you want. The daughter smirks at her mom. B there's scared. They know they're wrong. Mom pulls out her credit card. Just give us a new phone and we'll dispute the charge later. I shake my head. Ma'am, I can't exchange a phone that's been damaged by the customer. Customer? The girl laughs. More like victim of false advertising. She starts loudly complaining to other customers in the door. Don't buy anything here. They sell broken phones. The mom joins in. This is going straight to corporate. What's your name? I point to my name tag. It's right There! Well, you just cost yourself a job. The mom says, my husband's a lawyer. The daughter's getting older. Yeah, and my dad's gonna sue this whole company! She grabs the broken phone from my hands. This is evidence of your defective products! I try to stay calm. Please don't handle the device. Sharp glass could cut you. Don't tell me what to do! She snaps. You work retail! I'm the customer! The mom nods. Exactly. The customer is always right. Not when they're lying, I said quietly. The girl gasps dramatically. He just called me a liar, mom! Did you hear that? Mom's face turns red. I want your manager now! Call him back from lunch! And I want a new phone plus compensation for emotional distress! The daughter adds she's waving the broken phone around. This thing could have exploded and killed me! I notice other customers starting to stare. The mom notices too and speaks louder. This employee is harassing my daughter and refusing to honor your warranty! The daughter feels bold. I just wanted my phone fixed and he's being so mean to me! The mom hugs her. It's okay, sweetie. We'll get this resolved. She turns to me with fury in her eyes. You've made my daughter cry. I hope you're proud. I'm calling corporate right now. She continues dialing on her phone. The daughter whispers something to her mom, who nods and hangs up. Actually, we're going straight to the news. This is a Story they need to hear. The girl notices my own damaged phone on the counter. What's

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Ma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed this Weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I've been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that and mom says processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick. Drive over, Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in. Her car is not here, I say and dad points across the street where the pin actually is. We both see it at the same same time. Royal Flush Casino. Dad's face goes white. No way. We walk in together. She's at the penny slots with a bucket of coins, empty drink cups stacked everywhere. She's been here all day. She's talking to Another woman. My family thinks I'm at the doctor. It gives me all day here. She puts a 20 in the machine. This is from my daughter's paycheck. She'll never know. I step forward. I know now. Mom spends around seeing us both and dad holds up life. Three, 60, doctor appointment. She starts stammering, but her casino friend makes it worse. Just tell them about your system. You're due for a big win after last month's losses. Dad's voice cracks. Last month, how much? Now Mom's crying, saying 8,000, maybe more. I realized why she's been watching our location so obsessively. She needed to know we weren't coming home while she gambled away our money. I feel sick realizing this is where she went. All those times I told dad she was at appointments. I helped her lie so she could sit here feeding our rent money into slot machines. Mom admits she's been going every day for three.

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in.

Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool.

Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I'd ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend. Kids were splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing, Lexi's Reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street.

The astronauts likely survived the challenger explosion. They were falling for nearly three minutes. Some of them had activated their emergency oxygen. Supposedly, there are audio recordings of their last moments. 2. A successful marriage ends with watching your spouse pass away. 3. The amount of abandoned pets that know they've been abandoned. 4. Very few people in your life would actually drop what they were doing to help you cherish the ones that would. Five. There's a recording of the last kawaii oo bird singing before it went extinct. It was a mating call sung by a male bird. The song has breaks for the female bird to respond. There's no response because the male kawaii oo is the last of its kind. 6. Your loved one didn't say any last words. For context, I worked in a nursing home. People always ask, did they say anything? And the truth is no. We obviously don't say that to the family, but it is not like in the movies. Also, a weird thing that happens sometimes is that 24 hours before passing away, they get a sudden spike of energy, which may look like they're getting better. So it confuses the family members. Sometimes working with old people broke me a little bit. 7. It took my dog a couple years to realize he was here to stay. I was his seventh owner. I am his Last he was returned to the shelter multiple times for behavioral issues, and when he acted out, he would immediately get depressed, thinking he was going back. Very good dog. Very happy now and has turned into quite an entitled princess. 8 whales never die of old age. They just become too weak to surface for air. 9 we abandoned the pigeons. We spent centuries domesticated them, being friendly to them, and as a result, they moved to our cities and relied on us. Then we decided they were pests. 10 the nurse by Einstein's bed when he passed noted that he said something sounding profound. Unfortunately, she didn't speak German, so we'll never know what his final words were.

One girl I dated in college broke my laptop because she kept trying to get a USB drive in. Instead of, you know, flipping it, she just pushed harder and harder until it broke my port and motherboard. 2. My boyfriend refused to eat basil I had bought from the grocery store because it was a full plant. I was keeping it outside and he insisted that he would not eat dirty food. I asked where he thought farmers kept produce, and he said that they had special areas for food to grow that was sterilized, but my plant was not food grade. I just looked at him with a dumbfounded look. I didn't know how to respond. Three. On a camping trip, she was worried about parking the car on the grass because she thought the grass was going to grow, puncturing and flattening the tires. Four. My husband thought people whistled when they set off fireworks. He didn't realize the fireworks themselves whistles, though. That was one of his more harmless stupidities. Five. He thought potatoes never go bad because his mom always kept a bag in the pantry. I asked him if they ate a lot of potatoes and he said yes. They have a large family with six kids and it still didn't click. Six. I bought fresh broccoli and my husband asked why it was so big. He thought broccoli grows in small bite Size pieces

Like we're talking about a man who buys generic cereal and then pours it into name brand boxes so the neighbors think we eat the good stuff. He drives a BMW that's literally held together with duct tape and prayers. He parks it at the front of the driveway so everyone can see it anyway. I'm a senior in high school and college application season is here. All my friends are talking about where they're applying and their parents are stressing about tuition costs. Meanwhile, my dad keeps making these weird comments about how I better figure out my future because money doesn't grow on trees. But he never actually said he wouldn't pay for college, so I just assumed he would. Big mistake. I applied to my dream school and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I was so pumped and ran downstairs to tell my parents. My mom was excited and started crying happy tears, but my dad just looked at me and said, that's nice, honey. Hope you can afford it. I was confused and asked what he meant. He shrugged and said college was my responsibility now that I was becoming an don't. I felt my stomach drop. This man had literally never told me I'd be paying for college myself. We'd never had that conversation. I Was so angry and hurt that I decided to be petty about it. If you wanted to embarrass me, I'd return the favor. The next week was my 18th birthday party at our house. All my relatives were there, plus some family friends and neighbors. My dad loves showing off in front of people, so he was in his element, talking about his successful business and giving everyone financial advice. That's when I struck. During the cake cutting, I stood up and tapped my fork against my glass like I was making a toast. Everyone got quiet and looked at me. I smiled real big and said, thanks, everyone, for coming to celebrate with me. I just wanted to share some exciting news about my future. My dad looked proud, probably thinking I was about to thank him or something. I got into my dream college with a scholarship, which is amazing, because my dad just told me he's not helping pay for my education at all.

One? Probably the one where a man sought advice on how to handle his cheating wife, was advised to file for divorce, followed through and then news broke in the real world of a mother murdering her two children to prevent her soon to be ex husband from taking custody of them. The op later confirmed the news story was indeed about his wife and children. Horrendously sad. 2, the one where a dying mother told her teen that she was the product of an affair. Reddit encouraged the girl to tell her dad the truth. She took the advice and he kicked her out. Since he was the legal father, the state made him take her back in and he reacted by making life really difficult for the girl who by this point had no one else. She posted one last time on a sub about suicide saying that she'd taken something to end her life. 3, that dude that shot his dick off, cooked it and ate it, you slash worthless. 3, 19. 4 I don't remember the sub. There was this post by a woman who said she was worried about getting raped while out at night in the city. She was asking the area she should avoid and what would have to happen for someone to get away with raping her. People figured out the post was written by a guy trying to rape someone and Get away with it.

I said, you know, I always tell you how beautiful you are and how attracted to you I am, but I never recall you ever saying that I look good or that I look handsome. She stopped applying her mascara long enough to dismissively roll her eyes at me. So I made the mistake of asking her, do you even find me attractive? And she flatly said no. I asked, why did you marry me then? And she said, I didn't think it was important at the time. I never felt so ugly and unloved.

Two, the Dunbar armored robbery, the largest cash heist in US history. A six man inside job to rob an armored cash depot. They set up a house party as an alibi, use the keys to get into the cafeteria and waited in there until all employees came in on break, ambushed and subdued them without firing a shot or raising an alarm. They then loaded the money bags with over $18 million into a U Haul, destroyed the CCTV tapes and returned to the party. Then they sat on the money for six months before hiring a crooked lawyer to set up a real estate money laundering scheme to avoid suspicion. Two years after the robbery, one of the men paid a real estate broker with a stack of money still wrapped in the original currency strap. The broker immediately reported it to the police. After being arrested, he cracked under interrogation, confessed to the robbery and ratted out his partners. All the men have since finished their prison sentences. And most of the money was never found. So there's a chance they still won in the end.

However, after the war, history was often rewritten to glorify the resistance, which was actually made up of a small group of individuals opposing Nazi occupation. 3, the business plot. Yes, a group of powerful Wall Street figures tried to raise an army of 500,000 men to seize the White House, overthrow FDR, and install a fascist government. And yes, Congress investigated it under seal and concluded that the plot was real, but never named the conspirators. It's somewhat similar to what happened with Epstein. 4.

It's not that Japan is actually particularly a bad place to live, but they still utilize antiquated technology, have dated social mores and brutal work life balance, and are quite xenophobic and openly turn away foreigners from many services, even medical care. It's not some anime Utopia where everything is perfect. It's quite a challenging place to live for foreigners. It seems Japan welcomes the visitor, but does not always welcome the immigrant. 3. Birthing and raising a baby. People will acknowledge that it's not easy, sure, but it's so much harder than imagined, especially if you don't have a good support system. 4.

My older brother Jacob ruled our house with terror. At 17, he was built like a linebacker and had everyone walking on eggshells. He'd corner me in hallways, shoving me against walls over nothing. Once he threw my laptop down the stairs because I used his bathroom. Mom would find me with split lips and black eyes. But Jacob always had an excuse ready. She fell off her bike again, he'd say, ruffling my hair like some caring big brother. You know how clumsy little sis is. The worst part, everyone believed him. Teachers, neighbors, even our grandparents thought Jacob was this amazing kid who looked out for his accident prone sister. He played varsity football, got decent grades and charmed adults with his fake smile and perfect manners. At home, though, I lived in constant fear. He'd wait until mom left for her nursing shifts, then make my life hell, holding my head underwater in the bathtub until I saw stars, locking me in the basement for hours, feeling my birthday money and laughing when I cried. I Learned to hide in my room the second I heard his chuckle up. The physical stuff was bad, but the mind games were worse. He'd break my things and blame me, tell mom I was lying about homework to get me grounded. he convinced her I was doing drugs by planting a joint in my backpack. I spent three months in Counseling. Because of that lie, everything changed. The night of his championship game, our whole extended family came to watch Jacob play. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, even mom's boss showed up. Jacob scored the winning touchdown and everyone went crazy cheering his name. After the game, we all met at Denny's to celebrate. The whole back section was reserved for us. Jacob was soaking up the attention, telling war stories about his epic plays while everyone hung on every word. I was picking up my fries in the corner trying to stay invisible when my five year old cousin Lily started crying. She spilled chocolate milk all over her new pink dress and was having a complete meltdown. The sticky mess was everywhere. Other diners were staring. Mom was trying to clean it up while Aunt Grace dug through her purse for wet wipes. Without thinking, Jacob snapped. Shut up, you little brat, he screamed, grabbing her tiny wrist hard enough to leave marks. Stop being such a crybaby. You're ruining everything. The whole restaurant went dead silent. Conversation stopped mid sentence. Even the kitchen seemed to quiet down. But here's the thing, Lily wasn't me. She wasn't trained to take it quietly and apologize. She looked Jacob dead in the eye, her face red with tears and said.

So I bought this cute new sports bra from target last week. Nothing fancy, just black with some pink stripes. I was excited to wear it to the gym because my old one was falling apart and I felt good about myself for once. I walked into my usual gym around six PM when it's always packed with college kids and people getting off work. The second I stepped inside, something felt weird, like really weird. Everyone just stopped what they were doing. The guy doing bench press literally let the bar rest on his chest and stared. The girl on the treadmill almost tripped because she turned her head so fast. Even the front desk worker stopped scanning membership cards. I thought maybe I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe or something embarrassing like that. Checked my reflection in the mirror wall and everything looked normal. Sports bra, leggings, sneakers, hair in a messy bun, same as always. But people kept staring and whispering to each other. I tried to ignore it and went to grab a yoga mat from the rack. That's when I heard this girl behind me whisper to her friend, oh my god, does she not know? Her friend shushed her really loud and they both walked away quickly when they saw me looking. Now I was getting paranoid. I went to the bathroom to check myself again. Maybe I had a huge stain or my bra was see through under the gym lights. But nope, everything looked fine. Sports bra was actually really cute and supportive. I felt confident in it. When I came back out, more people were staring. This older woman on the elliptical kept looking at me and shaking her head with this disgusted expression. A group of guys by the weight rack were pointing and laughing. I was starting to feel sick to my stomach. I decided to just start my workout and ignore everyone. I got on a treadmill and started jogging. The girl next to me kept glancing over every few seconds. Finally, she leaned over and said, hey, I don't wanna be rude, but do you know what that symbol means? I had no idea what she was talking about. What symbol? I asked. Pulling out my earbuds, she pointed at my chest area. On your sports bra, that's not just a design. I looked down at the pink stripes I thought were cute. But now that she mentioned it, they weren't just random stripes. They formed a shape I hadn't noticed before. My stomach dropped when I realized what it was. The pink stripes made a perfect swastika right across my chest. I felt my face turn bright red. Oh, my god. I had no idea. I just thought it was a geometric pattern. I was mortified. No wonder everyone was staring at me like I was some kind of Monster. The girl nodded sympathetically. Yeah, I figured you didn't know. You seem way too nice to be wearing that on purpose. But like everyone in here thinks you're making some kind of statement. I immediately stopped the treadmill and grabbed my towel to cover my chest. I practically ran to the locker room, feeling everyone's eyes on me. A few people were taking pictures with their phones. I wanted to disappear into the floor in the locker room. I called my roommate, Emma, freaking out. She drove over in like 10 minutes with one of her overs.

One. The first piece of jewelry I bought my wife was a necklace. We went on holiday and she lost it. I said I would replace it, but it wasn't the same. She was upset that she'd lost it for sentimental reasons. I emailed the hotel, and of course, they hadn't found it. So I bought a replacement and told my wife they found it. 2. Not me, but my parents. If my mom wants to hide literally anything from my dad, no matter what it is, she just puts it somewhere where he would have to bend over to see it. Doesn't matter if it's something like a package of ore. If my dad has to bend over to find it, he's never going to find it. I've tested it with my own snacks when I was still living with them to confirm it works. He'd be mad if he knew how many snacks we'd hidden from him simply because he doesn't bend over low enough to see it in the cabinet. 3. I wanted my husband to quit wearing denim shorts because they made him look old. He had gained a bit of weight, so I kept buying his shorts in his old size 34. And I bought khaki shorts in a 38. He will never read a label for any reason. He would put on the jorts and then lay on the bed and lift And spread his legs to stretch out the shorts a bit. He blew out the back seam of two pairs in the same day, then ended up putting on the khaki shorts. Since then, almost 20 years, he has insisted that khaki shorts are made better and fit more comfortably than denim shorts of the same size. Four the remote didn't disappear. I accidentally put it through the washing machine and destroyed it and threw it out in a panic. 5. I only put spiders outside when she sees them. If they're only noticed by me, I let them continue hunting bugs, sometimes with a few soft words of encouragement. You're doing a great job, little guy.

And now I can't help but notice that sometimes when I speak to someone from a foreign country, I do feel like I talk louder than them.

What's the most embarrassing situation where you've been mistaken for your twin? One, my twin brother recommended a restaurant to me, said that he and his wife went there all the time. Good food, really friendly staff. So I took my wife there. Food was as advertised, but the service somewhere between cold and openly hostile, like they resented our presence. I was puzzled by the contrast between what I'd heard and what I saw. Suddenly from the front of the restaurant, explosion of laughter, much rapid talking. Suddenly the waitress is there smiling and all, just as my brother and his wife walk around the corner. They thought my brother was cheating on his wife with some blonde. Yeah, it's funny now. 2, I was dating a girl in college. The first time I went to her house, she opened the door. I told her I liked what she did to her hair and kissed her. She kissed me. We went inside. She then yells, your boyfriend is here. They were weird girls. 3. Not a twin, just Asian. Constantly asked at work about projects I am not involved in. Realize co workers think I am the other Asian guy. 4. Not me, but a co worker has two sets of twin daughters. The younger pair are identical and both work at the same McDonald's. The manager often puts one on the pay window and the other on the food window just to mess with Customers. 5, I've been called my twin sister's name my whole life. So one day I accidentally introduced myself to someone as her. When I caught and corrected myself they thought I was straight up crazy for not knowing my own name. 6, a friend and his wife go to the same supermarket every week. His identical twin also goes there with his wife. One day after summoning up the courage, the cashier pulls my friend's wife aside and says, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I've seen your husband here several times with another woman. 7, my friend said hi to his brother one morning. Well, it turns out his brother was actually his own reflection in a window. His mom witnessed it and has never let him live it down. 8, my twin had recently committed suicide and I was at a bar drinking away my rage and a friend of his came up and flipped out on me saying how awful of a joke it was and took everything I had not to remove their teeth with my fist.

Honestly, I got rejected by a girl who seemed to send very obvious signs, so I don't know anything anymore. 2. I've heard you can tell by where they put their feet, like if they put their feet behind their ears, they really like you. 3, a girl flirted with me in French, stole my bag under the table as a joke, wanted to arm wrestle and sat in the pub with me for 7 hours. She could have been Canadian, so I never knew if she liked me or not. Second date is today. 4, I tell my wife about a weird interaction I had with a waitress lady at the store, etc. Then she tells me that woman was hitting on me. Apparently I'm oblivious. 5. Looking back on my time in college, I got some pretty clear signs that I completely missed. If a girl invites you back to her dorm because she forgot something and then can't remember what she was going back to get and then sits on her bed and just kind of looks at you, that's a pretty clear sign. I think about that occasionally. I can't believe I missed that. 1. 6, laughing at everything I say. It's how I recognized my girlfriend. Like me, I could say virtually anything and I could see her laughing. 7, if you see that person hiding in a tree outside your window. 8. I Like things to be very clear and obvious. So I insist on waiting for them to issue me a Section 3.02 notice intention to pursue romantically, which will set out their detailed five year plan for us and describe the boundaries of their proposed pursuit, including likes, dislikes and information on any allergies. Still waiting, but one day I'm sure my luck will turn.

I woke up, watched Buffy, ate pizza, called my brother, went to work, came home and watched the end of the series of Buffy. It may sound like a joke, but I got up after finishing Buffy the Vampire Slayer and went walking. I kept listening to Gangsters Paradise on my iPod until I reached the Aurora Bridge. I live in Seattle. If you know the bridge, you may know that in the last couple years, they have built very high fences around it. But when I was there, there was just a small handrail. I walked to the middle of the bridge and looked down for a while. This part of the bridge was overland and not water, so I continued to walk until I wasn't above someone's yard. I was probably 100 yards before the end of the bridge. I stood looking over the railing for 10 minutes, maybe more. A man got off the 16 bus at the stop right before the bridge and walked toward me. He stopped beside me and asked if I was okay, and I didn't reply for a while. He just stood next to me for a while and just kept talking. He never stopped talking. He talked about the bridge and the bus and his family and about his work and chattered away for a solid 10 minutes. He asked where I lived and I told him Put his hand on my back and coerced me off the bridge and onto a bus. He bust me home and walked me to my front door. I never got his name and I haven't seen him since. But he saved my life. I don't know that I would ever have killed myself, but that's the closest I ever came to it. A stranger saved me and I really hope he knows that. 2. I treated it like a normal day. I got up, went to school, came home and went for it. I tried to enjoy the last moments I had with friends. I wanted to tell somebody but decided not to. I didn't want to bring anyone down. The day before, I wrote letters to those closest to me. On my last day, I left them on the kitchen counter, headed up to the roof and just stared down. It was around nine PM so when I glanced down, I saw nothing. It was pitch black. My right foot hovered around the edge. Right when I was about to leap off, I looked up cross the street. I saw a few people staring at me from their apartment window. This little girl, though, her gaze caught my eye. She shook her head then covered her face. Because of her, I didn't go through with it. 3, my younger brother texted me early that morning in a really good mood saying what a great day it was going to Be then he apparently went around giving out his stuff, buying people lunch and telling his close friends his bank info, etc. He wanted to make sure his friends were covered. I was at work so I didn't get the I love you Dragon flexo text until after he was in the hospital. The sad thing was when I read that text, I knew something was wrong. 4 my friend put on his Facebook the day before he did it, if you had one day to live, what would you do? The day he did it, he went around to all of his close friend and just spent a little time with them, like a half hour, just hang out and shoot shit as usual. Later that night, he texted everyone goodbye. He drove down to one of our favorite smoke spots and obviously no one knows after that except him. But that's where two of my friend found him the next day.

One, I didn't find this loophole, but my friend did. A few years back, an online store had this promotion where whoever spent the most money over a month would get free round trip airplane tickets to anywhere in the world. My friend who's a fucking genius found that one thing you could buy on the site was a gift certificate. So he bought a 25 dollar gift certificate and kept spending it on another 25 dollar gift certificate. So he ended up spending 25 dollars on round trip tickets to Australia. 2. My brother once yelled last one to jump in the pool is gay and then jumped into the pool. However, I figured out that if I did not jump in, then technically he would be the last one in the pool and he is still gay to this day. 3. I used to work at papa John's to pay my way through college. There was a contest we had where if you got someone to upsize their pizza from like a medium to a large for an extra $2, you got points towards movie tickets. A large was simply $2 extra normally anyways, anyone that ordered a large, I simply put in a medium and up sized it. I won every fucking week my co workers didn't notice this obvious loophole and it didn't cost the customer extra. So I didn't have a problem with this morally gray Area, free movie tickets every week was a huge in college. Four, there was a drink machine in college that was 75 cents for a juice. If you put a dollar in, it gave you five quarters in change. I got a juice every day for months before they finally fixed it. 5. When I wear glasses, white people aren't afraid of me. I can blend in anywhere. Nobody wants to be the guy who asks if the black guy really works there. I can walk straight in. Area 51, edit. I'm in the hospital. They shot me in the leg and said I was trespassing. Thanks whoever told me to bring that clipboard. It deflected a bullet. Probably saved my life, honestly. 6, that you can jiggle the handle of certain gumball machines to get free gumballs. 7. For a while, McDonald's had a promo where when you walked in, you could scan a QR code and possibly get free food. However, different locations and different cutouts had different codes. I took pics of as many unique codes I could find, put them all on a handy PDF and scanned them all using an Android device and an Los device. Before lunch, I got free extra value meals regularly. In fact, I still had a couple free ones left over when they stopped the promotion.

One. I had a friend I was crushing on, and I thought he liked me, too. One day we were chatting online and he had to leave for work. Before logging off, he said, I'll be back later to spend more time with my favorite Asian. Confused, I asked, who's that? For as long as I knew him, he thought I was Asian. Once he found out I wasn't, he ghosted me. Two. I was at a dinner party and people kept offering me drinks that I continued to decline. Eventually, one woman's eyes lit up as she looked between me and my husband, and then she asked, oh my gosh, are you pregnant? Everyone around us got quiet, and I laughed and said, no, I have epilepsy. I was handed no more glasses of wine after that. 3. My ex wife was convinced I had another family in another state simply because she heard a kid's voice in the background when I was traveling for work and sitting in a restaurant. Once during divorce depositions, I spent a full day being questioned, and half the questions were slightly different wordings of so you have another family, kid, etcetera. 4. One time in Japan, I asked an old lady for directions in Japanese. I was still a beginner, but I tried my best to speak in their language rather than asking stuff in English. So this lady Assumed I spoke very good Japanese and started chatting. I tried telling her I couldn't understand and everyone else on the bus was trying to hide their laughter. The conversation went on for 10 minutes and I still have no idea what she was saying. She was very nice though. 5 I live in a very Hispanic slash Latino area and one woman heard me speak English and yelled at me for not speaking Spanish, calling me a traitor to my ancestors and bringing shame to my past family history in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Imagine her surprise when I told her I was Arab and Middle Eastern. Still felt guilty for not knowing Spanish for some reason lol. 6 people assumed as high school I was eating nothing but junk because I was rapidly gaining weight while my twin wasn't. In truth I was starving myself because I couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight. It wasn't until my 20s I found out I had a tumor on my thyroid and that's what caused the weight gain.

When she said what kind of bird is a ham? Was hard to ignore. 2. When he ran out of gas while in line at the Starbucks drive through right across the street from the gas station. I told him to get gas first because his car was low, but he really needed that iced caramel macchiato. I asked why he didn't listen to me and he replied with I thought I could make it. He ended up pushing the car through the drive through and got his coffee while doing so, then parked the car in the lot and called a tow to tow it back home instead of the gas station across the street. No, he did not get any gas that day. He waited until his dad got off work to bring a three gallon jug of gasoline because I refused to enable that shit. 3. How do oil companies know where to build gas stations? She thought that there was a gasoline bubble underground that they would tap into and run a line straight to the pump. She was working for Chevron. 4. She thought that Islands Float. 5. When he asked my grandmother if she'd ever had children. 6. I was having bad cramps and I took an Advil. My ex told me I shouldn't take them because it's a gazebo. 7. She seemed to be confused about the difference between flamingos and penguins, but Insisted they weren't real because she'd grown up in Alaska and never seen any. 8 he played a lot of cod and got a tattoo based on a cool design he saw in the game. It was the Nazi eagle. Nine I told him I had to leave in one and a half hours. He told me that was oddly specific and I should have rounded up to two hours instead of one hour and 50 minutes. I clarified that I had to leave in one hour and 30 minutes, and he said, that's actually 1.3 hours. 10 her look at the moon. That ain't right. Me what do you mean, her? You're not supposed to see the moon during the daytime. The government put that there to spy on us. Me what? 11 I was going into anaphylactic shock at a restaurant due to unknown allergy. My throat was closing and I had no neck due to swelling. He asked if I wanted to go outside to get some air. We were sitting on the patio. 12 he insisted that Spain was in South America because they spoke Spanish.

One A recruit fired all his blank ammo during ambush response training. He crawled in ditch to opposite where the aggressors were and started throwing rocks at them. Dye came running in middle of the road blowing his whistle and screaming what the fuck are you doing? Recruit screamed back throwing hand grenades. Drill sergeant without missing a beat, the DI screamed outstanding! And walked away. Two asked a private the difference between cover and concealment. Private said drill sergeant, you asked what seems like a very important question which I am supposed to know the answer. However, this private was imagining not being called on and was not paying attention to the question. Drill Sergeant 3 I ordered the platoon to form up facing west. One troop asked Master Corporal, our west or your west? I just walked away angrily and let his peers sort him out. I came out of my office and they were facing east. Four required to have creases in your uniform, and if you know anything about it, you can sometimes fuck it up and give a shirt. Two creases commonly referred to as railroad tracks. On morning information for uniform inspection it was discovered someone had done this to their shirt, so in come the disc. At one point one of them yelling, asked Recruit X, are you a train conductor? And sure as shit he was before he joined. So He answered, sir, yes, sir. Everyone got awkward quiet for what felt like five minutes, but I'm sure it was only five seconds. And then the group of them went on yelling at the next person in Formation. 5 I heard a recruit say this. D S, did your mother send you here to piss me off? You write home and tell her you're doing a good job. Recruit sir, no, sir. My father sent me here to piss my mother off. DS spun on his heel and marched off with his head down and his hand over mouth. 6 I feel bad for the guy, but I gotta say it. His last name was smelly, as in smelly. So when I had him come into the class for the Orientations Admin Day, the very first day, I asked everyone to stand up and give their rank, name, serial number. So when I heard Private Smelly, I lost it. I felt so bad for the guy.

But did you guys know that there's totally like a lot of evidence that our planet is probably not round 9. Wait, the Romans are from Rome. 10.

Just for context, I'm Polish. I truly believe that Americans have this weird thing about believing in themselves. For example, I don't believe I will become the person I wanna be. I don't believe I will achieve anything in my life. I don't believe I will be happy in my life. Then I watch people from America who believe they can do anything and they just go for it. Does it always work? No, but it gives them a way higher chance than mine when I don't believe. Two, 21 years ago, the United States was able to deploy forces halfway across the world, roll into Baghdad and conquer Iraq in less than one month with only a few hundred American deaths. By contrast, Russia still hasn't even gotten to Kiev after three years of fighting, despite Ukraine being Russia's neighbor. And Russia has suffered 750,000 dead and wounded in the process. 3. Enthusiasm. I live in Ireland and we're all miserable pricks, as are most Europeans. But when we meet Americans, we're always amazed at the enthusiasm and energy they have for even the most mundane stuff. I once saw a bunch of American tourists shout, oh, freaking hell yeah, let's go, and high five each other because they managed to fit all their luggage and groceries into the car. If that was me and my buds, we'd be like, ah, nice. Four national parks courtesy of Theodore Roosevelt. 5. I could be wrong, but I'm in Australia and I love the way Americans go all out for holidays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. It all looks so fun.

One starlight from the boys. At first I thought it was CGI and part of her character, but then I realized she's had horrible surgery. She looks so much better in the earlier seasons, but now she looks drastically different, almost unrecognizable. 2. Simon Cowell I feel like Simon Cowell from 20 years ago would ridicule and lambaste current Simon worse than he ever did with any crazy X Factor or American Idol contestant. His excessive plastic surgery has altered his appearance significantly. 3. The Kardashian Jenner clan they immediately come to mind. A lot of younger celebrities seem to be following the trend of overusing fillers and Botox. Combined with buckle fat removal, it's aging them horribly, making them look middle aged well before they turn 34. Lindsay Lohan. I know she's been through a lot, but the plastic surgery hasn't helped. She was one of the first people my age that I saw undergo extensive cosmetic work, and it was sobering to witness the transformation. 5. Ariana Grande she's still really young and started out naturally beautiful, but she's already started looking a bit uncanny. You don't usually see this level of plastic surgery until someone reaches their 40s. It's surprising and a little disheartening.

Two, full ride for football at any school you can name. Decides to rob a Walgreens with his buddies one Friday night. He lost everything. I saw him working at McDonald's a few years later. 3. Went to a house party shortly after grad, got kicked out for being pricks, went back to the party and beat the host with a bat. He didn't make it. Petition for a conditional release so they could spend Christmas with family. 4 Kid was kind of smart but an excellent multi sport athlete. He had a full baseball scholarship lined up for a state school. The summer after senior year at a party he got drunk, picked a fight and got his knees broken. Don't know what happened to him, but I know he didn't go to college. 5. Took pictures of himself getting top from the football coach's daughter and slipped a copy under the coach's office door as revenge for some slight against him. He was one of the top football players. He was dumb enough to think the coach's daughter wouldn't say who it was in the picture. Of course she told and of course he knew. And of course he was kicked off the team.

One. Two of them decided to take hunting rifles and shoot several rounds into the principal's house at night, thinking the police wouldn't catch them. Two. Full ride for football at any school you can name. Decides to rob a Walgreens with his buddies one Friday night. He lost everything. I saw him working at McDonald's a few years later. Three. Went to a house party shortly after grad. Got kicked out for being pricks. Went back to the party and beat the host with a bat. He didn't make it. Petition for a conditional release so they could spend Christmas with family. 4 kid was kind of smart, but an excellent multi sport athlete. He had a full baseball scholarship lined up for a state school. The summer after senior year, at a party, he got drunk, picked a fight and got his knees broken. Don't know what happened to him, but I know he didn't go to college. Five. Took pictures of himself getting top from the football coach's daughter and slipped a copy under the coach's office door as revenge for some slight against him. He was one of the top football players. He was dumb enough to think the coach's daughter wouldn't say who it was in the picture. Of course she told, and of course he knew.

It looked like something he could no longer keep inside. 5. I'd need Shorsie's vocabulary to properly express that. 6. My true feelings about this would get me banned from this website. All I will say is that it is wildly unacceptable and any competent administration would have been ejected from his position before the end of the day. If a member of Biden's administration did this in 2020, the outrage from the right would be off the charts. 7. Just a reminder that I believe his grandparents were associated with the same radical ideologies. And that his dad gave him a name from a SCI fi book written by someone with similar values. Werner von Braun. 8. They've won. They don't have to hide. I have friends and family members laughing it off saying it's a joke or that he is weird, and it's him saying his heart goes out to those who support him. I'm not kidding. We're cooked. Nine if you're surprised, you haven't been paying attention. 10. Texted my dad the Video of him doing the salute, him being a Trump supporter, had the following explanations. There was nothing bad about his salute. He did it. But he was showing where we were versus where we are going. It was actually hail to the chief. That's a song. Oh, yeah. But Joe Biden is a commie. I have never been so disappointed in my own father.

One. Silly bands. I worked in retail at the time. After they initially sold out, by the time we got new stock in, nobody wanted them anymore. They all got cleared out. Probably because schools banned them almost immediately. 2. The sea shanty craze. Remember that one random week when everyone was suddenly into sea shanties for some reason? Three Segways does the existence of the Segway count as a trend? It was hyped as the future of transportation, but it never really caught on. 4. The 3D craze. Around 2010 everyone thought 3D was the future. After Avatar came out, every movie tried to be 3d. Then came 3d TVs, 3d phones, and a Nintendo 3ds. The craze died out in about a year, likely because it gave people headaches and was more of a gimmick than an improvement. 5. The summer of Pokemon Go the summer of Pokemon Go was incredible. People were up and outside walking around, getting exercise, strangers met and chatted, and for a brief moment it was cool to be social. Then, if I remember correctly, an app update broke the game and its popularity dropped off drastically. Ironically, about four years later, COVID 19 happened and we were all stuck indoors. A complete opposite of that one wonderful summer of Pokemon Go.

My daughter was the prettiest girl in high school and she always had boys showing up at our house hoping to confess their love. She rejected all of them, but unfortunately, one of the boys didn't take it well. He started harassing her everywhere. He would hide in a tree near our house and as soon as my daughter left for school, he would follow her, claiming it was to keep her safe. But one day, my daughter caught him taking photos through her bedroom window. Even at school, he never left her alone and would constantly invade her personal space, saying that friends should hug each other often. I reported his behavior to the teachers, but they said they couldn't control what a student did outside of school. They promised to try and stop the bullying, but things only got worse from there. He started showing up at our house, knocking on my daughter's window when I wasn't home, demanding to be let in. He spread rumors that they were hooking up every day and insisted they were obviously soulmates, all in an attempt to pressure my daughter into dating him. One day he took things way too far. I had just left for work when he decided to break my daughter's window and force his way into the house. He started screaming for her to stop hiding, saying that he would only hurt her if she resisted. He was laughing the entire Time acting like he was invincible. What he didn't know, however, was that I had taught my daughter how to defend herself in situations like this. She ran to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife she could find. Then she hid it behind her back and calmly asked him to leave. The boy didn't listen. He charged at her and in that moment, she reacted, impaling him in the stomach. He died from blood loss shortly after. My daughter was only 16 at the time. Although this experience was deeply traumatic for her, she was never charged with murder. The incident was ruled as self defense.

One when my ex and I got into dumb arguments or debates, we'd send it to council for review. There was no council. There would be no review. It was our way of shelving an argument that would never have a winner. Occasionally, we'd ask each other if we heard back from council about the judgment. Two. My husband and I have a game we call business, business. The goal is to clasp the other person's right hand, fully shake it twice, and say business, business. If the other person pulls their hand away or shouts business, business at the same time, it's a failed attempt. There's no score, but the last successful handshake holder is the reigning champion until dethroned. This started as an inside joke, but has spiraled into a full on competition, including notable wins, like at my uncle's funeral while reaching for a water bottle in the middle of the desert, and during heated arguments. Now whenever we try to hold hands, there's always a moment of hesitation to ensure it's not a ploy. 3. When the laundry comes out of the dryer, my partner dumps the warm pile on me, and I sort socks and underwear from inside the heap. Meanwhile, he hangs up shirts and folds pants. We call it Laundry Turtle. 4. He absolutely must touch my butt at least once every time we go to Walmart. I can't even remember how This started, but it feels weird if we forget. 5. We have a dollar Bill that fell between the washer and dryer during laundry one day. Neither of us could be bothered to fish it out, so we left it there for over a year. Eventually we acknowledged it and decided to leave it as a symbol of our wealth. We've added a quarter to it now it's our emergency fund. 6. We wrestle for fun. Not in a sexy or playful let the other one way, but as a legit competition. 7. We often stand in each other's way for no reason other than to be annoying. 8. We have a mating dance that has evolved over the decade we've been together. It includes moves like slapping one's own butt, moving arms like a Choo Choo train, and one handed clapping. Some moves go out of fashion year by year, but our repertoire is significant.

One. Letting your cat outside. Americans can't possibly imagine that in another country. This is very much a normal thing. The UK just doesn't have the predators the US does. No coyote, snake, Eddie or Mountain Lion is going to unalive a UK cat. The only enemy of the cat in the UK is the car. Two Christmas crackers. We're so used to them here that it is a shock to learn other countries don't do them. When my American brother in law was coming to England for Christmas for the first time, his friend said to him, do you know in England they sit round and wear paper crowns at Christmas? He thought his friend was lying until we all pulled the crackers. It amused me, especially as I thought everywhere did crackers until that point. Three no gaps around public toilet doors. I have never understood why you would ever want to catch a glimpse of someone taking a dookie. It's properly strange. 4. Pronouncing the H in herbs. I get ridiculously irritated with the H less pronunciation. 5. Having tax included in prices. Six walking places. I remember seeing a thread where Americans were freaking out and calling a woman an a hole because she and her son walked to his primary school instead of getting an Uber. 7. Not being bankrupted after visiting the hospital. Like free healthcare must be nice. 8 apparently Americans don't use kettles. I can't imagine life without one, to be honest. 9. Crossing the road wherever I like, whenever I like, without being arrested. 10. Yaffa Cakes. In my experience, Americans don't like the mix of chocolate and orange. 11. Washing machines in the kitchen. Twelve. Walking from any hotel or retail park to other establishments. Got dropped off at a retail park in the US by taxi. Tried and failed to walk across to a store on the other side. Three lane each way road with no pedestrian crossing in the way. Got taxi back to hotel.

One. I had a really good, hard working employee. Always on time, picked up other shifts, great personality. The thing was, he was a nice guy. You know, the guy who was always friend zoned and a little awkward around girls, so he very rarely got any dates. One day he was scheduled to work with me in an hour. The phone rings, I answer and it's him. He's nervous but excited. Tells me he's at a coffee shop and he had started talking to this really pretty girl and she was actually interested in hanging out with him. Asked if there was any way someone could cover his shift. I laughed a little, then realized he was serious. Fuck it. I told him to go out and have a great time and I would figure it out. I honestly thought the next time I saw him he would be all depressed because it didn't work out. Two days later I see him at work and he tells me they're dating. He couldn't stop talking about her the entire shift. For the next few months he worked for me, they were still together and had a great relationship after he left the company. I have no idea what happened, but I really hope it lasted two. I got stabbed and I can't make it in today, but I'll be there Tomorrow, this dude really got mugged and stabbed in the arm and still came into work the next day? Three. This would be from the other side. My mom died, and I had to phone her work to tell them. I called the store manager, and when he picked up the phone, I explained that I was Charlotte's daughter. He was a complete dick to me and said in a really condescending, rude tone of voice, oh, so she can't phone me to tell me why she didn't come to work yesterday? I very quietly told him that, no, she couldn't phone to explain herself because she was dead. There was complete silence on the line. He sputtered something and said HR would be in contact with me. I'm pretty sure that experience affected that man. I think about him every once in a while and hope he Learned a valuable lesson about not being a complete D I C L. In certain situations.

Let's look at what it may have looked like. Corbyn's plan for his first day as PM was to, on the steps of Downing Street, announced that his gov is going to end homelessness in the UK through a range of property purchases as well as long term investment in services such as frontline mental health. The Labour Gov would also immediately guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and call the then Chancellor of Germany to kickstart Brexit talks. The idea here would likely be a softer form of Brexit and maintaining of a lot of framework, but it would likely be paired with an emphasis on how the UK can now develop workers rights and wider social and economic policy. The flip side of this is the implication that the EU is guilty of prioritizing on business interests. Brexit would be an opportunity for the UK to pass legislation that strengthens workers rights, even if it steps on the toes of big business. I'd imagine we would probably be a bit like Norway, outside yet close and involved while paying for some access. Things would be a lot friendlier emo. There would also be an emergency budget and as part of that the government would increase them in wage and scrap tuition fees. This would not be a quick process. At the same time The establishment would go into overdrive to frame smear him. The right wing of the Labor Party would be weaker but still a powerful block. Leaks and stepping on toes wouldn't be rare. Emo. The media would close ranks to play up every issue and downplay every success. Respectable papers would run opinion pieces about how it's a bad thing to invest in public transport because a pundit thinks buses and working class people are scary. In the future, deeper reform like proportional representation may also forever change the political landscape and break the grip on power that the Tories have. Voting reform may also strengthen smaller parties or allow for new ones to emerge. While the large parties, including Labour and especially the Tories may take a hit, The Labour Party itself would likely be financially better off and have a larger active membership. It was doing well under Corbin as the party grew to be the largest in Europe. A lot of people ended their membership when Corbin went and a few unions unaffiliated. This hurts their ability to get activists and campaigners out and takes away a big chunk of funding. Under the right wing of the iffy. They also tend to waste the money they do have.

My daughter was the prettiest girl in high school and she always had boys showing up at our house hoping to confess their love. She rejected all of them, but unfortunately, one of the boys didn't take it well. He started harassing her everywhere. He would hide in a tree near our house and as soon as my daughter left for school, he would follow her, claiming it was to keep her safe. But one day, my daughter caught him taking photos through her bedroom window. Even at school, he never left her alone and would constantly invade her personal space, saying that friends should hug each other often. I reported his behavior to the teachers, but they said they couldn't control what a student did outside of school. They promised to try and stop the bullying, but things only got worse from there. He started showing up at our house, knocking on my daughter's window when I wasn't home, demanding to be let in. He spread rumors that they were hooking up every day and insisted they were obviously soulmates, all in an attempt to pressure my daughter into dating him. One day he took things way too far. I had just left for work when he decided to break my daughter's window and force his way into the house. He started screaming for her to stop hiding, saying that he would only hurt her if she resisted. He was laughing the entire Time acting like he was invincible. What he didn't know, however, was that I had taught my daughter how to defend herself in situations like this. She ran to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife she could find. Then she hid it behind her back and calmly asked him to leave. The boy didn't listen. He charged at her and in that moment, she reacted, impaling him in the stomach. He died from blood loss shortly after. My daughter was only 16 at the time. Although this experience was deeply traumatic for her, she was never charged with murder. The incident was ruled as self defense.

They can genuinely consider an idea which opposes their world view without necessarily accepting it. 7. They can switch up the way they talk to match the person they're talking to without sounding condescending. They listen to how others learn and explain it in that person's language of understanding. 8. They aren't afraid to say they don't know the answer to a question. 9. Understanding or appreciating nuance. 10. They are okay with being perceived as stupid by asking questions. If we hold back in fear we'll never truly learn. Plus it's a good way to show others it's okay to question things if you don't understand. Better off if we're on the same page instead of hoping things work out without being informed.

One, the person you strapped yourself to for a tandem skydive was up until 3:00am doing cookies last night. Two, the best time to buy a car is the second model year of its release. Year one, it's patchwork to just get them off the line. Year two, everything is fixed and has quality content. Year three, plus Oems give incentives to make parts cheaper and to discontent to improve margins. 3. Sometimes when a job is posted and the requirements are unrealistic, that's because they already have someone that needs to be promoted to that specific position and they simply tailor that job ad so only that person qualifies even if hundreds of people apply. 4. Political propaganda. TV hosts and speakers don't believe that shit themselves and are very cynical about it like it's just a job like any other. 5. The signal strength bars on your phone don't mean anything real. Each phone manufacturer comes up with their own secret formula. It might change between software versions and it's just a holdover from the old first generation analog phones.

The ones linked to top notch surround systems that make movies come to life. The ones so big they have a giant exhaust hose. They have regular HDMI ports on the side. 8, utility construction, primarily fiber.

The speed that you're traveling, by the time you actually hit the water, it will be the same as if you were hitting concrete. This is called surface tension. Surface tension is the reason why Olympic swimming pools have little sprinklers shooting into the water. It rattles up the water a little bit, allowing the divers to enter the water like this instead of like this. And I don't know about you, but regardless of how much I know about surface tension, it still seems like if my parachute malfunctions, I should still aim for the water. But no surface tension. Science, blah, blah, blah. However, regardless of how annoying surface tension is, without it, our lives would be miserable. How so? Let me explain. Imagine you're walking through your apartment with a glass of water. You trip and fall and spill the glass of water on the floor, creating a puddle. Surface tension is the reason why the puddle of water is only this big and not this big, covering every surface area of ground on your apartment floor. Literally without surface tension, if you spilled a glass of water on the floor, it would travel all over the floor about 2 microns deep. Meaning every time you spilled water, it would literally be impossible to clean all of it up.

Naomi completely crashed out in the best way, in the most supportive way possible for this AJ Lee return. And I'm living for every X post. Starting with this one, I'm pulling out the last few strands of hair I have left. I've waited a decade for this return just to be sitting on the couch now looking crazy. Listen, I feel like we all have been waiting for this return, so I feel your pain. These posts are just so iconic. Those Smackdown newbies don't deserve to share a locker room with AJ. If I was there, would have thrown them half his bags in the hallway. Like the praise she's giving her. It's so amazing. I'm absolutely loving it. And then someone writes back, so what are you doing at home then? Old B punching the air like she is. She's so amazing. I love you, Naomi. She did warn us the other day and let us know that if AJ Lee did return on Smackdown, that we would all witness the biggest crash out of the century on this app. And that's exactly what's happening.

Waylon was with his mother and his mother's boyfriend at the time. This is the mom, Kelsey, and this is the boyfriend, Bobby Gibson. Those two are being held in the Little River County Jail on a charge of injury to a child. It says that Gibson was arrested on Christmas Day, but the mother is also facing felony charges. The investigation determined that the injuries were a result of the mother's boyfriend and happened in Little River County. There's really not much else out there, but looking at these picture of little Waylon, he clearly went through hell. So while everybody was enjoying their Christmas Day, this is what Waylon was going through. This was the result he is make. He has lots of support from his family. This is his father, Dylan Simpson. I will tag him below. I have his permission to share this information. But Waylon is going to need extensive treatment for a long time, including even therapy to get over the emotional damage that happened as well as the physical. This baby was in this mother's care and she let this happen from her boyfriend. And from the look of his picture, he doesn't look very remorsefully. Looks really smug. And this is disgusting. So I'm happy to blast his face on here. I hope that Waylon can get the justice that he deserves. In the meantime, Waylon and his family need our help to help him recover. There is a gofundme. The link is going to be in my bio. I'll let you pause and read some of the information here. And I'm going to leave you with a really heartbreaking video of Waylon. Hey, can I get a bite? Come on, give daddy high five. Oh, good job, knuckles. Oh, good job, buddy.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? I practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't. His girlfriend Ava read over his shoulder then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason, did something happen to Isabella? He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like Usabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Miss. As a Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening, I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve have been helping Mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody, look me in the eyes and said I would never keep your children from you. For six months, she actually kept her word and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup and there was a for sale sign in the yard and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour dissociating because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles away. For months while looking me in the eye every Friday, The next morning a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took 3 days for me to get through to her. She answered and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous. I accepted and she passed the phone to my 8 year old. He cried instantly. Why can't we see you this weekend? My ex immediately answered, daddy's too busy with work. Then hung up on me. My calls wouldn't go through after that and she texted that I had just used up my call for the month. I was so pissed and refused to let her get away with this. So the next week I liquidated my entire 4 o one k to pay a lawyer who told me I was fighting an uphill battle, but at least we could try. I quit my traveling job that I'd worked so hard for and the local position making 40% less. All this was to show the court I was prioritizing my children. Every other weekend I maxed out credit cards to fly to Seattle and my kids would run to me in the airport like I was returning from war. We spent weekends in cramped hotel rooms making blanket Forts and eating McDonald's because that's all I could afford. But they didn't care because we were together. Those weekends were perfect until Sunday drop offs when my ex would make sure to say things in front of me like, daddy doesn't live here. This is just vacation. Remember that your dad is Steve now. I just smile through it while documenting every text where she denied me extra time. After two years of never missing a single visit, the judge finally granted me a week each summer. And when my kids got older, they started asking why mom lied so much about me. I was glad they didn't fall for her lies, especially because she couldn't even acknowledge how hard she made all of this. But her karma came a year later. My phone rang at midnight and when I heard her crying, I almost hung up because I didn't want to deal with her drama.

I refused. And the next day before I left, I found them tearing up my lottery ticket, laughing because I'm envious. But I laughed my head off because that ticket was fake. See, I saw this coming from a mile away. My sister Ruby has always been the golden child and my parents have always made me give her everything. When I got my first job at 16, they made me give Ruby half my paycheck to teach me about sharing. When grandma left me her ring, they gave it to Ruby because she'll get more use out of it. Every birthday, every achievement, every moment of my life, Ruby had to get equal or more. So when I won, I knew they'd pull this exact stunt. The moment I told them, I could see the wheels turning in their heads. Dad immediately launched into his speech about family responsibility while Ruby sat there with that smug smile she gets when she's about to take something that's mine. That night, after they delivered their ultimatum, I heard them whispering in the kitchen, she'll cave, Ruby said confidently. She always does. Mom agreed, saying, I'd never actually leave because I'm too dependent on family. They had no idea they were dealing with someone who'd finally had enough. I spent all night creating a perfect day. Fake ticket. I Work in graphic design, so I knew exactly how to make it look authentic. Same paper, texture, same fonts, everything. The only difference, completely different numbers. That definitely hadn't won anything. I made sure it looked slightly worn, like I've been carrying it around since the drawing. Meanwhile, the real ticket was safely locked in my bank's safety deposit box, already verified and ready for claim. The next morning, I acted devastated. I came to breakfast looking like I've been crying all night. Fine, I said quietly. I'll pack and leave today. I made sure to accidentally leave the fake ticket in my wallet on the kitchen counter. When I went upstairs to pack, the bait was set. Sure enough, 20 minutes later, I heard screaming from downstairs. Amelia, get down here now. Dad's voice was shaking with rage. I walked down to find all three of them huddled around my wallet. The torn pieces of the fake ticket scattered across the counter like confetti. How does it feel now? Ruby laughed, holding up a piece of the the ticket. No lottery money for you. Maybe next time you'll think about what family means. Mom was nodding approvingly. This is what happens when you choose greed over family. Amelia, Dad crossed his arms. Hopefully this teaches you a lesson about sharing. I just stood there a moment, taking it all in. Then I started laughing, quietly at first, then louder. You're absolutely right, I said, still chuckling. That ticket was Completely worthless. Their triumphant expression started to alter. Something in my tone wasn't matching their expectations. I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app, making sure the screen was facing them. 1, 847 30, 329, 18, deposited yesterday at three forty seven PM the silence that followed was deafening. Ruby's mouth literally fell open. Mom grabbed the counter to study herself. Dad just stared at my phone screen like it was showing him a ghost. The real ticket was never in my wallet, I continued calmly. It's been in my bank safety deposit box since the day after I won. That piece of garbage you just tore up, I made it last night specifically for you to find. Ruby's face went from pale to bright red. You, you tricked us. You tricked yourselves. I replied. I just gave you enough rope to hang yourselves with. And boy, did you ever. Amelia, wait, mom started her voice suddenly much. We can work this out. We were just trying to teach you. Teach me what? I interrupted that my own family would destroy what they thought was my future out of spite. Message received loud and clear. Dad tried his authoritative voice. Now hold on just a minute. We're still your parents and, and you just prove that means absolutely nothing to you when money is involved. Ruby was getting desperate. Now, Amelia, come on. We're family. Families fight, but they work things out, right? I mean, we can share The money now, can't we? 50 50, just like we originally talked about. I grabbed my keys from the counter. You're right, Ruby. That ticket you destroyed was worthless, just like this family apparently is. As I I headed for the door, I heard Ruby screaming behind me. You can't just leave. We're your family. You owe us, Amelia. But I was already in my car, driving away to my new life, a life where I'd never again have to pretend that blood relation means more than basic human decency. Ruby's still calling and texting every day, begging for another chance, and I don't answer. Some lessons are permanent. The best part, I'm happier now than I've ever been. Turns out, when you remove toxic people from your life, even winning the lottery feels like the smaller victory.

I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she got to ninth grade, but also had another kid who would constantly bug her. He was always trying to flirt with the girls in my class, which ended with them slapping him on numerous different occasions. I sent him to the office so many times that he had to sit in the front, but one day he practically begged me to sit in the back. I don't know why, but I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and our entire class was silent when at one point, I could hear whispering coming from the back. I looked up, and all I saw was him showing another student what, at first glance, looked like a handgun. It honestly took me a second to process what I had just seen. I didn't have a clear enough view to be sure, and I just sat there trying to stay calm. I knew I had to get a better look, so I stood up to go help one of my students. Now I was sure it wasn't a toy. It was real. I remember my sweat literally dripping off my face and tried my hardest not to pass out. My hands were shaking like crazy while I dialed 9 1 1 on my phone, but it was too quiet to say Anything. Couldn't just walk out of the room. I had to keep my students safe and knew I had to get my daughter out of there. I texted our assistant principal in all caps exactly what I had just seen, and waited minutes for a response. Eventually, I knew I couldn't wait, so I called that same girl over to my desk. I wrote her a note that said, ask me to use the bathroom. Go get the assistant principal, get him to check his phone and leave. The school immediately tried to keep a calm look on my face, but she could see something was horribly wrong. She left without saying anything, and I tried to act like everything was normal. Five excruciating minutes later, he knocked on the door. He walked inside and started chatting with a few students, acting as if nothing was wrong. I think they started to catch on something was going on, too, and eventually, he asked the boy to come out into the hall with him. He stood up, and those few seconds as he walked by my daughter to the door were the most terrifying of my life. As soon as he stepped out, he was tackled to the ground. Apparently, he was planning to use it on another student that lunch. And since then, I homeschool my daughter.

So my sister has been having kids since she was basically a teenager. She got pregnant at 18, married her boyfriend because both sets of parents pushed it. And now at 29, she's got five kids, 11, 6, 3, 2 and 1. And now she's pregnant again. Close with our parents, so we have family dinners a lot. And every single time she starts in on the same routine, how her life sucks, how her body is ruined, how she can't get surgery, how she never has money, never gets time for herself, how no one will watch her kids. It's constant. Her husband works all the time and can't stand her, so she just dumps it all on us. And honestly, her kids are wild. Sitting through those dinners feels like surviving a war zone. What pisses me off is that none of this was forced on her. Our parents gave us the talk at 16, gave us birth control, told us to focus on school and careers before starting families. She wanted a baby at 18. She kept choosing to have kid after kid. She had options. She ignored all of them. So Christmas rolls around and sure enough, she's sitting there with her pity party going on and on about how I don't understand because I've got a degree, a good job, a boyfriend, no kids, can afford to go to the gym. I get to live life. While she's trapped and I just snapped. I told her to shut the fuck up. I told her she's in this mess because she's a moron who made terrible choices and nobody feels sorry for her. My brother started laughing. My parents stayed quiet, which says a lot because behind her back, they complain about her all the time too. And she lost it. Now she's crying on Facebook, making sad TikToks about how society hates mothers and where's her village? And even my family doesn't care about me. But the truth is she built this life herself and I'm done.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

Last month at the dog park, this couple approached me while I was throwing a tennis ball for my dog waffle. The woman immediately started sobbing when she saw him. Her husband had his arm around on her shoulders and explained through his own tears that I had their dog, their baby, who'd escaped from their backyard, and they'd been searching everywhere since I'd found waffle wandering around the parking lot behind my apartment building six months ago. No collar, ribs showing through his matted fur, and figured someone had dumped him. Husband pulled out his phone, showing me dozens of photos that definitely look like waffle. Playing in their backyard, swimming in their pool, sleeping on their couch. He said his name was Cooper, and when he called that name, Waffle's ears perked up and he barked, which made my stomach drop because I've been so sure he was abandoned. The wife was crying into Waffle's fur while he licked her face, and her husband pulled out his wallet and started counting hundred dollar bills. We'll give you five thousand dollars for him, he said, his hands shaking as he held out the cash. I know you've been taking care of him, and we want to reimburse you for everything, food and vet bills and your time, because you saved our baby's life. We thought our lives were over when he got out. I stared at the money feeling sick because I Didn't want their money, and I definitely didn't want to give up waffle. This dog had been my only friend through the worst breakup of my life, sleeping next to me every night when I couldn't stop crying about my ex forcing me to go outside when I wanted to rot in bed forever. But watching this woman sob while showing me more photos of their family vacations with him made my chest hurt. These people were destroyed by losing their dog. And here I was keeping him from his real family when I just been the person who found him. If they were willing to pay $5,000 just to get him back, he must mean everything to. I told them to keep their money and just take him, that I was glad he had people who loved him that much. The woman hugged me so tight I couldn't breathe while thanking me over and over. Waffle kept looking back at me as I handed his leash to the husband, probably confused about why I wasn't coming with them. The woman coaxed him toward their car with an excited voice, telling him they were going home. I told myself he'd be happier with his real family, with a yard and another dog to play with, like in their photos. The husband shook my hand and said, you're a good person. Not many people would do this. And I stood there in the empty dog park trying not to cry. But I couldn't stop myself. Waffle was such a good dog, and I had no idea when we woke up that that was my last day with him. The next three weeks were exactly as horrible as I expected. I kept looking for waffle every time I opened my door, kept saving bacon scraps before remembering he wasn't there to beg for them. I bought a goldfish just to have something alive in my apartment, but it wasn't the same as having someone genuinely excited to see me exist. I started taking different routes home to avoid the dog park, and threw out his bed because looking at it made me want to scream. But I told myself at least he was back where he belonged. I kept hoping I'd hear from his family, that maybe they'd send me a picture of him all settled in, but they never did. Then yesterday, I was scrolling through next door looking for a used coffee table when I saw a post that made me drop my phone. Someone had written warning dog kidnappers active in our neighborhood with a blurry security camera photo attached. The post explained that criminals were stealing purebred dogs from yards and dog parks and selling them to puppy Mills and collectors overseas for massive profits. They worked in pairs, usually a couple, and used fake sob stories about losing their beloved pet to guilt owners into giving up their dogs. My hands were shaking as I clicked on The photo to enlarge it. Even with the terrible quality, I could see it was them. The same couple from the dog park leading someone else's German bird into the same car waffle had climbed into. The post said golden retrievers like mine were especially valuable, particularly the English cream variety, which could sell for $20,000 to collectors in China. I hadn't even known waffle was anything special, just thought he was a regular golden retriever who needed a home. They'd stolen my dog by pretending to love him, using my own decency against me. And we're probably selling him to some.

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. 3,000 dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you, you sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake? Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name. And track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look, the same guilty look they've been giving each other for months. Whenever grandma brought up gifts or money, I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The Same design, the same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. The Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved up. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought to a 3 thousand dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara's been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents because last month she asked me for 20 dollars for gas money. The month before that she needed 50 dollars for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Warren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Lara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing. And everyone at the table. Knew it. Grandma leaned forward, her eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

Back when I was 14, my dad and I were cleaning off his workbench. I found what I thought was a melted piece of metal wrapped up in a cloth. I asked him what it was and he said something along the lines of, wow, I didn't think I still had that. He told me that one day when I was over 18, he tell me what it really was. For four years, that thing consumed my thoughts. I'd sneak into the garage during family barbecues, Christmas mornings, random afternoons just to stare at that wrapped object in Dad's toolbox. The cloth was old and stained. Sometimes I pick it up, feeling its weight, trying to guess what could require an 18th birthday revelation. My friends thought I was crazy. Just unwrap it when he's not home, they'd say. But something about Dad's tone that day stopped me. I tried everything to get him to crack, bribery, guilt trips, bargaining. What if I get straight A's? What if something happens to you before I turn 18? Nothing worked. He'd just get that same distant look and say, when you're 18, son. The mystery drove me insane. I'd lie away creating elaborate theories, each more dramatic than the last. Uncle Mike used to be Dad's business partner and best friend. Small construction company, always laughing. At family gatherings, Mike was like a second father, teaching me football, sneaking me extra dessert. When mom wasn't looking. Then when I was 8, Mike just disappeared. No goodbye, no explanation. When? When I'd ask, mom would get this weird look and change the subject. Dad would mumble about Mike moving to Arizona. Our house changed after Mike left. Dad started locking the garage at night. He'd get jumpy whenever someone knocked on the door. Mom would find him staring out the kitchen window at 3:00am just watching the street. They thought I didn't notice, but kids pick up on everything. Years passed. No Christmas cards, no phone calls, like he'd vanished. But sometimes I'd catch dad staring at old photos of them together. The morning after my 18th birthday, I cornered him in the kitchen. Today's the day, dad. He sat down, his coffee with shaking hands. You sure you wanna know some things? Once you know them, you can't unknow them. I nodded. Heart pounding. He disappeared into the garage and came back with that familiar bundle. We sat at the kitchen table as he slowly began unwrapping it. His hands were trembling. This is about Mike, he said quietly, about why he really disappeared. The cloth fell away, revealing something jagged and twisted. Mike and I were doing well with the business, but Mike started getting greedy, skimming money from job sites, overcharging clients. I kept covering for him, thinking he'd straighten out. Dad's voice got quieter. One night, Mike showed up here completely drunk, eyes wild. Your mom?

The most gorgeous boy in our school, Parker, slid a signed Taylor Swift vinyl across the cafeteria table and asked me, so, can you teach me Japanese? I nearly choked on my apple juice. Parker was the guy every girl wanted. Soccer captain, perfect smile, the kind of handsome that made teachers forget what they were saying mid sentence. And he was talking to me, the girl who spent lunch reading. Why do you need Japanese? I told Akira I lived in Tokyo for a year. He rubbed his neck. Stupid first day lie. Now she keeps speaking Japanese to me, and I just nod like I understand. Akira Suzuki, of course. The exchange student who'd basically become our school's Akira in character. She had Disney princess eyes and a smile that made every guy melt. Her cousin's birthday party is in three weeks. She invited me. He pushed the vinyl closer. This is signed from the heiress tour. It's yours if you help me. His brown eyes actually looked panicked. Not like other girls. She cares about real things. I can't mess this up. I held the vinyl up to the light to examine it. Pen pressure, check. Letter spacing, check. It really was an authentic signature. You got yourself a deal! I exclaimed. First lesson, Parker showed up with coffee and colour coded notebooks. Adorable. Okay, basics first, I said. Konnichiwa genki desu ka no He leaned forward. Teach me how to flirt in Japanese. How to not sound like a tourist. I wanna talk to her about things she cares about. That was sweet. I expected him to want cheesy pickup lines. Start with pronunciation. Say Akira. Akira. No, you need to soften the R. Like this. Akira. He tried again. Failed. I sighed. Here. I took his hand and placed it on my throat, ignoring how my pulse jumped. Feel how gentle it is. Akira. His fingers spread against my neck. Akira, he whispered, and suddenly the room felt too small. Better? I stepped back. Practice that. Something in my chest fluttered. You're a really patient teacher, he said on Wednesday, after finally nailing a difficult phrase. You're a good student, really. He grinned, and I realized I never seen him truly smile before. Not the popular guy smile. A real one. By week two, we moved past basics. I caught him Haiku in his car after practice. He'd repeat lines about cherry blossoms while I tried not to notice how the sunset made his eyes look like honey. What does this mean? He showed me a line he found. When I think of you, I forget both time and place. Throat went dry. It means love makes you lose track of everything else. Huh? He stared at the words. That's beautiful. Thursday we practice traditional dance moves. I wasn't sure why, but he insisted that it would come in handy one day. Anything for a Taylor Swift signed vinyl, I guess. Terrible at this. He laughed as he stepped on my foot again. You're not. I adjusted his hand position. Just follow my lead. His mom walked by his room and smiled at us. Sorry about her, he said. She thinks we're. Never mind. What? Nothing. But his ears turned red. The final week, something shifted. He text me Japanese puns late at night. Bring me mochi because I mentioned loving it once. Stay after our sessions just to talk in English. You know what's weird? He said. Tuesday night, lying on his bedroom floor while we studied. I started this to impress Akira, but now I just really love the language. Yeah? Yeah. Like this. He sat up. How do you say I lose track of time with you? Key me to IRU to jikan wo suru tsuretsushimae. He repeated it, looking right at me. The air went thick. That's, um. That's good. Akira will like that, right? Then came our last session. He was fluent enough to hold conversations, quote poetry, even make jokes. He Learned an entire language in three weeks. Let's do one final practice, he said. Full romantic confession. My stomach hurt. Okay. He took my hands. I tried to memorize the feeling. Kimi to iru to subete GA imi WA motsu Kimi WA zutto bokunoko kocoron iita. When I'm with you, everything has meaning. You're like a song that was always in my heart. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't stop wishing those words were for me. Perfect, I whispered. You're going to sweep her off her feet. Something crossed his face. Think Akira will feel it, too? How could she not? Friday, the whole school watched Parker approach Akira at her locker. I stood by the water fountain, feeling sick. Oh, hi. You Akira San Yankee. Good morning, Akira. How are you? She turned surprised. Then he started speaking the Japanese I taught him.

My ex husband remarried three years ago to this woman, Beth, who came with twin daughters Madison and Mackenzie. They're both 15, same age as my daughter Chloe. When Chloe stays there every other weekend, she has to share a room with both of them because apparently there's no space for her to have her own room in their four bedroom house. Last month, Chloe came back from her dad's place looking exhausted. I asked what was wrong and she just shrugged it off like usual. But when she fell asleep on the couch at seven PM, I knew something was up. My kid never goes to sleep early unless she's sick. The next weekend she came back looking even worse, dark circles under her eyes, cranky all day, complaining about everything. Finally, I cornered her in the kitchen while she was making cereal. What's really going on at your dad's place, I asked. She stirred her lucky charms for like a full minute before answering. The twins think it's funny to make me sleep on the floor. They told me their beds are too good for someone who doesn't really belong in their family. My stomach dropped. What do you mean sleep on the floor? She looked up at me with these tired eyes. They took my pillow and blanket the first night and hid them when I asked, dad. And Beth about it. Madison said I was lying and that I probably just lost them. Beth believed her instead of me. I felt my face getting hot. Where does your dad think you sleep in the bed with them. That's what they tell him. But every night after everyone's asleep, they wake me up and make me get on the floor. They say if I tell dad, they'll make sure he knows what a troublemaker I am and maybe he won't want me visiting anymore. That was it. I grabbed my phone and called my ex immediately. Your daughters are making Chloe sleep on the floor, I said as soon as he picked up. What? That's not true. She shares the bed with them. Ask them right now if that's what really happens at night. There was silence and I heard him calling for the girls. Five minutes later, he called back. They admit they've been making her get on the floor, but they say it's because she kicks in her sleep and keeps them awake. the solution is to make a 15 year old girl sleep on a hardwood floor with no pillow or blanket? Are you insane? We'll figure something out, he said. But I could tell he was already making excuses in his head. No, we won't. I've already figured it out. The next Friday when it was time for Chloe to go to her dad's, I drove her straight to the Hampton Inn down The street from his house. Instead, I walked up to the front desk with my credit card. I need a room for my daughter for the weekend, just her. She's 15. The desk clerk looked confused. Is there an adult staying with her? No, but her father lives two minutes away. If there's an emergency, here's his number. I handed over a piece of paper with my ex.

The reunion was at Lake Tahoe. 60 relatives I hadn't seen since I was 12, all pretending we were some perfect family. My sister Katie had organized the whole thing, rented this massive cabin, matching t shirts with Henderson Family Reunion 2019 in cursive, a photographer, the works. I should have known something was up when they insisted I ride separately. Your car has better gas mileage, dad said. Follow us. We'll stop for lunch halfway. The drive from Portland was eight hours. I'd taken three days off from my job at the bookstore, or spent money I didn't have on gas and a gift for my grandma's 80th. Katie had guilted me for months about missing family events. You never show up for anything, she'd said. Just this once, please. Halfway through Nevada, they pulled into a Chevron outside Reno. Desert heat shimmering off the asphalt. I parked behind Dad's Escalade, went inside for Red Bull and trail mix. The cashier was counting change for some kid buying candy. Maybe three minutes total. When I came out, they were recording me on their phones through the windows, laughing as they peeled out of the parking lot. Mom was filming from the passenger seat. Even my teenage nephew Jake, had his phone up. The group text lit up immediately. 23 messages before I could even process what happened. Hope you brought a map. First one home wins. It's just a prank. Bro, don't be such a baby. Katie sent a gift of someone crying. They thought I'd panic. Panic, call them crying, beg for help. Classic Marcus. Right, the sensitive one. The theater kid who cried during Pixar movies. The one who still went to therapy. The one they called too soft at every family dinner. I sat in my Honda for 20 minutes, engine off, reading their messages. Dad posted a video to the family Facebook group. 67 likes, comments flooding in. Hilarious. Marcus will laugh about this later. Great prank. My aunt commented. He probably needs this. Toughen him up. That's when something shifted. This crystalline moment of clarity. They didn't leave me as a joke. They left me because they genuinely thought I needed to be taught a lesson. About what? Being myself. I turned my car around and drove to San Francisco. No dramatic goodbye text, no explanation. Just turned off my phone and drove west toward the bay. Found a hostel in the tenderloin that first night. Sketchy as hell, but it was 40 bucks and they didn't ask questions. Found a studio apartment that same week. Fourth floor, walk up in the mission. Bars on the windows. Radiator that sounded like it was dying, but it was mine. Bartending job at this dive called the Broken Clock. The owner, Tommy, was this ex Marine who hired me on the spot when I made him laugh during the interview. Deleted Facebook, changed my number the hardest Part was explaining to my old co workers why I needed my last paycheck mailed to a California address. For three months, I built a new life, made friends with the other bartenders, started dating this girl, Sarah, who worked at the coffee shop next door. Joined a community theatre group. Nobody knew about my family. I was just Marcus from Portland who moved for a fresh start. Then the email started. Six months after the Chevron incident, my cousin Derek sent an email to my work address. The one from the bookstore website, apparently

What happened afterwards with your life? I've been dating Sophia for four years when I finally decided to ask the big question. Her parents treated me like their own son, especially after they found out I grew up in foster care. Her little brother would literally follow me around their house, begging me to teach him how to fix engines. Someone who never had a real family, being part of theirs felt like everything I've been missing my whole life. I've been saving every extra dollar from my job at Murphy's Auto Shop for months. The ring wasn't fancy, just a simple band with a small diamond. But it was real, and it was all I could afford. I planned everything perfectly. Sophia's dad was turning 60, and they were throwing this big backyard BBQ. All her family would be there, plus her closest friends. She always said family was the most important thing to her, so I figured proposing surrounded by everyone who loved us both would be perfect. The party was going great. Sophia's mom made her famous brisket. Her dad was telling embarrassing stories about Sophia as a kid, and everyone was laughing and having a good time. After they brought out the birthday cake and saying happy birthday, I figured it was the perfect moment. My hands were shaking as I tapped my beer bottle with a fork to get everyone's attention. The whole backyard went dead silent. Sophia looked confused. At first. Then her eyes went wide. When I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring box, her mom gasped and started tearing up. Her dad had this huge smile on his face. Her friends were already pulling out their phones to record the moment. I opened the box and said all the things I've been practicing in my head for weeks. How much I loved her, how she changed my life, how I wanted to spend forever making her happy. The words just poured out of me. But Sophia just stood there, frozen. Not good. Frozen like she was overwhelmed with happiness. Add frozen like she'd seen a ghost. Liam, she finally said, and I could hear the panic in her voice, I love you so much, but I'm not ready for this. I'm so sorry. The silence that followed was the worst sound I'd ever heard. 30 people just staring at us, not knowing what to do or where to look. I stayed on one knee for probably five seconds too long, trying to process what had just happened. Then, and I slowly stood up, shoved the ring box back in my pocket, and nodded. Okay, I said, because what else could I say? Sophia reached for my arm, but I stepped back. I couldn't deal with her trying to comfort me in front of everyone. I mumbled something about needing to go and walked straight to my truck. The drive home was the longest. 20 minutes of my life. I stayed up all night staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation we'd ever had. About the future. We talked about getting married, about kids, about buying a house together. How had I read everything so wrong? The next day, I was under the hood of a broken down Chevy trying to lose myself in work, when I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up expecting to see my boss, but it was so.

And don't even get me started on. Show you're working out, Buddy. I got the answer. Why do you care how I got it? You're a math teacher, not a detective.

Then exams pull up like, hey, remember this one topic we spent five minutes on back in September 2023? No. I don't even remember what I had for breakfast. And yet somehow we're judged on a few sheets of paper in a sweaty exam hall with a broken clock and a pencil. That's losing the will to live. But, yeah, tell me again how this prepares me for life.

Someone stole my mountain bike from my apartment's bike rack last month. This wasn't some cheap Walmart bike, it was a 2,800 dollar trek that I'd saved for months to buy. I filed a police report, but honestly I didn't expect much help. The bike had GPS tracking built into the frame, part of the anti theft package I paid extra for. Most thieves don't know about embedded trackers. So I pulled up the app to see where my bike ended up. It was moving through downtown, then stopped at an address about 3 miles away. I waited a few hours to see if it would move again, but it stayed put. The GPS showed it was in someone's garage. I drove over to check it out. Sketchy neighborhood, run down houses, and sure enough, it was my bike. In this guy's open garage next to about six other expensive bikes that definitely didn't belong to him. Here's the thing. I couldn't just call the cops and say my bike is in that garage. They'd need proof it was actually mine, and this guy would probably just deny everything. So I came up with a plan. I went home and printed out fake flyers advertising a cash for bikes business. Made it look like I was buying used bikes, no questions asked. The next day I knocked on the guy's door. Mid 30s, covered in tattoos. Looked exactly like someone who'd Steal bikes for a living. Hey, man, I saw you've got some nice bikes in your garage, I said, showing him the flyer. I buy bikes for cash. Interested in selling any? His eyes lit up immediately. Yeah, I've got some bikes. What kind of prices are you talking? Depends on the condition and model. Mind if I take a look? He LED me straight to the garage, where I counted eight stolen bikes, including mine. My Trek was right there. Still had the custom handlebar grips I'd installed. This Trek looks nice, I said, examining my own bike. How much you want for it? That's a good one, he replied. I'm thinking $800. Perfect. He was trying to sell me my own stolen bike. Tell you what, I said, I'm interested in this track, but I need to check with my business partner about the price. Can I get your contact info and maybe come back tomorrow? He gave me his name, Danny, and his phone number. I told him I'd call him later. As soon as I got home, I called the police and explained the situation. I had GPS evidence showing my bike at his

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything, my location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part, she started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out. And my mom replied, sure thing, buddy, with way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me? My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid, but friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

He said, wouldn't you rather drive straight to the hospital? Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk typed something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She. I knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beeping machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me and from the moment we announced became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd flash, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and you first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations. But I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Now they're homeless with kids and I refuse to let them back in my life. When I was 22, I inherited our grandmother's house, a beautiful Victorian with enough space for my brother and his family to stay while they saved for their own place. They moved in with their two kids, promising it would only be temporary, just six months. My brother assured me, we'll be out of your hair before you know it. His wife despised me from day 1. She'd make snide comments about how I decorated, complained that I was too loud when I came home from my nursing shifts and acted like I was invading her space in my own house. She'd rearrange my kitchen without asking, throw away my mail, claiming it was junk, and lecture me about proper household management while I was paying all the bills. The passive aggression escalated weekly. She'd use my expensive shampoo, then deny it when confronted. My leftovers would disappear from the fridge and she'd claim she thought they were communal food when I started labelling everything with my name. She complained to my brother that I was being petty and territorial. I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour, but he always made excuses. She's stressed about money. She's not used to living with other people. You're being too sensitive. Every conversation ended with him defending her and dismissing my concerns. The breaking point came six Months later, I arrived home exhausted from a double shift to find her screaming at me in the hallway. She claimed I've been stealing money from her purse and eating her food from the fridge. Both accusations were ridiculous. I made decent money and kept my own groceries clearly labeled. You've been sneaking into our room, she shrieked, her face red with manufactured rage. I know you took $40 from my wallet last Tuesday. I stared at her in disbelief. I worked 12 hour shifts. When exactly would I have time to rifle through your belongings? Don't lie to me, she spat. I have proof. My brother stood behind her, silent as she launched into a tirade about how I was jealous of their family and trying to sabotage their marriage. When I tried to defend myself, she burst into tears and ran to their room. That night, my brother knocked on my door. His face was stone cold, a look I'd never seen directed at me before. We need to talk, he said. He told me his wife had been documenting everything. Times I allegedly took money, instances where I supposedly threatened her when he wasn't around, photos of missing food items. None of it was true, but he believed every word. She'd created a detailed log with dates, times and descriptions of my supposed crimes. You're toxic and you're tearing our family apart, he said. We're done enabling your behavior. I stared at him in disbelief. This was The same brother who'd cry.

What happened? I woke up during throat surgery when I was 23. They had me knocked out to remove some polyps on my vocal cords, but something went horribly wrong with the anesthesia. When I first opened my eyes, I couldn't move a muscle. I was completely paralyzed from the medicine, but fully conscious. Everything felt muffled at first, like I was underwater. Then I started hearing snippets of conversation. The surgeon was discussing a baseball game with the nurse while he worked on my throat. I tried to scream to let them know I was awake, but my body wouldn't respond. I. I could feel everything. The cold metal of the tools sliding down my throat. The burning sensation as they cut away the growths. The metallic taste of blood pooling at the back of my mouth. But I couldn't even twitch a finger to signal I was conscious. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it would burst. But the monitors didn't show any change. The paralytic they gave me was working perfectly. Too perfectly. I was trapped in my own body, forced to experience every excruciating second. At one point, the surgeon made a joke about my tattoos. Look at all this ink, he said. Wonder what her parents think. The nurse laughed and said something about kids these days. I wanted to cry, but couldn't even do that. Then things got worse. I felt this sharp, searing pain as something Went wrong. The surgeon swore under his breath. Damn it, we've got a bleeder. My throat was filling with blood faster than they could suction it out. The calm discussion about baseball was replaced with urgent commands. BP is dropping. Get me more suction. Where's that clamp? I. I could feel myself choking, drowning in my own blood, but still couldn't move. That's when the anesthesiologist finally noticed something was off with my readings. He rushed to adjust something in my IV, and everything started fading to black. The last thing I heard was him saying, she's fighting the paralytic. When I woke up in recovery, the nurse asked how I was feeling. I wrote on my notepad. I heard everything. The baseball game, the joke about my tattoos, the bleeding. Her face went white. They pulled my records and discovered my body had metabolized the anesthesia way faster than normal, but the paralytic had stayed at full strength. Apparently, it's a rare genetic condition that runs in my family, something my mom forgot to mention. The hospital tried to sweep it all under the rug. They offered to waive all my medical bills if I sign some papers promising not to sue. But that wasn't what I wanted. I just wanted them to document my case so it wouldn't happen to anyone else. The surgeon and anesthesiologist came to apologize later that day. The surgeon looked like he hadn't slept in days. He kept saying how sorry he was. About the tattoo comments, I wrote back the baseball game was more offensive. Yankees suck. But here's the crazy part. When they checked the surgery recording, apparently they film everything for teaching purposes. They found something disturbing during the bleeding incident.

This way if a police dog smells something unusual, they will only find the dead animal. If you want to get rid of a crime weapon, the best way to do it is to melt it down into a block of steel, then throw it in the ocean. This way it will sink to the bottom and if someone finds it, they will never know what it originally was. If you want to trespass onto someone's property, bring a dog leash with you. If someone asks why you're there, just tell them your dog ran off and you're trying to find it. If your grandmother is racist, create a photo montage of your brother or sister in a situation that will upset her. She will remove them from her will so you will inherit a larger share.

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents, who raised me, wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess, and I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted cryptic Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every. Every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was Going on at home. Needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep and drinking to get through the day. Then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After two months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had zero family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway, knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Greggy, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Greggy's Instagram on his own phone. Border, really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere. Right there over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said, while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up except for Gregorius. Gregorius showed up mysteriously in my Valorant lobby. Hey, Mel, it's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things, school friends. My strict parent, he never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained about my Parents or tried to turn me against them when I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, he said once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break, she asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay. My heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it. After she left, Greggy messaged, maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on and thank god I didn't lose him because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Greggy on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came home from College, completely wasted with two other friends. Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring, can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he'd be home. She tried calling her parents, but they didn't pick up. And I didn't have my own parents number.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together, for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. Get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy? I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text at 7:00am. Could you Drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else? Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't Admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie Marissa had been extra friendly all night. Kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend. And I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week three, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show.

I work in semiconductors, where precision matters in circuits and apparently not in HR complaints. This started when management moved a new girl, 22, to my department, and I, thirty four, had to train her. This woman had quite the reputation around our facility. Multiple guys had mysteriously disappeared from the company after working with her, with whispered break room stories about false reports and HR drama following in her wake. Her personnel file probably needed its own storage cabinet at this point. From day one, her behavior was off. At first, she was oddly shy around me, but that quickly evolved into something else entirely. As the days passed, she got increasingly flirtatious and super hands on. All touchy feely. She'd even mention how cute she thought I was and so on. I'll admit I did play along with her, but never in any kind of inappropriate way. She added me on social media and we swapped info since she'd mentioned wanting to hang out. So I guess one weekend she saw on social media that I'd gone to the park. When Monday rolled around, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically. She barely spoke to me, slammed equipment down, and gave me death glares across the clean room. Turns out she was mad that I didn't call her, which felt really immature and honestly just nuts. Especially since we never actually made any real plans or anything. A few Weeks later, that same flirty energy was still going strong. Then I ended up out sick for a few days with a nasty stomach bug. I couldn't keep anything down, not even water. So I stayed home.

I'm a courthouse security guard. And last Tuesday, this guy in a three thousand dollar suit storms past metal detector, setting off every alarm. When I try stopping him, he shoves me aside hard enough that I stumble backward into the well. I'm late for my hearing. Touch me again and you're fired. Do you know who I am? Turns out he's Marcus Wellington, tech CEO whose company Data Vault got sued for stealing employee pensions. The guy's been all over the news for months, but apparently thinks rules don't apply to billionaires. He barges into courtroom 3 where his case is being heard. Designer shoes clicking loudly on marble floors. But he's so entitled and distracted by his platinum iPhone that he doesn't realize something major has changed since last appearance. The judge stops mid sentence and stares at him over her glasses. Mr. Wellington, you're 40 minutes late to your own criminal trial. Traffic was absolutely terrible, your honor. My driver took some ridiculous detour. Anyway, let's get this pathetic joke over with. How much do I need to pay these losers to make this frivolous lawsuit disappear? The entire courtroom goes dead silent. You could hear a pin drop. His own defense attorney, some fancy lawyer in an Armani suit, is frantically making shut up gestures and sliding urgent papers toward him. But Marcus waves him off without even glancing down. Honestly, if these people were actually Smart enough to read their employment contracts properly? They wouldn't be working minimum wage jobs for me in the first place. This is basic business literacy. A middle aged woman in the gallery, clearly one of his former employees, starts crying quietly. Marcus notices her tears and actually laughs out loud. Oh come on, Karen, you worked at Data Vault for three years. You absolutely had to know what you were signing when you handed over your pension contributions. He pulls out his latest iPhone Pro and starts casually scrolling.

I was 19, sitting in a police station at 3:00am with bloody knuckles, watching my best friend's dad walk through the door to bail me out instead of my own father. The fluorescent lights made everything look worse. Swollen eye. The dried blood on my white T-shirt. The disappointment in Officer Rivera's eyes as she processed my paperwork. She'd known me since I was a kid, shooting hoops at the community center where she volunteered. Two hours earlier, I'd thrown the first punch at a guy who wouldn't stop harassing a girl at a party. I didn't know her. Didn't matter. She'd said no 14 times. I counted. And when he grabbed her wrist, something in me snapped. My fist connected with his jaw, and suddenly five guys were on me. I remembered the crack of my head against the coffee table, the taste of blood, someone yelling to call the cops. My parents hadn't answered my call. They never did when it was late. Their way of teaching responsibility. Three missed calls to my dad, straight to voicemail. So I called Mitch, my best friend since fifth grade. The guy who shared his lunch with me every day in middle school when my parents got to give me lunch money. When I saw his dad walk in, still in pajama pants, with his hair sticking up on one side, exhaustion in his eyes, shame hit me harder than any punch. From the fight, Mister Davis signed papers without complaint, noted respectfully to Officer Rivera, and motioned for me to follow him out. He didn't lecture me during the silent drive, just asked if I was hungry and pulled into Denny's, the only 24 hour diner in our small town. The waitress, Shelly, knew him by name, brought his coffee without asking. Your dad called me back, he said, finally, stirring his coffee methodically, the spoon clinking against ceramic in the empty restaurant. Told me to let you sit in jail until morning. Build character, were his words. Stared at my untouched pancakes, eyes burning with tears I refused to let fall. 19 years old and still hoping for a father who would show up. I'm sorry, I managed to say.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

I had this one kid in my class whose IQ was probably a few points higher than Homer Simpsons. I found this on my first day when he took out a blender, then interrupted class to ask if anyone had any fruit so he could make a smoothie. That same day, I left the class for a minute to laminate something, and when I came back, he was at my desk eating my lunch. He said that he needed something to eat with his drink and thought it was out there for everyone to snack on. Two weeks later, during his first test, he wrote your name beside the write your name heading at the top. He was by far the worst performing student in the class because he was always on his phone, even during tests. Whenever he'd stay after school to catch up on work, he'd tell me he's always on his phone because he's making money. At the time, I just brushed it off and told him he still can't use it in class. But one day, in the middle of a test, he screamed, oh, my god! Yes! In one motion, he stood up and took off running to the bathroom, accidentally knocking down the girl who was in the chair beside him. He came back 10 minutes later, and I told him to stay behind after class. I asked him what that was. All about. And he went on to tell me that when he said he makes money on his phone during class, he wasn't lying. He then told me that he does that stock trading thing and said while checking his green and red arrows, I noticed one of his stocks boomed and made him a lot of money. I didn't believe a word, but then he showed me the proof. He opened an app called Bloom in front of me and showed me his portfolio. This kid who was genuinely failing Algebra 1, had made over $400 profit in a couple of months. He told me he started from zero and just use the rewards the app gives you to start. I was sort of interested by this and asked him if he could give me some tips to start myself. He replied, I don't really know what I'm doing. Just get bloom.

When I was in elementary school, my best friend was a girl named Raquel. And because I was a very anxious and shy kid, I let her walk all over me. I did her homework for her and gave her the treats out of my lunch. And in return, she'd throw me under the bus constantly. I remember people started rumors about me and my family, but instead of defending me, she laughed at me with them. The worst part was how the very next day, she'd come up to me acting like nothing happened, and then once again asked me to do her homework. We're best friends, and best friends do things for each other, she'd say. There was one time she began punching my arm for seemingly no reason, so I grabbed her hands to make her stop. She suddenly began crying loudly, and everyone came to her defense, including our teacher, who told me, why don't you back off? I think you did enough for today. I was kept alone in the classroom during lunchtime, and when everyone came back, there was a rumor that I had tried to choke her to death. I tried to tell everyone I just held onto her hands when she was punching me, but no one believed me. And there she was in the middle of the crowd, not saying a word, taking in all the love and attention from the Class. I somehow finally came to my senses when we were 8. She invited me for a sleepover at her place. We were watching Pirates of the Caribbean, fangirling over Johnny Depp, when at one point during the movie, she told me I could rest my head on her if I felt tired. I did just that towards the end of the movie, and she shrugged me off of her. I asked why she did that, and she said, I never said you could put your head on me. If you do this again, I'll stab you. I laughed awkwardly, thinking she was joking or something. She said, I'm serious. There's a knife in the kitchen I stole from my mom. It's under the fridge. If you touch me again, I'll unalive you.

When I was 12, I called CPS, but not to protect myself. I just been adopted by a couple who could never have their own kids. And they seem so nice. At first, they never yelled at me like my bio mom or dad did. They gave me ice cream just for existing. And they tucked me into bed with hot chocolate by my bedside every night. I was convinced any kid would be lucky to have them as parents. That's why when I found out they had miraculously gotten pregnant, I cheered. However, that's when things changed. It was like a switch. But not in the way they treated me, rather, in the way they treated him. My adoptive parents instantly became obsessed with Raising Jacob as this perfect and gifted child. They hung this huge chart in the kitchen marking every milestone the day they took him from the hospital. If Jacob didn't sit up, walk, or talk exactly when the internet said he should, they get this anxious look and start whispering to each other. By the time Jacob was nine months old, they were already making him do these daily flashcards. I watched from the hallway as my dad sighed heavily whenever Jacob got distracted or confused. It felt weird and uncomfortable, but I thought maybe they were just stressed out about being new parents. It got worse when Jacob turned 2. They signed him up For these advanced toddler classes, trying to teach him Latin on top of English at home, they spent hours drilling him on letters and numbers. If Jacob got something wrong, they tense up, their faces showing clear disappointment. Sometimes Jacob would cry at night. Instead of comforting him, they'd stand over his crib with their arms folded until he stopped. They said it would build character. I started noticing how anxious Jacob got all the time. He'd pick nervously at his fingers. His eyes always looked like he was waiting for someone to yell at him. One night after a preschool meeting, I heard his teacher mention that Jacob was struggling socially. On the drive home, my parents lectured Jacob non stop about embarrassing the family. He sat silently in his car seat, tears rolling down his cheeks. From that day, dinner became a nightmare. Jacob was no longer allowed to eat until he perfectly recited whatever they drilled him on that day.

I was 17 when my sister Lucy called me crying from school. She was 14 and had gotten her first period during gym class. She had no supplies and was too embarrassed to ask anyone at school. Lucy called me instead of our parents because I was only 10 minutes away while they were both at work. I rushed to the pharmacy and grabbed pads, tampons, and even some chocolate because I wasn't sure what she needed. Got to the school in eight minutes flat. Lucy was hiding behind the gym building, tears streaming down her face, trying to cover the stain on her shorts with her backpack. I met her at the side gate and handed her the bag through the fence. He thanked me and ran inside to the bathroom. I waited in my car to make sure she was okay, playing some music and texting my mom about what happened. Everything seemed fine, then I saw this older teacher walking toward my car. He looked angry and was talking on his phone. Within minutes, three more staff members surrounded my Honda as security guard knocked on my window and told me to step out immediately. The teacher said he witnessed me talking to a distressed female student behind the building. He claimed the girl looked scared and ran away after I gave her something. They asked for my ID and started questioning me about why I was On school property during class hours. I tried explaining that Lucy was my sister, but they weren't listening.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes when I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. David, I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before. I drove to my old elementary school playground and sat On the same swing where dad used to push me before work completely consumed his life. Before he became just a distant voice I sometimes heard. Coming home at 2:00am, something inside me finally broke that night. All the anger I'd bottled up for years spilled over at once. I pulled out my phone and texted him.

And in it she admitted she'd lied about who my real father was. My dad Trevor, had always been this gentle guy who worked nights at the factory and came home smelling like metal and machine oil. Mom would heat up his dinner plate at 2:00am when his shift ended. He'd kiss my forehead before I went to school, even when I pretended to be asleep. Normal dad stuff. But I always wondered why I looked nothing like him. I'm tall with dark hair and green eyes. Dad's short with blond hair and brown eyes. Mom always said I got lucky with the gene pool. That sometimes kids just look different. I believed her, because what kid questions that? When Grandma Rose died last month, she left me this speed up leather diary from 1987. I almost threw it away until I found the page with my name on it. She'd written about the night I was born. How mom was crying in the hospital room, begging grandma to never tell anyone the truth about who my real father was. Turns out my actual father is Mom's boss at the insurance office where she worked before I was born. His name is David Walsh. Grandma wrote that mom had an affair with him for six months when she got pregnant. He wanted nothing to do with it. He was married with two kids of his own. Mom was terrified and ashamed. So when Trevor asked her to marry him three months later, she said yes and never told him I wasn't his. I sat in my car outside Mom's house for an hour, holding that diary, trying to figure out what to say. When I finally went inside, she was folding laundry in the living room. I just put the diary on the coffee table and watched her face go white. She didn't even try to deny it. She just started crying and said she never wanted me to find out because Trevor had been such a good father to me. She begged me not to tell him because it would destroy him. The weird part was, I wasn't even angry at her. I was angry at this David guy who basically abandoned me before I was even born. So I looked him up online. He still works at the same insurance.

Tony had hired the most expensive, expensive law firm in town and was going for blood. Their partnership had ended badly six months earlier when Tony suddenly decided Nico wasn't contributing enough and forced him out with just 48 hours notice. Now Nico was running a single food truck while Tony expanded to three locations, and Tony wanted to crush any competition. The evidence look damming. Tony had screenshots of Nico's new menu featuring Nico's famous sauce, and bank records showing Nico bought identical ingredients and Marzano tomatoes, aged balsamic, specific herbs a week after their partnership ended. He even had photos of Nico's sauce bottles that looked nearly identical to theirs. He copied everything, Tony testified smugly, adjusting his expense of suit, the recipe, the marketing strategy, even the bottle design. I have the original recipe cards with my handwriting from 2019 when I spent months perfecting it through trial and error. Tony's lawyer presented a thick folder of evidence, handwritten notes, ingredient lists given customer feedback forms praising the innovative sauce. The judge seemed convinced, nodding along as Tony described his creative process. Nico looked completely defeated beside me. His hands were shaking as he watched his former partner lie under oath. This food truck was his only income. After he kicked him out and he couldn't afford to lose everything over a bogus lawsuit. When it was my turn to cross examine Tony, I kept it simple.

We talked through possible scenarios, practiced ways to cope, and packed his noise canceling headphones. I even reached out to Henry's mom to make sure she knew Lucas might need breaks or might have to head out early. When we arrived, he hesitated at the gate, grabbed my hand, and whispered, mom, I'm nervous, but I really wanna try. My heart nearly burst. Everything was perfect. Lucas stayed in the shallow end, laughing with two other boys. He ate cake without getting overwhelmed by the singing. I started to relax, watching from a distance so he could feel independent. Then some teenagers cannonballed right next to him. The splash, screaming, and sudden chaos triggered him instantly. I saw his face change, that distant look I know too well. He started stimming, flapping his hands and making his high pitched humming sound. I rushed over, but before I could reach him, Lucas was in full meltdown. He covered his ears, screaming and rocking. The other parents stared. Some kids backed away. While others whispered and pointed. When I finally reached him, I saw a teenage girl recording us on her phone. I snapped, stop filming my son! She stopped and walked off. Two days later, a parent messaged me. Their kid had shown them a video on TikTok. The clip showed Lucas's meltdown, no context at all, with laughing, crying emojis.

They developed a family channel where cameras were in every room, scripts were taped to the fridge, and every holiday, every family dinner, every moment was filmed. Made us rehearse how to laugh, how to hug, how to cry. If you cried wrong, you did it again. And if you still made a mistake, they would pull out a small bottle of lemon juice and place two drops in each eye. So I Learned how to get it right the first time. People online called us perfect. And I agree. We were perfect. Perfectly fake. Mom practiced sad speeches in the mirror to start her day, while my dad made my brother refilm lines for brand deals at 4 in the morning, right before classes. They taught me how to smile and flirt with the camera. My parents controlled all of my meals. Keep being at just below 1,000 calories daily. It was really bad, but I was told that I had it good compared to everyone else. It wasn't until I turned 15 when my health collapsed that I started saying no. I refused a product because it gave me a rash so severe that I had to go to the hospital and take topical treatment for two weeks. Was the last time I smiled for a camera. I didn't set up myself. The day after I recovered, my parents set me up for another makeup brand, saying that it wouldn't give me a rash this time. I said no and hid in the bathroom. Before filming, my mom tried saying sweet and encouraging things through the stall door, but when it didn't work, she started kicking and violently pulling on the handle. She screamed out that I was being selfish and was just a stupid teenager who needed to learn how to listen to my parents. When she gave up, she filmed me crying in the stall, pretending to be a caring person by giving me space to control my emotions. Afterwards, she called me difficult and took my phone privileges away for a week. When I got it back, I started recording everything. I had clips of my mom feeding my brother spicy food to make him cry, my dad scream.

It's about doing what's right for the kids who depend on me. Lauren's kids chose to move with their dad. They wanted to go. My kids didn't choose any of this. They just want to stay in the only home they remember. Lauren thinks I'm being stubborn and that I don't understand what it's like to be separated from your children. But she's wrong. I do understand. That's exactly why I

This generation is completely wack. I remember being 14 and still having braces and wearing ugly blue eyeshadow to school every day. But this was before social media, so all of my friends were just as ugly as me. But on my daughter's 15th birthday, we went out to Chili's, and what she wore was shocking. Not because it was anything crazy revealing. It was just a corset top and some cargo pants. It made me realize the pressure she had to grow up faster. She even did her makeup. And I swear, my baby Annalise looked 23 years old. And as we sat down, the waiter began to flirt with her. I wasn't really paying attention because I figured she'd turn him down or just act really shy. But in the corner of my eye, I saw her batting her eyes and looking up at him with a single finger twirling her hair. Motherly rage flooded my system. I literally saw the bulge in his pants. Hey, do you guys have a birthday candle with the No. 15? Because that's how old my daughter is turning today. Luckily, the guy went super red and started stammering, so I knew that he had simply been blindsided. And we even got switched to a new later. As for my daughter, I didn't want to ruin her birthday, so I let her change the topic, and we just Talked about something else. But when she woke up the next day, I asked her what the f she thought she was doing. That she could wear what she wanted, but there was no way I'd ever let her date anyone over the age of 17. We did that teenage angst thing where they pinch the bridge of their nose and roll their eyes like. It was the most original move in the book. So I grabbed her phone and unlocked it with her facial recognition. This time, something in her eyes changed. She begged me not to go through it. It was a good effort, but not good enough. I love you. And if you were a mother, you'd do the same thing. I then walked into my room and locked the door. There wasn't anything too bad. I did find what people call thirst traps on her TikTok, but her account was private and her following was mostly girls. The worrying part was her Instagram. There were bikini pictures plastered everywhere with extremely intimate songs and angles.

Jokes on you, I'll sit here till the end of time. It was the late 90s. I was still drowning in flannel and keeping up my lifelong habit of hoarding library books way past their due date. I had a paper to write for my sophomore global studies class, so, of course, I checked out more books than I could possibly get through, wrote the essay, then totally forgot about the stack gathering dust in the corner of my room. After a steady stream of overdue notices showing up in my homeroom, I finally returned the four or five books one sunny afternoon via the anonymous drop box during a study hall, then promptly moved on to bigger and better things. About two weeks later, I was called down to the assistant principal's office. In that space of time before classes officially started that was reserved for one thing and one thing only. The reprobates and delinquents were in trouble. I walked the halls thinking that surely this was just a timing mishap, and I was being summoned to receive congratulations for some kind of award I didn't know I had entered into competition for. Yep, he just wants to prepare me for the surprise ticker tape parade. I was wholly unprepared to hear that I was receiving lunch detention to start immediately, because I had not returned a single book that I still remember was slim and had a white and red cover from My G S. Paper research. I tried to argue that there was a mistake, since I was sure, like I am sure that I have fingertips, I had returned it, but he could not be moved, and I was sentenced to indefinite lunch detention until I either return the book or paid the 16 bucks to replace it. I left the office late for first period, defeated, but kept my head held high at lunch later that day, as I walked past the entirety of the cafeteria, which held a couple hundred of my peers, plastic food tray in hand, I went down the hall to the old shop classroom that had since been moved and the awaiting detention. I checked in with missus brown at her desk in front and took an inconspicuous seat in the back, staring down at my canned peach slices. I braced for the worst. A murderous ruckus was going to break out any minute, I could tell. But once my ears stopped ringing, I discovered that it was really a calm escape from the crowded and rowdy.

Here, let me show you something. I'm driving to work a few months ago. Almost there. Two turns left, maybe half a mile total. Just neighborhood streets, nothing fancy. This guy in a black BMW crawls up my ass and stays there. I can see him in my mirror, phone in one hand, making these angry faces at me like I personally ruined his morning. I speed up a bit. 5 over the limit. He gets closer. Now he's maybe two feet from my bumper, still checking his phone every few seconds. Real genius move there, buddy. Anyway, I take the first turn, and now I'm on the street where my building is probably about 600 yards ahead. The assholes still tailing me, riding just inches from my bumper, and clearly pissed that I'm still sticking to the speed limit. Maybe around 35 on this stretch. So I press the gas a bit and sure enough, he matches my speed. I drive an 8 year old Toyota truck. Not huge, not tiny, just a regular truck that's seen some shit. All terrain tires, decent suspension, and I've definitely treated it like a truck should be treated. Pastures, rocks, curbs. My baby's been through it all. So as I'm getting closer to my building, there's this big speed bump in the road meant to slow people down before they reach the parking garage entrances. I plants back and yep, assholes still glued to my bumper. I remember thinking, I've got to ease up for this speed bump, and then thinking again, if I hit the brakes, this guy's gonna plow right into me. That's when the plan starts to form in my head. And I hit the gas. I'm going about 45 when I hit that speed bump and Yeehaw! Caught a little air and came down hard. Never even touched the brakes. Didn't tap him once. Gave him absolutely no heads up for what was coming. I'm locked on my rearview mirror through the whole thing cause I wanted to catch his reaction. He's got his phone.

After what I saw today, I'm quitting my job for good. Most people think YouTube is just a website to watch cat videos or makeup tutorials, but behind closed doors, there are thousands of disturbing videos that never make the homepage. It's my job to make sure it stays that way. You would think after watching thousands of these gruesome videos, I would build some type of tolerance. But after what I just saw on a random channel, I'm convinced that I'm gonna die soon. The channel was called marbles, and it didn't have a profile picture or bio, but what it did have were four videos with creepy titles and weird thumbnails. When I first saw the videos, I couldn't make out what the thumbnails were because the images were too pixelated. Thought it'd just be another person uploading abuse videos or someone making staged content to shock people, but I was dead wrong. The first video was titled doggy, and all it showed was just footage of a sleeping dog. No violence, no audio, and literally nothing. I watched it five times to see what the problem was, but I couldn't find anything, so I reinstated the video and moved on to the next one. But that's when things got creepier, because this video was titled six PM and it showed a man walking through a forest. His breathing was off and the camera was shaky, but then out Of nowhere, the video cut to him standing still while he wore a mask and stared down at the camera. His eyes didn't blink, and it felt like he was staring straight into my soul. The third video was called clouds, and this time the camera was pointed down while someone was lying on the ground with their legs cut off. He was screaming in pain for the first 30 seconds, but just when I thought I saw it all, he stopped screaming completely, looked directly at the camera, and whispered something before the video went black. I couldn't tell what he said because he was too quiet, but that didn't matter. The video clearly violated the terms of service, so I immediately removed the video and decided to watch the last one. The fourth video was called Bad Day, and this time the first three minutes were just footage of a blank white wall. I thought it would be a repeat of the first video where nothing happened, but right as I was about to click off the same.

I'm now convinced I'm going to be dead tomorrow. I was just eating pizza a few nights ago when out of nowhere I got an email replying to my audio technician job listing on Craigslist. I was super excited to finally have some interest in my work, but when I saw that the pay was $100,000 for just three days of work, I was a bit skeptical. I thought this was just a fake email and was about to click off until I saw that there was an audio file attached underneath. We've listened to your samples and your sound processing skills are exactly what we're looking for. If you're interested in the job, please reply within 48 hours. Additionally, you will need to sign an NDA before you accept the position. After listening to the audio, I assumed I was just wrong about it being fake and decided I was willing to sign whatever I needed to. But the second I opened up the NDA to get some more details on the job, I found that one of the clauses said I would need to sign a waiver with a fine print saying that I might die. I had a bad feeling about it, but I only had 80 cents to my name and needed the money, so I signed it anyway. The moment I finished, I got an email from the company with an address under the text Come to this location tomorrow at 8:00am to start working with us. I didn't think much of it and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day, I put on a suit, wear my brand new Cologne, and started driving over to the location. But when I pulled into the parking lot, I knew something was off because there were no signs, no windows, and the location looked almost deserted. I figured I was probably just early, but the second I stepped inside the building, a super weird woman called Elizabeth came up to me, put me inside a creepy room, and said, you'll soon understand why we had you sign that death waiver. Was already regretting coming here, but it was too late. After a couple minutes passed by, she introduced me to this guy called Darren, who looked like he hadn't slept in like 20 years. Before I could even ask what the hell I was supposed to do, Darren pointed to a weird black box in the corner with a speaker and keyboard attached to it. That device can hear the dead. I immediately started laughing in his face and even glanced around for cameras, hoping all of this was just a

My wife Jenna has this thing where she's always late. Not just fashionably late, but, like, 30 to 45 minutes late to everything. Dinner with friends, movies, work meetings, family gatherings. You name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it. Started telling her events start an hour earlier than they actually do, but she caught on and now just shows up even later. Last month was the breaking point. We were supposed to meet my parents for my dad's birthday dinner at this nice restaurant. I told her we needed to leave by 6:30 to get there on time. At 7:15, she's still doing her makeup, telling me to chill out because they'll wait for us. He showed up at 8:20. My parents had already ordered appetizers and were halfway through their main course. My dad looked hurt, my mom was pissed, and I wanted to disappear. But two weeks ago, something happened that Jenna had been talking about for months. Her favorite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue. Downtown. She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats, and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone canceled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at 8 p m. On a Saturday. The venue was small.

Emma was frantically texting me links to normal name lists. Kyle's dad kept muttering Nebuchadnezzar under his breath like he was trying to practice saying it. For the next three weeks I got calls every single day. Janet would call with alternative suggestions like Theodore or Michael. Emma sent me a 47 item list of actually cute names that aren't completely insane. Even Kyle's normally quiet aunt called to tell me about a nice couple she knew who named their daughter brunhilda, and she got teased terribly in school.

Who's expecting little Bartholomew or brinhilda? The poor woman didn't know what to say. Kyle was having the time of his life. He'd randomly bring up baby preparations like I wonder if they make monogrammed blankets with a G for Gaylord, just to watch his family squirm. Finally, at 38 weeks, we had the gender reveal party.

There are lines in life you don't cross. And when you do, you don't just break the law. You break people. For me, that line was drawn the day my sister's case went to court. She had been through hell, hurt in a way I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. She did everything right. Reported, gave statements, endured interviews, sat across from lawyers who asked her the most degrading questions you can imagine. She just wanted justice, um, recognition that what had been done to her mattered. I sat behind her in the courtroom, wearing the same suit I used for every hearing, notebook in hand. Not as a detective that day. Just a brother. Her attacker sat across the room, smug, relaxed, like he was at a casual lunch. Instead of facing charges for what he'd done. I kept staring at his hands, remembering how they'd shaken during questioning when I'd first confronted him off duty. That moment when you know someone's guilty, but they still think they can worm their way out. The trial wasn't long. Evidence lined up, witnesses were ready. The DA was confident. But when the judge walked in, I felt something I couldn't name. He wouldn't meet our eyes. Kept shuffling papers like he already hated being there. The DA made his opening statement clear and firm. Then came the defense, and it was pathetic. No alibi, no counterproof. Just character attacks and Cheap shots at my sister's credibility. But here's the thing. They didn't need a defense. Not when the judge himself was on their side. It started small. Objections overruled when they shouldn't have been. Evidence questioned that it had already been cleared for admissibility. The defense attorney practically smirking every time the judge leaned in their favor. Then the hammer blow. Halfway through testimony, my sister's voice trembling as she recounted the night everything changed, the judge actually cut her off. Said her words were too emotional to be considered reliable. He struck her testimony from the record. I felt my blood pressure spike. My fist clenched so tight, my nails dug into my palms. I wanted to shout.

Same booth in the corner, same hot chocolate with extra whipped cream. Same ritual of decompressing until my hands stopped shaking. The diner was dead quiet.

I own a small cafe in a college town. Not a chain, not fancy, just a cozy spot with good coffee, fresh pastries, and regulars I'll have their order started before they even reach the counter. Business was steady. Not booming, but enough to pay my barista as well and keep the lights on. Then out of nowhere, we started getting one star reviews. Not just any bad reviews. These were daily, always posted in the early morning, always detailed, and always personal. Coffee was lukewarm and the owner rolled her eyes when I asked for milk. The croissants are clearly frozen, not fresh baked. Owner talks too much to customers, slows down the line. None of it was true. We bake pastries at 4:00am every morning. My espresso machine hits 200 degrees like clockwork. And if I do talk to customers, it's because they're usually happy about it. I brushed off the first few, even replied politely offering to make things right. But they kept coming and they got nastier. She's rude, unprofessional, and probably microwaves the muffins.

But nothing tops this one. It was a Friday night, 1:00am. A dangerous mix of drunk people, bad decisions, and too many. Just one more shots. I get a ping from a bar downtown. Five star passenger rating. Easy money, I think. I pull up and see him. Expensive suit, loosened tie, hair gel that could withstand a Hurricane. The kind of guy who calls waitresses sweetheart and tips with exposure. He stumbles toward my car, beer in hand. First red flag. Hey, buddy. I say, no open containers. He grins like I'm an adorable toddler. It's fine. I know people. Translation I'm about to be a pain in your ass. We get maybe three blocks before he starts making phone calls on speaker, loudly to people with names like Vince and Chad about closing the deal Monday. He keeps kicking the back of my seat like a bored five year old. Then out of nowhere, hey, driver, how much you make doing this? Like 40 grand. Pathetic. I keep it professional enough to pay the bills. That's when he leans forward, beer breath hot on my neck, and says, you're lucky to have me in your car. If I wanted to, I could Have your job by tomorrow. My company works with corporate for your app. Sure you do, champ. We're about two minutes from his address when he decides to really flex. You know what? I don't feel like paying tonight. Consider it a networking opportunity. You scratch my back, maybe I'll throw you some real work later. I smile in the rearview.

I never thought I'd be that mom who cried at a Walmart checkout because her card got declined. But there I was last year, staring at a cart full of groceries I couldn't afford, while my 17 year old daughter, Anna, pretended not to notice the cashier's annoyed sigh. We'd been struggling since I lost my marketing job during the pandemic. Those unemployment checks barely covered rent, let alone everything else. Kept telling Anna everything would be fine, that I'd figure it out, but honestly, I was drowning. We started turning off heat in rooms we weren't using. I'd eat a sleeve of crackers for dinner and tell Anna I wasn't hungry. The pink envelope from the bank came on a Tuesday. Final notice. 30 days to pay or lose the house. I opened it in the kitchen and just collapsed right there on the linoleum floor, sobbing like a kid. I thought Anna was at school, but she'd come home early because she forgot her textbook. She found me there with that letter in my hands, hyperventilating. Mom, what's wrong? I tried to hide it, but she grabbed the paper and read it. Her face went completely white. How much do we owe? I couldn't even look at her. 43,000 back payments fee. He's everything. The next morning, Anna wasn't in her bed. Her backpack was gone, but her school clothes were still hanging in her closet. I called Her phone, like 20 times. Nothing. I was about to call the police when she finally texted back around noon. I'm fine at work. Talk tonight. Work. She worked part time at the grocery store on weekends. Maybe 15 hours total. What was she doing there on a Wednesday? When she came home that evening, she had this look on her face. Determined, but scared. Like she'd made a huge decision and wasn't sure if it was right. She sat me down at our kitchen

I run a barbecue food truck, and let me tell you, street vending is like the Wild West. No matter how good your brisket is, you're always one bad inspection away from losing everything. There's this one corner downtown that's gold. Heavy foot traffic, office workers at lunch, weekend festivals, you name it. The city only allows one truck there at a time, and you have to book it through their online permit system months in advance. It's first come, first served, and if you miss your day, too bad, you can't just swap in another truck without city approval. So I book my Friday slot three months ahead. I'm there early, set up smoker going, the works. Around 11 a m, another food truck rolls up. Bright neon paint job, giant Cartoon Taco plastered on the side. It's Taco titan, run by a guy named Vince. Vince jumps out in sunglasses and a leather jacket because apparently he's auditioning for Food Network's Douchebags in the wild. I'm taking this spot today. He says like it's a done deal. I laugh, thinking he's joking. Uh, no. I've got the permit. You can check with the city. He smirks. Oh, I don't need to check. See, your truck's a Dinosaur. I'm bringing in something fresh, Instagram worthy. People want tacos? Cool. I say you can give them tacos somewhere you're actually booked. Then he drops it. I've been parking here for Years without a permit. They never check. And you know what? If you call the city, I'll just tell them you invited me. Now, I'm a reasonable guy, but this is my living. My smoker takes four hours to get to 10. Moving is not an option. So I tell him straight, if you park here without a permit, that's on you. He parks anyway, right in front of my truck, like, literally blocking half my signage. At first I'm pissed, but then I remember something. Fridays are when the city inspector does his random rounds downtown. They check permits, sanitation and fire safety. And the inspector, he's a no BS kind.

When I was 16, I lied on a job application and said I was 18 so I could clean these massive vacation houses in Aspen. My mom had died three months before from diabetes complications because we couldn't afford her insulin consistently. I was living with my aunt, who worked double shifts at a gas station just to keep our tiny apartment. These houses I cleaned were insane. Like bathrooms bigger than our entire place, with marble everything. And those fancy toilets that cost more than my aunt made in six months. I'd scrub these pristine kitchens that probably got used twice during their whole vacation. One Thursday afternoon, I was mopping the hallway in this ridiculous mansion when I heard screaming from upstairs. This 14 year old girl named Sienna was having a complete meltdown at her dad because he wouldn't buy her a second iPhone just for making TikToks. She already had the newest model, but apparently she needed a separate one for content creation. I tried to keep working, but then I heard her yell something that made my blood freeze. She screamed at her dad, if you're gonna be so annoying about money, why don't you just divorce mom and marry someone richer instead? I gripped that mop handle so tight, my knuckles went white. My mom had died on the same couch I slept on every night. We'd eaten ramen for Dinner probably 300 days that year. See, Sienna stormed out of the room and saw me standing there in the hallway. She rolled her eyes and said, uh, I hate when the help just stands around doing nothing. I wanted to say something, but I needed this job desperately, so I just kept mopping and pretended I didn't hear anything. Later, I was cleaning their kitchen when Sienna came in, talking to her friend on speaker phone. She was still ranting about the phone situation, saying stuff like, my dad is literally so cheap.

My daughter Rosie was six when she started limping around the house. At first I thought maybe she twisted her ankle at the playground or something. Kids are always falling and getting bruised up, right? But then she started crying about her legs hurting, especially at night. She'd wake me up at 2:00am, sobbing that her bones felt like they were on fire. I'd give her some children's Tylenol and rub her legs until she fell back asleep. This. This went on for about a week before I decided to take her to our pediatrician. Doctor Mitchell had been our family doctor for three years. He was this older guy who always seemed rushed, like he had somewhere more important to be. When I brought Rosie in, he barely looked at her for five minutes before giving his diagnosis. Well, she's carrying some extra weight, he said, looking at her chart. Kids her age should be running around more. Put her on a diet and try getting her outside more often. The leg pain is probably just from the extra strain. I stared at him. Sure, Rosie was a little chubby, but she was active. She rode her bike every day and loved playing at the park. But Doctor Mitchell was already writing something in her file and moving toward the door. But she's crying in pain every night, I said. She can barely Walk some mornings. He turned back with this annoyed look. Kids exaggerate. She's probably trying to get attention or avoid school. Just stick to the diet plan. I left feeling confused, but figured maybe he knew something I didn't. So I started packing healthier lunches for Rosie and taking her to the park every single day after school. But nothing changed. If anything, she got worse. Two weeks later, Rosie couldn't even get out of bed without help. Her little face was so pale, and she kept saying her legs felt heavy. I called Doctor Mitchell's office and managed to get another appointment. This time he seemed even more irritated when I walked in. He didn't

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming. And they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I've been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off and college was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash.

The one with the massive food court, arcade, and the store that sells those custom sneakers he's obsessed with. We've been planning it for weeks, saved up to buy him a pair. Mom took the day off work. Even the weather seemed like it was cooperating. We got there around noon, Ethan in his wheelchair with a brand new Marvel hoodie, beaming like it was Christmas morning. He spotted a balloon stand near the entrance, and the vendor tied one to the armrest of his chair. It floated above him like a little red exclamation Mark. We spent the first hour just browsing, Ethan pointing out things he wanted to totally buy when he's rich, me joking that he'd better remember his big brother when that happened. Eventually, we headed to the sneaker store. Ethan had been talking about this moment for months. He rolled right up to the display, ran his hand over the shoes, and looked at me like, is this real life? That's When it happened, out of nowhere, this guy in a mall manager badge strides over. Tall, late 40s, perfect hair, gel helmet. He stops a few feet from us and says loudly, sir, you can't just roll in here and block the displays. I thought he was joking. Ethan was completely in the clear, nowhere near blocking anyone. I said, he's just looking at the shoes. The manager gives me this fake customer service smile and says, I understand, but maybe you could take him somewhere more suitable. We don't want accidents. I felt my stomach drop. Ethan smile vanished. People around us turned to look. My mom froze midstep, gripping the handles of Ethan's chair. The manager laughed, an actual chuckle, and added, besides, this is a busy store. Someone might trip over him. Trip over him? Like my brother was an obstacle? Ethan's

Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled and left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them.

We started drinking and playing video games, just chilling on the couch. Everything was normal for, like, an hour. Taylor was curled up next to me. Ethan was cracking jokes about the game, and I was thinking, this was actually pretty fun. Then Ethan said he needed to use the bathroom. I pointed down the hall to the one on the first floor. Taylor and I kept playing, and I didn't even notice how long he'd been gone until we heard yelling upstairs. My blood went cold. Mia never yells. We both jumped up and ran upstairs, and I found My sister standing in her doorway crying, like, full on sobbing. Ethan was right there in the hallway looking all flustered and red in the face. I immediately asked Mia what happened, and she could barely get the words out between sobs. She said Ethan had walked into her room, even though her door was only cracked open a little. She thought maybe he was lost, looking for the bathroom. So she

Uncle Henry banned all technology from his house the day we moved in. I was 16 when the plane went down over the Atlantic with both our parents inside. Noah was only 13 and barely spoke for the first three months after the crash. Uncle Henry was Dad's older brother who lived alone in this massive house in the mountains, completely off the grid except for one landline he kept for emergencies. He'd been preparing for the collapse of civilization for 20 years, stockpiling food and ammunition while ranting about government surveillance and mind control through Wi Fi signals. The social workers thought it was perfect that we had family willing to take us, never bothering to check if Uncle Henry was actually equipped to raise two traumatized teenagers. The technology band was absolute and immediate. Uncle Henry went through our suitcases that first night, confiscating our phones, Noah's Nintendo Switch, my laptop, even the smartwatch mom had given me for my birthday. He locked everything in a metal safe in his basement, saying we needed to detox from the digital poison that was rotting our generation's brains. He actually believed that cell towers were transmitting thoughts into people's heads and that social media was a government program to catalog citizens for future imprisonment. The only electronics he allowed were an ancient radio that only got three stations and an emergency landline that barely worked half the time. At first, I Thought Noah was handling it better than me because he'd always been the quiet one. He went to his new school without complaining, did his homework by candlelight when Uncle Henry decided electricity usage needed to be minimal, and ate the weird survivalist meals without comment. But after six months, I started noticing things that terrified me. Noah was wearing long sleeves in summer, spending hours locked in the bathroom. And I found him sitting on the roof at three in the morning, just staring at the sky. When I tried to talk to him about mom and dad, he just say they were lucky they didn't have to live through what came after. I found the cuts on his arms when I walked in on him changing after he thought I left for school. They were deliberate, organized parallel lines from his wrist to his elbow, like he was keeping track of something. I begged him to talk to me, but he just pulled his sleeve down and said there was no point.

My brother had said the same. Even my mom had accused my dad of misplacing cash from her purse. My dad finally asked Preston, are you serious? Preston nodded, dead eyed. Then he explained his system. While we were cooking, watching football, or cleaning up dinner, he'd sneak into bedrooms, take cash from wallets, purses, even my grandmother's coin jar back when she was alive. Then he'd drive to the casino on his way home, convinced he'd win big and surprise us all by paying for next year's Christmas. The room detonated. My mom shouted about all the time she thought my dad had lost grocery money. My brother realized why his savings jar was always light. My dad sat there calculating eight years of stolen cash in his head and looking like he was about to explode. We demanded to know if he'd ever actually won. Preston admitted he'd lost every single dollar. Thousands of our dollars vanished into slot machines. He insisted it wasn't theft, it was an investment strategy. That's when my dad stood up so fast his chair toppled backward. Preston immediately started inching toward the door, babbling about how we did understand his entrepreneurial vision. He grabbed his coat mid sentence, muttered something about next year will be different, and basically fled the house. We later added it up. He'd skimmed almost $4,000 from us over the years. The casinos had been getting rich off Our holiday gatherings. While we all thought we were just forgetful with cash, now we keep our wallets locked up every Christmas. And Preston? He hasn't shown his face since. Which is probably for the best, because if he ever does walk back through that door, my dad's still got the running total in his head, and it's going up with interest.

His mouth opened and closed like he was choking. This isn't how he stammered. Isn't this the official employee handbook we all signed? I smiled. Would you like to see my documentation of industry timeline standards? He stormed into his office without another word. Two hours later, HR called an emergency meeting. Derek sat there sweating while I presented my case. That same afternoon, I found another beautiful clause buried in the handbook. Managers found in violation of reasonable workplace policies face immediate performance review by end of week. Derek's boss called me personally. We've reviewed your timeline assessments, and they're completely accurate. Derek has been violating company policy for months. She paused, then continued with obvious respect, in five years, no one's ever actually cited the handbook like this. Congratulations. You found a legitimate loophole. Derek became obsessed with finding ways to write me up for other violations. One day, he tried citing me for excessive bathroom breaks, six minutes total. Another time for inefficient email communication because I use bullet points instead of paragraphs. HR tried a different approach. They offered me Derek's position if I'd agree to mentor him through Improved management practices. When I declined, they offered a 20% raise and full remote work. The desperation was beautiful. During my performance review, HR handed me an updated handbook personally. The new project timeline requirements were highlighted in bright yellow with Derek's signature. Checkmate. By the next quarter, Derek had been transferred to a different department. I got my Japan vacation, my bonus, and a reputation as the guy who actually reads company policies. Sometimes the best way to beat the system is to use the system's own rules against itself.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure, it's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights at target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head. And muttering about how I was clear, really struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parent choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing. But I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. I'm listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

My job had this ridiculous policy where you couldn't take vacation days if any project was behind schedule. Missing deadlines meant losing your bonus completely. I've been saving up for a two week trip to Japan for over a year, but my manager Derek kept assigning me impossible deadlines right before my planned vacation. Derek was basically a micromanager on steroids. This guy would literally schedule meetings at four fifty five PM on Fridays. Just to show he was dedicated. He kept a spreadsheet tracking everyone's productivity. It already cost three people their bonuses that year. Everyone hated him, but everyone needed their jobs more. After he assigned me an urgent project due the day before my vacation, he smirked and said, Guess Japan will have to wait until next year, buddy. I was furious that night. Instead of working on his impossible project, I. It's something no employee ever does. I actually read our employee handbook. All 47 mind numbing pages of it. At midnight, exhausted and frustrated. I found gold buried in Section 12.3. For purposes of project deadline policies, work assignments must be distributed with reasonable timeline expectations based on standard industry practices. I nearly jumped out of my chair. The policy specifically required reasonable timelines, but Derek was assigning two week projects with three day deadlines. By their own definition, his assignments weren't valid at all. The next morning, I set the trap. I Submitted a formal timeline assessment for Derek's project. Copied HR and his boss. I documented that the project required minimum 10 business days based on industry standards, but I've been given three. I requested either additional resources or timeline adjustment per company policy Section 12.3. Derek didn't even try to hide his anger. This project is Wednesday. No exceptions. He was already typing furiously. You can explain to corporate why you missed deadline and lost your bonus. I smiled calmly, then pulled out my highlighted handbook. Actually, there have been zero valid project assignments this quarter under current company policy. His typing froze mid sentence. What?

She was clearly uncomfortable, shoulders hunched, pressing herself against the wall as Carter leaned closer, whispering something that made his friends laugh. When she tried stepping around them, Carter grabbed her wrist. That's when Leo appeared, stepping between them. I could read his lips. Let her go! Carter's Face transformed from amused to angry. He shoved Leo hard. Mind your business, nobody. According to Miss Patel's narration, Leo didn't shove back. He just positioned himself between Carter and Nina.

Nobody was armed or aggressive. They just appeared in their yards with flashlights, phones, and whatever household items they grabbed on the way out.

I kept getting these annoying prank calls from someone pretending to be conducting fake surveys about random stuff. Like, hello, sir, we're conducting a survey about how many socks you own. Or, ma'am, what's your opinion on purple vegetables? After the third call, I was getting pretty annoyed, but then I had a brilliant idea. The next time they called, I was ready. They started with their usual routine. Hello, we're conducting a survey about kitchen appliances. I immediately cut them off and said, oh, perfect timing. I'm actually conducting a survey about prank calling habit. There was a confused pause, and they said, excuse me. What? I said, since you're clearly a prank caller, this is a great opportunity to gather research data. Can you please rate your prank calling technique on a scale of 1 to ten? I tried to deny it, but I pressed on with complete seriousness. Sir, this is for scientific research purposes. I need to document various prank calling methodologies. Now, would you describe your approach as amateur or professional level? The caller was clearly thrown off and actually started answering my questions. They said, well, I guess I'm pretty good at it. Excellent. I said, now can you demonstrate your range of fake voices for my study? They actually started doing different accents like they were auditioning for a voice acting role. I took detailed notes and said, fascinating. Now tell Me. What inspired you to get into prank calling? They spent five minutes explaining how they started prank calling as a hobby in middle school. Very interesting. Now, for research purposes, can you rank your top three prank call? Top. They enthusiastically listed fake surveys, wrong numbers, and pizza delivery pranks. I said, excellent data. Now I need you to demonstrate each technique with a brief example. This person actually started performing different prank call scenarios while I pretended to take scientific notes. 20 minutes into this fake interview. I said, now I need you to rate your own performance today. They said, honestly, this might be my best work. I really felt like I connected with my subject. that's interesting, because technically, I just got reverse prank called. There was dead silence, and I could hear them processing what just happened. They said, wait, you're not actually conducting research? I said, nope, but congratulations, you just spent 20 minutes teaching.

So my mom borrowed my laptop the other day to check her emails, and in doing so she stumbled across the folder. The folder is an absolutely massive couple thousand page long document that contains Wikipedia like profile descriptions of my entire family. I've been crafting it for over a decade now and it's finally come out now. Gotta be clear, I didn't mean for her to find it, but in retrospect, naming the folder family lore highly confidential was probably a bad call. Anyway. The first thing she did when she found it was walk back into my room and spin the screen around so I could see that she had found it. At first my stomach absolutely dropped, but then my mom hit me with a deadpan stare saying, so since when am I a former milkshake enthusiast turned reluctant bird watcher? I completely froze. Not because she found the document, not because she read it, but because that is what she pulled out of all the chaos in there. See, this file was comprehensive. I'm talking everything from her shoe size in 1997 to the exact date that that one time she screamed at a squirrel for ruining the vibe. It's all in there. Cross referenced, hyperlinked, footnoted. There's even a controversy section formatted exactly like Wikipedia's details. The infamous Tupperware incident of 2,012 where She blamed me for losing the lid to her favorite container when in fact, she left it on the grill during a barbecue. She asked me to explain to her what this was, but I couldn't even bring myself to respond. And so naturally, she just.

I picked up my grandma's phone call, and all I heard was crying. Not regular crying, but that broken kind of crying that old people do when they feel completely helpless. She was sitting in her car outside McDonald's trying to explain what happened. All she wanted was a small black coffee. That's it. One dollar and nine cents worth of coffee that she'd been ordering the same way for 20 years since Grandpa died. But the kids working there had other plans. She said when she walked up to the counter, this teenage girl with pink hair just kept looking at her phone. My grandma stood there for five minutes before someone even acknowledged her. When she finally ordered her coffee, the girl rolled her eyes and rang up a large caramel Frappuccino instead. Grandma tried to correct her politely. The girl called over her manager, who was maybe 19 years old, with a face full of acne and an attitude bigger than the restaurant. He told my grandma she was confused and needed to speak up. She repeated her order louder and clearer. Small black coffee. They gave her a Coke. When she went back to the counter to explain the mistake, a different worker started filming her with his phone. He was laughing and saying something about another Karen video for Tik. My 80 year old grandma, who still writes thank you cards and calls everyone, sweetie didn't Even know what TikTok was? She asked one more time for her coffee. They gave her chocolate milk. By this point, three employees were gathered around, filming and laughing. One of them actually said, come on, lady, just crash out already so we can go viral. They wanted her to lose it. They wanted her to scream so they could post it online and make fun of the crazy old lady who couldn't handle a wrong order. Instead, she just started crying and left.

I start going to this 24 hour diner at like 2:00am because I literally cannot sleep. It's one of those old school places with cracked vinyl booths and fluorescent lights that make everyone look dead. First night, I order coffee and pancakes and just sit there scrolling through my ex's Instagram like the masochist I am. The waitress, this woman in her 50s with kind eyes, just keeps refilling my coffee without saying anything. Second night, same thing. Third night, she finally asks, rough patch, honey? I nod and try not to cry into my syrup. By the end of week two, I'm there every single night at exactly 2:00am. Same booth, same order, same pathetic scrolling routine. That's when she sits down across from me. Alright, sweetie, you've been here 14 nights straight crying into pancakes. What's his name? And I just break. I tell her everything. How he cheated, how he moved in with her immediately, how all our mutual friends picked. She listens to every word while bringing me free pie. The next night, she introduces me to the cook. Hank, this is Pancake Girl. She's having serious boy troubles. Hank, this massive guy with tattoo sleeves, looks at me and Goes. What kind of idiot breaks a heart like that? Then he makes me these incredible chocolate chip pancakes shaped like a heart. Soon, the whole night shift knows my business. There's Madison, the other waitress, who gives me brutal but honest dating advice. Cameron, the dishwasher, who barely speaks English, but always pats my shoulder and says, no cry, Mija. Even the manager, Frederick, starts checking on me. They give me a nickname, pan.

My teenage son kept bragging about how he could outeat anyone. Every dinner came with the same speech about his legendary stomach. What Logan didn't know was that I grew up with four brothers in a house where food disappeared faster than Halloween candy. His boasting amused me until his 16th birthday party. I'd spent all morning grilling burgers for his friends when I overheard him telling everyone, my dad thinks he's some grill master, but wait till you see me crush these burgers. His friends laughed. I didn't. After the party, while cleaning up, I casually mentioned the local diner's burger challenge. Finish their 5 pound monster in 30 minutes. It free. Plus your photo on the wall. I could destroy that challenge, Logan said without looking up from his phone. Twenty bucks says you can't. He finally looked up. Only 20? Weak, dad. Fine. If you win, I'll let you take my vintage Mustang to prom. The car was my pride and joy, a 1967 fastback that I'd restored myself over five long years. Same car I proposed to his mother in. Logan nearly dropped his phone. For real. You never let anyone drive it. And if you lose, I continued, you have to come to work with me every Saturday this summer. No video games, no sleeping in. Just learning what real work looks like. I own a construction company. Logan had been avoiding real labor. Like it was homework. His mother thought I was being too hard on him, but I knew he needed to learn some grit. Deal, he said instantly, sticking out his hand. We shook on it, and I saw a flicker of doubt in his eyes, but it vanished just as quickly. That Friday, we walked into Geek Big Joe's Smokehouse. The place was packed with the usual crowd of truckers and locals. Conversations hushed when we approached the counter. The burger challenge was legendary in our small town. The

I just found out the horrifying reason. Ever since I was 9 years old, my dad would go into the living room at exactly 11:05 p m. Every single night and put a tape in his old Panasonic. He wouldn't talk, blink, or even eat dinner until the tape was finished. But to make things even more strange, he would always tell me to never watch the tape or to disturb him while he was watching it. I used to think it was something inappropriate, like cornhub. So one night when everyone was sleeping, I snuck into the living room to check the tape and found that it wasn't anything. All the footage showed was some random static for a full hour. I decided to just head back to sleep and didn't think much of it. And for the next 12 years, he never missed a single night. Not on holidays, not when he was sick, and not even when he broke both of his ribs. Every night he would go on the couch and watch the tape like his life depended on it. And I'm starting to think it did because of what happened last night. I was just playing with my meat while my mom was making dinner when we heard my dad yelling for help in the shower. We immediately rushed over to him and took him to the ER. But the Whole ride there. He kept pointing at his watch, which read 10:30. I assumed he was just worried about missing his little tape and just told him that it was okay to miss one day. But after 15 minutes in the ER, the doctors told us that he needed to stay overnight for some blood work. So we told the doctor that we'd come tomorrow and went back home. By the time we arrived back home, it was already 11:15. So I told my mom good night, and she went upstairs into her bedroom. But right as I was getting into mine, I saw the tape sitting right next to the TV. It was already half ejected into the Panasonic. So I went over to take it out when I heard some scraping in the hallway. It sounded like nails were dragging across the car. And when I looked around to see what it was, nothing was there. I thought I was just hearing thing. But the second I turned back around to take the tape out, the TV turned on by itself. But this time, the video wasn't static. It showed a creature walking through a long hallway. What made it even more creepy was the fact that the house layout looked identical to mine. I just stared at the screen, praying that this creature was gonna vanish.

What's the darkest thing you've ever seen? During that time, I was extremely skinny and constantly hungry. I had finally saved up enough change to buy myself a sit down meal at this small diner on the corner, something I hadn't done in months. The smell alone was overwhelming, like fresh toast and eggs. And warm. I walked in and barely made it three steps before the owner came storming over. He didn't even ask what I wanted. He just told me to leave. Said he didn't want me scaring the other customers off or making anyone uncomfortable. His voice was loud enough that everyone turned to look at me. Some of them even nodded along with him. I didn't argue. I was used to this. So I went back outside and sat down on the curb, trying not to let it get to me. About 10 minutes later, this very well dressed woman walked by with a small group of people. He was wearing this expensive coat and heels that probably cost more than I'd made in a year. As they passed, she stopped and handed me a folded hundred dollar Bill. I couldn't believe it. For a second. I thought it was fake, but it was real. I looked up at her, stunned, and the people she was with praised her for being so kind. I thanked her about a dozen times and she smiled and told me to stay safe as they walked off. I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. Hope. That money meant I could get a motel room for a couple night, maybe even a hot shower and a proper bed. But about 30 minutes later, she came back alone. She stormed up to me, all that warmth gone from her face. She held out her hand and demanded the money back. Said she needed it, that she hadn't meant to give me that much. Tried to reason with her, but she didn't want to hear it. She kept saying I had no right to her generosity, that I should be grateful. She even looked at me. I hesitated, but I handed the Bill back. Then she kicked over my cup of coins, scattering everything I had on the sidewalk. I asked her why she was doing this, why she was being so cruel. She looked down at me with disgust and said people like me were what's wrong with the country. That she only gave me the money to look good in front of her clients.

Her dad owned hotels across the world, and their house looked like something from a movie. At family dinners, everyone talked about their private jet gets a million dollar watches, while I sat there in my twenty dollar target shirt, feeling like an alien who'd crash their party. I started making excuses to skip family events, but Sarah insisted I come to her dad's birthday dinner. That night, her dad invited me to his office. I thought this was it. He was going to offer me money to leave his daughter alone. Instead, he asked about my work. I started talking about fixing cars, expecting him to be bored, but his eyes lit up. Turned out, before his success, he'd worked as a mechanic too. For the next two hours, we talked about engines and restoration projects. As I was leaving, he said something I'll never forget. You know why I like you? Everyone in this house asks me about my money. You're the only one who talks to me like I'm just another guy who loves cars. A month later, he helped me open my own auto shop. Not because I asked, because we share the same passion. Now I run the most successful luxury car Restoration business in the state. And every Saturday my billionaire father in law comes by in old jeans to help me work on classic cars. Sometimes the richest people are the ones who never make you feel poor.

Mom had left when I was 8 to find herself, so it had been just us for years. That summer, dad was renovating our bathroom himself to save money. I was sprawled on my bed doing nothing when I heard him curse, then a loud thud. I found him on the bathroom floor looking dazed, a pair of wire cutters still in his hand. Just got a little shock, he said, trying to laugh it off. Forgot to turn off the breaker. His breathing was shallow and his left arm hung limp. When I helped him up, he stumbled like he was drunk. I'm calling 9 1 1, I said, reaching for my phone. He grabbed my wrist. Don't you dare! It's nothing. Do you even know how much we'd have to pay before insurance covers anything? Dad, you could be having a heart attack. It's just a little electrical jolt. I'll sleep it off. I reluctantly agreed not to call an ambulance if he'd let me drive him to urgent care. He refused that, too. Fine, I said. But I'm sitting with you tonight, and if anything gets worse, I'm calling 9 1 1, and you can yell at me from your hospital bed. We camped Out on the couch watching TV. Around midnight, he fell asleep mid sentence. I stayed awake, watching his chest rise and fall, terrified. His breathing changed, longer pauses, then gasping, I shook him awake. Dad! Hospital now! Or I swear I'll call every neighbour we have and tell them you wet the bed. He was too exhausted to fight. At the ER, they rushed him back immediately. Turns out he'd had a mild heart attack and the electrical shock had masked the symptoms. The doctor said if we waited until morning, he might not have made it. While they prepped him for a procedure to insert a stent, I filled out paperwork and called his boss. Then I noticed.

What crazy things have you seen? I work as a maid for one of the wealthiest families in America, and they raised their kids like I've never seen before. During the interview process, I met the father, who's a well known wealthy multi hyphenate, and he started off by asking me a really weird question. Who do you serve? I was taken aback by this question because I came prepared with potential responses that would explain why I desperately needed this job. But I didn't know how to answer it, so I was just honest and responded with myself. He hired me on the spot, and I started the next day. My major tasks for the day were to deep clean the washroom, prepare lunch and dinner, then pick up his son and daughter from high school and cook them dinner. I got my groceries, deep cleaned everything, started food prep, and waited for the kids at the school. This was when I noticed something was off. They're enrolled in public school. I met the children again after briefly meeting them in the morning and asked what extracurricular activities they needed me to drop them off to. I know for a fact that wealthy families always enroll their kids in spin classes, music lessons, and foreign language classes. I'd probably be tracked down if I revealed how much money goes into those classes. These parents usually make sure their kids receive an education. You Definitely can't afford. You can imagine my surprise when the wealthiest 16 year olds in America told me, we don't have any extracurriculars. We study at home. After eating dinner, they disappeared into their rooms and stayed there the whole day. Before I left, I asked their father why he didn't enroll his kids in any extracurricular classes. In his fashion, all he told me was, the school system sucks. Yeah, no, I wasn't buying it. Sure, the school system sucks, but he wouldn't send his kids there if it meant they were set up for failure. When I went to the mansion the next day, I was prepared to ask the kids what they

My daughter Kelsey, Learned early that crying got her whatever she wanted. When she was 12, she sobbed to her teacher that I wouldn't let her have a phone, and suddenly I was a mean dad. At 13, she cried to her mom about my strict bedtime rules and got to stay at her house more. By 14, she was crying to judges about fake bruises. The phone incident happened first. When Kelsey turned 12, she wanted the latest model, but I told her to bring her grades up first. The next day, she sobbed to her teacher that I was isolating her from friends. The counselor called me in and lectured me about teenage social development. I left that meeting, forced to buy her a phone immediately. A year later, the bedtime battle started getting serious. I set lights out at 10 on school nights. Kelsey called her mom crying that I was treating her like a baby. Her mom, who only cared about child support checks, filed for modified custody. The next week, she stood in court talking about her daughter suffering under my control. She never mentioned Kelsey's grandma Mother's Education Trust fund waiting for her. The judge increased her time from weekends to half the week. Then came the bruises, when everything changed forever. Kelsey showed up to court with marks on her arms. At 14, she claimed I grabbed her during an argument about failing grades. I watched her cry and peek at the judge through her fingers. Her mother held her close and glared at me with disgust. The judge ordered supervised visits that same day. Three years passed before Kelsey made her final move. She decided at 17 that she wanted to drop out of school completely. I told her education wasn't optional in our family. Two days later, police arrested me at work. She had filed a report claiming years of psychological torture and food withholding. She said I stole from her grandmother's education trust fund. Then she told the detective, he gets weird when he drinks. He comes into my room at night and sits on my bed. I haven't touched alcohol since my brother died from liver failure. I sat in that jail cell and realized she would never stop escalating. The system believed her tears every single time. Something cold settled in my chest. I stopped feeling hurt and started thinking clearly. If she wanted freedom from me, she would get it. The charges were dropped for lack of evidence after three days. I hired a new lawyer.

I was sitting in this conference room at work, biting the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing at the whole situation. My coworker was waving their hands around, telling our boss how my rubber duck collection created a hostile workplace. And, yeah, you heard that right? Rubber ducks. This whole thing started after I got promoted to senior developer last month. I had been dealing with imposter syndrome for years, and one thing that really helped me was rubber ducky bugging, which is this programming thing where you explain your code to a rubber duck, and it helps you figure out problems. Every time I fixed a big coding issue, I bought myself a new duck to celebrate. And I had five of them sitting in this rainbow arc on my desk self. There was a yellow one from fixing my first major bug, a green one from when I saved the server from crashing, a blue one from solving that database issue, a red one from speeding up our main program, and a purple one from the project that got me promoted. Each duck had a name based on programming stuff, with syntax being yellow, logic being green, run time being blue, stack being red, and null being purple. Sat there on my shelf just being rubber ducks. The problem started the day after I got the promotion. My coworker thought they Deserved? First they walked past my desk muttering about unprofessional decorations, and then they started carrying their lunch tray straight to their car every day at noon. Sent our boss this 15 page document titled Urgent Hostile Workplace Legal Action pending where they went on and on about how my ducks were positioned in an intimidation pattern. They actually used a protractor to measure the angles between each duck and drew diagrams showing the yellow one leading an attack formation while claiming the rainbow arrangement create

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

When I was in secondary school, which is basically high school for you Yankee Doodle dandies, I was 13. I was stuck in that awkward phase of life where everything about you keeps shifting. One of those changes was the increasing amount of gas my body produced. Thanks to the endless stream of curries and chilies, my family regularly cooked cheap and convenient meals. Plus, despite being as English as Paddington Bear, we loved spicy food. In French class, I kept clashing with our petty teacher, missus F. She handed out detentions like candy. Sure, it made sense for kids who chatted or skipped homework, but me? I was a decent student, polite and respectful. Still, if I accidentally let one slip and someone made a fuss, that alone earned me detention. I tried everything to dodge her wrath, sitting by an open window, even pleading with my parents for less gassy meals. But the detentions kept coming without any clear reason. This school didn't have to justify them, and the teacher certainly didn't. I kept it quiet for a while. Both my parents worked late anyway, and I didn't think they could do much. That is, until I landed in detention on my 14th birthday. My parents always made a big deal out of it since it was close to Christmas. A day just for me, with any dinner and whatever I wanted all night long. Now, this detention was scheduled to last for two hours, so there was no way I was getting home before mom and dad did. They were pissed when they found out that for nearly two months straight, I been losing break times, lunch times, and hours of my home life to this woman's insanity in her efforts to get me to stop farting. Now, my dad was home after my mom every day, and he asked my brother where my mom and I were, as my mother had come to get me after calling the school to find out I was in after school detention.

Sunny turned around along with his yellow teeth and told me to mind my own business. I suggested maybe he should get some water and cool off. That's when his face turned red like a tomato and he started screaming about how nobody tells him, a grown ah man, what to do. The situation escalated faster than I expected. His acidic spit was hitting my cheek while he ranted about how his dad would destroy me. I kept my hands at my sides and told him to just walk away.

My manager, Dave announced daily team meeting in conference room B. I figured this was part of the job. We'd clock out at 5:15 p. M. After the meeting. Which meant an extra 2.5 hours on my paycheck every two weeks. Easy money for just sitting and listening, right? Wrong. When my first paycheck came, I stared at it confused. 80 hours exactly. No overtime, no extra time for those daily meetings. I pulled aside two of my co workers, Jason and Amy, during lunch. Hey, do you guys get paid for those after work meetings? I asked. Jason laughed bitterly. Dude, we've been doing this for three years. Nobody gets paid for those. Dave says it's team building and essential communication. Amy added, making air quotes, but HR won't classify it as work time. That afternoon at 4:55, Dave did his usual routine. Log off, everyone. Meeting time. I followed everyone to the conference room like a sheep. Dave droned on about quarterly goals and client satisfaction scores. Same stuff. He could have put In an email at exactly 5:00 p m. I stood up. Sorry, Dave. I need to be somewhere important, I said, grabbing my bag. 10 pairs of eyes stared at me. Dave looked.

I've been overseas for 8 months. My 2,018 Honda Civic fully paid off, sitting in my parents driveway with a car cover and explicit instructions to my family, don't touch it. I get back, jet lagged and exhausted, ask my dad where my car is. He goes quiet. You need to talk to your brother. Turns out Derek had been using again. Oxy, then fentanyl, then whatever he could. Get my car title from my room, forged my signature, and sold my car to some dealer for $8,000. Spent it all in two weeks. When I confronted him, he didn't even apologize. Just said, it's just a car, man. You'll get another one. Like I hadn't worked double shifts for 2 years to buy it. Like it wasn't my only way to get to work. Derek was three months away from graduating pharmacy school. Yeah, pharmacy school. A drug addict studying to dispense drugs legally. He'd already landed a job at CVS starting at $65,000 right after graduation. That's when I realized Derek hadn't just stolen my car. He'd stolen my trust. So I decided to return the favor. First, I called the school's academic integrity office, told them I was concerned about a student with substance abuse issues who might be cheating. Had Derek's student ID from old family photos, knew his class schedule from overhearing him on calls. I didn't lie. I just Asked question. What's your policy on students with drug dependencies? How do you verify academic honesty during take home exam? They started an investigation not because of anything I said, but because Derek was already on their radar. Turns out his grades had been suspicious. Perfect scores on exams. He never studied for assignments that looked professionally written. Phase 2 was his job offer. I looked up CVS's corporate hiring policies online, found their drug testing requirements and background check procedures. Then I made an anonymous call to their HR department. I'm calling to report that one of your recent hires might have a substance abuse problem. I said I thought you should know before he starts handling controlled substances. They thanked me for the tip and said they'd follow standard protocol.

He asked, rolling up his sleeves. I'm fine, I said automatically. Then, unable to help myself, tell me why I should believe you're good enough for her. He sat down the glass he was holding.

The first time my lunch disappeared, I figured it was an honest mistake. The second time, a coincidence. By the fifth time, it was unmistakably theft. My homemade Italian sandwiches, carefully packed salads, leftover pasta, all vanishing from the company fridge, despite clear labels with my name, Alex Marino, do not eat. I tried everything. Labelled containers with red warning stickers, used an insulated bag, even left passive aggressive notes in the breakroom. Nothing worked. HR was useless. Without proof, we can't accuse anyone. Security cameras, privacy concerns, and common areas. They suggested I keep my lunch at my desk. Why should I adapt to a thief? One Tuesday, I added a small camera to my desk plant angled toward the breakroom door. By Wednesday afternoon, I had my culprit, Derek Williams, Marketing Director, one pay grade above me, friend of the CEO, on camera. He casually strolled in at 12:15, opened the fridge, scanned its contents, then deliberately selected my container. No hesitation, no confusion. He even smirked slightly before walking out with my chicken pesto sandwich. Confronting him directly seemed risky. Outranked me. And office politics at Patterson and Burke heavily favored management. Filing another HR complaint would lead nowhere. I needed something more memorable. My opportunity came with the announcement of the annual holiday party theme. Patterson Burke Family Feast, a potluck where executives would judge dishes in various categories. Got a five hundred dollar gift card and company wide recognition. Derek, according to office gossip, prided himself on his culinary expertise. He won the appetizer category three years running with his secret family recipe. Buffalo Chicken Dip. Perfect. For the next two weeks I let him take my lunch without complaint. Each meal more tempting than the last. Aromatic curry. Gourmet.

Captain of the basketball team, straight A student, and somehow still the most grounded, humble person you'd ever meet. But what made Marcus legendary wasn't just his skills on the court. It was how he treated people. He wasn't just admired, he was respected. Genuinely, the guy knew everyone's name. Not in a fake politician way, either. He remembered little things. If you mentioned your grandma was sick and passing, he'd ask how she was doing a week later. If you were struggling in class, he'd sit with you at lunch, walking you through the assignment like it was no big deal. He made you feel like you mattered. And came senior year, and with it something none of us expected. Mister Patel, our math teacher, was diagnosed with cancer. He was one of those rare teachers everyone liked. Strict but fair. Always willing to help, even if it meant staying late. We found out his insurance wouldn't cover the experimental treatment he needed. Words spread quickly. The mood at school changed overnight. Everyone felt it. The very next morning, Marcus got on the PA system. Calm and direct. This Saturday, we're hosting a charity basketball tournament. $5 to watch, 20 to play.

Before I could, Taylor, the pretty senior everyone wanted to date, cornered me by my locker after third period. Her smile was sweet, laced with bitterness. I need to stop hovering around Jeremy, she said, flipping her gorgeous blonde hair over her shoulder. He doesn't want you around. I felt my cheeks burn. Yes, he does. We're friends. He doesn't mind it. Oh, let's go ask him. Before I could protest, she grabbed my wrist and dragged me across the cafeteria where Jeremy sat with his basketball teammates. Everyone was watching. She dropped my arm by the entrance and hopped over to them. My. My heart pounded as she put on her sweetest voice, practically purring as she leaned against his chair. Hey, I've been wondering, she said, playing with his shoulder, is Sarah your girlfriend or what? Everyone at that table laughed. Sarah, the nerd with the braces? Are you dating her, man? One of his teammates asked. I would never go out with her, he said, loud enough for the nearby tables to hear. We're not even friends. She just likes doing homework. Oh, that's cold, they said, bursting into laughter. Taylor glanced back at me with a smirk that said everything. I ran straight to the bathroom, where I locked myself in a doll and cried until my eyes were too swollen to hide. Ever since we were little, we've been best friends. We studied together, played together, went on family trips. We even made matching friendship bracelets at summer. And the way he looked at me when it was just the two of us. I really thought he'd fallen for me, too. But after that day in the cafeteria, I disappeared from his life completely. I took different hallways to avoid him. I ate lunch in the library. I stopped coming to Sunday dinners, telling my mom I had too much homework. He started dating Taylor the day after, hurting me. Eventually, I had the courage to return all of his stuff.

I was wrong. Things got really bad during election season last year. Every family gathering turned into Rachel giving speeches about how the country was going to hell.

I muted that chat after she sent a 47 message rant at 3 in the morning the week before the election. I was making dinner when our doorbell rang. I opened it and there was a package sitting there with my name on it. No delivery guy in sight, which was weird because usually they at least wait for you to grab it.

When he finally got back around 9, I showed him the box, he looked at the return address, and his face just fell. He goes, oh, no, what did she do now? We opened it together, and inside was this massive political flag with some really offensive stuff written on it. Like, genuinely nasty, hateful messaging that I'm not even going to repeat. There was also a note that said something like, thought you might want to show your true colours finally, with a winking face drawn.

In elementary school, hot lunch Fridays were everything. That was the only day the cafeteria served pizza instead of the usual bland government meals. The whole school buzzed about it all week. The smell would hit you before you even entered the lunchroom. Golden crust, melted cheese. Little square slices that somehow felt like magic. But the catch was, it cost two. We didn't have it. So every Friday, I faked being sick. Mom didn't push back. I was a good student. Never missed school unless I had to. When I said I wasn't feeling well, she believed me. I curl up in front of the TV and try not to think about what I was missing. It wasn't just the pizza. It was what the pizza meant. Sitting at the table, being part of the group. Not having to explain yourself or feel different. But one Friday, I had a spelling test I couldn't skip. I went to school, stomach twisted in knots. When lunchtime came, I grabbed my usual free tray and walked to the table, already bracing for it. All around me, kids were tearing open greasy cardboard boxes, laughing and trading slices. That's when the kid whose dad owned the town's car dealership looked at my tray and said, loud enough for everyone to hear you. What's that even supposed to be? The table exploded with laughter. My ears burned. I stared down at the gray Lump on my tray and said quietly, Salisbury steak. That night, I couldn't hold it in. I begged mom for pizza money. She emptied her purse on the table, counting out coins and old receipts. She gave me a small, tired smile and said, next week, baby. I promise. The next Friday, I opened my backpack and found $2 folded in a scrap of paper. For three weeks, I had pizza like everyone else. I laughed. I felt normal. But then mom lost her second job, and that Friday, I was back to the government tray. I tried to keep my head down. I sat quietly. But before I could even take a bite, the rich kid turned and started up again. Same smirk, same voice. Ready to embarrass me all over again. But he never got.

My mom was always strict but fair. No TV on school nights, grades before games. The usual stuff. Then I got into this habit of whistling all the time. My mom would always tell me to knock it off. Then she announced a new household rule. No whistling. Not inside, not outside. Not even humming with a whistle like tone. At first I thought she was joking. Who bans whistling? But she was dead serious. Complete with a three strikes policy where the third offense meant losing my phone for a week. The first time I broke the rule, I was brushing my teeth and absent mindedly whistling a song. She appeared in the bathroom doorway. Strike one, she said, her face completely neutral. I laughed it off. Mom, this is ridiculous. It's just whistling. It's not just whistling, she snapped. Just follow the damn rule! Two nights later, I whistled while taking out the trash. Like, two. My dad thought the whole thing was as weird as I did. He'd raise his eyebrows and shrug whenever mom went on whistling patrol, but he never challenged her on it. That was their marriage in a nutshell. She made the rules, he went along to keep the peace. I made it almost a month without another slip up. Then one night, I was hanging in my room, headphones on, when I caught myself whistling along to the beat. I didn't even realize I'd done it until my door flew open. Mom stood there, tears streaming down her face. I yanked my headphones off. Mom. Instead of saying, strike three, she just buried her face in her hands, sobbing. In 14 years, I'd seen my mother cry exactly twice. When her dad died and when our dog got hit by a car. I'm sorry, I said. I didn't mean to whistle. It was an accident. She grabbed my hand.

My eight year old daughter, Ella, has been through hell. Her mom is a complete mess. Drugs, alcohol, arrests, the whole disaster package. I got full custody when she was little, and I've been with my wife Laura, since Ella was two. Laura knew exactly what she was signing up for. When we got married, she said she was cool with it all, that she understood Ella came first. But now Laura wants to adopt Ella to completely cut out her biological mom. And I get it. Every time Ella's mom shows up for her court ordered visits, she either doesn't come at all or shows up high. Last time she came to pick up Ella for a supervised visit, she reeked of weed and couldn't even remember what grade Ella was in. Social worker had to send her home. Ella's been in therapy for years, trying to process why her mom can't just be normal. She draws pictures of them together sometimes, where her mom looks clean and happy. It breaks my heart every single time. But even with all this pain, Ella doesn't want Laura to adopt her. I asked her about it privately. She said she still loves her real mom and hopes she'll get better someday. Laura lost it when I told her Ella's decision. She started going on about how we have our two other kids to think about, how Ella might choose her train wreck mom over us if she keeps coming around. She said she's tired of just being the stepmom when she's been more of a mother to Ella than her actual mom ever was. I've been putting Ella first for six years, he said, pacing around our kitchen last week. I pack her lunches, I help with homework, I take her to therapy appointments, but legally, I'm nobody to her.

I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages. Actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs. Supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. The truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after six months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, cable management systems. I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store.

Everything unraveled because a doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbour's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? There returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them.

So I'm sitting in this courtroom wearing my grandfather's old blazer that smells like meatballs, and my neighbor's husband is pointing at me like I'm some kind of criminal mastermind. He's suing me for $25,000 because he claims my inherited parrot, Casanova, deliberately seduced his wife and destroyed their marriage. I'm not making this up. My parrot is apparently a homewrecker. The whole thing started when my grandfather passed away three months ago. We were really close. He basically raised me after my parents died. Every Sunday, I visit his apartment above the old barber shop he used to run back in the eighties. Grandpa found Casanova abandoned in a cardboard box behind his shop in 1987, right around when my grandmother left him. That bird became his whole world. Casanova Learned to talk from years of daytime TV and gossiping customers, getting perms. The bird would whistle at everything. The coffee maker, the mailman, Judge Judy on TV. He'd whistle the theme from jeopardy. Whenever I walked in, he'd walk, looking good, sweetheart. The exact way Grandpa used to greet grandma. When Grandpa died, I couldn't let Casanova go to some rescue, so I brought him to my apartment, set up his massive cage by the window where he could watch the street. I even played his favorite show, friends, on my laptop. The bird was grieving, too, you know? Everything went downhill when my neighbors, Vincent and Gina Were walking past my apartment window. Casanova was doing his usual routine, whistling at the plants, saying, hey there, hot stuff. Gina burst out laughing. She was doubled over, tears streaming down her face, telling Vincent, oh my god, that bird is so funny. Vincent smile dropped immediately. Step toward my window with his fists clenched, like he was about to swing at Casanova. A 45 year old man squaring up to fight a parrot. Gina had to pull him back, still giggling, which only made it worse. From that moment, Vincent became convinced this was a personal attack. He started stalking my parrot. I'm talking full surveillance mode. He installed a ring camera pointed at my window, bought some kind of parrot repellent on eBay. Even hired what he called a bird behaviorist, who turned out to be just some guy from Craigslist. Vincent

Maybe you should skip this trip. I said, fine, I'll skip it, and pulled out my phone to show them exactly what I've been contributing. Let me explain. My friends Nico, Chloe, and Sam had been planning this Miami trip for half a year. What they didn't know was that I'd secretly paid for everything three months ago. $3,200 for the beachfront Airbnb, $1,100 for the boat rental, $800 for V I P. Club tables, $600 for parasailing. They had supported me when I was broke and my dad had cancer, so I wanted to show how thankful I was. But I shouldn't have been that naive. We were already at the airport when Nico cornered me by the charging stations, Sam and Chloe flanking him. Arthur, we need to talk. Is this about the Uber? I said I'd pay you back. I offered, sensing something worse. It's about everything, Chloe said, loud enough for other passengers to start staring. I don't think you should accompany us on this trip. You're a leech. You never contribute anything to this group. What? I literally designed Nico's business logo for free. I even helped you move twice. Nico made air quotes with his hands. That doesn't count. Remember Vegas? You still owe me 50 bucks. Remember Josh's bachelor party? Sam had to cover your entire share. That was during my dad's chemo. I said quietly, I told you guys I was Broke. Because you always have an excuse. Chloe cut me off. Your dad, your freelance work, your car breaking down. We're exhausted being your personal ATM. I looked at Sam, desperately hoping for some support. Sam, come on. You know what I was dealing with. You saw the medical bills. Sam shrugged. Actually shrugged. Maybe you weren't ready to be part of a trip this expensive. We got you economy while we're in premium. That should tell you where you stand. I can afford. Can you really? Chloe pulled out her phone, scrolling through old Venmo requests. Six months of drinks we covered, four concerts where we spotted you. That Coachella trip where you mysteriously only brought $40. I paid you all back. I protested after we had to ask five times each. Nico said, look, Arthur, we're trying to have an adult vacation. Real money, real fun. You're still living paycheck to paycheck like we're 22. My business made $85,000

Make it until graduation and you've got a deal, I whispered back. Fifty bucks says you crack in a month. He smirked, extending his hand. We shook on it right there between plastic models of DNA strands. That night I researched everything about red green color blindness. I Learned about Isihara tests, those dotted circles doctors use, how color blind people navigate traffic lights, and common mistakes they make. By morning, I had a game plan. Day one, I accidentally mixed up my red and green folders in front of our math teacher. Sorry, I mumbled, just loud enough for him to hear. They look the same to me. He paused mid equation. Thomas, are you colorblind? I feigned embarrassment, staring at my shoes. Yeah, I don't really talk about it. Words spread through the teacher's lounge like wildfire. By lunch, my history teacher was asking if I needed special accommodations for map activities. By the end of the week, the school counselor called me in to discuss my learning needs. I committed fully. I bought special colorblind glasses online that did absolutely nothing but look convincing, wearing them dramatically during school events and removing

During the plane ride up, instead of a safety briefing, he quizzed me. Calculate our terminal velocity, factor in wind resistance. What forces are at work when the parachute deploys? I was terrified, but answered each question, surprising myself when the concepts finally clicked. Good. He nodded.

What I saw will haunt me forever. I've been doing water rescue for eight years now, and most calls are body recovery, not rescue. People don't survive long in these freezing northern waters. But what I found last Tuesday has me ready to quit and never look back. The all came at 2 p m. When a father took his seven year old daughter, Emma, fishing at Crystal Lake. He turned away for 30 seconds to untangle his line. And when he looked back, she was gone. No splash, no scream. Just gone. I knew she was dead before we even arrived because the water temp was 42 degrees. Even if she could swim, hypothermia would kill her in minutes. But we had to try. My dive partner Jake and I searched the main area for three hours, but we found nothing. The current was brutal from recent storms. And that's when I noticed something odd. One of the old creek beds that had been dry for years was flowing again. And heavy rains must have opened it back up. I followed the creek and realized where it LED, which made my blood go cold. The dead zone. That's what the older divers called the deepest part of Crystal Lake. Hundred yard stretch where the water drops to over two hundred feet. We're strictly forbidden from diving there because unpredictable currents will kill you. They Always said. But the creek LED directly into the dead zone. So if Emma got swept into that current, her body would be down there. Jake was searching the other side of the lake, so I made a decision that still haunts me. I geared up and dropped into the forbidden waters alone. The first thing I noticed was how wrong the older divers were, because there was no current at all. The water was eerily still, like swimming in black suit. And I descended fifty feet, then a hundred, with nothing but darkness below. At 150 feet, my light finally hit something, and I thought it was seaweed at first. Long, pale strands swaying in the water. But as I got closer, I realized what I was really looking at. Arms. Hundreds of human arms, growing from the lake bottom like some twisted underwater forest. They were all different sizes, from tiny baby arms no bigger than my thumb, to adult arms thick as tree branches. All of them were pale green and moving slowly, grasping at the water around them. And they had roots spreading through the sediment, like they've been planted there.

He loves me. But deep down, I felt like I was drowning. At my family barbecue, Tyler was being his usual controlling self, interrupting every conversation. I started pulling me away when I laughed, with my cousins standing so close behind me, I could barely breathe. I watched my family's faces change when he'd speak for me or cut me off mid sentence. I was embarrassed, but felt trapped. How do you tell your family your boyfriend is suffocating you when you're not even sure if it's bad enough to complain about? That's when my sister Maya appeared. Jess! She squealed, grabbing my arm with fake enthusiasm. Mom needs you inside right now. Wedding planning emergency. I was genuinely confused. What wedding? Cousin Amy's the 1 we've been helping plan. She shot Tyler a sweet smile that didn't reach her eyes. Sorry, Tyler. Total girl emergency. You know how crazy wedding Stuff gets.

I was 14 and I was walking through the mall when I saw a girl my age sitting alone at the arcade playing a racing game by herself. She looked really lonely, mashing buttons and talking to the screen like she had someone to compete with, making sound effects and celebrating when she won races against nobody. So I decided to go over and challenge her to try and make her day better. I walked up to her and asked if I wanted to race against her and I saw her face just completely change. Really? You really wanna play against me? I told her yes and I asked her which game she wanted to play so I could show her some moves. I knew she got excited and was about to pick a two player game, but then at the last second she stopped. She grabbed her backpack and said, the last time someone asked to play games with me and I let them use my quarters, they took all my money and left me standing there with nothing. My mom called me stupid and said stupid kids don't deserve more arcade money and I had to save up my allowance for three weeks just to come back here. I'm not stupid anymore and I'm not sharing. She turned around clutching her bag tight and my heart broke for her. I walked back over and Pinky promised her I wasn't going to take her money and told her I'd use my own quarters right next to her so I couldn't steal anything. I even showed her my wallet to prove I had my own money. She ended up agreeing to play, and when I showed her the combo moves, she was absolutely amazed. She yelled, that's so awesome! Teach me how to do that! She then started practicing really hard, and although she was messing up the timing at first, she seemed so focused and determined. I'll beat you, just you watch, she said with this fierce look in her eyes. And then after a full hour of trying and failing and trying again, she pulled off the combo perfectly. When she did, she was so thrilled she jumped up and down screaming and called me her awesome new gaming buddy. We took turns playing different games the rest of the afternoon, and she kept getting better and better at everything I taught her. When I told her I had to go home, she looked disappointed, but then asked me if I wanted to meet.

Basic conversation, nothing special. She sends me a paragraph about her weekend plans.

We're not engaged, but Madison's just getting started. She screenshots our entire conversation and post it on her Instagram story with the caption, men really think they can just ignore women with no consequences? No consequences? It's a dating app, not a legally binding contract. Then she finds my LinkedIn somehow discovers where I go to school, and files a formal complaint with the university ethics committee for demonstrating poor character and disrespect.

I thought I hit the Jackpot when the Morrison family offered me $300 to babysit their daughter for one night. I had no idea this would be the last normal day of my life. The job seemed perfect. Rich neighborhood, well behaved kid, easy money. What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. When I arrived at their mansion on Elm Street, Missus Morrison answered the door, looking absolutely exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, hands shaking slightly as she spoke. Thank god you're here, Riley, she said, practically pulling me inside. We haven't had a night out in months. Mr. Morrison came downstairs carrying their seven year old daughter, Sophie. The little girl was adorable, with curly blonde hair and big blue eyes. But something felt off. She didn't smile when she saw me. She just stared. Before we leave, Miss, Missus Morrison said, handing me several folded papers. These are very important instructions. Please follow them exactly. Sophie's special. I nodded, stuffing the papers in my pocket without reading them. Big mistake. They left in a hurry, practically running to their car. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30 she yawned and said she was getting Tired? What time is your bedtime? I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by 8 p m, she said. Matter of factly locked? That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes. I figured I'd check the instructions once I got her settled. I tucked Sophie into her bed at 7:55. As I was leaving, she grabbed my arm. Don't forget to lock the door, whispered urgently. And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to? Promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay. I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock. This was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key. Downstairs, I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice.

Maya's like, you know, daddy's friend who always sits in the front seat. She gives him kisses goodbye, and her lipstick is super pretty. My stomach dropped so hard, I thought I might throw up right there on the clean laundry. I've been finding red lipstick on his collar for months, but he kept saying it was from work, meetings, handshakes, whatever. I even bought the same shade, trying to figure out where it came from, like some kind of detective. The whole time, it was right there, picking up my baby from school. I'm trying to keep my voice steady because Maya's still chattering away, completely innocent. How long has Miss Britney been picking you up, sweetheart? Maya starts counting on her fingers, tongue sticking out in concentration. Maybe two months. She's really nice and smells like flowers. Oh, and she always fixes daddy's hair before they kiss. Like this. She demonstrated by grabbing her own face and making exaggerated kissing sounds. Not a cheek peck, a real kiss. My seven year old was unknowingly describing my husband's affair in perfect detail. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom, where I sat on the toilet seat and cried for ten minutes, my whole body shaking. All those late nights, all those work emergencies.

In fourth grade, a kid named Tyler walked up to me during recess and said, I'll give you five bucks if you pretend to be my twin brother for the whole day. I looked at him completely confused, because Tyler and I looked nothing alike. I had dark hair, he was blond. I wore glasses, he didn't. He was short, I was tall. But five bucks was five bucks, and I wasn't about to turn down free money. So I shrugged and said, deal. That's when I Learned he had already been telling everyone in our class that he had a secret twin who went to another school. Apparently, this started as a joke, but then people actually believed him. And instead of admitting he was lying, he doubled down. Now he needed me to prove it. The plan. Every time someone asked him something, I'd answer for him and vice versa. If a teacher called on him, I had to answer like I was also Tyler. If someone asked me a question, he'd respond like we were one person. It was the stupidest thing ever, but for some reason, people actually bought it. Then in gym class, things went very wrong. We were playing dodgeball when a teacher stopped the game and yelled, Tyler, why are you on both teams? I panicked. Tyler panicked. We both just stood there staring at her, waiting for the other to say something. Then Tyler grabbed his knee, fell over and yelled, Mrs. Davis, I think I'm seeing double. She genuinely looked concerned. She walked us both to the nurse's office, where Tyler kept acting dizzy, saying he felt weird, like there were two of him. We sat there for twenty minutes while the nurse gave him crackers and told him to breathe slowly. By the end of the day, he so committed to the bit that he even wrote my name on his homework and tried to turn it in. The next morning, he handed me a single dollar Bill and said, sorry, I only have this. But you were the best fake twin ever. I never got the rest of my money. Most importantly, Sophie has been dead for three years. What's in that room is something else. Something that found her body and decided to wear it. We can't get rid of it, so we contain it.

Something was waiting for us. It was ten thirty one PM when my phone buzzed with an emergency alert that said do not enter underground structures such as basements. Stay above ground until they all clear. My husband Mark looked up from his own phone and we stared at each other, both having received the same message. What do you think's going on? I asked, glancing toward our basement door. Our five year old daughter, Emma had been asleep for an hour upstairs. Could be a gas leak or radar issue, Mark replied, but his voice sounded uncertain. I ran upstairs to check on Emma, who was sleeping peacefully in her bed, then came back down to find Mark staring at the TV. The local news channel was displaying the same emergency alert in blocky white letters on a black screen, but when he flipped to CNN and other networks, there was nothing about any emergency in our area. I pulled out my phone and searched Google for any news about the alert, but nothing came up. I texted Sarah, a neighbor from two streets over, asking if she'd gotten the same message. No response. I think we should leave, I said, grabbing a duffel bag from the closet. We can go to my sister's place until this clears up. But Emma has school tomorrow and I have work, Mark protested. Don't you work from home on Mondays, anyway? I replied, already packing clothes and Emma's favorite stuffed animals into the bag. While Mark hesitated, I walked over to our basement door and noticed the chain lock was latched. I hurried to the kitchen, grabbed some duct tape, and started sealing the cracks around the basement door. What are you doing? Mark asked. If it's some kind of gas leak, I don't want it getting into the rest of the house, I said, pulling another strip of tape across the bottom gap. Within 10 minutes, I had packed our essentials and was ready to leave. Mark finally agreed to wake Emma, and we carried her out to the car. Wrapped in blankets. She stirred sleepily, but didn't fully wake up as I strapped her into her car seat. As we pulled out of our driveway, I noticed how quiet the neighborhood was. If everyone had gotten the same alert, wouldn't more people be leaving? The houses on our street were all dark except for automatic porch lights, and there were no other cars on the road.

But then something shifts in her eyes. Instead of breaking down, she gets this quiet confidence I hadn't seen before. Actually, you're right about high school. Just graduated. Valedictorian last month. The guy smirks like he just proved his point, completely missing the steel in her voice. See? Exactly what I thought. Get someone with actual experience. Here's what this jerk didn't know. Emma had been telling us all week how nervous she was about proving herself to her Family. How she wanted to earn every promotion, every bit of respect. How she was terrified people would think she only got opportunities because of her last name. She'd been working at McDonald's. She was 16, sending half her paychecks home to help her mom pay rent after her dad left them with nothing but debt. This job at her family's restaurant was supposed to be temporary, just until she left for Princeton in the fall on a

They kicked me out at 17 when my girlfriend Thea got pregnant. Not asked to leave. Literally threw my stuff on the lawn and changed the locks. Dad screamed I was throwing my life away. Mom cried about the neighbors. Their ultimatum. Break up with Thea and give the baby up or never come home. I chose Thea. We lived in my car for two months, then a friend's basement. Those first weeks were hell. Thea had morning sickness so bad she couldn't keep anything down. I'd hold her hair back in gas station bathrooms, both of us crying. I remember one night in November, the car windows fog up from our breathing. Thea was shivering despite three blankets. She whispered, maybe your parents were right. Maybe we're too young for this. I held her tighter and said, no, we're going to prove them wrong. But honestly, I was terrified. I'd wake up at three a m. In panic attacks, wondering how we'd afford formula or doctor visits. Thea would rub my back and remind me we had each other. The worst part was driving past my house for school. I'd see mom watering her flowers, dad washing his car. Normal life continuing like I'd never existed. Thea caught me staring once and just squeezed my hand. They don't deserve you, she said. But I still missed them every single day. Her parents weren't thrilled either, but they never abandoned her. Mom Delfine started buying prenatal vitamins and baby clothes. Her dad taught me basic car maintenance so I wouldn't get stranded. Family sticks together, Delfine told me one night. Blood or not, that hit different when my own blood relatives had written me off. Christmas was the hardest. Thea's family invited me.

I've been working at this upscale steakhouse called the Prime Cut for almost four years now, and I've seen more first dates than I can count. Most blend together in my memory, but there was one last Tuesday that I'll never forget. The evening rush hadn't started yet when this woman walked in. Late 20s, wearing a sundress that still had the tags tucked in, clutching a small wrapped gift that looked like it came from the bookstore next door. She was 50 minutes early for her reservation and asked for a specific spot at the bar that she requested when booking. As I set up her area, I noticed her hands trembling slightly as she placed the gift on the empty stool beside her. She kept checking her reflection in the mirror behind the bar, are adjusting her earrings and practicing what looked like conversation starters under her breath. So how was your drive over? She whispered to herself, then shook her head and tried again. Is this your first time at the prime cut? The nervousness was radiating off her in waves. For those 15 minutes, she just sat there nursing a Diet Coke, rearranging her purse, and checking her phone every two minutes. Our manager even asked if everything was okay, and she assured us her date was coming at 7:00. When he finally arrived, the contrast was immediate. He was polished, expensive watch, tailored jacket. But He barely acknowledged her as he slid onto the stool. Before she could even hand him the gift, he pulled out his phone and started scrolling, saying, sorry. Client stuff. You know how it is. The woman's face fell for a split second before she plastered on a smile and gently placed the gift on the bar between them. I brought them water and took their drink orders. A simple wine spritzer for her, a specific brand of Bourbon with exactly two ice cubes, not crushed, for him. When I returned with their drinks, he was still glued to his phone. She was desperately trying to connect, asking about his work, his weekend plans, his thoughts on the restaurant, while he gave one word answers without looking up. The few times he did engage, it was to interrupt her

My parents thought I was just being lazy, so they dragged me out of bed for family stuff. I'd literally fall asleep standing up during conversations. The worst part was watching my social life disappear. My friends stopped inviting me places because I'd either cancel last minute or fall asleep during movies. I remember one time at my best friend Maya's sleepover, all the girls were up talking and laughing at 2 a m. And I was passed out on her couch like I'd been drugged. They took pictures of me sleeping and posted them on social media as a joke. I laughed along, but deep down I felt broken and humiliated. I started avoiding social situations entirely because I was so embarrassed. My boyfriend at the time, Dylan, broke up with me because he said dating me was like dating a zombie. He told me I was no fun anymore and that I cared more about sleeping than spending time with him. That destroyed me because I desperately wanted to be present, but I physically couldn't stay awake. At school, I'd sleep through entire classes. Teachers would shake me awake, and I'd have zero memory of falling asleep. My English teacher, Missus Thompson, pulled me aside after I slept. Through a test and asked if everything was okay at home. Started crying because I couldn't explain that I wasn't staying up late playing video games or partying. I was just exhausted.

I just found my boyfriend's name on a murder list. I moved into apartment 42 with my boyfriend Marcus three days ago. We've been together for five years and finally saved enough to leave our parents houses. He's 24, I'm 22. And this was supposed to be our fresh start together. The apartment was way too good for our budget. Two bedrooms, city part views, balcony deposit free with a five year lease option. The landlord said no inspections, no questions asked. It felt too good to be true, but we were desperate. On our first morning, I found a handwritten note in the kitchen cupboard. Beautiful cursive writing that said new occupier of apartment 42 on the outside. Inside was a 12 rule survival guide from the previous tenant. Missus Prudence Hemmings, who lived here 35 years before her husband died in some kind of incident. Rule seemed insane at first. Never use the elevator between 1:11 and 3:00am. Ignore the window cleaner who appears on the balcony. Don't talk to neighbors claiming to live in apartment 65 to 72 because those burned down in the 80s and everyone died. Keep weapons in every room. Don't babysit Terry's kids from Apartment 26. I thought it was some sick joke until everything started happening exactly as described. At 11:00am, a friendly window cleaner knocked on our balcony door on the seventh floor. He exactly 30 minutes tapping and Calling out, never breaking eye contact through the glass. When he left, I checked every balcony in the building. He vanished completely. That afternoon, I heard the animal noises from apartment 48. Not dog barking or cat meowing. Something else. Something that sounded like it was in pain. Dying slowly, over and over again. At 8:00am the next morning, the postman, Ian, knocked. When I opened the door, he looked at me with sad eyes and said, missus Hemmings left something for you, didn't she? I'm sorry about what's coming. What do you mean? I asked. The rules aren't suggestions, he whispered. They're the only thing keeping you alive. This building feeds on people who don't follow them. That's when I noticed the damp patch on our bedroom ceiling had turned deep red overnight. Not rust or water damage. It looked like blood pooling and spreading, but never dripping. Marcus had been acting strange since we moved in. Distant, jumpy, checking the time constantly. Yesterday, he kept muttering about his early shift, saying he had to leave at 3:15.

This kid has serious anger issues. Every time we go to the playground, it's the same story. He sees a toy he wants, walks over, and if the kid won't hand it over, he just hits them. Not a little push or shove, full on punches to the face. I'm talking about a seven year old who thinks violence solves everything. My sister just stands there going, use your words, honey, while some poor toddler is crying with a bloody nose. It's embarrassing as hell. But more than that, it breaks my heart. I see the way other parents look at us, the way they quickly gather their kids and move to the other side of the playground. We've become those people. The worst part is watching my nephew's face after these incidents. There's this moment right after he hits someone where I swear I can see confusion in his eyes, like he doesn't understand why everyone's upset, why the other kid is crying, why suddenly he's alone again. It's like he wants to connect with these kids, but the only way he knows how to get what he wants is through force. My sister tries. I know she does. She's a single mom working two jobs, and she's exhausted all the time. She reads all these parenting books and tries the gentle approach, but nothing sticks. Every conversation ends with her crying in my kitchen, asking me what she's Doing wrong. I've watched her blame herself so many times, it makes me sick.

For six months, my German neighbor Heidi had been hosting these fancy dinner parties. I could hear through our shared apartment wall. I never got invited, but I could hear everything, including when she'd switch to German with her friends. What Heidi didn't know was that my mom is German. I grew up speaking it at home, but rarely mentioned it since moving to the city. Why would I? Every weekend, like clockwork, I'd hear Heidi and her friends laughing. Die amerikanerin und die banane ist so languish. The American next door is so boring. Or the hat kind gushmack. She has no taste. Once she even joked about my pathetic dating life after seeing me bring home the same guy twice. At first, I brushed it off. Just mean girl talk, right? But week after week, it started to wear on me. I'd catch myself standing in front of my closet, overthinking my outfits. Is my style really that bad? I started ordering takeout from different restaurants to seem more cultured. And walking through our hallway with bags. God, how pathetic is that? The worst was when my mom came to visit. We were speaking German in the elevator when Heidi got in. Mom was mid sentence about her garden back home when Heidi's eyes widened with recognition at the language. She stared at the floor numbers like they were the most fascinating thing she'd ever first Seen. My stomach dropped, not because she'd heard us speaking German, but because I realized how deeply I'd let her comments affect me. I hadn't even told my own mother about the situation because I was embarrassed about not stand standing up for myself. That night, after mom left, I sat alone in my apartment, listening to Heidi's laughter. Through the wall I could hear glasses clinking, music playing, and then, right on cue, hear a mutter zephanio languidly like alswiezie. Her mother looks just as boring as she does.

He's riding my bumper so close I can't see his headlights, flashing his high beams and honking. I don't speed up, he starts swerving into the oncoming lane, trying to pass on a two lane road with heavy traffic. Finally he finds a gap and floors it past me, but not before rolling down his window to flip me off and scream something about learning how to drive. Here's where it gets interesting. The guy immediately cuts back into my lane, nearly clipping my front bumper, then slams on his brakes to teach me a lesson about following distance. I had to break hard to avoid rear ending him.

Then I see the construction zone ahead, single lane flaggers controlling traffic, and a long line of cars already stopped. Mister Road Rage doesn't notice until the last second. He slams on his brakes, but he's going way too fast. His truck starts skidding on the morning dew and He slides right past the stopped cars into the construction zone. I pull up safely behind the last car in line and watch through my windshield as this guy's truck gets stuck in wet concrete that the crew was pouring for a new sidewalk. The construction workers are yelling and waving their arms as his rear wheels spin uselessly and what's probably $1,000 worth of concrete mix. But wait, it gets better.

I've been living with Jake for eight months when I started noticing my adderall running out faster than it should. At first, I thought maybe I was taking extra doses during final stress, but the numbers weren't adding up. I'm prescribed 30 pills per month, one daily, but by day 20, I'd only have five pills left. This happened three months in a row. Jake was the obvious suspect. He had access to my room where I kept my medication, and had been acting weird. New clothes, expensive dinners, always had cash when he used to be broke. Must be miscounting, he'd say when I mentioned running out early. ADHD brains, right? The thing is, I'm a pharmacy student. Tracking medication is literally what I do. For my senior thesis, I was researching prescription drug diversion, so I've been documenting everything. I decided to set a trap. I bought a small spy camera from Amazon and hid it in my bookshelf, aimed at my desk, where I kept my medication. Then I marked each pill bottle with a tiny dot and photographed every pill from multiple angles. I also started a spreadsheet tracking the exact number of pills, their characteristics, and when I took them. If Jake was stealing, I'd have proof. Three days later, I reviewed the camera footage. There was Jake, 2 p m. On Tuesday, going through my desk while I was in class. He opened my prescription Bottle shook out several pills and put them in his pocket, but I wanted to catch him in the act and see how deep this went. I checked our university's anonymous tip form where students buy and sell things. Sure enough, there was a post from username Jake M94 selling study aids for $20 each. The post had dozens of responses from desperate students looking for Adderall during midterms. I created a fake account and message Jake's username pretending to be a freshman needing study help. Hey, I heard you have study aids available. My roommate mentioned you might have adderall. Yeah, I got the good stuff. Prescription grade, $20 per pill. Meet at the library. He was selling my medication for $20 per pill. Pills that cost me $5.

What's the most absurd emergency you've responded to? We received a dispatch from a hysterical father, shouting and sobbing. My daughter is in critical condition. Please hurry. She has a 115 degree fever. We exchanged glances, thinking, that's not a fever, that's cremation. If this girl's temperature was actually 115, she'd be cooking from the inside. We sped to the residence, like rushing to deliver triplets. Upon arrival, the dad was frantically pacing as if his world was ending. She's upstairs, burning up, won't respond. We charged up the staircase, prepared for severe intervention. When we opened the bedroom door, there she was. Crawled across her bed, pretending to be unconscious, whimpering. My insides are on fire! My bones feel like they're disintegrating. She appeared to be auditioning for a de less drama. As we moved to check her vitals, I noticed a washcloth soaking in scalding water, still limiting steam. I glanced back at her. She froze, eyes wide with panic. We didn't need to take her temperature. I turned to the father. Sir, she's completely fine. He squinted. What do you mean? She fabricated the whole situation. He looked at the steaming cloth, then at his daughter, and visibly deflated. Are you serious? The girl started scrambling. I didn't intend to. I just didn't prepare for my history presentation. Dead silence followed. Then he erupted. You summon paramedics over a school presentation? She attempted justification. I thought I'd get an F. He faced us. You're free to Go. Thanks. As we departed, he slammed her door. We heard objects crashing, yelling, and him declaring, your re. You're grounded till college. Just as we reached our ambulance, he hustled her outside, shoved her into their car, and sped towards school to make her do the conviction overturn. I sued the state for wrongful imprisonment. Use the money to become a criminal defense attorney specializing in cases involving prosecutorial misconduct. Trevor got out last year. Works at a gas station now. Sometimes I drive by just to see how far he's fallen. From governor candidate to night shift attendant. The Maxwells thought they could bury the truth forever. Instead, they just delayed it until the moment it would hurt the most.

One day, this 19 year old kid walks in wearing designer everything, waving around a credit card his daddy gave him. He demanded to skip the basic training and go straight to advanced jumps because he'd played a lot of video games. When I refused, he pulled out his phone and showed me his social media. He had two million followers and made videos doing dangerous stunts. He threatened to post about how our school was refusing service to famous influencers unless we let him skip the basics. My boss, worried about bad publicity, asked me to give him a chance. The kid signed every waiver with a smirk, bragging about how he'd probably teach me some new tricks. He wouldn't stop talking about his parkour videos and how skydiving would be easy mode for someone like him. During the ground training, he kept interrupting me to explain how he'd seen it done differently on YouTube. When I tried to show him proper parachute handling, he rolled his eyes and said, I've watched literally every skydiving video on the internet. Morning of his first jump, he showed up hungover. I told him we'd have to reschedule, but he threatened to sue us for discrimination.

So I accidentally started a full scale latte art controversy because I said thanks wrong. Let me explain. It was Tuesday morning. I'm running on three hours of sleep and the emotional stability of a wet napkin. I stumble into this bougie coffee shop downtown. You know the type. Edison bulbs everywhere. Baristas who look like they exclusively date people with septum piercings and a chalkboard menu written in cursive so fancy it might as well be hieroglyphics. I order a simple cappuccino. Nothing crazy. No oat milk, no extra shots, no interpretive dance on top. Just caffeine in a cup so I can pretend to be a functioning adult. The barista, let's call her Luna, because of course, that's her name, makes my drink with the intensity of someone performing surgery. She's got this little metal pitcher steaming milk like she's summoning spirits. Takes her a solid five minutes to create what I can only describe as the Mona Lisa of foam art. She slides across the counter with this proud smile and goes, I made you a swan. I look down. It's beautiful. Beautiful, like, genuinely impressive. This foam swan is sitting there looking more elegant than I've ever looked in my entire life. I'm genuinely appreciative. So I say, oh, wow, that's really cool. Thanks. And Luna's face just drops like, I told her my dog died. She blinks twice and goes, cool. I pause mid Sip? Yeah, it's. It's really well done. She crosses her arms. I spent six years perfecting latte art. This isn't cool. This is craft. Ma'am, I said it was cool because I think it's impressive. That's. That's a compliment. But Luna's not having it. She turns to her coworker, guy with a mustache that definitely has its own Instagram account, and goes, he called my swan cool. Mustache. Guy looks at me like I just vandalized the declaration of independence, bro. That's dismissive. I'm standing there holding my swan cappuccino, thinking, when did coffee shops become art galleries? With attitude, I try to backtrack. I'm sorry. I meant it's beautiful. Really skillful. Luna gasped. Skillful? It's not

My dad tried to hand the money back, but I stepped away from the table. Nope. A deal's a deal. I'm Officially a rent paying tenant now. My mom said, honey, we didn't mean it literally.

I just pay rent and take over the house. I said, actually, according to your own logic, I can. You've been telling me for years that rent equals rule making power. My mom tried reasoning with me.

At graduation, them holding ultrasound pictures. The room went silent. My

Everyone knew Alexis Parker was untouchable. Investment banker at 28, drove a Tesla, lived in a penthouse. I fixed her AC unit when her buildings regular guy was sick. She watched me work, typing on her laptop, worth more than my monthly rent. When I finished, she said, you're different from the usual repair guys. Because I didn't hit on you? Because you noticed my MIT diploma and didn't suddenly get weird about it. Talked for an hour. She was brilliant, but lonely. Rich people, she said, only saw her money. Poor people only saw her money. Everyone saw her money. What do you see? She asked. Someone whose AC was broken. She laughed. A real laugh, not the polite one rich people do. Started texting me about random broken things. Dishwasher, cabinet door, flickering light. Half weren't even broken. I knew she knew I knew. We both pretended otherwise. One night she called crying. My engagement party is tomorrow. What parents arranged it? He's perfect on paper. Harvard Law, family money. Knows which fork to use. But? But he's never fixed anything with his hands. Never had to. Wouldn't know how. I showed up at her engage party in my only suit. Told everyone I was fixing the wine cooler. Her fiance, Christopher Hale, kept calling me the help. Alexis found me in the kitchen. You came? Your wine cooler is not actually broken. I know. She kissed me. Right there. Catering staff everywhere. This is insane, I said. My whole life is insane. You're the only real thing in it. We dated in secret for three months. She'd come to my studio apartment, amazed I could cook actual food, not just order it. I'd go to her penthouse, amazed anyone needed three bathrooms for one person. Her parents found out when her mother saw us at Home Depot. Alexis was helping me pick tile for a job. Her mother

I'm at McDonald's at 2:00am. Not because I have my life together, but because I was up gooning to productivity videos and realized I hadn't eaten anything except sadness and energy drinks for 12 hours. I pull up to the drive through speaker and this voice comes through. Sound like it's been filtered through three layers of defeat and a broken dreams machine. What you want? Not welcome to McDonald's or how can I help you? Just pure, pure existential exhaustion in four words. So I respond the way my mom raised me. Good evening. Could I please get a Big Mac meal with a Coke? Thank you so much. Silence. Dead silence. Like I just spoke ancient Latin. What? A Big Mac meal, please, with a Coke. Thank you. More silence then. Why are you talking like that? I blink. Like what? All fancy and stuff. You making fun of me? No, I'm just ordering food. Nobody talks that polite at 2:00am. You being sarcastic? Ma'am, I said please and thank you. That's not sarcasm. That's basic human decency. But she's not having it. Hold on. I sit there for five minutes wondering if being raised with manners is now considered a hate crime. She comes back. My manager wants to talk to you. A new voice appears. Male, tired. Sounds like he's been managing teenagers since the Clinton administration. Sir, my employee says you're being Disrespectful? I said please and thank you. Right, but the way you said it was condescending. I'm getting accused of weaponizing politeness, like I'm some kind of manners terrorist. I was just trying to be nice. I explained. See, that's the problem. Nobody's that nice at 2:00am unless they're up to something. Up to something? I'm up to diabetes and poor life choices. That's what 2:00am McDonald's is for. Sir, I just want a burger. And I just want customers who don't mock my staff with fake politeness. Fake politeness? I've been accused of many things, but never artificial courtesy. How would you like me to order? I ask normal, like everyone else. What does normal sound like? Just say what you want. No fancy words. So I try again. Big Mac meal. Coke. Better, but lose the attitude. What attitude?

My Jewish family had a tradition called the debt book. Every child born into our family got their own Ledger on their first birthday. Every expense, diapers, food, clothes, school supplies, medical bills got logged with interest. On your 18th birthday, you were presented with your total debt. Mine was $247,000. Family takes care of family, my father would say. But family also pays family back. The tradition went back four generations. My great grandfather started it during the depression, supposedly to teach financial responsibility. Every adult child paid their parents back in monthly installments. Some took decades to clear their debt. My older brother Jake signed his repayment contract at 18, dropped out of college to work construction. 10 years later, still paying. My sister Maria became a nurse specifically because medical professionals pay off debt faster. When my 18th birthday approached, I did something nobody had ever done. I research. Found out child support is a parent's legal obligation. Not alone discovered that charging your children for their upbringing might actually be illegal. Learned that financial abuse is a real thing. The night of my birthday party, the whole extended family gathered. 50 relatives waiting to witness another debt book signing. My parents presented my Ledger like it was an honor. Two hundred forty seven thousand, one hundred eighty two dollars and sixty three cents. My father announced, very reasonable, Uncle Rob

My cousin Tommy weighed nearly 300 pounds by eighth grade. Kids at school were brutal about it, but at family gatherings, we never mentioned his size. He was just Tommy, the gentle giant who helped grandma pull weeds, always let the younger cousins win at board games, and laughed like a foghorn when something genuinely made him happy. He was everyone's favourite. Every Friday night, our entire family would gather at my aunt's house for dinner. That night, like always, Tommy was sitting cross legged on the floor playing Mario Kart with my little brother, while whiskers, our 17 year old family cat, slept in his usual warm spot near the sliding glass door. Whiskers was ancient. He had survived two house moves, four new babies, and more toddler tailpulls than any living creature should have to endure. We all joked he'd outlive us. Out of nowhere, my little brother came racing in with his new remote control car, zigzagging through the living room like a maniac, showing off to everyone. The car flew right under Tommy's legs. Just as he started getting up to grab a second plate of pizza, his foot caught on the corner of the carpet. He lost his balance. I watched it all in slow motion. His arms flailed his face, and then came the soft, dull crunch when he landed. Most people didn't even hear it, but I did. Whiskers didn't move. He didn't hiss. He Didn't cry. Just silent. The whole room froze. Tommy stayed on the floor, pale as a ghost, whispering no over and over while his eyes filled with tears. My dad crossed the room and gently picked up whiskers, wrapping him in the fleece blanket from the recliner, the one whiskers always curled up on. My mom quietly ushered the rest of us into the kitchen. From behind the doorway, I could see Tommy sitting there, shoulders heaving as he sobbed. My aunt knelt beside him, rubbing his back and trying to hold it together. But even she looked shattered. That blanket never came back. By the time we left that night, every trace of whiskers was gone. His toys, his bed, the food and water bowls by the fridge. It was like someone hit delete on his whole existence. We never talked about it again. No one.

The only difference is he's the smart one, and I'm the one who once tried to microwave a Pop Tart. Still in the wrapper. We're both seniors, but we take completely different classes. He's in AP everything that makes your brain hurt. I'm in regular human classes for people who think algebra might be a country. Last Tuesday, I'm sitting in my criminal justice class. And yes, the irony will become clear when my teacher, Mister Rodriguez, walk. Then, looking like someone stole his lunch money and his dignity, he slams a stack of papers on his desk and says, we need to talk about academic integrity. I'm thinking, cool, a lecture about not copying homework. Time for a nap. But then he locks eyes with me. Just me. Like I personally betrayed him and his entire family lineage. You, he says, pointing directly at my soul office. Now I look around, confused. Me? What did I do? Don't play dumb, sir. I'm not playing anything. This is just my face. So I follow him to his office, and he pulls out a test paper. But here's the thing. It's not from his class. It's from AP Physics. You Know, the class I've never taken, would never take, and couldn't pass if my life depended on it? He slides it across the desk. Explain this. I stare at the paper. It's got my name on it. Well, technically, it says M. Johnson, but we have the same last name, same first initial. And the handwriting looks exactly like mine. Because it's Marcus's handwriting. Because we're twins. Because genetics is a thing. Mr. Rodriguez, I say slowly, I don't take physics. Leans back in his chair like he just caught me in the lie of the century. Really? Then how do you explain getting a perfect score on yesterday's quantum mechanics exam? I blink. I don't even know what quantum mechanics means. I thought it was a type of car repair. He's not buying it. He pulls out another paper. This one's from AP Calculus. Also signed M. Johnson. Also, my brother's identical.

So I made his life a living hell. We moved into our house three years ago, and everything was perfect until Logan moved in next door six months later. He's maybe 35, works from home doing something with cryptocurrency, and has way too much time to monitor everyone else. No trespassing signs every five feet along his fence. Guy even painted his grass with some kind of spray to make it look more green, which was weird, but whatever. My daughter Zoe plays in our backyard all the time. She's 8, loves soccer, and kicks the ball around for hours. The yards are separated by one of those low, decorative fences, maybe two feet high. And sometimes her ball goes over like any normal kid. She'd hop over, grab it, and hop back. Takes literally ten seconds. Last Tuesday, Zoe was playing when her ball went over Logan's fence. She hopped over to get it, and I watched from the kitchen window as Logan came storming out of his house. He started screaming at her. I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off. Zoe was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to Learn boundaries. This is my property, and I don't want her stepping foot on it ever again. I told him she was just getting her ball and would be more careful, but he wasn't having it. Then yesterday came, so he was playing again when her ball went over. She looked at me through the window, and I nodded. It's a ball, for crying out loud. She hopped over, grabbed it, and started hopping back. That's when Logan appeared with his phone already dialing. I couldn't believe it. I ran outside as Zoe came back, confused and scared because this grown man was on the phone with the police about her. 20 minutes later, a police car pulled up the office

But then I started thinking about it more. I talked to Tyler and his girlfriend, who saw the whole thing. They said it wasn't just, like, a quick reaction. She grabbed that candle holder and kept hitting me. Even after the spider was obviously gone. Even after I was bleeding and unconscious on the deck. The burns healed slowly.

It started with phone cases. My three best friends and I, Maya, Liam and Chloe, decided to start a small online shop. We'd spend weekends in my garage hand painting cool designs and bringing them out. We were a team. We even opened a shared bank account just for the business. The rule was simple. All the money goes in, and we only use it for supplies. For a while, it was perfect. We were actually making a profit. But then weird things started happening. Ten dollars vanished, then twenty. We'd all look at the account confused. We blamed it on bank fees, maybe a miscalculation. But when a fifty dollar transaction appeared that no one could explain, the mood shifted. We had a meeting in the garage, but it felt more like an interrogation. Liam got super defensive, which made him look guilty. Maya was so quiet, she seemed like she was hiding something. And Chloe just kept trying to nervously make peace. The trust was gone. Every sale notification, instead of being exciting, just made my stomach tighten. We weren't a team anymore. We were just four people sitting in a room full of paint fumes, wondering who the thief was. I couldn't sleep, so I ended up telling my mom everything. She's an accountant and her brain just works differently. She saw how torn up I was and said, Let's stop guessing and start looking. She didn't want to hear about who looked guilty or who acted weird. She just wanted the facts. She had me pull up all the bank statements on her big monitor. Then she had me open our online store's admin page. She exported every single sale. Every

I just nodded. The next morning, fueled by coffee and hollow grief, I started packing everything she owned. It was brutal. Every object was a memory. Her ugly ceramic mug from our first trip. Yoga mats, expensive skincare that took up the entire bathroom counter. But what I didn't know yet was that Lauren's journey of self discovery had a name. Zachary. A lifestyle entrepreneur she'd met at a networking event two months earlier. While I was packing her belongings, she was already moving into his studio apartment across town, convinced she'd found her soulmate. The manipulation started immediately. She called our wedding venue, claiming my cancellation was sent in error and demanding the 2,500 dollar deposit be held in her name. The venue coordinator called me confused. Both names were on the contract, so they'd frozen the funds until we reached joint agreement. Then came her masterpiece.

When I pulled Bianca aside, she said, for the honeymoon, obviously. You already bought honeymoon outfits last month. Those were for the pre honeymoon trip with my girl. We never discussed that. We're stretched with wedding costs. God, why are you being so cheap? It's just money. The sales lady announced the total $8,600. Absolutely not! I said, that's insane. Bianca's face went red, then purple. She grabbed her phone and screamed, I'm calling the police! You hit me! Help! He's attacking me! The store or went silent. Every customer turned to stare. My brother's a paralegal and drilled into me, always document everything. While Bianca made her scene, I calmly pulled out my phone, started recording and held it openly. Please do call them, I said.

One day, my daughter came up to me and told me she didn't want to stay at daddy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when she outright refused to visit him for her scheduled week. I sat down beside her and asked her what was going on. Did daddy do something to upset you? Then she told me how daddy's new girlfriend would make her do strange things and also made her promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart dropped into my stomach. She would make my daughter sit in front of a laptop camera and answer personal questions about her body. Then she would record everything and tell her it was just a game. At first, my daughter thought it was normal, but she eventually realized that something felt wrong and became scared. So she asked her to stop. And my ex's girlfriend grabbed my daughter by the shoulders and shook her hard. She went to her daddy to complain and told him everything while sobbing. But instead of protecting her, he told her to stop making up stories. He was under the impression that I had coached our daughter to say this and simply refused to listen to her. I was so furious, but also heartbroken at the same time. The first thing I did was call the police, but the officer Who showed up was my ex's golf buddy, who basically laughed in my face. He told me the same thing that my ex said to our daughter. Stop making up drama just because you can't handle your ex moving on. I don't know what kind of father my ex husband was being that he didn't even consider the possibility of his girlfriend actually doing this. But I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. I sent my daughter to my sister's house before taking action. I was a regular at this gym where I had made friends with these two guys who had done some questionable things in their past. Both of them agreed to help me with my plan. We waited for my ex to leave for his business trip and broke into his house to find the girlfriend. I knew she worked from home, so she was probably in her office all day. She looked absolutely terrified when she saw me entering the house and tried to run, but we cornered her. You see, I was under the impression that she was just some creep getting her

In my 15 years working at maximum security, I met thousands of inmates, but none like Omar. He was serving 25 years for shooting someone during a robbery gone wrong. The thing is, he wasn't the shooter. His brother was. Omar took the fall because his brother had three young kids. The first time I saw Omar, he was teaching another inmate how to read in the library. Not unusual, except this was at 3 a m. See, Omar had worked out a deal with the night guards. He'd help clean the cafeteria after hours in exchange for using the library to tutor guys who were too embarrassed to be seen learning during the day. I remember asking him why he bothered. Looked at me and said, everyone deserves a chance to write letters home to their mama. Simple as that. What really got me was how he handled the gang stuff. We had major problems with rival groups, but Omar somehow stayed neutral. One day, two gangs were about to go at it in the yard. Omar walked right between them, pulled out a chessboard and challenged both leaders to a game. Said whoever won would get his dessert portions for a month. These tough guys, covered in tattoos, actually sat down and played. By the time they finished, they'd forgotten what they were fighting about. Omar lost his pudding cups.

One. That as their father, I could change their names whenever I wanted to. One time I pretended to get on the phone with the Arizona Name Registry, renamed my two kids snorkel and gorf because they kept misbehaving. They were bawling. I could barely keep a straight face. Two. I was on a flight where a kid saw the button for calling. A flight attendant didn't know what it was, but clearly was thinking about pressing it, and so asked his dad what it did. His dad said it opens a trap door under your seat and drops you out of the bottom of the plane. Afterwards, the kids spent the whole flight intrigued by the button, thinking about and talking about pushing it, but too worried to actually do it. 3. Not exactly a lie, but when I was first learning swear words, my parents made the mistake of telling me those were words only mommies and daddies are allowed to say. So I was playing house with my sister and her friends, and I was the dad. I promptly went on a swearing tirade as the dad and got in big trouble. Four. When we were in the car and it was raining, my mom would wait for a bridge or tunnel, and as we approached it, she would tell us she was going to make the rain stop in 3:21. She told us she could only make the Rain stop for a minute because it made her so tired. My siblings and I were convinced she was magic.

It was always Jordan or him when she talked to her mom about me. But there she was, reaching her good arm toward me, like I was the only person in the world who could fix this. I dropped everything.

I got banned from all school events for switching out all the interview questions at a beauty pageant. Thirty minutes before showtime, my best friend Carmen looked at me through the curtains, her face full of panic. I grinned at her and put two thumbs up, whispering, okay, let the show begin. The lights dimmed and the host on stage shouted, and now for the question and answer portion of the show. Let's bring out our top five contestants. Finally, my best friend Carmen didn't think she'd make it this far, but I knew she was kind and beautiful and deserved it way more than the bratty. Harper greeted us with a typical mean girl line every morning at school. Hi, losers! I held my breath as they called Carmen to the front, along with Harbor and three other girls who looked just as nervous. Harbor looked confident, but she wouldn't be soon, not with what I did behind the scenes. The host called Harbor first. Judge fished a question from the bowl while she stood there in her designer dress and perfect posture. Who is your role model and why? She started strong? The three pillars of leadership that have guided my journey are. Then she froze. Her eyes went wide. That wasn't the question she was looking for. She tried to recover, but by then the timer had run out. The host tried to push her to the Side to call up another girl, but stood there malfunctioning like a robot. These aren't the right questions, she finally snapped at the judges. The audience gasped at her outburst. I laughed on the side, thinking she deserved it after all the terrible things she did to other people at school. Harper's mom stormed onto the stage and demanded they stop everything. Someone switched the approved questions. This is sabotage! She screamed. The principal hurried onto the stage and fumbled with the microphone. We'll be having a 10 minute break before continuing the Q&A. Please help yourself with some refreshments. The crowd grew loud, already making theories as to what happened. After a few minutes, the principal called me over. Oh no! I took in a deep breath and followed the towards the security room. They sat me in front of the screen and pointed. Mind telling us what you were doing at 2 p m? The footage showed me switching out the pieces of paper from the bowl very clearly. I'll tell you what she was doing.

We'd stay up watching movies and she'd sneak me candy when mom said no more sugar. But she turned into a huge jerk when she came back home from her first semester of college. She start acting like a house was her personal hotel and everyone else was just in her way. First it was the TV. She changed all the streaming passwords so only she could log in. Even told our twelve year old brother to grow up when he wanted to watch cartoons on Saturday morning while she binged Love Island all day. Now, apparently, my bathroom was her territory, too. I tried to be considerate, I really did. I'd set my alarm 10 minutes earlier so I could be done before she woke up. I kept my shampoo and stuff in a basket so everything was clean and organized and she wanted to use it. And still she complained. Gwen told our parents I was hogging the bathroom every morning, even though I showered an hour before she woke up. She complained that the steam from my hot showers made the bathroom more moldy and toxic and gave her asthma. But it was summer, so I only took cold showers. Mom scolded me, telling Me to be more considerate of my sister. But that only made her lies older. She started setting her alarm for 6:00am just to me in the bathroom. Then she'd tell our parents I woke her up. So mom scolded me again, texting, be quieter next time your sister needs sleep. The lie that really got me into trouble was when Gwen claimed she lost her dream job at a marketing firm because I hogged the bathroom that morning. I finished my shower when I heard her phone blaring job interview today over and over. But Gwen was dead to sleep. Now, I could have let her miss it, you know, especially after everything she done. But I still tried to wake her up. I shook her shoulders, turned on the lights, even pulled off her blankets. Nothing worked. When she finally did wake up, she had 20 minutes to get to her interview. She came home sobbing, mascara running down her face, saying the interviewer specifically mentioned she looked disheveled. She blamed my morning showers for ruining her career.

I was 10 when my Uncle Mike started taking me to the arcade every Saturday. Just us two. No parents, no cousins. Our secret guy time, he'd say with a wink. Mom would hand me some cash and off we'd go in his rusty blue pickup truck. I felt so special, like I'd been chosen for something important. All my friends were jealous when I'd come back with stories about beating the high score on Pac Man or mastering Street Fighter. Go! Mike would cheer me on and buy me ice cream after, no matter how badly I played. You're getting better every time, champ, he'd always say. For three years straight, not a single Saturday was missed. Rain, snow. Even when I had a cold. Uncle Mike would show up at 10:00am sharp. I'd run to the door before he could even knock. When other kids complained about their boring uncles, I'd brag about mine. My Uncle Mike is different, I tell them. He actually likes spending time with me. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. Then one Saturday when I was 13, Uncle Mike didn't show up. My mom found me sitting on the porch steps, jacket on, waiting. She looked strange. Sad, almost. Uncle Mike can't come anymore, she said quietly. I cried the whole afternoon, feeling abandoned. I didn't see him for years after that. Nobody talked about him. And when I asked, They changed the subject. I figured he just stopped caring about me. Last week, I was helping mom clean out the attic when I found a shoebox filled with old photos. It was a picture of me and Uncle Mike outside the arcade, both of us smiling with ice cream cones. Remember that? Mom asked, peering over my shoulder. Yeah, I said. I miss those days. Why did he stop coming? Mom sat down beside me, holding the photo. Your father found out Mike was using the arcade trips to meet his drug dealer. She said.

A beautiful two story home with a pool, big T V. And a fully stocked fridge. The perfect spot for a mini vacation. On the second night, we were playing cards in the living room when the power suddenly went out. We checked the breaker box, but nothing was wrong. Then my friend Jake looked outside and noticed all the street lights were still on. Something wasn't right. We grabbed our phones as flashlights and checked around. That's when we heard it scratching at the back sliding door. Through the glass, we could see a man in a black hoodie trying to force the lock open. My heart dropped. I wanted to call the police, but my phone had no signal. The storm from earlier must have knocked out the cell towers. We were on our own. My friend Sophie, who's normally the quiet one, suddenly whispered, I have an idea. She pointed to the stairs leading to the basement. We need to lure him down there. The basement had a heavy metal door that locked from the outside. If we could get him down there, we could trap him until morning when the police could come. We positioned ourselves in the darkness. One by the basement door, two behind the couch, and me near The kitchen. Then we deliberately made noise upstairs. Like we were all sleeping up there. And left the basement door open. With a flashlight shining on my uncle's expensive watch collection. Within minutes, the back door slid open. The man crept through the kitchen, crowbar in hand. He spot out of the open basement door in the gleaming watches. Just as we hoped, he headed straight for them. The moment he was halfway down the stairs, Sophie slammed the door shut. And we all piled furniture against it. We could hear him banging and shouting from below. That's when things got weird. My friend Tyler grabbed my uncle's old Halloween decorations from the closet.

Helen had CPS on speed dial and used it like other people used Yelp reviews. The Bradshaw kids jumped on their trampoline without her approved safety protocols, so she called. The new mom let her four year old dress herself, resulting in mismatched clothes, so she called. My daughter ate her lunch on the front steps instead of inside, so she called. Every deviation from Helen's parenting standards meant another report. The Bradshaw family never recovered from Helen's first attack. Three kids jumped on their trampoline while dad grilled burgers nearby. Helen watched through her window and documented supposed safety violations. She reported it as child endangerment. The investigation consumed two weeks of their lives. Mister Bradshaw lost his promotion after missing work for C P S. Meetings. Helen targeted the war widow next. Her four year old coped through choosing her own outfits. She wore Dinosaur shirts with tutus and rainbow socks. All things her father bought her. Helen photographed these outfits as evidence of neglect. The mother had buried her husband three months earlier. The CPS visit shattered her remaining strength. She now picked every piece of clothing her daughter wore. Though it wasn't the same as her daughter deciding daddy was going to dress her that day. My turn came in June. My nine year old took her sandwich outside to eat while reading. I monitored her from my home. Office window perfectly. Helen filmed it all and called CPS immediately. She reported unsupervised outdoor eating and potential choking hazards. The worker arrived during my biggest client presentation. The contract that would have covered our mortgage. I lost focus and nearly lost the 800 thousand dollar contract. But worse, my daughter internalized the fear and refused to eat anywhere but inside. Everything shattered when my six year old's action figure broke one afternoon. He was exhausted from swimming and inconsolable about his toy. I comforted him in our driveway using calm parenting techniques. Helen filmed it all through her window. She recorded my child's vulnerable moment for her files. The CPS worker who came wasn't there to check boxes. This was a serious investigation due to multiple reports. She discussed temporary foster placement while my children listened. They clung to me, crying about being taken away. My ex husband's call that night was the final straw. He'd use the CPS reports for full custody from Phoenix. I sat on my

I started a new office job and they had a super strict dress code. I have a pretty big scar on my scalp from a surgery when I was a kid, and I've always been self conscious about it. So I wore a simple, plain black beanie to cover over. It was discreet, no logos, and looked professional. For the first two weeks, nobody said a thing. Then my manager, Brenda, decided to update the dress code. She sent out a company wide email saying all headwear must be formal and business appropriate. The next day, she called me into her office. He pointed at my beanie and said it was no longer acceptable. I explained calmly, it's just to cover a scar. I'm happy to buy a different one if this color is the problem. She just shook her head. Beanies are not formal. The rule is the rule. You could wear a wig if you're that concerned. I was stunned. A wig? I couldn't afford that. And it felt so humiliating. I went home that night and read her email over and over. Formal and business appropriate. That vague wording was her mistake. The next morning, I walked in wearing a fascinator. A big bright pink one with feathers and a little net that came down over my eye. It was something you'd see at a fancy horse race. Brenda's jaw hit the floor. What is that on your head? I Smiled it's a fascinator. It's formal headwear. Is it not business appropriate? She was completely speechless. It technically followed her new rule. She couldn't say anything. The next day, I wore a sleek black pill box hat, very 1960s. The day after that, a small, classy top hat. My co workers thought it was hilarious. They started placing bets on what I'd wear next. My a little corner of the office became the most popular spot for people to walk by. Brenda got angrier every day, but I was following her rule perfectly. The breaking point came when the regional director was visiting our branch. That day, I had chosen a particularly bold peacock feather.

When they denied my wife's chemo saying it was experimental while approving the exact same treatment for others. My wife got diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in February and the cancer doctor gave us the treatment plan that same day. Standard FDA approved treatment that everyone gets with nothing experimental about it. We sent everything to insurance feeling good, but the denial came back in two days claiming the treatment was investigational. Called right away and could hear the woman typing while I talked, not even listening. She kept saying their medical team decided it was experimental, my wife's doctor literally wrote that this was standard care. When I asked if anyone even looked at the medical records, she just repeated that their review team makes determinations based on coverage guidelines. I filed an appeal and attached 15 medical studies showing this was standard treatment, but the second denial popped up in my email 20 minutes after I hit submit. My wife saw the timestamp and started crying. They don't care if I die, do they? I couldn't answer because we both knew the truth. That night I found an online support group where three people with our exact diagnosis got in approvals, and one woman messaged me saying her treatment got approved in two days with the same medicine at the same dose, but different insurance. That's when everything clicked. I spent the weekend digging Through state insurance law, and discovered they had to respond to every appeal within 72 hours, and pay $600 for each external medical review we requested. So Monday morning, I put their system to the test. I called to file an appeal for the denial of Abraxas, and heard the representative side before he even spoke. He kept insisting I'd already filed appeals for that medication, but I explained this was for the 500 milligram dose specifically, since the others were for treatment in general. Pulled up their denial letter and read it back to him, explaining how they evaluate each aspect separately. So I'm also filing appeals for the 100 mg dose, and for weekly versus biweekly scheduling. When he said that would be three separate appeals, I told him it was actually more, because I needed to appeal each of the 12 infusions separately, plus each anti nausea medication.

My girlfriend Bianca was obsessed with skincare. Her bathroom looked like a Sephora. Hundreds of products lined up on custom shelves. She'd installed glass bottles. Korean serums, French moisturizers. She'd spend two hours every night on her elaborate routine, explaining each step like a beauty guru. I thought it was cute how dedicated she was to self care. Bianca had porcelain skin that literally glowed. She worked as a makeup artist for a local theater company, so I figured her flawless complexion was just professional knowledge paying off. Until I started breaking out. At first, it was just a few pimples on my forehead. No big deal. I'm 28, but sometimes adult acne happens, right? But then it spread. Weird, painful cysts rupt it all over my face and neck. Deep, angry bumps that hurt to touch. I'd never had acne like this in my entire life, not even as a teenager. Bianca was incredibly sweet about it. She'd examine my face with genuine concern, tracing the inflamed areas with her fingertips. Poor baby. This must be so frustrating for you. She researched online for hours, constantly offering solutions. I think it might be stress related, or maybe you're allergic to something new. She bought me special face wash, expensive serums, even booked me an appointment with her dermatologist. The doctor was completely baffled. My hormone levels were normal. No underlying health condition. Sometimes these things just happen. She said. With a shrug, let's try some topical treatments. Nothing worked. If anything, my skin kept getting worse. I looked like a pepperoni pizza. Deep red welts covered my cheeks and jawline. My confidence was completely destroyed. I stopped hanging out with friends, barely wanted to leave the apartment. Even wearing a mask felt pointless because people could still see the inflammation around my eyes. Bianca was my rock through everything. She never made me feel ugly or self conscious. You're still handsome to me, she'd whisper, kissing my forehead gently. We'll figure this out together, I promise. She suggested I start using some of her product.

So I exposed the truth about him. I found out yesterday when his iPad auto synced to the family computer. There it was in his Venmo history. Monthly payments to RM labeled lunch money every first of the month. Like clockwork, the amount matched exactly what my brother once drunkenly admitted. His apartment costs $4,000 per month. My stomach dropped. When ARAM moved to New York after college, my parents threw him a goodbye party. So proud of you for making it on your own, my dad had said. Raising his beer, that's what real men do. He'd looked directly at me when he said it. I was living in their basement, then rebuilding my career. After my online business collapsed. Dad had made it a big deal charging me 700 dollar rent. You're so ungrateful. I'm doing you a favor, he'd announced at dinner. You need to learn responsibility and be like your brother. So I paid every month while freelancing during the day and building my new business on weekends. Five hours if I was lucky. Meanwhile, Aaron was posting Instagram Stories from rooftop bars and weekend trips to the Hamptons. Your brother's just better with money, mom would say when I'd question his lifestyle. He got that finance job while you're doing nothing but being on your computer. And that finance job? Entry level at A no name firm. His apartment alone would devour most of his salary. But I believed the lie because the alternative, that my parents were lying to my face, was unbearable. The Venmo history went back three years. Some payments had notes that made me sick. Lunch money plus vacation, lunch money plus new wardrobe. All while I was buying groceries at the dollar store. I kept scrolling, my hands trembling. Now I found a synced email to their accountant that stopped me cold. Can we claim both kids as dependents? RM for support and daughter for disability? Disability? They told their accountant I was disabled. Not struggling, not rebuilding disabled. While I was working 60 hour weeks in their basement, they were writing

She doesn't know I won the lottery. Three days after the divorce finalized, the morning my wife Rebecca moved out. She actually laughed when I offered to help carry boxes to Daniel's Tesla. Even your breakups are boring. That's why I'm leaving you. In truth, I've been trying to save our marriage for months by that point, spending $800 on counseling sessions she never attended, but. And relationship books she never knew existed. Even signing us up for salsa lessons that would never happen. When she announced she'd been sleeping with Daniel for six months, I just nodded and said I'd sign whatever paper she wanted. She looked genuinely annoyed by how quietly I was accepting everything, probably expecting me to throw something or make some desperate speech about our seven years together. Instead, I folded her clothes into boxes with the same precision I used for my spreadsheets at the accounting firm. She kept rolling her eyes like my compliance was just another predictable trait, even calling Daniel while I was standing there to complain about how I was being passive about the whole thing. Divorce was finalized in three months, the fastest in our state's history. She took the house, got 15 monthly alimony, even my mother's dining set. The lawyer looked sympathetic, but stayed professional. Then, three days after signing papers, I did something completely random. I bought 5 powerball tickets at a gas Station I'd never visited before. Rebecca always said lottery tickets were attacks on stupid people. I was an accountant who should know better. She'd literally mocked my cousin for buying them at family gatherings. But that Wednesday morning, standing in an unfamiliar shell station, I spent ten dollars on tickets with my morning coffee. The second ticket hit all six numbers when they drew. That night, I won $92 million on a two dollar piece of paper. After taking the lump sum and paying taxes, I walked away with 58 million in my account. I told absolutely nobody about my windfall, not even my mother. The next Monday, I walked into my accounting firm and quit on the spot. Told them I needed to find myself or whatever people say. My boss assumed I was having a breakdown from the divorce. Within two weeks, I was on a first class flight to Monaco, sipping champagne that cost more than my old hour.

I wiped away my tears as the door chimed, but then I felt my whole body freeze up when I realized who had just walked inside. My ex boyfriend, Kai walked in with some blonde girl hanging off his arm like a trophy. My hands started shaking as I gripped my clippers because this was the same guy who'd spent eight months ridiculing my red hair. He'd call me Wendy's mascot or fire crotch pretty much every chance he'd get to his boys behind my back. He didn't stop at anything. Every time he'd use the same pathetic excuse, even for a man who'd made an entire group chat dedicated to roasting gingers. The worst part of it all was when I overheard his new girlfriend talking about dying her hair red of all colours. I watched Kai's face scrunch up and disgust as he heard it, before he said the words that made my blood truly boil. Are you insane? Red hair is literally the worst feature a girl can have. Trust me, I know. He said it loud enough for the whole shop to hear, and then he actually kept going. I dated this redhead chick for way too long, and it Was so embarrassing. Like walking around with a human hot Cheeto. Plus, they're all psycho, every single one of them. All this happened while I was standing 10 feet away, and he had no idea. The girl at the next station literally stopped cutting halfway through to stare at him. Also in pure disbelief. Everyone in there picked up their phones, not making it obvious. As we started texting, the shop group chat exploded with messages like, is he serious right now? And bro is about to get karma. While all the girls started telepathically coming up with our plan. We immediately put down her clippers and walked over to his girlfriend. Girl, I'm sorry, but I overheard your idea, and I have to show you something. She pulled out her iPad.

She told me there was a family emergency, and my mom asked her to pick me up. Something felt wrong immediately. Her smile was too wide, her eyes too focused on my backpack, not my face. I'd never seen this woman before. No uniform, no ID badge, nothing that proved she knew my mom. But she knew my name. And that my mom worked at Memorial Hospital. My heart started racing, but I tried to stay calm. Oh, that's weird. My mom just texted me five minutes ago and didn't mention anything. I lied, patting my pocket where my phone was.

I approached her cautiously, remembering how the charge nurse warned the girl refused all male staff. We all knew what that meant, and she looked as broken as I imagined. I pulled up a chair next to her bed instead of standing over her, and gently asked if she wanted some water first. She nodded. Sweetie, you're safe here, I said, keeping my voice soft like I do with my anxious patients. Male staff won't come near you, I promise. It's just us girls here. She looked at me for the first time and whispered, he's here. I asked who, and at first she refused to even say his name. I handed her my pen and clipboard. After a second, her hand moved. Percy. My blood boiled at the name. He was my everything, she finally whispered and started showing me photos on her phone of them together at college, confirming that it was the same Percy who was now a resident at the hospital. I did everything for him. Everything. Her voice cracked as she swiped to screenshots of assignments, time stamps showing her submitting his biochemistry homework at 3:00am, his pathology essays at 4:00am, his anatomy exams that she taken for him. She showed me his Instagram from those same nights doing beer pongs and Body shots with other girls while she was writing his thesis on cellular biology. The day after graduation, after I'd spent three years making sure he got into residency, he sent me this, she said, and handed me her phone. The text made me want to throw something. Babe, you're too clingy, and it's honestly suffocating. Need to focus on my career without distractions. And honestly, doctors are supposed to date doctors, and you're not one. We're done. Please don't contact me again. I waited until she was stable and sleeping before I stormed into the break room where three other nurses were charting. You guys are never going to believe what I just found out about Percy. I said. I told them everything and watched their faces go from confused to furious. And within 10 minutes, we had half the female staff crammed into that tiny break room. I knew something was off when he asked me to explain what antibiotics were.

The first incident happened two months into deployment. During our scheduled video call, Jared walked past shirtless. In the background, coming from our bedroom, Rosie was crying, saying Jared found dating profiles on my old laptop with messages to other women. Jared leaned into frame and said, she deserves better than a cheater, bro. At least I'm here for her. Before I could explain, the connection cut. Rosie didn't answer my calls for three days. When she finally did, Jared was rubbing her shoulders while she told me she needed space to think. The second incident destroyed everything. My mother called the base four months into deployment. She'd seen Jared and Rosie kissing at what should have been my son's first birthday party. Jared had told the entire family I had deployment girlfriends and showed them fake screenshots. Mom said Rosie changed her relationship status, and Jared was commenting hearts on every photo. My own brother had moved into my life while I was defending our country. Rosie filed divorce papers that week, listing Jared as her emotional support. Letters came back with moved on, written in Jared's handwriting.

Even your son calls me daddy. Trying for a baby of our own. You should thank me for taking care of her. My pregnant wife stood there in lingerie I bought her, telling me Jared showed her who I really was. You're my brother! I roared, my voice breaking. I was fighting for our country, for you.

I run a boutique skincare business from my home studio, creating custom serums for clients with sensitive skin conditions. Each formula is specifically tailored. Some need snail solution filtrate from Korea, others require bakuchiol oil from India, and the really complex cases get peptide complexes that literally cost more per ounce than actual gold. A thing. Full custom batch runs me about $200 in raw ingredients, but I charge $400 because the results are incredible. My sister in law, Kayla, moved in with us three weeks before her wedding. She's always been jealous of literally everything I have my house, my business, even my husband's attention. She kept complaining about stress breakouts appearing on her face, dramatically sighing in front of mirrors, and asking if I had anything professional grade that could help her look perfect for the big day. I offered her some basic drugstore products, gentle cleansers, hydrating serums. Nothing too intense, but she kept hovering around my workstation asking detailed questions about my expensive ingredients. She'd pick up bottles, read labels, ask about prices. I caught her photographing my formula notebooks multiple times. The week before the wedding, I started working on a rush order for my most important client, a local news anchor who pays premium for custom anti aging serums. This particular formula required $300 worth of rare peptides, growth factors, and botanical Extracts. I spent two days perfecting the mixture, testing P H. Levels, ensuring stability. The morning of Kayla's wedding, I woke up early to package the completed serum for Monday pickup. Walked into my lab, set up, and immediately felt something was wrong. My bakuchiol dropper was sitting in the wrong spot. The snail mucin jar had clear fingerprints on the glass. My peptide vials were slightly out of order. I did a complete ingredient inventory.

A truck hit my side of the car when a driver ran a red light. The impact shattered my ribs, collapsed my lung, and left me with internal bleeding so bad, the doctors put me in a medically induced coma. I wasn't supposed to be conscious, but somehow I was. It's called covert awareness. When your brain is active, but your body can't respond. I could hear everything around me. The beeping of machines, doctors talking about my poor chances, and my mom crying by my bedside each night. That evening, a new nurse came in for the night shift. She seemed annoyed from the moment she walked in, sighing loudly and checking her phone every few minutes. I heard her talking to someone, complaining that her phone battery was dying and she needed it for her side hustle calls later. I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't even open my eyes to show I was listening. I was trapped inside myself, completely helpless. Around midnight, when the hospital floor got quiet, I heard her footsteps coming closer to my bed. She mumbled something about needing an outlet and how it's not like he'll notice anyway. Then I heard the unmistakable sound of a plug being pulled in. Instantly, the Steady hum of the machine keeping me alive went silent and the alarm started blaring. My heart raced as panic set in. I was screaming inside my head, but my body remained perfectly still. I could feel myself slipping away as the oxygen levels in my blood dropped, but the nurse didn't rush to plug it back in. Instead, she calmly silenced the alarm, plugged in her phone, and said, relax. These machines have backup batteries. You've got, like 30 minutes before you're actually in trouble. She laughed and

I live with one. Or I should say I lived with one. It was my husband's view of our two kids. We have a daughter, Amy, who's 16, and a son, Leo, who is 17. The rules for them were so different. It was like they grew up in separate houses. Amy had a long list of chores. Had to cook dinner twice a week, do her own laundry, and keep her room spotless. She had a ten PM curfew, even on weekends. And we expected her to get good grades, which she did. She was a straight A student. Leo, on the other hand, his only chore was to take out the trash, and he usually forgot. He didn't have a curfew. His grades were just okay. But my husband would celebrate a C plus like he'd won a Nobel Prize. Whenever I brought it up, my husband would just say, he's a boy. He's figuring things out. We need to teach Amy to be responsible. The whole thing exploded one Tuesday night. Amy came home at 10:15, 15 minutes late. She was at her friend's house, helping her study for a big test. My husband grounded her for two weeks. No phone, no going out. Amy was so upset, she just went to her room and cried. Later that same night, around two in the morning, I heard the front door open. It was Leo. He'd been at a party. I went downstairs, and my husband was already there. He just looked at Leo, smiled, and said, have a good time, son. Go get some sleep. Not a single word about how late it was. I just stared at him. I looked at our son, who was walking to his room without a care in the world. Then I went to check on Amy. She was sitting on her bed, her homework perfectly laid out on her desk. She looked at me with these tired, sad eyes and said, it doesn't matter how hard I try, does it? That was it for me. The next Saturday morning I called a family meeting in the living room. I had set up a giant whiteboard. On it I had written

If I joined a yoga studio, she'd join the same one with the premium membership. If I bought a purse at target, she'd get the designer version and tag me in the photos. It started small, almost flattering, even. Like when she bought my wedding dress in white after seeing mine in ivory. Regina told everyone she'd had her eye on it first, didn't care since I was already married. But by the time we both got pregnant, it got disturbing. I announced it at Easter dinner, but Regina announced it at my baby shower, claiming she'd been waiting for the right moment. I chose a specific Dula after months of research. Regina hired her the next day, offering double the rate, and got my slot. When I switched to a different birthing class, Regina switched to sitting right behind me each week. My mother in law pulled me aside after Sunday lunch. You need to stop making everything a competition. Regina just wants to feel included. She's always looked up to you. This jealousy you're showing is ruining family dinners. It was Frustrating how everyone only thought about her problems. But whatever. I was focusing on my own life. Seven months into my pregnancy, I finally shared the name we'd chosen at a family dinner. Lillian, after my grandmother who'd raised me. It was the one thing I'd kept private, special, sacred, even. Two weeks later, Regina gave birth early and named her daughter Liliana. But she didn't just steal the name. She told everyone at the hospital that she'd always loved that name and had it picked since high school, making me look like the copycat. But the worst part came when I confronted my husband about it. He defended her completely, saying I was being hormonal and over sensitive about similar sounding names that aren't even identical. I sobbed for hours and kept saying, that was my grandmother's name, our daughter's legacy. She stole it.

Then things started disappearing. First it was just a few tomatoes. Then entire plants were getting damaged. Mom kept saying maybe it was animals, but our yard had a tall fence.

It's not a suggestion, it's a medical necessity to prevent a seizure or coma. We had a doctor's note and a detailed plan we gave to all his teachers. But this year he got missus Davison. She was famous in the district for her strict, healthy classroom policy. She send notes home scolding parents for packing things like goldfish crackers, calling them processed poison.

She looked at the juice boxes and fruit snacks with disgust. I'm sorry, but we have a no sugar policy in this classroom, she said. A medical condition is not an excuse to break the rules. An apple will work just fine. I tried to explain that an apple sugar acts too slowly during a critical low. She cut me off. I've been a teacher for 20 years. I know what's best for children. The next day, she confiscated his emergency kit. Two weeks later, I got the call I've been dreading. Leo had a severe low sugar episode during math class. Missus Davidson gave him a few apple slices. His numbers kept dropping. He was pale and shaking. By the time the school nurse arrived with his emergency kit, he was barely conscious.

I thanked him and went to check my dresser. That's when I noticed something was off. My sock drawer looked weird. All my socks were there, but they looked different. Faded, shrunken. Some of them had these weird fuzzy bits all over them. I grabbed a pair of my favourite black ankle socks, the ones I bought from target for 12 bucks that fit perfectly and never slipped down in my shoes. They were now the size of toddler socks and felt like sandpaper. Jake! I called out, holding up the tiny sock, what did you do? He walked over, looking confused. I washed them with hot water to make sure they got really clean. Hot water on cotton socks? I felt my eye twitch. These are ruined, I said, showing him the drawer. All of them? They're either too small or they feel like steel wool. He shrugged. They still work as socks. That's when I lost it. These Weren't just any socks. I'm super picky about socks. I hate when they bunch up, slide down, or feel rough. I'd spent months finding the perfect ones that didn't make me wanna rip my shoes off by noon. No, they don't work as socks. I said. Look at this. I tried putting on a pair of my favorite gray ones. They barely covered my heels and squeeze my toes like a tourniquet. Jake rolled his eyes. You're being dramatic. They're just socks. Just socks. Just socks. I took a deep breath and explained very calmly that he destroyed about $60 worth of socks that I'd

Turns out my mom's been lying about something huge for 18 years. Last month, my dad got one of those Ancestry DNA kits as a Joe birthday gift from my aunt. She thought it would be fun for him to trace our family tree, maybe find some distant cousins or something. Cool. When his results came back, he called me into his office looking like he'd seen a ghost. According to this, you can't be my biological son. My world stopped. He'd always been my hero. The guy who taught me to throw a football in the backyard every weekend, helped with calculus homework every night at the kitchen table. Promised since I was little he'd pay for any college I wanted. I'd already committed to an expensive out of state engineering program at Georgia Tech because as of that promise, we'd even toured the campus together last spring and bought me a hoodie. Mom completely broke down when he confronted her. Through tears and hyperventilating, she admitted she'd had an affair with his best friend Jason, right around the time I was conceived. She genuinely didn't know who my father was, and I've been living with that secret my entire life. She said she thought about getting a paternity test when I was born, but chickened out every time. The worst part? Jason had died in a car accident when I was 5. I actually remember Him, clearly. He was like a second dad to me. Always at our barbecues, flipping burgers. Helped coach my Little League team. Taught me how to change a tire. When I turned 16. He used to joke that I was more like his kid than his own son. I have no way to get answers from him now. Dad looked me dead in the eye, his voice shaking with anger and hurt, and said, I need proof you're mine, or I can't justify spending $200,000 on someone else's kid. It's nothing personal, but that's my entire retirement fund. My mom begged him to reconsider getting on her knees in our living room. You raised him. DNA doesn't

My little sister Nora always got the lead in every school day, ever since she was 8. She'd belt out songs from Hamilton in our living room while I sat there clapping. I told myself I was proud of her, but deep down, I was seething with jealousy. When auditions for our high school spring musical came around, we both tried out for the same part. Maria and West Side Story. She was a sophomore with natural talent. I was a senior who'd taken voice lessons for three years. And this was literally my last shot at high school theater. At the first audition, Nora sang somewhere and got a standing ovation from the other kids waiting. I went after her and could barely hit the high notes. Director smiled lightly and said, thank you. Two days later, the callback list went up. Both our names were there, but I knew Nora had already won. That night at dinner, she was practically bouncing in her chair. I can't believe we both made callbacks. This is so cool! We could be in the show together! Mom beamed my two theater stars. I smiled and nodded, but inside, I was planning something terrible. The night before callbacks, I snuck into Nora's room while she was showering. I knew she had a severe shellfish allergy. We'd been to the ER twice because I found her favorite strawberry lip balm, The one she always used before singing. I crushed up some of the shrimp crackers from our pantry and mixed the powder into the lip balm. Not enough to kill her or anything, just enough to make her lips swell up so she couldn't hit the notes. I felt sick doing it, but I convinced myself it was just leveling the playing field. The next morning, Nora woke up looking like she and stung by a dozen bees. Her lips were so swollen she could barely talk. Mom, she tried to say, but it came out garbled. Mom freaked out and rushed her to urgent care, while I got ready for school, texting my friends about how worried I was about my poor sister. At callbacks, I was the only Maria left. I nailed every song, hit every note perfectly. The director pulled me aside after and said, you were

My twin brother Felix got engaged six months ago to his girlfriend Julia of three years. We've always been incredibly close. Not identical twins, but people constantly mix us up. We did everything together growing up, went to different colleges, but talked daily, and I was genuinely excited when he found someone who made him happy. When he told me about the engagement over dinner at our favorite restaurant, I congratulated him and jokingly asked when I should start planning his bachelor party as his obvious choice for best man. He just laughed it off and said we'll see how things go. A month later, I brought up wedding party plans more seriously during one of our weekly coffee meet UPS. He seemed uncomfortable and said they were keeping it really small and would let me know once they figured everything out. I didn't push it because I know wedding planning can be incredible, incredibly stressful, and overwhelming. Three weeks ago, I was scrolling Instagram during my lunch break and saw photos from what clearly looked like his bachelor party, Felix and about eight guys I didn't recognize at some trendy brewery downtown. I wasn't in any photos and definitely hadn't been invited. When I called him that evening to ask about it, he seemed flustered and said it was just a few guys from work and super last minute planning. He promised we'd hang out soon to celebrate. Properly, that soon never happened. Yesterday, I was mindlessly scrolling social media during my afternoon break when I saw professional wedding photos. Beautiful shots of Felix in a sharp black tux and Julia in an elegant white dress, surrounded by smiling family members and friends. The wedding had happened last weekend, three days ago. I had absolutely no idea. I wasn't just excluded from the wedding party, I wasn't even invited to the actual wedding.

He leaves dirty dishes everywhere, talks down to me like I'm 5, and makes these weird comments about how I need to man up whenever I show any emotion.

But Janet had other plans. He'd literally snatch our daughter Emma, right out of my arms whenever I was holding her. If Emma was crying and I went to pick her up, Janet would push past me like I didn't exist. I've got her, she'd say. Already lifting Emma before I could even react. The worst part was feeding time. My wife was breastfeeding, but we'd started mixing in some formula bottles so I could help with night feeds. Janet would hover around my wife like a hawk, watching her every move. Then she'd take the baby and refuse to give her back when it was bottle time. You're doing it wrong, Janet would say when I tried to take Emma for her bottle. Let me show you.

My wedding venue is this gorgeous lakefront property that costs $200 per person. It's basically built on a cliff overlooking the water. Stunning for photos, but definitely not baby friendly. There are no railings, no baby gates, literally nothing to stop a crawling kid from going over the edge. That's why I specifically wrote adults only ceremony on every single invitation. When Andrew got his invite, he immediately called me up. Hey, sis, we're obviously bringing Hazel anyway. She's only six months old. What could possibly go wrong? I tried explaining the safety concern, how the venue is basically a death trap for babies, how there's a literal 30 foot drop to the lake with rocks below, but he cut me off mid sentence.

The kids thought it was hilarious the next morning, but when I got home from work, Tyler had moved the elf to our bedroom and positioned it on my pillow with a note that said, Emma's mom needs to step up her game. I was pissed, but didn't want to start a fight in front of the kids. I moved jingle back to the living room that night, thinking Tyler would drop it wrong.

Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired, effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just Solved world hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry. Just untied my apron, set it on his desk, and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone.

When Catherine said she needed space to find herself, I just nodded. But when I saw the resort confirmation email on her laptop, Sunset Paradise in Bali, something clicked. The thing is, we'd talked about Bali for our anniversary last year. She said it was too touristy and we should go somewhere more authentic and Ed. Funny how her standards changed. When chase from her yoga class started posting Instagram stories from Southeast Asia, I called my buddy Ricky. Remember that Bali trip you've been planning? Yeah, why? Mind if I join?

I transferred to the new high school halfway through junior year when my dad got a new job. Walking into Senor Vasquez's AP Spanish class, I immediately felt the judgment. I'm pale, freckled, with bright red hair. Basically the poster child for Gringo, who probably thinks Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. Ah, our new student, Senor Vasquez said in English, looking me up and down. I hope you have some Spanish background, because this is an advanced class. Do my best, I replied in English, taking the only empty seat in the back. From day one, Senor Vasquez has treated me like a class charity case. She'd speak slowly to me in English while rattling off rapid Spanish to everyone else. the real entertainment started when she thought I couldn't understand her side comments. Pobrecito! She'd whisper to her aid when I'd pretend to struggle with vocab. This poor boy is so lost. Red hair, no brain for languages. During group work, she'd tell the other students in Spanish, help the gringo understand. He probably thinks Biblioteca means taco place. The students were just as brutal. Mira al pelirrojo! Jessica would whisper to her friends. Look at the redhead trying to roll his R's. Sounds like a broken lawn mower. Por que es que he? Miguel would mutter, why is he even here? He should be in Spanish. One with a freshman during lunch when they thought I was out Of earshot. El Gringo probably uses Google Translate for everything. Watch him fail the midterm. See, what they didn't know was that Spanish is my first language. My mom is from Guatemala, and I spent every summer with my abuela in Antigua until I was 15. But I gritted my teeth and played along. Got b's and C's on purpose. Mispronounced words I'd known since I was three. For four months, I was their entertainment. The struggling white kid who clearly didn't belong in AP Spanish. Then came the final presentation assignment. The students will present a 20 minute cultural analysis entirely in Spanish. Senor Vasquez announced this is 40%

It started when some seniors decided to pull a prank involving our school's ancient fire alarm system. They'd noticed that during fire drills, only half the alarms actually worked. And teachers just told us to follow the crowd instead of following proper evacuation routes. So they came up with this plan. They'd trigger a fake fire alarm during lunch and then hide in the bathroom to see how long it took administration to figure out there was no actual emergency. Just stupid prank to waste everyone's time for 10 minutes. But when they pulled the alarm, something went seriously wrong. The main fire doors, the ones that are supposed to automatically open during emergencies, didn't budge. Kids were pushing against them, but they were completely locked. Backup exits were chained shut from the outside because administration didn't want students leaving campus during school hours. What was supposed to be a harmless prank turned into 800 students trapped in a building with no way out. Students started panicking. The alarms were blaring, but nobody could get through the exits. Teachers were yelling contradictory instructions. Some kids were having full panic attacks, thinking there was a real fire. It took 20 minutes for a janitor to find the manual override keys and unlock the doors. Twenty minutes of chaos, with kids genuinely scared they were going to die in a fire drill. Our principal was furious about the prank, but he Was more concerned about covering up the safety violations. He suspended the seniors and tried to spin the story as students interfering with emergency procedures. But parents started asking questions. Why were the fire doors locked? Why did it take so long to evacuate the building? The seniors who did the prank hired a lawyer because they were facing criminal charges for endangering public safety. Their lawyer discovered that our school had been failing fire safety inspections for three years. The fire

When my son was 11, his school bus crashed. The impact whipped his neck so violently that it crushed his airway. The doctors told us he would recover, but warned that he might never be able to speak again. It felt like a piece of him had been taken. He never let it stop him from trying to stay present, especially with his little sister, Rosie. She was five at the time, full of energy, always talking about everything and anything. And even though Nathan couldn't respond with words, he would still listen to every story she told. He'd smile, nod, or type little messages back to her on his phone. Most of the time, that was enough for her. But one afternoon, Rosie came home from school clearly upset. Her eyes were puffy, and she didn't say a word until she ran straight into Nathan's room. She dropped her backpack and hugged him tightly, tears rolling down her cheek. Nathan rubbed her back gently, trying his best to comfort her. She held on to him for a long time and then whispered, I just wish you could tell me it'll be okay. Nathan froze for a second. I saw it from the hallway. The look on his face broke me. He couldn't say what he wanted to say, and Rosie quietly left the room a few minutes later. After that day, Nathan started spending more Time alone. He would come home from school, eat dinner, and then disappear into his room. Every time I peeked in to check on him, he was already under the blanket. I figured maybe soccer practice was wearing him out or school was getting tougher, and I didn't want to push him to talk about it. I just let him rest. Then came Rosie's seventh birthday. The house was packed with cousins, neighbors, friends from school. There were balloons everywhere and a giant pink cake with seven candles sitting on the table. When it was time to sing, Rosie leaned forward and made her wish. She closed her eyes, smiled, and blew out every single candle in one breath. Everyone clapped, and then Nathan raised his hand. The room went completely silent. At first I thought something was wrong. He usually only did that when he needed help or something hurt. But this time his face was calm. Focus. He took a deep breath. His cheeks flushed.

For 12 years, I wasn't allowed to laugh, eat with my family, or basically exist in my own house because everything I did triggered my older brother. I'm 16 now, and my brother Jake is 20. He moved out two months ago, and suddenly my parents are acting like we're this close, happy family, but they have no idea what they put me through for over a decade. Jake has something called misophonia. He gets severely triggered by certain sounds. He. He was diagnosed when he was seven and I was four, and apparently he has a really extreme version of it. The problem? Every single one of his triggers was connected to me. My laugh, my footsteps, the way I chewed food, the sound of me turning pages when I read. Even the way I breathe sometimes would set him off. I remember being six years old, sitting in the backseat of our car, and I laughed at something I saw outside the window. Jake immediately started having a meltdown, covering his ears, yell, hitting himself. My dad pulled over and screamed at me. For being selfish and not thinking about your brother's condition. That's when the rules started. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with the family anymore. My parents would have dinner with Jake, and when he was finished and had left the table, then I could come out of my room and eat by myself. Cold Food alone while my parents cleaned up, or watch TV. I couldn't go on family outings if Jake was coming, which was basically all of them. Movie theaters, restaurants, amusement parks. Anywhere that my normal kid sounds might bother him was off limits for me. At home, I had to walk on my tiptoes. I couldn't watch TV in the living room if Jake was around. I Learned to laugh silently, covering my mouth with both hands so no sound came out. The worst part was that I was just a little kid. I didn't understand why everyone was always angry at me for just existing. I thought I was a bad person because everything I did naturally seemed to hurt my brother.

But it was actually a setup to humiliate me when I found out. I gave her the public proposal she wanted, just not the one she expected. The ultimatum came on a Tuesday night. My girlfriend of two years, Laura, turned off the television, crossed her arms, and gave me a look I'd never seen before. We need to talk, she said. This isn't moving forward. My friends are getting engaged. Married. I'm 28, Alex. I'm not getting any younger. I'd always been honest about my timeline. While I loved her, there were things that gave me pause. Her obsession with appearances, her need for social media validation. How she spoke about friends behind their backs. Laura, we've talked about this, I said. I'm just not ready right now. Maybe in another year. No, she cut me off. My family's Christmas Eve party is in two weeks. I want you to propose to me there, in front of everyone. If you can't do that, we're done. A public proposal ultimatum felt like a hostage negotiation. I tried reasoning with her, but she wouldn't budge. It was the party or it was over. Three days later, her older sister Sarah asked me to meet for coffee, her voice tense over the phone. Sarah was Laura's opposite. Quiet, pragmatic, worked as a real estate agent. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't slept. She'd overheard Laura in Her old bedroom, talking to her best friend, Megan. Laura was laughing, bragging about the ultimatum. Sarah said she's been seeing someone else for a month. Her plan is to let you propose publicly. So she can say no and humiliate you in front of everyone. It would be her grand exit. Dramatic story she could tell for years. Megan was squealing with delight, promising to film your rejection. Sarah looked directly at me. She wants to ruin you just for a story.

I think she just confessed to mass murder. When I met my girlfriend Haley, everything in my life happened way too fast, because within just two weeks, I was practically living at her place. But it didn't matter to me. She let me eat her out whenever I wanted to, was super beautiful, and even made me feel like I was the only guy on earth who truly mattered. I felt like I was on heaven until the 23rd night into us living together, because when I was just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok while I was next to her in bed, she suddenly rolled over to me and just stared at me without an expression. Ask me a question, she whispered, but I immediately realized something was wrong because her voice sounded completely flat and robotic. I nervously laughed, thinking it was a joke, but she didn't. Instead, she just grabbed my hand and yelled, ask me! So I gave in and asked, do you like it when I stick it in? Yes, I love it, she replied. Then she just turned around like nothing happened. The next morning, she looked like she had completely forgotten what happened. So when I showed her the massive wound she left on my hand, she completely freaked out and apologized a million times. I tried to forget it because I loved her too much. But the very next night, she did it again. Asked me a question. She asked again. This time I asked her, would you ever cheat on me? She just looked at me and said, no, daddy, and turned around to sleep. Every single night after that, the exact same creepy routine happened. One question, one answer, then sleep. Until one night I got super annoyed and asked what happens if I don't ask anything? She just stared at me and said, you die. Then, just like every other day, she turned around and slept. The next day, I was still horrified with what she said, so I texted her that I had to take care of my sick mom and just went to sleep at my house. But in the middle of the night, at 3:00am, she broke into my house, shook me awake, and violently told me to ask her a question. I just couldn't go on living like this, so I refused. And the second I said that, she immediately dug her nails into my skin so deep that I started bleeding. I had no idea what to do, so I asked her, when do I die? But this time she just said after me and dropped asleep on the floor. That night, I packed everything in my car, drove to the other side of the country.

She just posted something horrifying on her Instagram story. Last time I saw her, she was screaming at my mom in the driveway, told us that she was done with all of us, and then stormed off into the night. We assumed she'd be back in a couple of hours, but after 10 hours with no sign of her, we knew something was awfully wrong. At first, the cops thought it was just a dramatic teenage runaway case. When they found her phone three hours later in the middle of the woods, their tone completely changed. There were no footprints, no fingerprint, and not even a sign of where she could have gone. The cops told us that she died in a river and that it was best to just move on from her. My mom started sleeping in Aubrey's bed. My dad put locks on every door and window, and I spent every night putting missing posters around town. That was 5 years ago, and I accepted the fact that she was never coming back. But last night, while I was watching some corn, a notification popped up on my phone. Yobrey Duris just added to their story. I was super confused how that was even possible, because her account was deactivated the week she vanished. I assumed her account had just gotten hacked or something. When I clicked on her story, it showed a blurry photo of Aubrey in some disgusting Bathroom. She had the same jawline, same mole under her eye, and even the same freckles, but her skin looked kind of grayish, almost like she hadn't seen sunlight in years. And her mouth was stretched into this weird smile, like she was forcing it or something. She also put a caption on it which said, see you soon, Danny. But before I could even process what was going on, my phone started buzzing with DMs from random accounts. They were saying things like, bro, is this a joke? Why is she back? Check the next story. So I tapped back on her profile and saw that it was fully active again. Her old photos were completely restored, but all the captions were changed. All kept saying things like, he feeds through me. Danny's next. I hear him breathing. But it was the pictures that shook me the most. Each one had a shadowy figure somewhere in the background, standing behind trees, peeking from hallways, or even sitting at our dinner table in one of them. And just when I thought I saw it all, she uploaded a real called home. It was a video.

Zara, a yoga instructor who kept mentioning my blocked chakras. Natasha, a lawyer who interrogated me like I was on trial. And Ava, the only decent one who at least looked uncomfortable. I already finished a bottle of wine before I arrived, and the humiliation started immediately. So you work in IT, Scarlet said with that condescending tone. How practical. Not very creative, though, is it? When I mentioned gaming as a hobby, Zara laughed. Gaming? Isn't that for teenagers? I dated a gamer once. He chose his PlayStation over couple's therapy. Red flag. Honestly, every answer got picked up. When I said I hoped Luna and I would be engaged in five years, Iris scoffed, maybe after five years, Luna needs someone. Who knows? Not maybe. Then came the ex boyfriend comparisons. Luna's ex, Miguel, was so Romantic! Zara said, looking directly at me. Remember when he flew her to Paris for a weekend? I bet Theo is more of a staycation guy. Miguel was intense, though, too jealous, Scarlett added. At least he had passion. Some guys are just vanilla. They all stared at me while Luna said absolutely nothing. When I finally stood up for air, Scarlett smirked. Oh, did we hit a nerve? Luna, your boy is sensitive.

So I changed the locks and packed her things while she was at brunch. Twenty four hours later, she and her friends were blowing up my phone. The house is mine. Inherited from my grandparents. Mortgage paid off. I pay property taxes, utilities, insurance, everything. My girlfriend Hannah moved in about a year ago with no formal agreement because I loved her and thought we were building a future together. She pays for her car, phone, and split. It's groceries. That's it. No rent, no utilities. Her friends Olivia and Marie were constantly at our place, treating it like their personal hangout spot. They'd raid our fridge, leave messes, and Hannah always defended them with, they're practically family. When I suggested they hang out at their own apartment. Sometimes Hannah acted like I was being unreasonable. The breaking point came yesterday morning. Hannah walked into the kitchen, scrolling her phone, not even looking up when she dropped the bomb. Hey, so good news. Olivia and Marie are moving in. Moving in? What do you mean? Like, with their stuff? Their lease is up, so it's perfect timing. Where are they staying? We don't have spare rooms. Furnished. Take the two spare rooms. They're moving in rent free until they get back on their feet. Hannah, you can't decide your friends are moving into my house without talking to me. She sighed dramatically. Don't Be like that. It's a big house. They're practically family. Where are we supposed to sleep? She smiled that dismissive smile. Olivia and Marie can take the master bedroom. Since there are two of them, you can have a smaller room. Then he paused. Actually, you can just sleep on the couch. It's comfy. Sleep on the couch in my own house. The house my grandparents left me. I was being demoted to a guest in my own home to accommodate her friends financial problems. Something inside me snapped. Not in an angry, yelling way. It was quiet and cold. The sound of a door slamming shut in my head. All the little compromises, all the times I'd let her entire

Mom says if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would even notice. While opening the 850 dollar phone I bought her. All 30 guests laughed except me. I nodded and with two taps I shut down every payment. Credit bills, subscriptions, gone for years. I paid Lindsay's rent, covered dad's gambling debts, handled mom's credit cards, and bought countless expensive gift. I was the responsible one who always said yes when they needed money, but never really part of the family, just their walking ATM. Birthday party had 30 relatives gathered around. I driven straight from work to deliver that phone. Another expensive gesture to show my love. My niece peeled away the plastic with delicate fingers, but her words cut like glass. Mom says if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would even notice. The room erupted in laughter. Lindsay smirked from the couch like she'd been waiting for this moment. Mom pretended not to hear from the kitchen, but her shoulders lifted in silent approval. Dad raised his beer and chuckled. Well, she's not wrong. Even Uncle Gary, who barely knew me beyond family dinners, ordered into his drink. Cousins grinned. 30 people laughed at my expense while I stood there like the fool I'd always been, the one who paid for everything but mattered to no one. But this time, something different happened. Instead of forcing a smile, I felt my phone in my pocket and made two quick taps. Every Bill I Paid every subscription I managed, every credit line I'd set up for them. Gone, just like that. The voices blurred into distant noise as I slipped out without saying goodbye. No one noticed me leave the one thing my niece got right. I went home, packed essentials, then returned with an old black backpack while they celebrated.

My gym teacher, Mr. Dempsey, died during class. Heart attack while showing us proper push up form. One second he was counting rep, next second, he was faced down on the basketball court. We all froze. Then Lindsay screamed. Then chaos. Except here's the thing. He got back up. Not immediately. Paramedics worked on him for 12 minutes, called time of death at 2:47 p m. We watched them cover him with a sheet. Whole school got sent home. Next morning, he was in his office eating a bagel. Morning, ladies. Five laps around the track. We lost our shit. Kids running away. Tessa fainted. Eli threw up. What? He looked genuinely confused. Too many laps, you died. I finally managed. Oh, that. He took another bite of bagel. Yeah, that happens sometimes. What? The principal called an assembly. Tried to explain Mister Dempsey has a rare condition. I die, Dempsey be interrupted. No big deal. Been happening since I was 12. Heart stops, I'm dead for a bit, then I'm back. Like a really shitty superpower. Parents went ballistic. School board had emergency meetings. Lawyers got involved, but Dempsey kept showing up. Court ruled he couldn't be fired for a medical condition, even if that condition was being temporarily dead. We adjusted, kind of. Dempsey's dead again became a normal announcement. We'd move his body to the nurse's office, continue class with a substitute, wait for him to pop Back up. He started wearing a bracelet. If found dead, just wait 10 to 15 minutes. The weird part? He remembered being dead. Not heaven or hell stuff, and just not nothing. Said it was like the best nap ever. Honestly, dying is the most rest I get. He'd joke while making us run suicides. Then Trent asked the question we'd all been thinking. What if one time you don't come back? Dempsey shrugged. Then I get a permanent nap.

At my high school, we had this ancient set of graphing calculators for math class that were constantly glitching. Half of them had dead pixels, cracked screens, or just refused to turn on. Teachers would apologize and tell you to share with someone else. During my junior year AP Calculus exam, I grabbed calculator No.. 23, which was notorious for freezing during tests. Sure enough, 10 minutes in, it completely died. Black screen, nothing. I was panicking because this test was 40% of our grade. So in desperation, I started whispering to the calculator like it was a pet or something. Come on, buddy, I said quietly. Wake up. We need to do some derivatives together. Nothing. Getting more frustrated, I tried what I thought sounded like computer commands. Enable calculation mode. Only the screen flickered and came back to life. Perfect timing. The girl next to me saw the whole thing. Oh, my god, how did you do that? I just talked to it, I whispered back, confused. After the test, she told everyone that I had special calculator powers and could fix broken ones by talking to them. I tried to explain it was just a coincidence, but nobody listened. The next week, someone handed me calculator No.. 14, which had been dead for months. As a joke, I whispered, activate mathematical functions. It turned on immediately. Now I had witnesses. Word spread that I was some kind of Calculator whisperer teachers started noticing that their permanently broken calculators were suddenly functional again. The legend grew out of control. Freshman would approach me in the hallway with broken calculators like I was some sort of tech wizard. I started charging $5 to activate calculators, which was ridiculous, but kids hate it. I was making $50 a week fixing school technology by talking to it in fake computer language. The principal called me into her office after a month of this. I thought I was in trouble for running an unauthorized tech repair business. Instead, she said, I don't know what

Right. This happened in 2014, and no one was arrested until 2022. The story is pretty twisted. This is Donna Adelson, the grandmother, but we'll get back to her in a minute. This is her daughter, Wendy Adelson. And this was Wendy's husband, Dan Markel. Wendy and Dan created a life for a while until it just no longer worked. They got divorced, but then they ensued in a custody battle. You see, Wendy wanted to move 370 miles south of Tallahassee to southern Florida with their two sons. Dan was a law professor at Florida State University, and he absolutely refused to relocate. This was going to prevent Wendy from leaving with the kids. In comes Donna again. Apparently, Wendy's mother, Donna, wanted to help with the situation. This is her son over here, Charlie Adelson. Apparently, Donna master minded this murder for hire plot utilizing her son's ex girlfriend. Here's Charlie. Here's his girlfriend, Catherine. Here's Catherine's baby daddy. Tuto was friends with Louis, and these two were part of the Latin Kings gang. These two were apparently hired to take out Dan. Wendy and Donna's problem. On July of 2014, those two stalked him, followed him to his house, and ended up taking his life in his garage. Now, Dan's unaliving went unsolved for nearly a decade. It wasn't until 2022 that they were finally able to link this unaliving to the son Charlie. Adelson at that time it was found that Charlie and his then girlfriend Katie had hired these two to do the plot. Louis took a plea deal and is serving 19 years behind Bar. Tutu was found to be the trigger man, serving life behind bars. Charlie and Katie were also sentenced to a life behind bars. But let's not forget Donna and all of this who hated her son in law. Donna also avoided arrest for nearly a decade. She was being investigated, although she clearly denied that she had anything to do with this. Basically she let her son take the fall. But in November of 2023, Donna was arrested in the Miami International Airport. She had a one way ticket to Vietnam, which she later admitted that she was aware that they have a no extradition policy. She waited for quite some time for her trial, but on September 4th the judge handed down the verdict and she was found guilty. And she wailed and cried for nearly two minutes as the judge had to send the jury out while she collected herself. It was found that she had orchestrated this entire murder for hire plot, gotten together $100,000, which she came from a pretty affluent family and area anyways, and that she indeed did deserve to be behind bars.

So you want to keep an open tab, so you want to be able to get drinks and then pay for them all together at the end, right? Yeah. I know what it means to open a tab. Right. So if I don't keep a card on file for you, there's nothing stopping you from ordering 5 drinks and then leaving. I have no means to contact you, and I have no way to make you pay. Nice.

No, we're not saying that we think you personally are gonna steal, but some people would, and Some people, you know, will just forget to close other tabs. So it's not personal. It's just a policy that we enforce for everybody. This is unbelievable. So I'm just supposed to leave my credit card with a complete stranger who probably needs the money? Right?

Is that okay? No, no, I don't want like extra chicken, but just like more chicken. I see. Um, so our salads come with like 6 ounces of chicken. Would that be enough? Um, like 10 would be good. Okay. Unfortunately, in order to get 10 ounces, I would have to ring it in as extra chicken. Um, so it would just be a dollar more. Are you even listening to me? I don't want to pay an extra dollar. Can you just throw some extra chicken on there? Well, sir, I'm not even the one that's gonna be making your food. So if you want extra chicken, I have to bring it into the kitchen as extra chicken and that cost a dollar. Oh my God. This is ridiculous. I know. I'm sorry. My boss is kind of a stickler about the prices. Then don't tell him. Just go back to the kitchen and throw some extra chicken on it. I don't think that would go over too well. So do you want the extra chicken or no? Yes, I want the extra chicken. Okay. And just to be clear, that extra chicken will cost $1. No, I'm not paying a dollar. Alright.

Did you just ask me why I missed the entire first week of school to go to my dad's funeral? It doesn't matter whether or not he was on my emergency contact list. He was still my dad. Well, I just meant why wasn't he on your emergency contact list in the first place? Because we're in Florida, and he was in Maryland, and my mom has full custody of me. He was still my dad. Are you.

There's a temporary transfer of custody that has my mom's signature and her mom's signature on it, but it's in his office. Okay. And what is your mom's number? Is it the same as last year? I just want a call to verify. My mom isn't in the country. She's on a cruise in Mexico. She's not gonna be able to answer her phone. Okay. Well, I'm looking on your old emergency contact form and it's only your mom and your stepfather. So what about him? My stepdad is on the cruise in Mexico as well, so neither one of them are gonna be able to answer the phone. Um, it says on the paper, though, that if there's any problems to call her mom. Well, her mom should be on your new emergency contact form, but you don't have an updated one. Why is that? Um, because y'all give them out the first week of school, and when I got back, I was never given one.

My daughter Emma is 25 and absolutely beautiful, not just physically, but she's charming in a way that makes everyone want to be around her. She's got this perfect smile and this laugh that makes guys lose their minds. Her boyfriend, Tyler, is head over heels for her. The poor guy follows her around like a lost puppy and talks about her like she hung the moon. But here's the thing, nobody knows. Emma is a diagnosed sociopath, has been since she was 18, though I knew something was off way before that. When she was 8, she locked her little sister Mia in the basement for three hours just to see what would happen. When I found Mia crying and scared in the dark, Emma was upstairs watching TV like nothing happened. When I asked her why she did it, she just shrugged and said she was curious. No tears, no sorry, nothing. School was a nightmare. Teachers called constantly about Emma lying to get other kids in trouble, stealing lunch money. And once she convinced a boy to eat glue by telling him it was candy. The counselor said she was just going through a phase, but I knew better. After years of therapy and medication, Emma Learned how to act normal. She, she studied other people like a science project, copying their emotions until she could fake them perfectly by High school, she was popular, dated constantly and had everyone fooled. The diagnosis came when she was 18, antisocial personality disorder. The doctor explained it in fancy terms, but basically Emma doesn't feel love, guilt or empathy. She can't. Her brain just doesn't work that way. We've had honest conversations about it since then. When her best friend died in a car accident last year, Emma cried at the funeral and gave this heartbreaking speech later that night. She told me she felt absolutely nothing. The whole thing was an act because that's what people expected. She's been with Tyler for almost two years now. He's a good guy, works as a teacher, volunteers at animal shelters, brings me coffee when he visits. He talks about marrying Emma constantly. Last week, he asked me for my blessing to propose. That's when I told Emma she needs to tell him the truth or I will. She laughed and said I'd never have the guts. She thinks I'm bluffing because she's my daughter and I love her. But Tyler deserves to know what he's signing up for. Emma flat out told me she doesn't love him, never has and never will. She likes the stability he provides and thinks he'll be a good father if they have kids. To her, marriage is just a business transaction. When I brought it up again yesterday, Emma got that cold look.

I went on a breakfast date with a man one time. He spread ketchup across his entire plate and then chopped all the food into one big pile. Pancakes were involved. At that moment, I knew I could never see him again. Honestly, if they breathe or eat or swallow too loud, I can't handle it. It's petty, I know, but I can't do the rest of my life listening to someone breathe like a 70 year old man asleep on a chair or chew and swallow like a cow. 2, someone that takes forever to get ready to go literally anywhere. I once dated a girl and it literally took her 40 minutes to get ready to walk the dog for 15 minutes with me. Mind you, this was not a phobia. And for the record, she didn't wear any makeup nor did she wear anything special that might explain the sloth pace. Just basically talking my ears off and spending an eternity tying her shoelaces. It even left me with a small existential crisis, wondering if I would even be cut out for children. But choosing a life like this with an adult, I have way too little patience for that. Sorry. 3. This girl was beautiful, driven, intelligent. We got along well. She was perfect except that she would snap her fingers whenever someone would say something she liked. Every conversation peppered with snaps, she'd do it instead. Of applauding at concerts, too. Eventually I realized that this couldn't be my life. 4, the guy I married goes by his first and middle initials. Think J, C, L, J. And when I found out his actual first name about six months into dating him, it legitimately made me upset because it was such an old fashioned name. It didn't make me end, but I sure thought about it. To this day, 10+ years together, I avoid saying his proper name like the plague. I feel super petty about my feelings, but all these years later, I still really, really dislike it. I'm just used to it. Five, I once broke up with a girl because her teeth were small and the gaps between all her teeth really freaked me out. 6, I went on a first date with a guy at a coffee shop. I got there before him and was sitting at a table waiting. He walked up and instead of approaching and saying, excuse me, are you so and so, he very loudly yelled my name and everyone around turned and looked at him while I homered back into the bushes. It was over then and there. I think he thought he was being manly and dominant or something, but I'm a private and introverted person and that made my skin crawl. Seven, I swear to you, the day we got married, my wife started swallowing loudly like she knew it was a thing she did. She intentionally hit it and then stopped trying to hide it five seconds after our vows. 8, was married to someone. Then when that ended, I dated someone who had the same name. Years later, I was flirting with someone and when I Learned they had the same name, I just turned and walked away. 9. I won't date them if they don't use their turn signals. If you can't communicate on the road, you can't communicate in a relationship. 10. I dated a really cute lady in my early 20s. Pretty much my type, super sweet, but she did this weird exhale, scoff thing consistently in conversation when she didn't like something. And it became so noticeable I was going to lose my mind. I finally was just like, yeah, this isn't going to work. Eleven. They drag their feet when they're walking. 12. This was years ago, but I would swipe left on any dude holding an iPhone without a case on it cause I didn't need that kind of stress in my life. 13, allergies. I love animals and I'm not going to date a man who might pass away if I come around him after eating a peanut or shrimp.

One first time I took a hot shower in our new home, the steam covered the mirror only to reveal the phrase, hello, I see you in large finger drawn writing. It freaked me out for a second but made me laugh soon after that. It was such an inconspicuous yet obvious thing to leave for the new homeowner. Me. Two, wasn't a purchase, but I was showing a house to a couple and we couldn't believe the reported square footage. It looked like a nice 1,700 square foot house in a semi rural community, but the square footage on the listing said about 4,500. I was sure it was a typo. Turns out most of it was in the basement. Think Buffalo Bills basement. That just goes on and on with random rooms. The place was vacant. The lighting wasn't great. We got to a dead end room down there and turned on the lights and there was this porcelain doll just chilling in the middle of the room. Only thing left in the house. Husband yells, screw this, and we all run out. We ruled out that whole neighborhood as an option for obvious reasons. 3, $1,200 in cash above the door on the inside of the closet. I found it while painting. 4, we bought a house being foreclosed on. We gave him an extra month after closing in. 2000 to help with his move. Still had to have the sheriff come to remove him. Anywho, I was doing some clean up and remodeling before we moved in. The whole house was carpeted. When I started ripping it out, there was a giant blood stain that started in a downstairs spare bedroom and then trailed up to the master bath where there was another stain. His wife had left him. So I had to call the realtor to find out if anyone knew where she was. Turns out he had taken out a deer in the yard and gutted it in the house. What a hassle. Had to rip up and install new sub floors. My vegan ex wife was not thrilled. 5. The property my wife and I moved to three years ago had a bucket full of wrapped Dinosaur bones. Took them to our local museum where they confirm they are roughly 68 million years old. Hadrosaur. Pretty cool. 6. We bought the house from the CEO of the company which we franchise from. It was her childhood home where her mother lived until the day she passed. In true rich person fashion, they didn't care to clean out the house before selling it. They just told us we can do whatever we want with the old lady stuff that was there. We found a hidden box of spicy letters from the old lady to her secret partner spanning many years. That was fun to give to the CEO 7, my uncle was renovating the house that he bought for his chiropractic practice. And when he knocked down a wall to enlarge a room, a few dozen pill bottles fell to the floor. They were each filled with about 25 US silver dollars, which at the time were worth more like $6 in silver each. So it was about $5,000 in vintage coins. 8, that they wired a room by connecting the outlet with an extension cord inside the wall. 9, a diary of an American soldier in World War 2 South Pacific Theater found it above a door when remodeling 20+ years ago. My wife and I tried everything we could think of to find a descendant, but to no avail. Ten, a basement room that was fully decked out as a dungeon. Fake stone walls, a stocks like where you lock your head and hands in Old England. Candle scones on the walls, a metal barred cage in the corner from floor to ceiling. Oh, and the closet had a load of toys, some normal, some not so normal. 11, an entire tribe of raccoons living in the attic.

My old apartment complex had a soda vending machine at the pool that was broken. If you put in 50 cents and press the button, nothing happened. If you put in another 50 cents and press the button, nothing happened. But if you put 50 cents in a third time and press the button, you'd get three sodas. I could see the vending machine from my couch, so I would watch for someone to try and then try again and then give up without trying a third time. And then I'd head over and get three sodas for 50 cents. Two. Not me, but my roommate. In college, whenever you paid for anything on the university's website, you'd earn college bucks, each year's tuition, pay for something small like a beer, koozie, fold up lawn chair, or if you somehow spent an absurd amount, an official school branded kayak. Well, my buddy found out that the points were added to your account before payment went through on the website. So he just refreshed the page over and over and got millions of points. I only found out about his scheme when I came home to an entire living room filled with boxes from our school. There were shirts, coolers, chairs, cups and, of course, the kayak. We opened all of it like idiots and had a giant laugh at the school's expense. All of the guys living in that house. Were having a great time until we opened the smallest box which had 1,100 dollar visa gift cards. Then we got scared. A bunch of school branded crap from a warehouse was probably unusual, but not something that would bother the person loading all that up for delivery. The gift cards though, that was where he got caught. The gift card issuer called the school to verify such a large amount before activating the cards and that raised a lot of red flags in the accounting department. They traced it all back to my roommate and came and took everything back. They left the opened items in the worthless gift cards and suspended him during his final semester of college. He had to write an apology letter and do community service for the school for that whole semester in return for not pressing charges for fraud. It makes for a great story though. We had a ton of beer, koozies and gift cards that we threw at each other like Ninja Stars 3. When in high school, there was a company that offered money to run an advertising window at the top of your screen would monitor mouse movement to track whether you were at your computer and pay a small amount per hour. A buddy and I downloaded it and a mouse moving software and it would run both 24 7 except when we were on the computer. Made a few hundred dollars off of it before the company Closed down 4 Coca Cola did a campaign where you register a code from the bottle cap and earn prizes I worked at a store with a bottle deposit and earn myself a sweet MP three player with room for five songs or something. It was pretty sweet at the time. 5 had a college professor who insisted on doing all tests and quizzes online. If you looked at the page through view page source all of the answers for each multiple answer question had a marker on which one was correct. 6 free sandwiches from CFA based on location I used GPS spoofer and got tons of free sandwiches a week on multiple accounts. I think I got about $5,000 worth of sandwiches and nuggets before they banned me. 7 I received thousands of dollars of stock certificates in the mail. Some intern messed up so badly that my broker said to hold on to it I I held the stock for years before selling it at a profit. 8 I Learned before my USAF basic training to say that I played an instrument whenever they asked the group on the first day I raised my hand and lied and said the symbols so most days I got to angrily smash symbols together in the air conditioning band trailer.

One. The grandma who used coconut oil on her granddaughter who was extremely allergic and passed from it. As someone who works with toddlers, that story is a nightmare. Grandma nonchalantly caused the passing of her granddaughter. Not because she didn't know about the allergy, because she just didn't think it was a big deal. And in no time flat, a toddler is gone and two parents and two surviving siblings are forever traumatized. And grandma can't figure out why her daughter won't see her two. It wasn't as memorable or as big as most Reddit comments, but one has stuck with me. I forgot what the question was, but this guy commented that he was asked to bring like two gallons of milk to his girlfriend's family dinner. He thought, oh, they must really like milk. When he arrived, each family member had their own gallon of milk, and when dinner was served they all just started guzzling their own milk like animals. I need to try finding that. It was hilarious. 3 the one where the guy had an imaginary girlfriend, later wife, who was a giant cockroach, and his coworkers eventually found out that he had a whole fantasy life with his life size cockroach girlfriend slash wife. Four people seem to regularly post what Reddit post can't you get over? And I always drop in to say the pregnant woman whose husband and father In law decided she'd pass in labor and we're doing all the planning for that to happen. She never updated and I always wonder and worry a little. Wish I'd save the post. 5 the guy who was looking for legal advice because his landlord was sneaking in and leaving him notes while he was sleeping and someone in the comment section saved his life by realizing he was actually suffering carbon monoxide poisoning. Six the lady on ADA who unplugged her fridge to deep clean it while her husband had a box in there who told her to not open the box. I frequently wonder what was in the box. 7 the dude that bought a house with his GF and wasn't allowed upstairs.

I moved into my condo in 2011 and I introduced myself to my one neighbor next door to me but instantly forgot his name. We would see each other in passing for years and I would always just say hi and the casual conversation. I met my wife in 2018 from a long distance relationship. When she finally moved in with me, there was an awkward moment when I introduced her to him. I said this is my fiance and we're getting married next month. He said congratulations and nice to meet you, then walked away. She asked me what his name was and I said I have no clue. Later that day she said his name was Brad. And I was like, oh, he looks like a Brad. And she said he had no clue what my name was either, so no big deal. 2. 2 years. I used to be a club promoter and I had a guy that bought tickets for me for every event he went to. He told me his name when I first met him, but I forgot it soon after he told me. Meeting lots of people makes it hard to remember names, especially when I don't even know if I'll ever see them again. So what's the point of remembering everyone's names after a certain point? I saw him out partying often enough, but it was past the point where I could ask him his name without it being awkward. I had him saved in my phone as Sir Prince Albert since he told me about his piercing so that I'd know who was texting me if we ever texted each other. But I didn't think to add his name since I wasn't sure what it was. So that was no help. Eventually we ended up at a party together and some people walked in and asked, hey, have you seen Phil? After not remembering meeting anyone that night named Phil, I said, no, I don't think there's a Phil here. Then that guy whose name I couldn't remember came up and joined the group and said, I'm right here. Don't worry, these guys are cool. I invited them. At that moment, I finally found out his name and I played it off as, oh, okay, well, if they are your friends, then I guess it's cool if they stay and just went with it. 3. A whole school year I knew their names. I just didn't know which twin was which and they weren't identical. 4. My name is apparently Darren to this nice couple who own a restaurant in my town. My name is not Darren. I've known them for two years. We're even FB friends. They can literally see and read my name. But it's cool. I always wanted to try being a Darren. 5. I've lived in my townhouse for almost five years now and I Don't know the name of the guy who lives directly across from me. I have pretty regular interactions with most of my neighbors, but I've never talked with this one guy beyond just exchanging pleasantries while passing each other. When I moved in and first met him, I immediately forgot his name. I was almost positive he said it was Mike. So I went about four years just assuming that was probably his name, but not quite confident enough to actually call him Mike. Then a few months ago, I was talking to some other neighbors in the parking lot when he walked by and my other neighbors called out, hey. So it was confirmed that this guy's name is not, in fact, Mike. And I was relieved. I hadn't been calling him that for the past 5 years. But I immediately forgot again what his name actually is. So now all I know is that it is something other than Mike. Maybe I'll learn his name by the time I've lived here 10 years. Six, a whole date. Someone fixed us up, but my dude never told me her name, just the address. She wanted me to pick her up. I didn't have the guts to ask her name between the date. She became a longtime GF after that date and we laughed about it. 7. My nickname in college was the mayor and I had people I had known for years coming up to me at my graduation. Saying, I had no idea your name was actually Dan.

One, a work friend invited me over to his house to watch a hockey game. So I said, sure, why not? I bought a six pack of beers and he said, sweet. He just put them in his fridge. He proceeded to pour himself scotch but never asking me if I wanted to have a drink. Then he pulled out some leftovers and made himself a dish and again, never asked me if I was hungry. Then I just asked for a beer that I had bought and he said, I guess, but I was going to save them for another time. I left after the game and it's been really awkward at work. 2. Oh yeah. Did we mention we've got bed bugs? You should be okay, though. My girlfriend's mom did this to us last year for Christmas. We had plans for three days worth of celebrations with various family and friends. We knew going in that they had bed bugs as in past tents, but they didn't bother to mention that it was still an issue until we had arrived. I was livid. It wasn't as bad as it could have been because our sleeping arrangements were elsewhere due to my cat allergy, but I was still worried about bringing them home with us or even transferring them to the hotel after they told us. I bought trash bags, everything we wore, all Our gifts, everything went into a trash bag to bring it home once we got here. We put what we could in a high heat cycle in the dryer and I inspected everything else on our tile bathroom floor with a flashlight. I was nervous for days afterward thinking I'd missed one and we'd have issues at our place, too. 3. A failed scorpion farm made the horrendous mistake of spending the night at my ex's parents house. I woke up to the feeling of something crawling on me. I soon realized there were three somethings. I flicked on the light and discovered scorpions. There are no scorpions native to our area. I freak out, SWAT them off and then run to the bathroom to strip and check for more. And when I turn on the light, several scorpions on the wall scattered like roaches. I wake up the ex. Apparently when he was younger, he thought ant farms were boring and decided to order scorpions on the internet and make a scorpion farm instead. The survivors of his arachnid Mad Max setup escaped into the house where a few turned into an insane amount. The very wealthy parents chose to live with the scorpions rather than call an exterminator, never went back. 4. Their bathroom floor was carpet and it was always wet. It went through my shoes and got my socks wet. First time, maybe someone just showered. Second time, nope. I can't live like this. 5. I Had a buddy I visited who played cat turd golf in his house because there were cat turds caked onto the carpeting everywhere. Believe an 8 iron was the club of choice. 6. I once went to a party at someone's house in Florida at night. We were all hanging out in the backyard. So the house looked okay from the outside. I asked the host if I could use his bathroom and I noticed the wallpaper looked kind of fuzzy, but I chalked it up to being tipsy. It wasn't until he flicked the light switch on that the fuzzy wallpaper was in fact a huge roach infestation and they scattered everywhere and even more ran away from us. When he put the toilet seat down for me and left, I was too scared to move, let alone sit and pee. So I just sped walked right up out of the whole house and held my pee in until I got home. I have no idea how they were okay living in that house with a trillion roach roomies. Seven was not offered any form of bedding. I slept on the floor while they slept on the bed. There were three of us and we were both invited. Both guests slept on the floor. This has happened multiple times and I swear I will not go back now that I can drive.

You dodged one. After a night of partying, a bunch of us wanted to go watch the sun come up at a local beach. When we had just graduated high school, there wasn't a single logically thinking one amongst us, and one guy volunteered to drive in his minivan. A few of us said, no, let's watch it from the deck. But he said he was sober enough. I just had a bad feeling, and a bunch of us stayed back and slept it off at the house. We were all woken up a few hours later at about eight to a phone ringing off the hook. Cops and freaking out parents. It's pre cell phone days. They were in a really bad single car rollover accident. Four out of the six didn't make it. No one was wearing seat belts. They would have had to have taken a curve at about 90 miles per hour. 2 Yesterday I was driving and waiting for the left turn arrow to turn green. I kind of spaced out and then realized the arrow turned green about a second ago. Took my foot off the brake. As soon as I did that, a huge pickup truck ran the red light from my left and didn't even tap the brakes. If I hadn't zoned out, the truck would have hit my door right where I was sitting in my car. And I Probably wouldn't be typing this right now. 3 I, a 24 year old, had a pesky sore on my tongue that was really bothering me. My boyfriend's dad was a dentist, so when I was over at his house one night, I asked him to take a look. He recommended I go see an oral surgeon the next day for him to check it out. The next day I decided it was feeling better, so I tried to cancel my appointment, but my boyfriend's dad insisted I go. I went, and the oral surgeon pretty much diagnosed it as cancer on the spot. It was aggressive, and by the time of my surgery to remove it, it. It had already spread to multiple lymph nodes. They ended up removing over half my tongue, followed by chemo and radiation. Given how aggressive it was, I often think that if I had put off the doctor's visit any longer, I probably wouldn't have survived. I'm coming up on my 10 year anniversary in January. Four. I was driving home from visiting my brother in Vermont when a snowstorm started. I didn't have much experience driving in serious snow, and I completely lost control. The car careened off the road and I was heading for a giant boulder at around 50 or 60 miles per hour. I literally felt time slow down, and I reflected on my life for a moment and then said goodbye to my body. I was jolted out of It by an impact, but I could see that the boulder was still 20 or 30 feet away. When I got out of the car, I saw that I had hit a little skinny tree that I could have easily grabbed with one hand. It had a giant root system that lifted the car off the ground and stopped me. The car was totaled, but I was completely fine. Because of that little tree, there is no way I would have survived the other impact. 5 my wife dragged my behind to the dermatologist for a cyst I have had for years. While there, the DOC noticed a mole on my ankle that he didn't like. Turned out to be melanoma. Would have never gone if my wife didn't force me. 6 on a road trip in college with four friends, we stopped halfway for a pit stop because I had explosive diarrhea and was getting sicker by the minute. Friends carried on to Vegas and left me with one of the guys who rented us a car to return home. Friends that carried on got into a rollover. One didn't make it, and two will be injured for life. Seven my wife and I were prepared to buy a nice river front property in 2019, but the owners, her dad and uncle, were dragging their feet. We had our down payment, we were approved for the mortgage. Then the river rose 30 feet, so we didn't buy it.

The cold would destroy his skin. He would only put lotion on when it was basically bleeding, by which point it can't really do much help. Moisturize. To steal from Bill Burr, guys, you can put lotion on places other than your weapon. It still looks brand new while the rest of you looks like an aging pirate. You need to increase the circumference of the lotion distribution. 2, going to the doctor before it's too late. I am a doctor and seriously, the wives are always dragging them in there. That was my mom with my dad. He got sick, wasn't eating enough, didn't want to go to the doctor, collapsed in the kitchen and then she had to call 911. Turned out to be sepsis and he almost passed. Married men live like five years longer than unmarried men or something like that because of their wives forcing them to be seen. 3. Squat in the shower and reach under my dude. Pro tip, use hair conditioner when shaving any body part that isn't your face. It's much better than shaving foam but does make things slipper. So be careful. Also, if you shave your butt, prepare for an unholy swamp butt. I refuse to shave my butt anymore because The grow back is horrific. Four, my husband never really did pedicures before we met and the first time I did one for him, he was in love with it. I used a scraper to get the dead skin off his heels. He calls them hooves. Haha. And he was horrified at how much came off. He'll even inspect my work now and say this toenail is a little jagged. Do want me to look a messy? He likes being pampered. I'm happy to do it for him. 5. I was trying on jeans for work the other day and I found this magical material that stretches but looks like denim. I was gushing over them and my wife laughed and said a lot of women's jeans use that material and a lot of hers are the same. Men should discover these jeans. 6. A man started carrying a satchel years ago and never looked back. I mean, Indiana Jones has one. I'm a new man. Breath stinky. Boom. Here's some gum. Headache, boom. Here's a pill. Phone dead. Boom. Here's a charger. My little bag carries so much and has saved me so many times. 7. Separate shampoo, conditioner and body wash. 8, making an effort to make their home smell nice. The way you clean, taking a shower does not actually clean your shower. Washing your bedding with more frequency, buy a few candles, etc. You will feel more relaxed at home. And clean sheets are better for Your skin and health. 9, buying clothes when they should be replaced. I see so many men with holes in their socks and shirts with stretched collars. Please just get new ones instead of putting it off. Lol. 10. Prior girlfriends and now my wife have said I should sand my feet. Calluses off his office office. I'm in work boots all day and they get dried, crack and bleed. Now I have this cheese grater thing that I use occasionally and rub lotion on my feet a few times a week. I'm happy to no longer bleed from my feet as it is quite painful to work with open sores on my feet. I do miss having Spider Man feet that had these little Velcro like hooks on them that I'd rub on her legs to annoy her while in bed. I could attach to the sheets and move them with the bottom of my feet. Hey, 11 p. Sitting down.

He was always showing up in places she would be or randomly showing up at her house with no good intentions. She asked me not to get involved, so I respected her wishes for a while. he tried to break into her home one night while everyone was asleep. He got caught, made a run for it and keyed her car on the way out. Shortly after it happened, I was informed by a witness to the events. The witness expressed to me that at that time they were scared because they knew the ex boyfriend had been physically aggressive in the past and had recently tried to do it again as well. My girlfriend called me that night also but told me it was okay now and not to worry. For the next week, I staked out her house at night in case he tried again. I also found out where he lived and hung out and his routes to such places. I observed him and tracked his schedule. I waited for him to try something again and he came back to try and break in. Added security measures prevented him and after trying other ways, he left. He rode his bike down an isolated dirt path every morning as a shortcut to work. I waited and when I saw him, I blocked off his path with my vehicle. I did what? Had to be done and destroyed his bike. I told him if he even came near her again, even by accident, he wasn't going to walk away from it. An empty threat. I would have just roughed him up more at best. I also told him I recorded him trying to break into her house and damaging her property. I also read out to him in explicit detail his schedule and routines. I told him if I even thought he was sniffing around her again, I would find him. We never heard or saw from him again. We have been together for nearly 2 decades now. Very happy, successful and much so in love still. I swear I'm not a psycho, lol. I'm not possessive or an aggressive person. Everyone calls me a big teddy bear or a big softie. I grew up in a home with that kind of behavior and have zero tolerance for any of it. 2. Every time we go into a restaurant or place of business, I make sure to identify all the exit points in case something bad were to happen. Also never have my back to the doors. 3. I pretend to be asleep when he wakes up because I love how sweetly he wakes me up. 4. That I knew he was planning to propose to me, but I still acted surprised. We've been married 14 years now, but I still haven't told him. He is so proud of the idea that He managed to surprise me. 5. That I know their Reddit account. 6. That her mom called for her the moment before she passed when her mom was passing. She was in the room with her for almost 24 hours straight and left for 30 seconds and I was there in those 30 seconds. Her mother passed, but not before calling for my wife. I don't know if it will haunt her or not, but I just don't think it's something she needs to know. 7. He does not know that he was my teenage crush since I was 12 and I wrote so many beautiful poems about him. We have been married for six years and have a child together. I don't know if I will ever have the courage to tell him that I have always loved him. Eight. 8. That I have a folder of photos on my computer called Places I Have Found My Wife's Shoes that is legitimately filled with thousands of pictures of my wife, shoes that are neither in the closet or shoe rack. 9. That she's my partner. We rent together, go on dates, laugh together, cook together, eat together, and talk about each other's day every evening. But she doesn't want a relationship right now. Before anyone says anything, I know how it sounds. And I'm slowly making my way out of the situation. 10. Out of grocery shop efficiently. I can't stand going into the grocery store with her. She. Makes a list and then follows the list order through the store, back and forth. She visits the same aisle three to four times.

One, maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn't care to have my peers know what I was up to, so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues. At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, are you taking this call on a cell phone? I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I, I'd be happy to continue it the next day when I'd be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point, but did agree with the second. To this day, I wonder what in the world he was talking about and where he Was coming from. Two, at my wedding, we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian at my wedding sister in law who hates me fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the heck are they supposed to know it's vegetarian? Guess she wanted to be able to ask so then everybody knows they're vegetarian. Lol. Three. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the fire marshal because he was talking about something being flame retardant. Her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word. It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her, but instead I just stood off to the side making a surprise Pikachu face. 4, this guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume. Some girl was yelling at him for being so offensive toward those who didn't eat bacon for various reasons. Mind you, she ate pork. One of the guys who didn't eat bacon at the party asked her what the heck she was talking about, but she didn't back down. Lol. I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be inaccurately offended on behalf of other people. 5. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt. She thought I was commenting. On her ability to drive. The same thing happened to me when inside a taxi. He asked, do you wear your seatbelt when you're with your dad? I said yes. 6. My seven month old was wearing a shirt that had a rocket ship and the NASA logo. And some middle aged woman in the shop said he shouldn't be wearing that because he's clearly not an astronaut. I was dumbfounded. 7, at school, someone didn't have a calculator and asked if anyone had one they could borrow. Someone offered them a pink calculator and they refused saying that they were offended. They try and give them something less masculine. Clearly they didn't need a calculator that badly if they're just gonna whine about the color. 8, I'm a nurse at a children's hospital. I was wearing Mickey Mouse Halloween scrubs which have little dancing skeletons on it. A visitor for one of my patients complained that I was wearing scary and inappropriate scrubs. Nine, people get very offended that I don't like being touched. And this happened just last week. I work at a bank in an affluent part of Atlanta and a woman called in to let us know she was offended by the security questions for her online banking. The security question she set up herself. 11, wearing a mask in public.

One, I used to be a manager for a Disney store. We had a regular old man come in with his wife regularly. Super cute couple. I mean, matching outfits, holding hands, just cute as could be. We used to sell these huge stuffed animals, like ginormous. The couple came in about once a week and would just walk around, laugh and smile things here and there. One night he came in on his own and bought one of these gigantic Mickeys we had. It was $300, I think. He was so excited. He told us all about how he was going to take her out to dinner and it would be sitting there on the bed to surprise her when they got home. Anyway, two days later, he walked back in carrying the gigantic Mickey Mouse plush to return it. He had bought it to surprise her for her 75th birthday. She passed away in her sleep the day before her birthday. Thanked us and said goodbye and that he would not be coming back because our store reminded him too much of his wife. We found out he passed away a week later. It was just seven days from the day his wife passed. We found out all the details because one of our employees went to the same church they attended to. Customers regularly come in with large amounts of baby supplies, returns they get The wrong gender items or duplicates. An older woman came in with a cart load so I asked about the new baby. She slowly and through tears explained that her only child and grandbaby didn't make it during childbirth. 3. Not a return, but I worked in a jewelry store and the saddest sale we ever had was a labor. The guy had this ring on labor for 12 months but passed in a car accident. His parents came in and picked up the ring so his girlfriend could keep it. I don't think she had any idea he was going to propose. 4, I work at a store in a college town and one night some younger guy was returning a keg barrel only was still half full. I jokingly asked the guy if it was a trash party or something along those lines and he responded with, yeah, it was a party for one of our friends who passed the day of the party. Five, I was working at a large pet store in the tropical fish department. One busy weekend a very well dressed, rather snobby woman came in and bought six baby angel fish, each about the size of a dime plus the fins. The store I worked in was inside a huge high end shopping mall. So we had a holding service where we would bag up fish, cash the customer out and float the fish in their bags in a warm tank until the Customer was finished all their shopping and was ready to leave for home. As a matter of course, I offered to hold this lady's baby angel fish. She said she was all good and left. Four or five hours later, she stormed back into the store demanding a manager and a refund. She was shaking the bag in our faces for emphasis, yelling that her gorgeous angels were all deceased. On close inspection, we discovered that the silly woman had put the poor fish in her car, presumably so she didn't need to carry them while she shopped for other things or returned to the store to pick them up. Unfortunately, because it was January and the temperature outside was extremely cold, the tiny babies had frozen. 6. A guy was returning baby formula and he was looking pretty down. I asked him how his day was and he said that he has been having a long day and that he's been having a long month too. I thought he just had a baby, so maybe he just got the wrong formula. I asked if he just had a baby and he said he used to have a baby. I told him I was sorry and he said it was okay. There were a few minutes of silence and he said he was a fun little guy, seen a lot of things, but that one broke my heart.

And kicking them out when they insisted. My husband Tyler, had been working 18 hour days for three weeks straight. Some department at his company completely screwed up and cost them $50 million. So his team had to fix everything. I'm talking coming home at two in the morning, eating cold leftovers, showering and passing out. Some nights I'd find him literally sleeping face first in his dinner plate or passed out on the bathroom floor with the shower still running. Two nights ago, he finally stumbled through the door around midnight with this huge grin on his exhausted face. We did it, he said. Boss gave us the rest of the week off. He ate some leftover pizza, took the world's quickest shower and was snoring before his head hit the pillow. Next morning around 9, I made breakfast but let him sleep. Poor guy looked like a zombie for weeks. Around noon, my parents showed up unannounced. I'm six months pregnant, so they visit sometimes to check on me. We're sitting there having coffee when my mom asks where Tyler is. Since his truck's in the driveway, he's still sleeping, I said. My mom's face went all pinched. It's past noon. That's unacceptable with a pregnant wife. Wake him up. I explained the whole situation. Three weeks of hell. Fifty million dollar crisis. Barely any sleep. My dad just shook his head like Tyler was some lazy bum. I'm not waking him up, I said. He needs to rest. Well, if you won't do it, I will, my mom said, standing up and heading for the stairs. I jumped up and blocked her path. If you can't respect my husband getting proper sleep after three weeks of torture, then you need to leave our house now. Are you kicking us out?

And honestly, the few times I'd met him before, he seemed like a normal dude. Maybe a little too friendly, but nothing that set off major alarm bells. Two weeks ago, Taylor asked if Ethan could come hang out at my place for a few hours. She said he was bringing pizza and beer, and since my parents were visiting my aunt for the weekend, I figured, why not? My little sister Mia is 15, and she was just gonna stay upstairs doing homework anyway. So they showed up around 7. Ethan had this huge grin and two cases of beer. We started drinking and playing video games, just chilling on the couch. Everything was normal for, like, an hour. Taylor was curled up next to me. Ethan was cracking jokes about the game, and I was thinking, this was actually pretty fun. Then Ethan said he needed to use the bathroom. I pointed down the hall to the one on the first floor. Taylor and I kept playing, and I didn't even notice how long he'd been gone until we heard yelling upstairs. My blood went cold. Mia never yells. We both jumped up and ran upstairs, and I found My sister standing in her doorway crying, like full on sobbing. Ethan was right there in the hallway looking all flustered and red in the face. I immediately asked Mia what happened and she could barely get the words out between sobs. She said Ethan had walked into her room even though her door was only cracked open a little. She thought maybe he was lost looking for the bathroom, so she tried to be polite and tell him it was downstairs.

Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live. Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine.

Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen.

My son Leo just started walking the four blocks to school by himself. He's eight. I'm a nervous wreck, of course, so I did what any normal, tech savvy, slightly too anxious parent would do. I have this tiny little drone the size of a Robin. Every morning, I'd fly it up just high enough to keep an eye on his little blue backpack until he was safely at the school gate. It was my secret, my little piece of mind. This worked perfectly for two weeks. Then I get a knock on my door. It's my new neighbor, Carol. She moved in a month ago and immediately put up about six security cameras, all pointed outwards at the street. She's holding a clipboard and has a very serious look on her face. Says, I've been documenting your surveillance activities. You've been operating a drone every morning at 8:00am? It's a clear violation of privacy. You're stalking the children. I tried to explain I'm not stalking anyone. I'm just watching my son walk to school. She wasn't having it. She said she'd already reported me to the neighborhood watch and was considering calling the police for unlicensed aerial surveillance. The next day, I see her outside with binoculars watching my house. The day after that, a letter from the homeowners association is taped to my door. A formal complaint. My stalking drone was causing distress to the community. This was Ridiculous. My little peace of mind project had turned into a. A neighborhood incident. But calling the police for watching my own kid? So I decided to give her something real to watch. The complaint was about the drone, not about why I was flying it. The letter said I couldn't fly it over other people's property. It said nothing about my own.

My good suit was on a hanger in the back. Of course, halfway to the city, the truck's engine starts smoking. I pull over and the thing just dies. Cell service was spotty, and the only Uber that would even consider the pickup was an hour away, so I started walking. Three miles later, in the humid morning sun, my dress shirt was soaked. I I tried to cut through a small patch of woods to save time, snag my slacks on a branch, leaving a nice tear down the shin. A passing car splashed muddy water all over my pants. By the time I finally saw the courthouse, I looked like I've been sleeping in a ditch. I was just tired, sweaty, and wanted to get to my new office. I walk up the main steps, and a security guard, a guy with a thick neck and a bigger ego, steps in front of me, blocking the door. Whoa, hold on there, buddy. You can't come in here. I tried to smile. It's alright, officer. I work here. He looked me up and down, a smirk playing on his lips. Work Here. Doing what? We don't have any janitor positions open right now. I felt a flash of anger, but I kept my cool. I just need to get to the judge's chambers. That made him laugh. A full, deep laugh. The judge's chambers. Sir, this isn't a shelter. You need to leave the premises now. He put a heavy hand on my chest and started pushing me backward. I'm telling you, I'm the new. He cut me off. You're the new guy who's about to be arrested for trespassing if you don't get off.

I'm 34 and my wife's parents still think I'm just some dirty construction worker. her father cornered me at dinner while my wife was in the bathroom. He pressed $500 into my hand and said, A real man should be able to provide for his wife without help. My wife grew up with money and I grew up in a trailer park. Her parents never let me forget where I came from. We lived across the country from them and only visited twice a year. But those visits were torture. Last week was their anniversary party. 5 hundred guests in a massive ballroom. At the entrance, her mother looked at my suit and sighed. They have a spare jacket and coat check if you need one. It was a thousand dollar suit. During cocktail hour, her mother grabbed my arm. Come meet the Johnsons. She introduced everyone else by their careers. This is Doctor Johnson, Professor Williams, then me. This is our daughter's husband. He does manual labor. Her friend Patricia asked what kind of work I did. Before I could answer, her mother said, small jobs, fixing toilets, that sort of thing. Patricia made a sympathetic face and changed the subject. Her father pulled me aside next. Your truck is parked out front. The valley lot is for luxury vehicles only. Maybe move it to the street. I drove a 70,000 dollar truck. He assumed It was worthless because it had dirt on it. Then he showed me his phone. Look at this article about successful people under 40. This man built an empire from nothing. Maybe it'll inspire you to aim higher. The article was about me. My photo was just blurry enough that he didn't recognize. At dinner, they seated us at table 19 by the kitchen doors. Her parents table was at the front with a spotlight on it. Her father stood up to give a toast. He thanked everyone for coming. Mentioned his successful children, their careers, their achievements. Got to my wife, he said, and our youngest daughter, who were still hoping will find happiness. He looked directly at me when he said it. After his toast, her parents cornered us by the bathrooms. Her mother had a folder with job applications she'd already filled out. Garbage collection, city benefits. 30,000 a year. It's honest work. My phone started buzzing. 20 calls, then 40. Emergency at the waterfront project. We've arranged an interview, her father announced. Tomorrow morning, nine sharp. My

I had burns from a kitchen accident across my left cheek and jaw, and my brother Brian had turned them into his favorite punchline. Every time we argued, it ended the same way, with him saying, at least I'll have someone at my wedding besides our parents. No girl will even look at you for more than a second. Hurt me every single time. But my parents had taught me to learn how to live with the insults. Then, when I was 20, something shifted. I was working at the bookstore near campus when a woman asked about a photography book. She was so beautiful and perfect that I forgot to turn my scarred side away. But surprisingly enough, she didn't look disgusted or turned off. We talked for an hour straight about art and composition. Before leaving, she handed me her card that said she was a model doing a local shoot. I'm Adrian, she said. Coffee tomorrow? That's when everything changed. I started seeing Adrian in secret. Every weekend she wasn't traveling for shoots, we'd meet at quiet cafes, go hiking where no one knew us, cook dinner at my apartment. She asked why I never introduced her to my family. I told her about Brian, about the comments, about how I wasn't ready for him to poison this, too. She understood. For three years, we built our relationship away from everyone. Meanwhile, Brian was busy dating Jessica, this girl from his finance firm. He constantly brag about how sophisticated she was, how she'd studied abroad in Paris. He'd make snide comments like, people like you, people with scars are just meant to be alone, bro. It's actually noble living for other things besides romance. Made it worse was our parents seemed to buy into it, too. They'd stopped asking if I was seeing anyone, stopped mentioning their friends, daughters. It was like they'd accepted Brian's version of my future. Jessica would come to family dinners and talk about her travels, her NBA program, while Brian would smirk at me across the table. Don't worry. When Jess and I have kids, you'll be the fun uncle. Every family needs one person who's totally devoted to their nieces and nephews since they don't have their own children.

The same man apparently showed up right after us and asked if his wife and kids had checked in yet. He asked for a key. And when he gave it to him, he was ready to walk into our room. However, the key he had was actually to a different room. And when he walked in, the police were waiting inside. This guy was actually a convicted stalker and was arrested on the spot.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class. He went to the hospital and his parents threatened to sue the school. The very next day, we watched our principal walk out for the last time and the banana guy returned wearing his costume.

When I found out what Smurf Day was when I was in college, everyone told me they were really jealous of me because of one of my teachers. But I didn't really get why. He was old and quiet and just seemed like a normal guy to me. I heard a few people call him Mr Smurf, which really confused me. But eventually one guy asked if I had seen Smurf Day yet. I had no idea what he was talking about and thought it was a joke. When I asked him what he meant, he just said, you'll see. Apparently this guy had a three year old daughter and a few years, years before she was diagnosed with a rare brain disease, she was bedridden in the hospital. And after he was done teaching, he would go sit with her every night. And since the Smurfs was her favorite show, he'd always watch it with her. Apparently it got worse and she didn't have much longer. Since he was a single dad, he had to keep teaching to pay for everything. He'd come to class completely broken. However, eventually some students found out about this and started a gofundme for him. They raised over $15,000 so he could take time off work. And because of them, he got to spend her last few days with her. And since then, every year he shows up like this on her. Birthday.

I promised my entire third grade class that if they all got A's on my test, I'd do whatever they wanted me to. Well, they all decided on me eating a live worm in front of the entire school, so I hesitantly agreed. That weekend, I was completely shocked to see that not only did my class all get A's, but almost all of them got 100%. All except one. This girl really struggled in my class, but I could see she really tried. So I changed her grade to an A and told them they won. I found the most real looking fake worm I could, and that day during an assembly, the school told everyone I had a presentation for them. I ate it in front of the entire elementary school and they all screamed and laughed. They all bought it. And that same girls to enjoy seeing me do that the most. She thought it was so funny. She burst out giggling every time she saw me. Whenever I'd walk by her, she'd say, you ate a worm! You ate a worm! And we'd laugh together. She said it one time during lunch, and shortly after, I noticed another teacher was crying. She asked me if I could take over lunch duty for the day because she couldn't stop herself from tearing up. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me it was Because of that girl had absolutely no idea. But she had been abused by many of her mom's boyfriends and was severely traumatized by it. They tried everything for years, but this was the first time she ever actually saw her smile and laugh. We both had to find someone else to supervise lunch because I didn't want them to see me crying either.

When my daughter was 5, she begged me to put up Christmas lights for an entire day. She was literally crying because I was leaving for a work trip the next day and she told me Santa wouldn't come if our house wasn't decorated. It was really icy and snowing that day, but my wife told me to just do it. So I told her fine. I got the ladder and climbed up and my daughter passed me the lights and the colors she wanted. Right before we were almost finished, the slipped out from underneath me. I fell and hit my head on the concrete hard and remember the sound of her screaming. I didn't wake up until I was in the hospital later that day and felt the worst pain in my neck and back. I tried to feel for the bandages on my head, but strangely I didn't feel anything. I was really confused but barely managed to sit up and noticed I couldn't move my legs. I looked up and saw a nurse walk in the room and she looked really surprised. Five more people came in and all started asking me questions. I was really worried because I still couldn't move my feet no matter how hard I tried. I didn't know what was going on until an hour later when my wife finally got there. I was so happy. To see and didn't think anything about her. In tears, I asked who the girl she was with was because she was also crying. And when she walked closer, I made the most shocking realization of my life. This 13 year old was my daughter. And they broke the news. I was in a coma for almost nine years. I realized I had missed her entire childhood. I was paralyzed. My wife had remarried. But what hurt the most was when I went home to our house and I looked up at our roof. I broke down because those lights were still up.

My sister Emma has always been the type to make everything about her. When I got engaged, she announced her pregnancy at the same dinner. When I picked my wedding venue, she suddenly decided she was getting married there too, just six months later. So when she showed up to my wedding wearing a floor length white lace dress that literally looked bridal, I wasn't even surprised. The dress had a train. Guy. Guys! A freaking train! She walked into the church like she was the one getting married, posing for photos and accepting congratulations from confused relatives who thought she might be the bride. My bridesmaids were whispering about it during the ceremony. My maid of honor kept shooting me these worried looks like she was waiting for me to have a meltdown. But honestly, I was weirdly calm. Maybe it was the pre wedding yoga. Or maybe I was just done being shocked by Emma's behaviour. The real kicker was during cocktail hour, Emma positioned herself right next to the gift table, greeting guests like she was co hosting the wedding. She kept saying things like, we're so happy you could celebrate with us today and this is such a special day for our family. The photographer actually asked her to step out of some shots because guests were getting confused about who the bride was. My new mother in law pulled Me aside and whispered, honey, is your sister okay? She seems to think this is her wedding, too. That's when I knew I had to do something. During dinner, I was walking around with a glass of red wine, thanking guests for coming. Emma was holding court at table 6, showing off her dress to my college friends and talking about how she inspired my wedding aesthetic. She kept standing up and twirling, making the white lace swirl around her. As I approached her table, Emma jumped up again for another dramatic pose. She spun around right into my path, and I swear time slowed down. The wine glass in my hand tilted, and suddenly her pristine white dress had a giant crimson stain spreading across the front. Oh, my god, I'm so sorry! I gasped, grabbing napkins from the table. But inside, I was doing cartwheels. The stain looked like abstract art, completely ruining the bridal illusion she'd been working so hard to maintain. Emma's face went through about five different emotions in three seconds. Anger, embarrassment, then this weird, forced smile as she realized everyone was staring. It's fine, she said through gritted teeth. Accidents happen. My cousin Jake, who's always been savage, piped up from across the table, well, at least now everyone knows who the real bride is. The whole table went quiet. Then my college roommate started snorting with laughter. Emma excused herself to go clean up, but the damage was done. The wine had Soaked through the fabric and wasn't coming out with just water and soap. She came back 20 minutes later, wearing my backup emergency cardigan over the stained dress, looking absolutely miserable. The best part? My photographer caught the whole thing. There's this perfect shot of the wine hitting her dress, with my face in the background, looking shocked, but with this tiny smile that only I can see. It's hanging in our hallway now. For the rest of the reception, Emma sat quietly at her table, no longer commanding attention or posing for photos. She left early, claiming she had a headache. My wedding suddenly felt lighter, like someone had lifted a dark cloud.

I was 13 when my classmate Olivia invited me over for dinner. Our moms worked at the same office and Olivia's mom thought it would be nice for us to hang out. I barely knew Olivia. She was one of those kids who acted friendly but always seemed to think she was better than everyone else. My mom made me go anyway, saying it would be good for me to make new friends. I showed up right on time wearing my nicest dress and carrying a small box of chocolates my mom had picked out as a thank you gift. When I knocked on the door, Olivia's mom opened it and barely glanced at me before snatching the chocolates and tossing them on the kitchen counter like they were garbage. No thank you, no smile, nothing. The house smelled weird, like old food mixed with cleaning supplies. Olivia was sprawled on the couch scrolling through her phone and didn't even look up when I walked in. Her dad was watching TV in his underwear and a stained shirt. I stood there awkwardly for 10 minutes before Olivia's mom finally told us to sit at the dinner table. That's when things got really strange. Olivia's mom came out carrying only three plates. She set one down in front of me and I looked down at what was supposed to be my dinner. There was some grayish Meat that looked like it had been reheated multiple times, mushy green peas that were practically liquid, and two rock hard biscuits that could have been used as weapons. Olivia got her plate next and immediately made a disgusted face. She looked at her mom and said, didn't we give this exact same food to Pepper yesterday? Pepper was their golden retriever who is currently sleeping under the table. Olivia's mom just shrugged and said, we had leftovers. I wasn't going to let perfectly good food go to waste. I sat there staring at my plate trying to figure out if I was really being served dog food. Meanwhile, Olivia and her mom had completely different meals, fresh chicken breast with rice and steamed vegetables that actually looked edible. I politely asked if there had been some kind of mistake with my plate. Olivia's mom rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out of her head. Oh, honey, if you're going to be picky about what we're offering you, then you can just sit there and go hungry. We don't run a restaurant here. Olivia started giggling like this was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. I felt my face turn bright red with embarrassment. I tried to take a small bite of the meat just to be polite, but it tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for a week. Texture was rubbery and it had this sour aftertaste that made me gag. I Quickly put my fork down and asked if I could use their phone to call my mom. Olivia's mom gave me this look like I was a piece of trash she'd found stuck to her shoe. What's wrong now? The food not fancy enough.

My parents never planned to have another kid after Abby. She was their perfect little girl. Smart as hell. Played piano like Mozart, made honor roll every semester. But when she got hit by that drunk driver at age 8, everything changed. Nine months later, boom, there I was. I grew up thinking I lived in a museum. A house. Abby's room stayed exactly how she left it. Her bed made perfectly, her soccer trophies lined up on the shelf. Even her stupid math homework still pinned to the bulletin board. Nobody was allowed in there, not even me. My parents acted like they were babysitting someone else's kid when I was around. They take maybe three photos of me a year. And that was being generous. My birthdays were these weird, quiet affairs where mom would make a cake and we'd all sit there eating it in silence. No friends, no parties, nothing. Every July, they'd pack their bags and disappear for a week to visit Abby's grave. They drop me off at Mrs. Henderson's house next door and act like I didn't exist. Mrs. Henderson was nice enough, but I always wondered why I couldn't come with them to see my own sister. When I turned 13, I finally asked dad about Abby during dinner. Big mistake. His fork hit the plate so hard, I thought it cracked. She was perfect. He snapped, not even looking. At me, you don't get to ask about her. Mom just stared at her food like it was the most interesting thing in the world. That's when it hit me. I wasn't their son. I was their do over. Their second chance at getting what they really wanted. High school was brutal. I'd watch other kids complain about their parents being too involved, too loud at games, too embarrassing. Meanwhile, mine forgot to show up to my graduation. They said they had to work late, but I saw Dad's car in the driveway when I got home. That's when I started writing letters to Abby. Not because I believed in ghosts or anything, but because I needed to understand what made her so damn special that my parents couldn't love anyone else. Dear Abby, I wrote one night, I know you were awesome and everything, but I'm tired of living in your shadow. They wish you never died, and they wish I was never born. But here I am anyway. I left that letter taped to the attic door where they kept all her stuff. I figured if they wanted to worship their dead daughter so much, they might as well read what their living son had to say. The next morning, I found a dusty photo album slid under my bedroom door. No note, no explanation. Just this old book filled with baby pictures. My baby pictures. Pictures I'd never seen before. Most of them had me alone in The frame, but a few had mom holding me

Your family canceled your invitation, but asked to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid. I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list. Just entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously, they also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding videography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me. Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling On her end, um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings, LLC, right? What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services. Also owned by longer pot. Sunset Holdings, LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos. Elite Moment Studio. Oh, my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's. That's you, too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests. All owned by Sunset Holdings, LLC. Which is my company. Renee's Voice went up an octave. Mr. Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months, I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs, so my family wouldn't know their disappointment. Son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school seven years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it.

See, my brother Dylan has always been the golden child, NBA from Wharton, six figure salary at 25, the perfect corporate success story. Meanwhile, I'm 31 with a psychology degree that my family constantly mocked as expensive feelings training. Growing up, every family gathering was the Dylan Appreciation Hour. His promotions, his bonuses, his networking events. When I tried to share anything about my therapy practice, dad would literally roll his eyes. Paige is still playing therapist with crazy. People say dismissively Dylan's actually contributing to society. My psychology degree cost $120,000. They assumed it was wasted money. Instead, I've been building something they never bothered to understand. I opened my own trauma therapy practice specializing in executive burnout and addiction. I charge $300 per session and I'm booked solid for six months out. My waiting list includes CEOs and several of Dylan's former colleagues who burned out from the same toxic work culture. The day they called, I was reviewing treatment plans for three Fortune 500 executives who'd crash and burned like Dylan was about to. He's been using cocaine daily for months. Mom sobbed into the phone. Lost his job last week, won't leave his apartment. The only person he's mentioned wanting to talk to is you. I knew this was Coming my business partner, Doctor Bennett, had warned me. I saw Dylan at that corporate networking event downtown. He was visibly high, completely manic. That industry chews people up and sits them out. I tried to hint to my parents that Dylan's lifestyle wasn't sustainable, but they brushed me off. You're just jealous of his success. Mom had snapped. Three hours after their call, dad showed up at my office unannounced. He looked around my professional waiting room, took in the diplomas on my walls, the high end furnishings. Paige, Dad said quietly, we had no idea your practice was this successful. I looked up from my client notes. What can I do for you, dad? We need you to help Dylan. He's refusing treatment, won't see any therapist, but he keeps asking for you specifically. I leaned back in my chair surrounded by my psychology credentials that they'd mocked for years. Dad, I specialize in executive addiction and trauma. My rate is $300 per session for family. It's still $300 per session. That's not the point, Paige. He's your brother. You have to help him. Actually, dad, I don't have to do anything. Just like you didn't have to support my career choice. Remember, mom joined the conversation. Paige, please. He won't get better without professional help and you're the only therapist he trusts. I smiled, checking my appointment calendar that was completely full. You know what's interesting, Last Thanksgiving you told everyone I was wasting my education on Damaged people said I never have real success like Dylan because I chose feelings over finance. I was wrong. I'm sorry, but Dylan could die if he doesn't get help. Dylan cleared his throat from the doorway. He looked terrible, gaunt, shaking, probably hasn't slept in days. Paige, I know. I never respected what you do. I always thought my work was more important.

I stopped asking how her day was, not out of spite, but because I realized I didn't actually care to hear the same rehearsed complaints. I wanted to see what would happen if I let conversations die instead of always keeping them going. At first she didn't notice, but as days passed, I saw it sinking in. She throw out comments like, you've been quiet lately, or everything okay, but I just shrugged them off. Then something strange happened. She started trying, bringing me coffee when I was working late, suggesting we watch movies together. But instead of jumping at these scraps of attention, I let her efforts hang in the air, unacknowledged. I needed to see if it was real or just another way to smooth things over. One night, she asked directly, are you mad at me? Her voice was quieter than usual. I looked at her and said, the one thing I've been holding back. I'm just done trying harder than you. The words hit her like a slap. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I had the upper hand. Not because I'd won some argument, but because I'd finally stopped apologizing for wanting more than she was willing to give. The next morning brought text messages. We need to talk. I ignored them. When I got home, she was pacing, ready with a rehearsed speech. What do you want? I asked, dropping my keys on the counter. You're acting like a stranger in our own house, she said. I'm just following your lead, sweetheart. You made it pretty clear what this marriage is and what it isn't. She turn defensive. I'm allowed to set boundaries. If you can't handle that, maybe that's your problem. You're right, I said calmly. You don't owe me intimacy. But let me ask you this. Do I owe you commitment? Do I owe you loyalty? Do I owe you anything beyond basic civility? Her eyes widen. I saw fear crack through her expression. Because if we're playing by those rules, maybe I don't owe you date nights, emotional support, or even coming home at the end of the

She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability.

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice, and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under six. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts passive aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of her. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava and a tutu with one sock, and baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. They'd literally just dumped them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason, straight to voicemail, texted Amber. Nothing. They turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel my Life for their convenience. This was their master plan. Force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childfree. Most people would stay home and complain. Not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing anyway. Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said, you're absolutely insane, then helped me strap Liam into a life vest. Like this. Think she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen songs at every passing kayaker like she was performing at Carnegie Hall. Liam tried catching fish with his bare hands and nearly looked out of his tube twice. Jackson actually calmed down once we got moving. The motion and fresh air put him right to sleep. Other river goers stared at our bizarre parade. A guy in a canoe asked if they were all mine. No, I said cheerfully. Just the world's most reluctant babysitter taking revenge on manipulative relatives. After tubing, we hit this dog friendly taco truck lot near Clara's Ice. She brought her rescue Mutt, Peaches, who immediately became the fourth child. Kids went absolutely wild over the picnic tables and dogs running around. We got them quesadillas with mild cheese and churros, which ended up mostly decorating Ava's face and hair. Jackson passed out in his stroller. Clutching half a churro like a trophy. I documented everything on Instagram. Photos of the kids laughing in tubes covered in churros, playing with dog dogs looking absolutely delighted. I captioned it in prompt to adventure babysitting. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected moments. Thanks for the practice run. By the time we got home, all three were exhausted but genuinely happy. They fell asleep within minutes. Ava on my couch with glitter still sparkling on her forehead. Liam snoring with one shoe mysteriously missing. Jackson sleeping like

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text at 7:00am, could you Drop off my work laptop. Sure, I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday, can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else. Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't Admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie, Marissa, had been extra friendly all night, kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted, what was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend and I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week 3, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd.

I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. Entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything and she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in real time. Then as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

When the police arrived, it appeared that it had been a robbery. So they were looking at it from that angle. But after over a two year long investigation, the police found out what they believed happened. This is Kayvon Warren, the father of the child who is now in jail. The police found out that kayvon tried to get India to terminate the pregnancy, which she did not do. They also found out that he was cheating and he was going through a serious financial hardship, which you can't tell by looking at his page. The night before he took India's life, him and Robert Irvin and Lamar Suggs were in a group chat where they discussed what they were going to do.

But after she passed away, he Tried to play the role of the grieving partner, things like this. He posted this 15 days after he allegedly took her life. Baby, I'm hurting bad off this one. I love you all. Just this year, he posted this, my Valentine forever. And he made many other posts about her like he had nothing to do with it. She was supposed to meet her baby that day. So not only was that robbed from her, but everything from that child was taken, too. For what? I will keep you guys updated on what ends up happening to them. I just don't understand how you can even get two more people to be willing to help you do this. The fact that kayvon would even consider doing it is crazy. But to find two other people who are willing to do this with you is unbelievable. I'm so sorry for her family.

My brother Bruce literally brought an inflatable unicorn pool float to our family beach reunion for me to use because he thought I was still terrified of water. After nearly dying in a neighbour's pool at age five, I was constantly terrified of drowning. And since then, every family vacation involved my parents bribing me to put my toes in the water while my three older brothers surfed. Even now, Bruce brings up how I wore a life jacket in the hotel hot tub until I was 16. The teasing got to be too much for me and so I've kept my distance from my family for all but holidays and birthdays for the past few years.

During breakfast, my aunt presented me with children's arm floaties she bought as a joke. Just in case a big wave comes, she said. While everyone took photos, Bruce grabbed them and tried shoving them on my arms. Safety first for our little scaredy cat, he announced to relatives filming on their at the beach.

She's terrified of anything deeper than a puddle, my mom explained, while my aunt added, we used to blow dry her tears after bath time, because even those had too much water. An hour later, Bruce decided to show off some girl he'd met. He stood on his board, shouting, watch this! Unlike my sister, I'm not scared of water. Before paddling out further than everyone else, I watched him drift left with the current. Red flags were stiff in the wind, but nobody noticed. Then he threw his arm.

I'm 32 and my girlfriend's parents still think I'm pouring cheap beer at some dive bar. Last week her mother cornered me in their kitchen while my girlfriend was upstairs. She pressed $300 in my hand and whispered for gas money. I know those tips can't be much. My girlfriend comes from old money and I started working at 14. Her parents never miss a chance to remind me where I belong. We've been together two years, but every family dinner felt like a job interview. I was failing.

This is Doctor Morrison and Judge Williams. Then me. This is my daughter's boyfriend. He works in the service industry. Her Aunt Patricia asked what exactly I did. Before I could speak, her mother said, he pours drinks beer, mostly downtown somewhere. Patricia touched my arm sympathetically and asked about my career goals. Her father intercepted me by the bar. You parked in the member lot. Staff and vendors use the back entrance. The guard mentioned your car doesn't have a member sticker. I drove a hundred thousand dollar Mercedes. He assumed I'd stolen the spot. Then he pulled up his phone. There's a management training program at this restaurant chain. Six week course. I know the regional director. He showed me the application. Thirty five thousand to start, but it's steady. At dinner, they put us at table 23, near the service station. Her parents sat at the head table under a chandelier. Her father gave his retirement speech. He thanked his colleagues, praised his children's accomplishments. When he mentioned my girlfriend, he said, still waiting for her to find someone worthy of the family name. He stared at me while the room chuckled. After dessert, her parents ambushed us by the restrooms. Her mother had printed emails from her friend's husband. He owns several franchises. Fast food. But management track. 40,000 to start. My phone exploded with notifications.

You know what M stands for? Massive. But wait. And if that wasn't enough, low taper fade has 12 letters. Now add that up. 13 + 12 = 25. What year are we in? The big 25?

Like, bro, it's second period, you're gonna smell like wet donkey balls all day. And the gym teachers don't help. They're like, give me your best effort, sir. This is not the Olympics. It's Wednesday, 9:30 a. M. And we're playing kickball. Nobody should be breathing that hard before lunch. Then you see kids acting like dodgeball decides their whole future, sliding on the floor, dripping sweat, shirts sticking to them like duct tape. All of this just to go sit in science class leaking onto the desk. And now the whole row smells cooked. You're stuck breathing in wet donkey balls in class because someone thought he was LeBron James at 9:00am. Hard to focus on the math problems in front of me when there's a stench like that behind me. The air is actually unlivable. Every class after feels like punishment. Follow for more rants.

My wife Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked, because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is. Is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I know Miss Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put On this red dress I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner, she pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. All's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How is Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. I kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car Broke down out of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. Forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing. Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach. What about them? I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party, made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind She was. Paul forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop! I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff. But then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. Next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. She started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know exist. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secretaries, bookmark folders labeled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own, reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic, how to look expensive, feminine energy. She that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. She started using therapy be to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops, emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd learn these words somewhere and weaponize them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward 8th graders and high schoolers who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. She was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids at Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history. Created fake contact names. Emma Mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult, hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she'd insert herself into adult conversations about work, drama and relationships, bringing advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences she didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16. Not 11. With a whole fabric in a backstory about being held back. Started lying about everything. Library visits that were really mall, trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist, sleepovers at houses I never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music blasting to cover phone conversations. He stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare. One word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow, taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an 11 year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched Father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, PTA volunteer, my neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth five more minutes like I was embarrassing her that night. I waited until she was.

I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said these would be perfect for my birthday, I just said cool and kept folding laundry. When he asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, clearly expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe. Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday, he said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I've been a complete idiot. Yeah, I said, you have been. The next morning I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favourite breakfast and had a jewellery box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch, her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious. That night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she would texting, you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her. And when we went to dinner that night, She asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. Made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot! I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven PM, Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down, her face, shaking
