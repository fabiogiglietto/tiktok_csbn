Ten years ago, Lisa was working for a real estate company when her boss offered her a unique deal. She could live in one of the company owned homes for free as long as she remained employed there. Lisa chose a three bedroom house and moved in. She assumed a formal lease would come later, but everything changed when her boss was sent to prison for mortgage fraud and the company collapsed. Still, Lisa stayed in the house and no one followed up. Unaware the home was occupied, the city listed it for auction. Lisa tried to buy it at a low price multiple times, but each auction was mysteriously canceled. Recently, a company from Singapore finally purchased the property. The surprising twist the new owner told CBS This Morning they want Lisa to stay. After discovering the roof had started leaking, the company offered to fix it and work out a formal lease agreement. This time, however, rent will be due, but at least Lisa gets to stay and start a new chapter legally.

The tips they received were the only thing keeping them afloat. Her father, Ali, had a younger brother, a renowned violin virtuoso, but the two had long cut ties. Girl's name was Oslan. Ali had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, so he wanted to spend his final days passing his craft on to her. The next day, Ali went to see Mahir, but Mahir greeted him with nothing but cold distance. Mahir still couldn't let go of the day Ali abandoned him, leaving him alone on that ship. But Ali still made his plea, hoping Mahir would take care of Oslan. Mahir rejected him outright. Ali wasn't afraid of dying. He was afraid of leaving Oslan with no one back home. Mahir couldn't shake the past. He wanted no part of those old wounds. One night, Ali began coughing violently. Everyone feared the worst. Seeing Oslan cry tore Ali apart. Just 8 years old, Oslan became an orphan. She poured her grief into music, playing one last piece for her father before Ali passed. He told her that as long as she played the violin, he would always be there listening. From then on, Oswald carried her violin everywhere. One day, Annie from the orphanage came to find her. Because Ali's friends had no legal right to raise her. She would be taken to the orphanage unless a direct relative adopted her. So Ali's friends Went to Mahir's home for help. They told him the news of Ali's death and asked him to handle the paperwork while they continued taking care of Oslan. But Mahir turned them away without hesitation. His wife Sunna accused him of being heartless. Mahir pulled out an old photo of him and his brother. Even though he resented Ali, his death still hit him hard. In the end, Mahir filed the paperwork. Ali's friends waited at the door for Oslan, grateful that Mahir had stepped in. But Annie suddenly informed Mahir that the orphanage would be doing random check ins to verify the child's living conditions, which meant for now, Mahir had to bring Oslan home. But Oslan refused to go inside. Sunna gently comforted her and Oslan finally felt a small sense of safety. That night, Oslan slept on the couch and Sunna even asked Mahir to keep his voice down. Late into the night, Oslan woke up and tried to sneak out, but the door alarm woke Mahir. BAK çocuk gel seninle bi anlaşma Yapalım Sen bana zorluk çıkarma Ben de seni evine en kısa sürede ulaştırmanın bi Yolunu Bulayım anlaştık mı two reached an agreement, but Oslan could only sleep if she held her father's violin. Sunna and Oslan quickly grew close. Then the lawyer called saying the orphanage had discovered the fake adoption. But Sunna insisted that the adoption was real. She dressed Oslan like a little princess and took her to the evening gala. It Was clear Suna already saw her as her own child. During the performance, Oslan playfully tapped a fork to the rhythm. And when Mahir finished his piece, I'll be slow time here, put a life shop there, her antics left him embarrassed. The lawyer congratulated Mahir on officially adopting Oslan, leaving him stunned. That night, Mahir and Suna argued, and his words cut deeply. Sunna had given up her dream of becoming a pianist to marry him, yet he treated her this way. She left in anger. The next morning, when Mahir headed out the door, he realized he still had to care for Oslan, so he took her with him to the theater. Oslan wanted to join the ensemble, but Mahir wouldn't allow it and sent her outside to play instead. He had no time for her now. Oslan eyed the snacks in a vending machine, but she didn't have any money until she came up with an idea. People adored her street performance, but a homeless man stole all the cash. Meanwhile, Mahir was searching for her everywhere. He finally stopped her in her tracks. Seeing how hungry she was, he cooked her some noodles. Though he wasn't much of a cook, Osland still missed Sunna's dishes. That night, Mahir tried composing, but he had no patience left. Looking at Sunna's photo, he finally understood how wrong he'd been. Yet he couldn't bring himself to call her. Seeing his brother's battered violin and Oslan asleep beside it, Mahir Felt something shift, a willingness to let her into his life. And he remembered Suna's words, there's more to cherish in this world than music alone.

Upon seeing this, the staff immediately activated the ultraviolet Protection measures as this was the only thing trolls feared. However, someone deliberately spilled coffee at that moment, causing the equipment to short circuit and the UV lights that had just turned on went dark as well. When the troll discovered his hands were bound by iron chains, a surge of rage instantly welled up inside him seeing the massive creature. The laboratory workers scattered in all directions, yet by then it was already too late to run. One unfortunate worker was just a second too slow and ended up being stomped into a pulp under the trolls foot. In the chaos, I let everyone out through the back door of the laboratory. Just as we reached the exit, we saw the troll squeezing out of the passage as well. With just a slight shake of its body, the troll destroyed the hydroelectric stations pipelines. Fortunately, the troll didn't continue its rampage. It simply turned and walked into the distant forest. Soon the troll arrived at a bar. It lifted off the roof and curiously surveyed the crowd inside. The foolish humans completely oblivious to the danger, all pulled out their phones to take pictures and show off. It wasn't until the troll reached out its massive palm toward the crowd that everyone finally realized something was Terribly wrong and began fleeing in every direction. But the troll, having starved for 2,000 years, had switched into buffet mode. He tossed one lucky soul right into his mouth. The troll's actions thoroughly alarmed the military. To eliminate this monster, soldiers activated the ultraviolet lighting devices on their aircraft. The instant the light hit it, burn marks appeared on the trolls body. Seeing that ultraviolet light was effective, the soldiers prepared to continue their attack. What they didn't expect, however, was that the troll grabbed a nearby utility pole and hurled it straight at the helicopter. Watching his comrades aircraft crash, the soldier was furious and prepared to charge directly at the troll. Fortunately, I stopped him in time, which allowed the soldier to calm down. The troll, meanwhile, flashed a mocking expression before swaggering away. Through these two experiences, I realized that humans alone could never defeat the troll. Only magic could defeat magic. I LED them to a mysterious cave in its deepest recesses. I gently tapped the ground with a stone as if it were some kind of signal. After waiting a moment, a violent rumbling sound came from deep within the cave and a colossal creature rapidly approached us. As it turned out, another troll lived here. To everyone's astonishment, I was able to communicate with it telepathically. Through this connection, I conveyed to the troll our purpose for coming. The next day, I stood before the troll that had been wreaking havoc everywhere and Fired a flare gun to attract its attention. Just as the troll approached me, the other troll hiding in the snow swiftly revealed itself.

But when the family discovered what was really happening inside that stable, they were so terrified that they immediately called the police. Cynthia, 24 years old, had always been passionate about animals. She spent more time in the stable than at home. She said her horse was her best friend and refused to sleep away from him. At first, her parents thought it was strange but harmless, until they began to notice disturbing changes in the young woman's behavior. She would spend hours in silence, staring fixedly at the animal. One night, her mother decided to follow her to the stable. What she saw made her heart race. Cynthia wasn't just next to the horse. There was something strange about the way she interacted with him. Unusual movements, whispers, and a closeness that seemed to hide much more than simple affection. Frightened, the family installed hidden cameras. And when they saw the footage, the impact was so great that they immediately called the police. Do you want to know what the recordings revealed?

He picked out two relatively smooth pieces, tied them to a long strip of cloth, and made a makeshift pair of sunglasses. He had been trapped in the mansion for several days. He planned to pry open the vent cover on the ceiling and escape. The falling cement dust was blocked by the sunglasses, which not only greatly improved his work efficiency, but also gave Jack hope of escaping. When he finally pried off a cement block from the ceiling, he discovered a hidden screw on the frame. Jack instinctively tried to unscrew it, but it wouldn't budge. He then hammered away the cement around the vent frame, only to find that there were 12 screws embedded inside. Clearly, these screws were used to secure the bulletproof glass. Suddenly, he saw a cleaner appear on the security monitor sitting outside the mansion taking a break. Jack saw a glimmer of hope in that moment, and without hesitation he grabbed a frying pan and began smashing the door, hoping to attract the cleaner's attention. But the door was made of steel with excellent soundproofing, and the cleaner was busy with a vacuum, so he didn't hear anything coming from inside. Jack quickly scribbled a distress note, hoping to slip it through the door gap, but the gap was too small to fit anything through. He could only watch helplessly as the cleaner left the elevator. Next, he used a metal Object to pry open a hidden room where he found food and steak. Just then, the sound of water spraying filled the house. Jack quickly dropped to the ground, drinking several mouthfuls of sweet, fresh water. Refreshed, he got back to work. He kicked off a stool leg and with a small knife carefully carved the shape of a screw, eventually making a makeshift wrench. His plan was to use this wrench to unscrew the bolts, but the next second, despair took over him.

Cada vez que hago el check in, debo esperar hasta que las puertas del ascensor se cierren completamente para luego sacar una tarjeta de habitación al azar, de manera que ni siquiera yo sé en qué habitación me voy a quedar. Precisamente por mi cautela, que nunca he tenido un accidente. Esa noche, mientras dormía, de repente me despertó una llamada. Era la recepción del hotel informándome que la cena había llegado. Respondí que se habían equivocado de número. Somnoliento, no le di mucha importancia sin saber que mis enemigos ya habían encontrado mi ubicación. 2 asesinos disfrazados de repartidores llegaron al hotel. Al encontrar mi habitación, sacaron inmediatamente sus cuchillos, entraron al cuarto y comenzaron a atacar la cama de manera frenética. Pero a su sorpresa, lo que estaban apuñalando eran unos almohadones. Al darse cuenta de que el plan se había descubierto, los 2 asesinos comenzaron a registrar la habitación por completo. Escucharon el sonido de gotas de agua proveniente del baño y pensaron que me había escondido allí, por lo que sacaron de nuevo sus cuchillos. En realidad yo estaba escondido en el techo, observando cada uno de sus movimientos, desmayé a una persona con un palo. Al ver que el plan había fracasado.

Cuando caí al suelo, los secuestradores ya se habían ido en su coche, pero no iba a rendirme. Crucé por los callejones persiguiéndolos como un loco. Finalmente encontré su coche. Los secuestradores me miraron sorprendidos. ¿Cómo era posible que alguien pudiera correr más rápido que su coche? Inmediatamente giraron hacia un callejón, rompí una ventana y los detuve. Luego me lancé hacia su coche como un toro. Los secuestradores intentaron retroceder. Salté al coche y comencé a romper las ventanas. Era vidrio a prueba de balas, pero me trepé al lado del coche. Finalmente logré abrir una rendija. Los secuestradores dispararon. Me atropelló un coche que venía en dirección contraria, dejándome inconsciente cuando los secuestradores se preparaban para escapar en un helicóptero. Agarré un cable de acero y lo lancé hacia el helicóptero. Me aferré fuertemente y con mi fuerza traté de evitar que despegara. Luego amarré el cable a un muelle. Los secuestradores sacaron armas. Me escondí rápidamente para evitar sus disparos. Luego tomé una barra de acero para contraatacar. No, no, pero en ese momento el helicóptero logró soltarse. Inmediatamente me agarré del cable y fue arrastrado sobre el mar. Después de 400m me golpeó una boya. Solo pude mirar, impotente ¿Cómo se llevaban a mi hermano?

Cuando noté que el guardaespaldas detrás de mí llevaba la funda del arma abierta. Esa mínima señal me hizo sentir un peligro inmediato al ver que no parecía una mala persona. Bajé la guardia por un momento, pero al seguir observando los alrededores del Presidente me di cuenta de que algo no cuadraba en el lugar. Muchos espectadores agitaban banderas de colores. Como francotirador profesional, sabía que aquello no eran solo simples banderas, también podían ser instrumentos para medir la dirección del viento. Avisé de inmediato al coronel a mi lado para que asegurara todos los puntos elevados en un radio de 2km. Los equipos de seguridad se movilizaron enseguida, pero de pronto noté que el viento se había detenido casi por completo. Otra vez el peligro me golpeó el instinto. De repente, un disparo estalló a mis espaldas. En ese instante comprendí por fin que esta misión de protección presidencial, era en realidad una trampa cuidadosamente montada contra mí. Por suerte, reaccioné a tiempo y salté por la ventana. Ahora sabía con claridad que debía salir de ese lugar cuanto antes, que ya me habían convertido en un fugitivo buscado en toda la ciudad. Las fuerzas de tierra, mar y aire tenían sus ojos puestos en mí. No había corrido mucho cuando choqué de frente con un policía. Para evitar que descubriera mi identidad, lo neutralicé rápidamente. Le supliqué que me creyera que me había entendido una trampa. En un impulso, tomé su arma Robé su coche patrulla y escapé del lugar a toda velocidad, las calles estaban llenas de patrullas buscándome y además seguía herido por un disparo anterior. Para despistar a la policía, entré en un túnel de lavado. Mientras el coche era limpiado, me pasé al asiento trasero y me vendé la herida lo más rápido que pude. Después salí del lugar sin perder un segundo. Pronto la policía localizó mi vehículo y me acercó bajo un gran puente. Al ver cómo llegaban más patrullas, metí marcha atrás y me lancé directamente al río. Cuando los agentes alcanzaron la orilla, ya había desaparecido bajo la cobertura de un barco grande. Conseguí eludir temporalmente la persecución. Aún así, no podía relajarme. Robé otro coche cerca del puente, sabiendo que toda la atención policial seguía concentrada en el río. Al poco tiempo logré salir de la ciudad. Lo primero que hice fue ir a casa de mi exnovia porque ella era doctora. Cuando me vio, se asustó. Ya había visto las noticias sobre mi orden de arresto. Por suerte, los lazos del pasado aún pesaban. Finalmente me abrió la puerta y comenzó a atender mi herida de bala. Durante la conversación, supe que quien había caído no era el Presidente, sino el arzobispo que estaba a su lado. Al comprender que todo había sido una trampa para inculparme, decidí descubrir quién estaba detrás de toda aquella conspiración

Mostré la foto a todos los que estaban en servicio, pero nadie la conocía. Nadie la reclamó, así que la llevé conmigo poco después de que terminara la guerra.

Este es mi método para juzgar si la tierra es adecuada para excavar, pero esta vez, justo cuando puse la tierra en mi boca, sentí que algo no estaba bien. Pero la recompensa de este trabajo era muy alta. No podía detenerme solo por una sensación, así que ordené a los trabajadores mover el ataúd. Cuando la pala apenas se insertó, descubrí algo extraño. Claramente, el ataúd ya había sido movido porque todavía se escuchaban sonidos debajo. Rápidamente aparté la tierra con mis manos. Efectivamente, encontré otro ataúd debajo. Esto me dejó muy sorprendido. He visto muchos entierros conjuntos. Es la primera vez que veo un ataúd enterrado verticalmente. Rápidamente, llamé a mis compañeros para ayudar cuando excavamos hasta la mitad, descubrimos que el ataúd estaba completamente envuelto en alambre. No sé si era para evitar que alguien lo abriera desde afuera o para evitar que algo saliera de adentro. Más extraño aún cuando lo excavamos completamente. Este ataúd tenía 3m de largo que este ataúd era muy extraño, pero ya era tarde. Sugerí primero arrastrar el ataúd montaña abajo, ponerlo en el almacén del templo. Para prevenir cualquier accidente. Primero esparcimos arroz glutinoso alrededor del ataúd, luego rociamos sangre de cerdo. Finalmente, colocamos un sello protector. En ese momento, el empleador llegó de repente. Ella estaba muy confundida porque debajo del ataúd de su padre había otro bajo mi insistencia. Ella sacó una fotografía. Era de su padre con varios japoneses. Dijo que antes un japonés también había elegido un lugar de entierro para su padre. Lo demás no lo sabía. Antes de irse, me pidió ayuda para manejar este ataúd. Prometió pagar según lo acordado. Pero después de que todos se durmieran a medianoche, mi pequeño hermano menor soñó con un hombre siniestro presionando sobre él. Se dio cuenta de que algo andaba mal. Rápidamente dibujó un talismán protector y logró liberarse. Sospechó que era algo del ataúd haciendo travesuras. El pequeño hermano menor corrió a revisar el almacén. Encontró la puerta bien cerrada, sin ninguna anomalía, pero justo cuando iba a tranquilizarse, escuchó gritos desde el corral de cerdos. A través de la ventana vio todos los cerdos aterrorizados, apiñados en la esquina. Más aterrador aún, había algo terrible que había despedazado al vigilante. El pequeño hermano menor se asustó mucho. Rápidamente despertó a la hermana mayor. Los dos abrieron el almacén y miraron. Encontraron que la tapa del ataúd ya estaba rota porque alrededor había un sello protector. Juzgaron que lo que estaba dentro definitivamente había atravesado el techo y escapado. Decidí volver al cementerio a ver

Tracking one down? No. See, I have so many landlines. I don't know how to ask if someone is Native American or not. You absolutely should. Yeah, don't do that. Yeah, but, but it would. I'm trying to save my patient's life. She won't let me put her on a helicopter trip. But the more I think about it, the more I realize she's right. Why should she trust me? Because you're a doctor. American doctors and Native American patients. Not the easiest history, but if I can find someone to convince her to get on that trip, then I can keep her alive. Okay. So what do you need me for? Because I may have heard a long time ago a little rumor that you were maybe a quarter something. She's native. Native American. No way this ends well for you. Wrong kind of Indian. But I did do Iowa once. Does that count? Nope. Seriously. Nope. But some people think I look like Cher. I'm Jewish, waspish.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And, yes, he's rich. Like, really rich. We met at the Starbucks, where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbour needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it. And not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom, puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news, and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work emergency, leaving Me at the bar where his call kids don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says, worth every penny at that age. Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open, and he's on speaker phone, negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the papers. Spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

And the whole class is just staring at me like I just asked everyone if they could sell their kidneys. You're sitting there laughing your ass off, unable to control yourself until the teacher starts yelling at you and your friend. Like the two of you get out of my classroom now. Devious smile on your face wipes right off. You try begging the teacher to let you stay, but she won't budge. So you end up having to accept your fate. And now you and your friend have to do the walk of shame.

You instantly cover your face with your hands and you just can't sit still and watch the whole scene without dying of embarrassment.

You're pacing back and forth yelling at the screen like the actor can even hear you. Then after a couple of minutes of calming down, you sit back down and press play, only to immediately fast forward 15 seconds because you physically cannot watch the rest of the scene. The worst part? The character doesn't even realize how cringe they are. They're just standing there smiling like everything's fine while you're having a full blown meltdown on their behalf.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and have lived together for nearly 2 years. I am at university and work as a manager and he has a full time job at around 30 to 40 hours a week. At the start, it was your stereotypical happy and progressive relationship. He got me flowers, made me coffee in the mornings, cooked his favorite meals if he had a bad day and we would go on dates. Our friends used us as a template for the perfect relationship since we knew how to communicate and anything that almost became a fight was resolved within the day. We were both on the same wavelength. With everything in the past year, it's become tough to have good communication. I kept doing what we've always done and brought up anything bothering me and how to resolve it. But he started making empty promises. For example, my university semester started and I got a job promotion. So I asked him if we could shuffle the house chores since I was doing many hours. He said, yeah, of course, and did the usual hug and kiss, but nothing changed. If I bring it up again, he will brush it off saying he'll do it later, but he doesn't. I thought he might have been struggling with something he didn't want to tell me about. So I Gave him more leeway and just asked for a little bit of help here and there. I would make dinner and ask that he unload the dishwasher afterward, but he would do the same thing, agree, but pretend I hadn't asked. The final straw for me was a couple of days ago. We were getting furniture moved to our house and my parents were helping us. At 10:00am I told my boyfriend this and he said that's fine, but he's already agreed to go clubbing with our friends. I said that was fine as long as he helped me clear up the living room for the new furniture before he left. He says that his friends want to have a house party until 6 and I say we can't be out that late, but we can stay until 3. He says that's fine. I hadn't been on a night out in ages so they invited me. I had just got a new dress and was excited to go out. I got my dress and makeup ready and told my boyfriend that we had to start moving furniture now. If it would be prepared in the morning. He said sure, give him a minute to finish a fight in his video game. I started moving things and struggled with the heavy stuff. So I reminded him to help me move things. He told me to wait. Two hours go by with me struggling to lift couches and he jumps into the Room dressed up and ready to leave. He quickly tells me that he's ordered a taxi and is leaving soon. I ask, what about moving the furniture? He shrugs and says, show me that kitty cat. I'm going to do it later. Just let me shove my glizzy inside that pun Tang. Follow for part two.

He basically raised me since I could remember and now he wants to try my Bamba clat. My mom had me at 18, right out of high school, and my dad died a year later, which left her a vulnerable teen mom. Suddenly, my mom remarried at 21 and had my sisters. My stepdad, Scott, was the only father I've known and he's been amazing, even though he says he has 23 children and 22 baby mothers. Now, that's a real bad man. But anyways, things changed when I turned 23, though. I remember Scott was becoming a little more touchy than normal and a little too personal. He started to buy me Nike Pro shorts anytime he could and told me I was only allowed to walk around the house with them on. He told me I was beautiful all the time and said I had a crazy bomba clap and if he was my age, he would have gone after me right away. He would offer me wine, I declined, and would ask me about boys I was seeing in my life. After one too many glasses, I brushed it off because I thought maybe he was being a nosy Jamaican father and just wanted to make sure his daughter wasn't getting in trouble. Then this kind of stuff continued to the point where my stepdad tried to rizz me up. By telling me that he likes my Bamba clat like a fat kid likes his cake. I told my mom and she just laughed and told me that's how he gets that. He was never too good at using Rizz. After that, I knew that I had to make plans to leave. So I started saving up. After that incident, things died down a bit until my mom got pregnant at 39. It's a higher risk pregnancy, so she's on a lot of bed rest and taking extra care of herself for her doctor. A couple of weeks ago, my mom and Scott sat me down and told me her doctor said she should avoid any bedroom activities during her pregnancy due to various health reasons I won't get into. However, I knew this was partly a lie since I heard Scott tell my mom he was tired of her bumbaclap. They asked me if I could take over for my mother with Scott just until she was able to be out of bed rest. Of course, I said no. I was livid. I was crying. She told me she'd be okay with it and she'd be in the room as well. I told her that was even worse. Like, what are they thinking? My Jamaican father just said, womp, womp, take one for the team. This was the last strike. I now have enough money for an apartment. I got approved and I'm signing my lease next week. My Parents are ignoring me and the whole house is full of tension. My younger sisters don't understand what's going on, and my mom told me not to say anything. But my sisters are smart. They know something is up and won't stop asking me about it, especially the oldest. She came to me crying today and told me I'd better tell her what's going on right now. I didn't say anything. I don't feel safe anymore in my house. I don't want anyone to touch my bomba clock.

I'm half Korean, but look completely white. Nobody ever expects me to speak Korean, which has given me some interesting advantages over the years. Last month, I was at this trendy ramen place downtown with my friend Stella. We got seated near the window, and two minutes later, three Korean guys sat down right behind us. College students with designer clothes and expensive watches. Total trust fund kid vibes. Stella launched into her dating drama about her ex texting her at 3:00am. I was nodding along when I heard one guy behind us say in Korean, check out that blonde girl in front of us. She's actually really pretty. I kept eating my ramen, acting clueless. My mom made sure I was fluent growing up, but I've Learned it's better to let people think I don't understand. You learn a lot when they think you can't hear them. His friend responded, yeah, she's hot, but probably has zero personality. Look how she's dressed. Probably spends her whole paycheck on clothes. I was wearing a target dress and drugstore mascara, but okay. Third guy laugh. White girls like that are all the same. No substance, just Instagram and shopping. Bet she's never read a book. I have a master's degree in literature, but sure. Still. I was still talking about her ex, completely oblivious to the commentary happening behind us. These guys were getting more obnoxious by the minute. Look at her trying to use chopsticks! The first guy said, giggling. She's holding them like a kindergartener. This is painful to watch. His friends burst out laughing. Should we go help? We could play the helpful Korean guys teaching the clueless white girl how to eat properly. She'd probably be so grateful for our cultural expertise. Another added. They started planning this elaborate scheme to come over and rescue me from my terrible chopstick technique and use it to hit on me. The condescension was unreal. Stella finished her story and asked what I thought. I told her to block her ex while these guys kept potting behind us. I bet she doesn't even know what miso is, once said. White girls love that exotic Asian guy thing. This will be easy. We could totally impress her with our food knowledge, another added. I was getting more annoyed by the second, but decided to wait and see. How are they take the this ridiculous plan? They kept going on about how grateful I'd be for their help. She'll probably ask for our numbers after one last. We'll be like her Asian food heroes. The whole thing was so cringe I almost wanted to turn around and end it right there, but I knew waiting would make the payoff even better. About 10 minutes later, they finished their ramen and got up. I could feel them approaching behind me, probably pumping themselves up for their big rescue mission. The first Guy tapped my shoulder and said in push with this exaggerated hell tone, excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but I noticed you might be having trouble with your chopsticks. Would you like me to show you an easier way? His friends stood behind him, trying not to smirk. They probably thought they were so smooth. I looked up with my best confused expression.

My daughter Yazari has been my heart since the day she was born. She's 15 and still the kindest kid I know. Always the first to hug grandma every time we visited. Always helped set the dinner table without me asking. She made her little sister feel like the most important person in the world. Teachers loved her, family couldn't stop praising her. Her bio dad left before she could even walk. So it's just been me and my mom raising her and her sister. She made me believe we built something good. Then a few weeks ago, my worst nightmare happened. I didn't notice the change at first because it was small. Yasare started keeping her phone closer, angling the screen away when I walked by. She stopped coming downstairs to watch TV with me and her sister at night. I told myself it was normal. She's fifteen and teenagers need space. But then she straight up lied to me. She said she was sleeping over at her friend Mia's house. And I only found out she lied to me because Mia's mom called me asking if yaser was feeling better since she couldn't make it to the sleepover that night. Then I started freaking out. Where the hell is Yaziray? She ended up coming home at 5:00am. I waited on the couch and confronted her. She blew up on me, told me I was suffocating. Her? That I didn't trust her? That I was the problem. I stood there stunned. She had never raised her voice at me. A week later, $50 went missing from my purse. I asked her about it. She looked me dead in the eyes and said she didn't take it. I wanted to believe her, but something felt off. Then the night of my mom's birthday dinner, I asked yaser to get ready. She groaned like I asked her to walk through fire. Why do we have to make such a big deal out of this? She's old. She doesn't even care. I felt my stomach drop. She's never talked about grandma like that before. I told her it wasn't optional. She rolled her eyes and muttered something under her breath. Then right before we walked out the door, she said it. Maybe if you had your life together, I wouldn't be stuck in this situation. I stepped in front of her before she could get to the door. You can have an attitude with me, but tonight is Grandma's birthday, and you will not ruin it for her. Whatever this is, you leave it here. She stared at me for a second, then pushed past me to the car. We got to my mom's house, and the second we walked in, my mom opened her arms for a hug. Yazirra walked right past, her eyes glued to her phone typing. Didn't even acknowledge her. My mom's face crumpled and Her eyes started to water. I pulled Yazirra aside. What was that? She shrugged, rolled her eyes. I wanted to scream. This wasn't my daughter. She wasn't sick. She wasn't on her period. There wasn't a reasonable explanation. Why was she being like this? At dinner, she sat at the end of the table, phone in her lap, barely touching her food. My mom asked about school. Yasira gave one word answers without looking up. Then her little sister tried to show her a drawing she made. Yasira said mid and went back to texting. Her aunt tried to make a joke, and Yasir said it wasn't funny. Everyone was uncomfortable. Then I walked behind her to grab something from the kitchen, and I saw her phone screen. From above. I saw her send a message about my mother. I can't stand these beaches that I call family. My hands started shaking. I couldn't do it anymore. Without thinking, I took the phone right out of her hands. I tried to grab it, but I was already reading everything out loud. I can't fake it anymore. Grandma is old and boring and I don't care about her stupid birthday. My mom let out a small cry. Mom acts like she did everything for me, but she's the reason I never had a dad. She ruined my life. I kept going, voice shaking. My sister means nothing to me. She's not even my real family. None of them are my youngest Started crying quietly. I almost have enough money to run away and finally live with you. I scrolled up and saw who she was texting. She was texting her bio dad. The man who chose substances and needles over diapers. The man I protected her from for 15 years, who never paid a dime in child support. He found Yasir and convinced her we were the enemy. Yasir was sobbing, but when she looked up at me, there was no remorse in her eyes. You kept him from me my whole life, he said. You abandoned him. You're the villain here, not him. I stared at her. You defended a man who abandoned you for drugs over a family who took care of you. I took my youngest hand and walked out.

My girlfriend Brianna and my brother Nathan. They weren't even trying to hide it. I didn't yell, didn't throw anything. I just looked at Nathan and said, you're dead to me. You're not my brother anymore. Then I grabbed my keys and left. I thought my family would understand, that they take my side. But they didn't. My parents said I was overreacting, that people make mistakes, that family is family. When Nathan and Brianna got married eight months later, my whole family went to the wedding. I stayed home alone. For 26 years, I held that line. Every Christmas, every Thanksgiving, every family event. I told them to invite him, not me. I wasn't going to pretend everything was fine. I move. Moved on. Got married, had my daughter Ruby, got divorced, rebuilt my life. But I never forgave Nathan. Then last month, Ruby came over for dinner. She's 24 now, getting married next. We were talking about the wedding when she got quiet. Dad, I need to tell you something, she said, pushing her food around her plate. What's up, kiddo? She took a deep breath. I've been visiting Uncle Nathan and Aunt Brianna. For about four years now, I just stared at her. You what? I wanted to know them. They're family, too. And, dad, I want them at my wedding. I want Cousin Everly to be my flower girl. My hands started shaking. Ruby, you know what he did to. It was 26 years ago, dad, don't you think. No. I cut her off. If he's there, I'm not. And I'm not paying for it either. Her face crumpled. So you're choosing your grudge over me? I'm choosing my self respect. She left in tears. Within hours, my phone was blowing up. My ex wife called, screaming that I was ruining our daughter's life. My parents sent texts saying I was being selfish and immature. Even my girlfriend Kara sat me down and said, maybe it's time to let it go. I stopped answering calls, stopped reading messages. Then yesterday afternoon,

He got on one knee in front of everyone and pulled out an actual ring box. I felt my heart stop. He opened it, and inside was a key. Asked if I'd keep watering his mom's plants since she'd left them to him. His aunt slapped him. His own aunt slapped him at his mother's funeral. That's when I knew exactly what to do. I started planning with military precision. Told Kevin we needed to visit his dad more after his mom's death, help him. His dad lived three hours away, but Kevin agreed. We started going every weekend. I'd cook, clean, help organize things. Kevin's dad started calling me his daughter. After two months of this, I suggested we throw his dad a birthday party to cheer him up. Invited the whole family. Kevin thought it was sweet. The day Of the party, I waited until everyone was there. All Kevin's relatives, his dad's friends, and neighbors he'd known for 30 years. During dessert, I stood up and clinked my glass, said I had something important to say. I talked about family law and coming together. Then I looked at Kevin and said he'd shown me something important. With all his proposals, that commitment was about more than words or rings. Kevin looked confused, but pleased. Then I turned to Kevin's dad and got down on one knee, asked if he'd let me be his daughter in law because I was leaving Kevin and wanted to keep him as a father figure. The room exploded.

Now I am done being his punchline. Kevin and I have been together for four years and lived together for two. We met at a friend's birthday party and just clicked immediately. Same sense of humour. Both loved hiking. Both wanted kids someday. He worked as an electrician and I was a physical therapist at a rehab centre. We talked about marriage plenty of times, agreed we both wanted it, even looked at houses together for when we were ready to buy. His sister got engaged and we helped plan her wedding. My brother got married and Kevin gave this whole speech at the reception about finding your person. Everyone assumed we'd be next. The first fake proposal happened on my birthday. We went to dinner at this Italian place we loved and Kevin started acting nervous, kept checking his pocket, clearing his throat, saying he had something important to tell me. Then he got down on one knee and I started crying. I pulled out a jewelry box and inside with a pair of earrings said he wanted to give them to me in a special way. I laughed it off and felt weird about it. The whole restaurant had been watching and some people actually clapped before they realized what happened. The second time was at my parents house during Thanksgiving. Kevin clinked his glass during dinner like he was making A toast, started talking about how much he loved me, how grateful he was to be part of the family. Got on one knee again.

Kevin grabbed the mic during the couple's cake cutting and said he had been inspired by their love, dropped to his knee on the dance floor and asked if I'd cat sit for his brother next weekend. The bride cried and not in a good way. The DJ actually cut the music and told us to leave. The 15th time was the worst. We were at his mom's funeral reception. His mom had died suddenly from a heart attack and everyone was grieving. Kevin stood up during this speeches about his mom and said she'd always wanted him to settle down. He got on one knee in front of everyone and pulled out an actual ring box. I felt my heart stop. He opened it and inside was a key. Asked if I'd keep watering his mom's plants since she'd left them to him. His aunt slapped him. His own aunt slapped him at his mother's funeral. That's when I knew exactly what to do. I started planning with military precision, told Kevin we needed to visit his dad more after his mom's death, help him. His dad lived three hours away, but Kevin agreed. We started going every weekend. I'd cook, clean, help organize things. Kevin's dad started calling me his daughter. After two months of this, I suggested we throw his dad a birthday party to cheer him up, invited the whole family. Kevin thought it was sweet. The day Of the party. I waited until everyone was there, all Kevin's relatives, his dad's friends and neighbors he'd known for 30 years. During dessert, I stood up and clinked my glass, said I had something important to say. I talked about family law and coming together. Then I looked at Kevin and said he'd shown me something important. With all his proposals, that commitment was about more than words or rings. Kevin looked confused but pleased. Then I turned to Kevin's dad and got down on one knee, asked if he'd let me be his daughter in law because I was leaving Kevin and wanted to keep him as a father figure. The room exploded.

So it was cleaning day and to be honest, I like to clean freely in my panties and my shirt with no bra. I was washing my front room windows when I noticed my super cute neighbour across the street talking with some contractor guy outside his front door. He really is so handsome. I spilled dark hair, tall 10 and always had this dominant look to him. I catch myself blank staring, daydreaming about him making me his good little slut. When I hear my name being called, I immediately snapped out of it and noticed it was my fucking neighbour crossing the street heading straight to my house, was waving, trying to get my attention with this big beautiful smile on his face. Most like he was flattered BC he knew I was just thinking about being on my knees while he fucked my mouth and told me I was his good little slut. I immediately starting blushing and could feel myself starting to press my thighs together. The closer he got to my door, he knocked and I answered the door the same way. I was in the window, panties and a shirt with no bra. My nipples were rock hard and I hadn't even noticed till I see my neighbour look right at my tits and ah, I have natural perky to cup tits with these perfect nipples and he had their full attention. I didn't even bother To cover myself up. I wanted him to see. I wanted him to think about what it would be like to suck on my nipples and hear me moan for more. This turned me on. And here I was again, pressing my thighs together right in front of him with my hard nipples. He could see perfectly. I couldn't even tell you what he was telling me BC I really didn't even care. But as soon as he moves his eyes from mine, it's down to my thighs. I noticed he had a smirk on his face and asked if he could come in for a minute. Without hesitation, I stepped back and let him in. The way he moved was so smooth and light and that's when I could smell him, his Cologne, his pheromones. I couldn't help but bite my lip and stare at him with those eyes that scream, fuck me, please. He must have caught onto what he was doing to me and asked if I liked his Cologne. I told him I loved it. As I was heading past him to the kitchen and asked if he wanted anything to drink. As I was walking past him, he put his arm out in front of me and stopped me and said that he'd seen me looking at him in the window and asked me what it was I thinking about. I blushed and started to fumble my words and he laughs saying he had no Idea he had that effect on me and that he was flattered but still wanted to know what it was I thinking about. I, do you want me to be honest or lie to you? Of course, he said be honest. His eyes lighting up in excitement. So I told him the truth. I was thinking about getting down on my knees and taking out his big, thick cock to admire it a little bit before I start to lick on the head and work my way down, taking all of his cock in my mouth.

I asked him probably a dozen times if he would be okay with just one child. I only ever wanted one. He looked me in the eyes every single time and said, yes, one was fine. So we had our baby girl about 10 months ago. The pregnancy was rough, constant back pain, couldn't sleep, could barely walk by the end. Then the birth was even worse. I was in labor for almost 30 hours before they finally did a C section. After all that, I told my husband, Jake, that I was completely done, one and done. He said he understood. But lately he's been changing his tune completely. It started small. He'd see a commercial with siblings playing together and say, wouldn't that be nice? Then he started showing me pictures of babies on his phone and asking if I thought our daughter would want a brother or sister someday. Here's the thing about our situation, though. Jake works these insane shifts at a warehouse. He leaves at 5 in the morning and doesn't get home until 9 or 10 at night, sometimes later, five days a week. When he finally walks through the door, he's so exhausted he can barely keep his eyes open. He showers, eats whatever I heated up for him and passes out. On weekends, he sleeps until noon both days. Because his body is literally broken from the week. So guess who takes care of our daughter every single second of every single day? Me. I'm with her 24 7. I haven't slept more than three hours in a row since she was born. I can't remember the last time I showered without her crying in the bouncer right outside the door. I eat standing up while feeding her. I haven't had a real conversation with an adult in weeks. And we can't afford daycare, not even one day a week. So there's no break coming anytime soon. Last Tuesday, Jake came home from work and I was sitting on the couch crying because the baby had been screaming for four hours straight and I didn't know what was wrong. I hadn't eaten all day. My hair was in a knot on top of my head. He sat down next to me and instead of asking if I was okay, he said, you know what would cheer you up? Giving her a sibling. I just stared at him. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told him I was drowning. I told him I was barely surviving with one baby and zero.

Like you're just sitting in bed scrolling on your phone. And that's when your big back decides you're gonna try to sneak into the kitchen to go get some snacks. So you tiptoe out of your room, trying to be as silent as possible and successfully make it into the kitchen. And you can literally hear your dad snoring like a whole ass rhino all the way from the bedroom. You open the drawer and you try grabbing a bag of Doritos, and the sound of the bag crinkling is literally louder than a whole ass volcano erupting. And that's when your dad decides to stop snoring and your soul literally drops straight to your ass crack. You're standing there frozen, thinking your dad is about to walk out and literally publicly execute you. But then after 10 seconds he goes right back to snoring. So you grab the rest of your snacks as carefully as possible and try to sneak back to your room. But literally every step you take the floor creaks so loud it sounds like the whole house is literally about to collapse. You're just speed walking to your room praying your parents don't hear you. And you finally make it into your room and jump into your bed with your heart literally racing like, bro, that wasn't just trying to get snacks, that was a full tactical operation And my soul is completely cooked.

And if she says, I don't really like it, then you know, you're gonna look like a model for the next week. And don't even get me started on school with a bad cut. Nobody holds back.

Her coworker laughed and said, how does it feel to be a loser? Your wife earns and you just sit at home. Everyone laughed, including my wife. Except me. I smiled and asked the CEO, how does it feel to know this loser owns 67% of your company? The room went silent. Her face turned pale. I never thought I'd be the guy sitting at a corporate dinner while people laughed at me. But here I was, watching my wife, Amanda's coworkers mock me for being a stay at home husband while she made millions. Let me back up. I'm David, 45, and I've been married to Amanda for 18 years. She's a VP at Titan Enterprises, this huge tech company in Seattle. Everyone thinks she's the breadwinner and I just exist. I mean, I do make breakfast and handle the house stuff, but there's more to the story. The dinner started normal enough. Fancy ballroom, expensive wine, executives showing off their watches. Then Marcus Chen, this arrogant SVP, spotted me sitting quietly at my table. David, he called out loud enough for everyone to hear, how does it feel being Mr. Amanda Harrison? Must be nice living off your wife's salary while the rest of us actually work. People started laughing. Not polite chuckles, real mean laughter. I looked at Amanda, waiting for her to defend me. Instead, she raised her glass and smiled like it was the funniest joke she'd ever heard. 18 years, Of marriage. And she was laughing at me. Marcus wasn't done. Seriously, though, what do you do all day? Yoga, Netflix, maybe some light grocery shopping. More laughter. The CEO, Jennifer Blackstone, was running. Amanda's secretary was recording on her phone. I mean, we all work 80 hour weeks, Marcus continued. While you sit at home doing what, exactly? How does that feel? The whole room was watching. Now Amanda still hadn't said a word. In my defense, he just sat there enjoying her champagne like I was some punchline to a joke I didn't know I was part of. Something inside me snapped. I stood up, slowly, smooth my jacket, and walked toward Jennifer's table. The laughter died down as people sensed something was about to happen. Jennifer, I said calmly, I have a question for you. She looked amused. What's that, David? How does it feel to know that the losers stay at home husband you're all laughing at own 67% of Titan Enterprises? The room went dead silent. Jennifer's wine glass froze halfway to her lips. Marcus's smug expression melted like ice in the sun. Amanda's face turned white as a sheet. But Jennifer whispered, I pulled out my phone and showed her the Greystone Capital documents. 12 years ago, Titan was bankrupt. Remember that mysterious investment firm that saved you? That was me. I used my inheritance from my father's tech company to bail you out. The condition? Majority ownership through shell companies. Jennifer was scrolling Through her phone, frantically, probably texting her lawyers. Marcus looked like he might throw up. Every major decision for the past twelve years needed my approval. I continued Amanda's promotion to VP. I approved it. The Seattle expansion. Me. The merger with Digitax. Also me. I turned to Amanda, who was staring at me like I was a stranger. I've been managing a six hundred million dollar portfolio from our home office while you thought I was watching TV every morning after you left. I've been running the company you work for. The room erupted in chaos. Jennifer was on the phone with legal. Marcus stumbled backward, knocking over his chair. Amanda just sat there, frozen. I grabbed my coat and walked out, leaving my wife and her company to figure out what happens when you mock the person who actually owns everything. My lawyer called this morning. Seems Titans board wants an emergency meeting. Amanda's been texting. To continue, tap the arrow in the bottom right corner and copy the link. Then tap the CapCut icon in the bottom left. Finally, click the red button. When I pulled out the tampon in front of her, she actually gagged. We need to admit you, she said, covering her mouth. Hospital, day one. I

My wife Stephanie waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this Red dress I've never seen before that. She'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months. Even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why don't you wanna know

The moment happened at their country club's anniversary gala, the one they pointedly not invited me to for eight years running. I only knew about it because my husband posted photos every year of him standing awkwardly alone while couples danced around him. This year was different. His mother called him the morning of and I heard her through his phone, bring someone respectable this time. The Hendersons are bringing their daughter, Harvard Law School, very accomplished. My husband looked at me across our kitchen table and said loudly, I'll bring my wife like I've offered to every year. The silence on her end stretched so long I thought she hung up. Then I suppose if you must. Eight years we've been married. Eight years of his mother introducing me as David's friend at family functions, eight years of these settings mysteriously disappearing when I'd arrive at holiday dinners. Eight years his father asking when David was going to get serious about his future while I sat right there, my wedding ring catching the light. They thought I was temporary because I was a mechanic, not even a man, which might have been acceptable in their backwards way, but a female mechanic with grease under her nails and coveralls in her closet. Their son, the surgeon, had married someone who fixed cars and they've never recovered from the shame. The night of the gala, I wore the emerald Dress David had bought me for our anniversary. His mother took one look and whispered to his aunt loud enough for me to hear. At least she cleaned up. Small miracles. The Henderson's daughter was indeed there, beautiful, accomplished and placed strategically at our table. David's mother kept steering her toward him, literally putting her hand on the woman's back and pushing her forward while I stood right there, my hand in his. Claudia just made partner at her firm, his mother announced. Isn't that wonderful, David? That's nice, David said flatly. My wife just opened her third auto shop. She employs 47 people now. His mother's smile went rigid. How industrial. The breaking point came during the auction. They we're auctioning off luxury experiences for charity, weekends in Aspen, yacht trips, the usual rich people things. Then they announced a special item, a full classic car restoration by Morrison Automotive, my company, the one I built from nothing. David must have submitted it without telling me. His mother actually gasped. You put her little garage project in our charity auction. David stood up. Her little garage project is worth more than most items here. She restored a 1967 and Shelby for the governor last month. The waiting list is three years long. It's still just cars, his father said dismissively. That's when Roger Blackstone, the actual billionaire Roger Blackstone stood up from across the room. Excuse me, did you say Morrison Automotive as in Riley Morrison. He looked around. Until his eyes landed on me. You restored my father's 1955 underbird. He cried when he saw it. He hasn't cried since my mother died. The room was staring. Now Roger walked over to our table. My father is here tonight. He'd love to thank you in person. He helped me up and LED me to his father, this 90 year old man who grabbed my hands with tears in his eyes. You brought back my memories, he said. Every detail perfect. Even found the original cigarette lighter my wife bought me. The waiting for my restoration service started at 10,000. It ended at $78,000, the highest bit of the night. The winner was a tech CEO who'd been trying to get on my waiting list for two years. When. When I returned to the table, David's mother was staring at me like she'd never seen me before. 78,000, she kept repeating. But the real moment, the one that ended it all came when her best friend leaned over and said, Margaret, you never mentioned. David's wife was the Riley Morrison, the one featured in Classic Car Monthly. My husband has been trying to commission her for three years. Domino's fell fast after that. Every person at the table it turned out either knew my work, wanted my work or knew someone desperate for my work. The Henderson's daughter, the Harvard lawyer, spent 20 minutes asking me about the legal structure of my business expansion. You're franchising nationally that.

Keep smiling or you're sleeping outside tonight, my mother said. The doorbell rang again. Child Protective Services, we need to talk to you about your daughter. My mother grabbed my face and squeezed hard. You tell them we're perfect or I'll lock you in the closet for a week like last time. He shoved me toward the door while my father scrambled to hide the ring lights that had burned my arms so many times. The CPS worker was named Melinda. A viewer sent us multiple screenshots of bruises and burns on your daughter. My mother stood right behind Melinda where only I could see her face twisted into a silent threat. I smiled the way they taught me, with all my teeth showing. Everything is amazing here. I love making videos every single day with my parents. He pulled out her tablet and zoomed in on a picture. Why do you have a black eye that's covered with makeup? In this video from last week, I walked into a doorknob because I'm clumsy. My mom helped me cover it so viewers wouldn't worry. Melinda wrote something down in her notebook. You're 10 years old. Why aren't you in school right now? My mother interrupted fast. We homeschool her, but really, she doesn't need school. She makes more money than most adults. Melinda asked to see my school work. We don't waste time on books when she could be filming and making us money. Instead, Melinda asked if she could speak to me alone. We don't leave our daughter alone with strangers, my father protested. Melinda pulled out her badge and explained that refusing would look suspicious. My mother squeezed my shoulder so hard I almost cried out. We'll be right in the next room, sweetie, she said in her fake sweet voice.

But on Christmas morning, when Jordan walked his kids into the house he grew up in, the shock hit instantly. Every gift his children wished for. The red bike with flame decals. The glittery pink karaoke mic was already being torn open by Brandon Estuans. Liam froze. Dad, isn't that mine? Maisie took her sleeve, a voice trembling. Is that my microphone?

He had taken his children's wish list and used it as a shopping guide for Brandon's kids, then bragged about it. Jordan, didn't he fight back? Not yet. He began collecting everything forgotten.

No, I didn't want her to die. We loved her like she was our own. Everything was fine until she stopped eating. We thought she missed her mother. Then I saw the white spots in her mouth, and I knew it was AIDS. How many people have died in my country? I raised my sister, and she had the same sickness. So you knew how sick Antonia was. Why didn't you bring her to the hospital? Because the AIDS medicines are poison. Who told you that? Our president. But he has found the cure. He rubs a green paste of herbs on his patient's chest. Hold on. The president of Gambia does this himself every Thursday. And then he gives him the bitter yellow brew and two bananas, and they are cured. Did you try to cure Antonia? No. The president's recipe is secret. So we went on the internet and found a doctor who believes as we do. He gave Antonia vitamins, but she just got worse. Okay, this doctor, what's his name

They discovered that by layering two sheets of paper together, they could get almost the exact feel of the real thing. Even the thickness matched. They bleached the sheets, printed each side separately, punched holes in the front layer, inserted the security strip, then glued everything together. This created a perfect sandwich structure. With the paper solved, they moved on to the second problem, the color shifting ink. By mixing commercially available metallic paint and ink, he produced a colour shifting effect realistic enough to fool most people. They coated the bills with a layer of clear varnish, giving them the crisp texture of real currency. Then they artificially aged the notes again to test the quality of their new batch. They returned to the same street corner shop.

At that moment, a man walked by, mistaking my boyfriend for a woman and even felt a sudden attraction. His luxury watch and golden teeth clearly flaunted his wealth. My boyfriend came up with an idea, but the problem was his figure wasn't feminine enough. Luckily, some clothes had been left nearby. He grabbed them and sprayed them black. After dressing, it still felt incomplete. Spotting a small cupcake on the table, he shoved it into his blouse to create curve. However, his hairy legs ruined the illusion, so he crawled under the table, cut the hem off someone else's pants, put them on. Even then, the outfit wasn't quite right. Later, an elderly man went to the restroom, slipped inside unnoticed and used his white beard to craft a feather accessory, instantly upgrading my boyfriend's style. My boyfriend went to meet the millionaire, who was immediately captivated, pulled out a diamond ring and proposed on the spot. My boyfriend froze while jealousy boiled inside me, turned on a fan, blew another person's wig toward me and put it on my head. But the strong wind also whisked away the wig and my boyfriend's fake mask. The millionaire was stunned, realizing my boyfriend was actually a man. Seizing the opportunity, I stepped closer, flashing the millionaire a flirtatious smile.

My simple minded son is already in his 40s and he still hasn't met a partner. Usually he's a complete mess, but today he cleaned up nicely, all just to stick armpit hair on his bald head and use my flowers to mask his body odor. I have to admit, he can be clever sometimes, but my flowers wilted because of the smell. He rolled up his sleeve to show off his muscle, only to realize his left arm was underdeveloped, so he used my bra as a makeshift muscle. Seeing the ugly hair on his stomach, he tried to wax it with a candle, almost making me burst out laughing. Honestly, he's so clumsy he could have just buttoned his shirt. Suddenly the doorbell rang. Starving, he slipped, splattering red wax on my face. The pain nearly made me gag. He shoved ice cubes into his pants to soothe it, which got them wet instantly, but the trick worked. Finally, he faced his bad breath, spraying perfume straight into his mouth, then yanked my hair abruptly. Luckily, I knew how to fix it, smoothing it out gently until it was barely noticeable. After all that prep, he chickened out at the last moment, so I had to quietly step in, help him. Some things only a mother can do. When his date arrived, I quickly retreated. I have to say, his girlfriend was absolutely amazing.

After the harvest was done, the goats took over the transport job. Then the donkey arrived pulling a truck. The goats used their horns to collect the wheat. Meanwhile, the ducks stood on the truck, arranging the wheat neatly. To finish the task as quickly as possible, the donkey tied a rope around the horse's neck. Once the horse adjusted its position, it started pulling the large harvester. The moment the horse passed through, the wheat disappeared at an amazing speed. At the same time, the ducks were pulling out weeds. The pigs skillfully used sickles. They worked more and more efficiently, moving faster and faster. The farmer made a lot of money because of this. This made the hunters extremely jealous, so they planned to raid the animal farm. Luckily, the pigeons brought back the news. This allowed the animals to prepare in advance. The geese hid in the haystacks. The goats painted themselves green to blend into the grass. The hens hid inside the scarecrows. Once all the animals were ready, the hunters arrived, but they were shocked to find not a single animal in sight. Just then, a pig suddenly banged on a pot. The hunters who heard the sound immediately started searching. But what they didn't know was that the animals had already set traps for them. At the pigs command, his companions pushed barrels down the Hillside. The hunters suddenly panicked and could only run. In all directions. At that moment, the battle began. All the hidden animals emerged to fight the hunters, but the hunters had firearms. The animals paid a heavy price for this. After a long battle, the animals finally won. Unfortunately, they were also seriously injured in the fight.

That was exactly what I needed. I met my girlfriend at Alcoholics Anonymous. I'm shaky, she's shakier. And somehow we keep each other standing. We're the kind of couple who checks in on each other after hard days and celebrates monthly milestones with fancy coffee instead of champagne. So riot is the reason both of us are alive. My girlfriend is 18 months clean when this whole thing starts. Her best friend from high school, Melanie, shows up the week my girlfriend gets out of treatment with flowers and a speech about being there for her. She hugs my girlfriend for a long time and tells her she's so proud of her. I think it's sweet. However, it starts small, so small I feel stupid for even noticing. Melanie brings wine for herself when she visits our place but always leaves the bottle in our fridge like she forgot it. The first and second time it happened, I throw out the bottle and say nothing. The third time, the bottle is practically full and I mention it to my girlfriend. She just shrugs and says Melanie's always been forgetful. So I let it go. Then one night, my girlfriend mentions almost offhand, you know, Melanie keeps joking about how one drink won't hurt. She says I'm being too intense about this whole sobriety thing. My chest titans. But I tell myself Melanie just doesn't understand. People who haven't been through addiction don't get it. Melanie starts posting throwback photos on Instagram of my girlfriend wasted at parties, eyes half closed, red cup in hand. And she tags my girlfriend in every single one. The captions are always something like miss my party girl or remember when we actually had fun. My girlfriend goes quiet for hours after those posts. I noticed she starts pacing before Melanie's visits, picking up.

I was a student at Santa Monica Tech when Mister Trilling spoke to our class about using science to improve an everyday product. What was the name of the auditorium where he spoke?

He tried to fill the other arm neck, only to realize the supply had run out, which made him furious. Glancing at his wife, he noticed she still had plenty left, so he immediately started draining the fat from her belly. Within moments, her entire body collapsed into a saggy, weakened shell. She woke up in shock, catching him in the act of stealing her fat. She tried to stand, but was too weak and fell back onto the couch. Instead of helping, he mocked her, grabbed the hose, and began inflating her thin arm with the very fat he stole, and filled the rest of her body until she matched his twisted idea of perfect. She stared at him, thinking quickly, and suddenly came up with a plan. She began laughing at his ridiculously skinny leg, provoking him. Instantly enraged, he shoved the hose into his leg and started pumping, hitting himself. While he was distract, she cranked the machine to maximum power. The pressure spike caused it to malfunction, and his body began swelling uncontrollably. She locked him in place as he tried to chase her, but his inflated weight pulled him down, leaving him flailing helplessly on the floor. Taking advantage of the chaos, he used the remaining fat to clean up the dead skin on her own body. Once done, she kicked the machine, causing it to explode. He stared in terror, but before he could react, she delivered a powerful kick to his backside, sending him rolling out of the house like a giant ball, bouncing all the way down the street. At last she was free from him for good.

The shock nearly made her lose control. If he ever saw her real face, he was certain he'd leave her instant. But at that moment, a waitress spotted them and became absurdly thrilled. The woman snatched flowers straight from her hand. Panicking, she yanked the tablecloth to hide herself, only to fling an entire spread of food onto her boyfriend's clothes. To her astonishment, he calmly removed his shirt, exposing muscle fibers that rippled like twisting tongues. The waitress fell head over heels on the spot. While he wiped ace, she dashed to the restroom. Her makeup needed urgent rescue before he noticed anything. But her nerve betrayed her and everything in her bag spilled onto the floor. The waitress crushed her foundation under, then sprayed water directly onto her exposed skin. It was obvious the woman was targeting her boyfriend, and when she caught a glimpse of her real face, the waitress erupted into hysterical laugh. She was convinced the boyfriend would dump her immediately. Burning with humiliation and rage, she pressed her skin lace patch onto the waitress's face face, and even claimed the woman's eyebrows for herself. The laughter died instant. Even a well traveled old lady who happened to see the waitress swore she just encountered a creature from folklore. Terrified, the old woman pulled out across, hoping it would shield.

Eighty two year old James, who had been battling pancreatic cancer, lived alone in the hospital. He never married and had adopted a son when he was younger, years of stress and isolation eventually LED to his cancer diagnosis. His adopted son rarely visited, always claiming to be too busy with work. So it was Nurse Annie who cared for James day and night.

I took a test myself and sure enough, I was pregnant. I didn't tell my ex. He already had a new girlfriend and I wanted to deal with this on my own. But he kept showing up asking me to help him run the student council with him. I was sick of it and told him to stay out of my life. He looked hurt and kept asking what he'd done wrong, saying he could fix it. You can't fix it. What the hell did I ever do to you, Claire? You got me pregnant. When I finally told him the truth, he froze. We had used Protection and he refused to believe anything had gone wrong. He didn't know how to explain it to his new girlfriend or her mom. What a coward. I never asked him to take responsibility. Anyway, after that, he stayed quiet and stopped bothering me. Then I finally got some good news. I got accepted into Columbia University. I was so excited. I hugged Ali. But right then I started bleeding heavily. Ali thought it meant I wasn't pregnant, but something felt Wrong. I thought something was happening to the baby, so we rushed to the hospital. Neither of us realized someone else was in the bathroom stall. Zoe heard everything. She even figured out who the father was.

They needed to collect some important samples to maintain the horse's pure bloodline. After half an hour of tension, he finally made it out of the stable unharmed. Back at the farm, Jimmy just wanted to take a shower. But more than that, he wanted to get rid of the smell on him. At that moment, Rita suddenly appeared. Jimmy closed his eyes, feeling embarrassed, and Rita couldn't help but laugh at his awkward reaction, teasing him a little. After chatting for a while, Rita mentioned a dinner date. Jimmy, a bit shy, still, tried to act casual. The two went to a restaurant in town, enjoying their meal while sharing their experiences. As the evening wore on, Jimmy drove Rita back to her house. Standing at her doorstep, the awkward atmosphere lingered. In Jimmy's words, it was his first date with a Texas girl. Fortunately, Rita was more bold and direct, and under her guidance, the two naturally moved toward a closer relationship.

No one expected that she bought all the chickens to give them away on the street for free to people experiencing homelessness at a Sam's Club in Los Angeles. When she placed the final rotisserie chicken into her cart, the customers around her couldn't hold back anymore. Some called her selfish. Some said she was ruining the holiday spirit. And someone even yelled at her, a Christian like you wouldn't do things like this. Everyone assumed she was hoarding, reselling or trying to make a profit. But she simply stayed quiet, smiled and proceeded to check out. She didn't argue, not even once, because she knew every judgment was wrong. A few hours later, the same woman appeared on the streets of Los Angeles. She didn't take the chickens home, didn't resell them at a higher price. Instead, she set up a folding table on the sidewalk, cut the warm chickens, plated them and handed them out. She chose to remind everyone in her own way, don't rush to judge others because you never know someone might be quietly doing what you never would. What do you think of this?

Leopard like a mountain lion or bigger spots like a jaguar, you know, jaguar. It attacked you. I killed it. You're pretty far from anything and I don't see a horse off the train. Pick poor spot to get off. I'm not hiding from anything. I'm trying to get home. Well, that's the truth. Your train tickets on us. All you're gonna do out here is die. You're 30 miles from water.

Then his teammate released the skateboard's connector, sending it sliding rapidly beneath the passenger filled bus behind them. Because terrorists had planted multiple bombs under the bus, if the speed dropped below 50, the bombs would detonate. So the police could only use this method to send bomb disposal expert Jimmy under the bus. With the bus drivers cooperation, he successfully reached the bomb's location. Drawing on years of bomb disposal experience, Jimmy quickly found the bomb's control wire. But just as he was about to cut it, the high speed skateboard suddenly hit a piece of rubber on the road. It instantly lost control. Even the safety rope up front couldn't hold it back. In the critical moment, Jimmy grabbed onto the bus chassis in time, avoiding being crushed by the spinning wheels. But the danger wasn't over. If this continued, his strength would soon run out. Worse still, the massive pulling force had snapped the safety rope connecting the skateboard board. By now, no matter how strong Jimmy's arms were, he could no longer stop the skateboard from sliding backward. Watching death draw closer and closer, Jimmy directly jammed the screwdriver into the fuel tank to use as a handhold. With his other hand, he grabbed an iron frame on the chassis. This finally freed his entire body from the skateboard. Passengers on the bus quickly opened the floor and pulled Jimmy up together. But this wasn't the Time to celebrate yet. The fuel tank had been punctured and was now leaking continuously. In less than 10 minutes, the bus would stop and everyone would be killed in the explosion. Since they couldn't defuse the bomb, police brought in a flatbed truck to drive alongside the bus, hoping to rescue the passengers this way. Only the first passenger was lucky. When it was the second passenger's turn, the bomber suddenly triggered a bomb under the door. The step was instantly blown open with a hole, and the woman fell from the bus and lost her life. Jimmy felt very guilty about this, but it also made him realize there must be a surveillance camera installed in the bus. That's how the bomber knew their every move. Sure enough, after some searching, he found a pinhole camera lens in a corner above the door. After learning this, the captain quickly had the radio station intercept transmission signals in the area and replace them with footage of the current bus, then loop it. They hoped to fool the bomber. In reality, they had already started the rescue operation. With the efforts of the police and Jimmy, all passengers were soon transferred to the bus on the other side. The bomber didn't notice anything unusual. Now only the driver and Jimmy remained on the bus. To escape alive, Jimmy used a metal rod to hold down the gas pedal, then tied one end of a rope to the steering wheel and The other end to an iron plate. Then they lay on the iron plate and escaped from under the bus. The bus changed its direction due to the ropes pulling force and finally crashed into an abandoned airplane and exploded.

Then he set up his gun in the distance and waited for his prey. Shortly after, a van approached and stopped directly beneath the shoes. The doors opened and two men looked around to confirm no one was watching before hiding smuggled weapons in a hole. Just then, the old man fired a shot into the air. Startled men immediately hit the ground. Thinking the police were ambushing them, the old man fired another shot. The men relaxed, thinking it was just a hunter nearby, then continued their work. When they got back into the van, the real trap began. The old man raised his rifle and aimed for the sneakers hanging high up. The bullet hit the target and the shoes instantly split open. White powder rained down, covering the back of the van. The two men, completely unaware, drove straight toward the heavily guarded border. However, during the inspection of police dog suddenly stopped sniffing the back of their vehicle. The officer noticed the anomaly and immediately signaled his colleagues to search. Without giving the two men time to react, police swarmed them and immediately subdued them. All of this was the old man's plan. He wasn't a police officer, he just wanted to teach the gang a lesson. But the Mafia boss didn't back down. Instead, he became even more reckless. So the old man put on a mechanic's uniform and infiltrated the Heavily guarded, parted villa. He deliberately made strange noises to distract the butler. Then he pulled out his camera and secretly photographed the villa's interior layout.

Everyone immediately realized this monster would not be easy to capture. At this moment, the old man suddenly fired a gunshot.

In an instant, the ladder detached from the iron tower. Luckily, she was wearing a safety harness, with the other end of the rope connected to her best friend's thigh at the top of the tower. To rescue her from the dizzying height, her friend used the iron pillar strength to pull the rope up bit by bit, while she cooperated by climbing up. Finally, after exhausting all their energy, she grabbed onto the remaining ladder, which was less than a meter long, temporarily escaping the life threatening danger. Now they faced an even bigger problem. With the ladder gone, how are they supposed to get down? Due to the high altitude, their cell phones couldn't receive any signal. However, her friend had a bold idea. He took off her bra, stuffed it into her shoe as padding, quickly typed out a distress message, put her phone in the shoe and then threw the shoe down. This way the phone could reach the ground safely and there was a chance that the message could be successfully sent before the phone displayed. Message sending failed on receiving a signal on the ground. But even after waiting until the next day, no rescue came. After being thirsty for a day, their skin had already started to crack. Her friend decided to take matters into her own Hands to survive! They had a drone in their backpack. But because of the ladder breaking earlier, the backpack had fallen from her onto the satellite pot below. Her friend prepared to go down and retrieve it, which was obviously a crazy move. One misstep and she'd be smashed to pieces. Without the latter, she instantly lost her support and her body was left dangling in midair. But with her excellent rock climbing experience, she quickly regained her grip on the rope, placing her feet on the iron pillar and inching her way down. This distance of less than 10 meters took her an hour to complete. However, the rope was a bit too short, and no matter how much she stretched, she couldn't reach the backpack. Staring at the backpack that was so close, yet so far, she decided to take a gamble. She unhooked the carabiner from her waist and gripped the end of the rope with one hand, allowing her body to descend a little further. But even then, there was still a small gap between her and the backpack. Suspended in Madeira, she had no way back. With a forceful kick against the pillar, she swung her body through the air. Then, seizing the right moment, she leaped, successfully landing on the satellite pot. So how was she supposed to return?

After all, her in laws had always treated her kindly. So she made a decision, if Jack didn't want her on the trip, she'd go anyway on her own terms. At the airport, she didn't sneak away as Jack expected. Instead, she confidently boarded the same plane as her husband. By morning, they were heading to the hotel Jack had booked. Pasha was ready to immerse herself in Europe's beauty. But Jack had other plans for this journey.

Waiting for the money to fall, the young man tucked his bank card back into his pocket, unaware that the withdrawn bills had slid directly into Carl's trousers. The young man turned and walked away, while Carl calmly adjusted his trousers, pretending to be busy with business, carefully moved the cash to a more secure spot. Just as he was about to grab the bank card, Sonny suddenly spun around, anxiously asking Carl if he had seen it. Carl played innocent, claiming ignorance, but the bank card sticking out of his pocket betrayed him. Sunny lunched to snatch it, and a passing police officer saw the scuffle, demanding to know why sunny was trying to steal. Sunny insisted the card belonged to him, so the officer retrieved it from Carl's back pocket. Sonny then claimed that the cash he had just withdrawn must also be with Carl. As the officer prepared to investigate further, an elderly man appeared unexpectedly on the scene. Seeing this, sunny bolted, but the officer quickly restrained him. It turned out the old man didn't know how to operate the ATM and had only approached sunny for assistance, unaware that sunny intended to steal his money. After hearing the old man's story, Carl seized the chance and cleverly recovered the cash, returning it to its rightful owner.

In fact, she specialized in staged accidents, and her trunk was filled with tools for her schemes. That day, she noticed a man who had just bought an oversized TV blocking his rearview mirror, leaving him to rely on the side mirrors. So Maggie positioned herself in the blind spot, and sure enough, a scream rang out and the man saw her knocked down. He intended to offer help, but seeing the expensive car, she immediately went into full dramatic mode, clutching her head, securing a large payout. As expect. This made Maggie even more confident, yet she did not stop. She quickly regroup, searching for her next victim. Soon her eyes landed on an elderly woman scavenging for recyclables. Seeing the woman's polished appearance, Maggie knew it was going to be a big score. As the elderly woman got into her car and prepared to start, Maggie readied herself, only to be unexpectedly struck by another speeding vehicle. The woman inside the car saw none of it, still attempting to reverse and drive away. With a sudden jolt, the car ran over Maggie, prompting the elderly woman to call emergency services immediately. Firefighters arrived quickly, and the woman explained the situation as they assessed the scene. Maggie was no stranger to them, but this time she had actually been injured. The firefighters reassured her repeatedly. Saying it was only a minor injury that could be treated quickly. Soon they lifted Maggie from under the car. She was taken to the hospital for a full examination. At this point, she still hadn't realized her wrongdoing, continuing to demand double compensation. The firefighters could only warn her, this kind of behavior is extremely dangerous, and one wrong move could cost her life.

Alright, so you struck up a conversation that way. And how'd everything else go? It went great from there. We just started, we had a couple of more drinks. We were talking the whole rest of the night and probably like 11:30 or midnight, place was getting slowing down. She ended up whispering. She said, let's go back to your place. And I was amazed. I was like, what a way.

I think it's Wink Martindale. And all of a sudden this little man starts pumping his foot, pumping his foot. And that's how we get in there. He's pumping that plane. And I don't know if I saw a glacier. I don't know if I saw one one, because I mean, it was all white everywhere. But also I was praying. I was praying and I took my purse handle. My little daddy, all of my life has been scared to death something would happen to me or my sister. And he would say, don't you dare get on a motorcycle. That was one of the things. And it would just scare me to death. I was like, I'm not going to. Well, my husband buys one and says, because we're 30 minutes from the Smoky Mountains, let's go ride in the mountains. And I thought, oh my lord, if I get on this thing, he's gonna pull off into the bushes and make me do something horrible. And my boy was 9 years old and we joined Pop Warner football.

And I drift off to sleep. And then my husband remembers me, and I'm over here, dead to the world. And he reaches over and grabs one of my breasts, and it put. I've got on a girdle from here to here, and I can feel fat coming out of the back. I want y'all to know that I was so cute in the 80s. I really was. All right, I'm 57 years old, and. And I want, I. I've gained weight, and I'm really trying to do better. But if that'll mean stupid Covid, I wanna blame the mean, stupid Covid and Vladimir Putin. So my husband does work for that big mobile home company, but one of the perks there that they give us is they send us on these trips, unbelievable trips all over the world. But sometimes it'll be like Alaska, somewhere like that. Sometimes it's been overseas, but say, for instance, Alaska. And they all. We sign up for excursions before we go. My husband signed us up to go on a float plane to see a glacier. And we walk up to this dock, and there's this little float plane floating in the water, and They line us up on this dock, and this little crusty man with a pack of marbles, reds, comes up to me and says, what do you weigh? And I lied. I lied and I watched nine more people. He has nine more people. And I watch them all lie. And I thought, oh, my Lord, I can be in the pickup line at school.

And they're goosing each other and giggling and doing and talking and having a good time. They're waving to the teachers and the principal. See you tomorrow, okay?

And they got on those jumpsuits with those weighted things in the back, and they had those hats on, and everybody had their hair shaved and all that. And so that school had a big thing where it was like Daddy Day, where your dad comes and talks about what they do for a living. And so they had these air.

I went through all these hormonal changes and I had to change my panties. I'll just tell y'all. I used to wear Victoria's Secret and they started cutting me in two and I bought, who are these really for? Little children. Who are these for? I switched over to a big penny company and I. They've got these gowns that have a cool technology in them and I wear those most of the time. But I. I held on to these two little gowns from target. They're no big deal. They're no big deal. They're just a cotton little gown. And every time I put one of them on, my husband's like, he really does not believe in fancy cars. He doesn't think anybody needs a nice car. My children drive old, old beat up cars. And what he does for me, he'll buy me a car about a year old, pay cash for it, and then make me drive it the rest of my life. I finally had to put my foot down cause I was driving a 2,009 white Honda Pilot. And they're wonderful cars, but if you don't know what that model looks like, it looks like I was delivering Lay's potato chips. I never felt pretty in it. It Had over 239,000 miles on it.

You have to hand him over to another woman. And my boys said to me, mom, she is but my best friend. She's gonna be my wife. I'm supposed to cling to her. That's biblical.

I bet y'all are a lot like him, cause my husband's like that. Very driven and overachiever. And he. I had to hide from him that I was watching Real Housewives because he thought it was awful. He goes, what are you watching? This mess? And I would have to get the remote and do this real quick and change it before he got up to the bedroom.

Just let me tell y'all I was in a bad place, okay? I was in a bad place and I think I gone up a size in my pants and she asked me About Jlo, she goes she going to heaven and I said I don't know I don't know I think she needs to mature spiritually and um, she's going through a lot of men right now. I said it, I remember saying it and it was wrong and I'm sorry and I should have never said it. One reason I should have said it, I went through as many men as Jlo ever thought about going through. When my boy and his wife found out about this precious baby, they would say their baby and we would say our baby and then they started using words like boundaries and I thought to myself, they don't know what's about to hit them. They're gonna have this precious baby and they're gonna be up all night and that's gonna go into weeks and months and then my little daughter in law is gonna start hallucinating and then she's gonna wake up the night she'll be breastfeeding a lamp and we'll see who's got boundaries. Well, I was right. So they work full time, both of them and my daughter in law has been going to NBA school at night and on the weekends. So they are so tired and crazy they don't even know their own name.

And my middle one was running around and she had a pacifier and she looked at the baby, said, does the baby need the pacifier? And put the, put it in her mouth and then went over to my boy and said, do you need to blow your nose? And he went, so she got Kleenex and he did it. And then she was just as busy and throwing that in the trash can and work like a doll. And then it pans over to me and I'm over in a bad looking pair of pajamas going, did y'all ever go to a lock in? What little fool came up with that? Y'all know that it was some precious little woman maybe.

I looked at the unfamiliar face, thinking he must be new and didn't recognize me, so I politely explained. Just put it on your boss's tab. She knows about it. The mail manager gave me a dismissive glance. Sir, this is a three Michelin star restaurant. We never allow tabs. He finished speaking, then handed me a printed Bill. I glanced down at it. A single meal, half a million dollars. Glow up cutlery maintenance fee $30,000 exclusive air purification fee $50,000 VIP emotional appeasement service fee $100,000 and a bunch of other ridiculous charges. I had no idea my sister ran such a rip off joint. I let out a sarcastic laugh. I'm Adrian Hayes, Miss Hayes's brother. If there's an issue, she can come home and talk to me. But he wouldn't back down. If you can't afford it, just say so. Don't try to piggyback on Miss Hayes's name. I've seen plenty of pretty boys trying to sponge off women. I texted my assistant. Astros, tell my sister, either fire this guy or I'm pulling all my investments. Sir, stop wasting everyone's time. Just pay. His tone was smug and cutting, as if he'd already labeled me a scoundrel trying to climb the ladder on a woman's coat tails. Several curious glances were already turning my way. I frowned, not wanting to Waste time on such a ridiculous matter? I pulled out my phone and dialed my sister's number directly, but all I got was a cold, busy signal. I tried again. Same result. It's a weekday. What's that girl up to? I put down my phone and looked straight at the aggressive man, repeating each word clearly. I'll say it again. My name is Adrian Hayes, and I am the biological brother of your boss, Serena Hayes. Her phone isn't answering right now. You can check her card. My photo and information are linked to it. I thought this was the most direct and effective way to solve the problem. But when the male manager heard my name, instead of verifying it, he burst into a loud, exaggerated and grating laugh. He laughed so hard he almost doubled over, drawing even more attention. Then he suddenly leaned in close, lowering his voice to a whisper only we could hear. Still pretending. I've seen your face in Serena's photo album a thousand times. You're that persistent creep who always tries to interfere with our lives. And now you have the nerve to show up at her restaurant and put your tab on her. Who do you think you are? I froze for a second, then glanced at his name tag. Brendan Miller. An overwhelming sense of exasperation washed over me. Serena's boyfriend. The one she'd been so secretive about. The one she wouldn't even let me see a single photo of it. Turned out to be this foolish, venomous man right in front of me. How could her taste be this bad? It dawned on me then. Today's half million dollar exorbitant Bill wasn't a misunderstanding at all. It was a premeditated humiliation. Before I could even speak, he completely lost his patience. If this gentleman insists on dining and dashing, we'll have to restrain him until the police arrive. He waved his hand and two burly security guards who had been standing nearby immediately stepped forward. They were two well trained, strong men, two fists against four hands. My resistance was quickly subdued and my arms were twisted tightly behind my back. I struggled violently, but couldn't break free from their professional hold. They ignored my furious gaze and the frightened looks of the other guests, roughly dragging me towards the back kitchen. Then I was violently shoved into the storeroom in the back, reeking of disinfectant and stale, greasy slop. The door slammed shut, cutting off all light and sound from outside in the dark. The male manager said nothing. He simply raised his leather clad foot and kicked me hard in the stomach. The excruciating pain made me grunt instantly, my stomach churning. That's for spending my woman's money! That's for meddling in her business! He yelled, his voice twisted by jealousy and rage. He looked down at me, then ordered the two burly men beat him! Teach him a lesson! The two security guards were clearly his cronies. They didn't hesitate, a relentless flurry of punches and kicks raining down on me. I gritted my teeth, swallowing every cry of pain. My bones felt like they were being crushed. Inch by inch, my internal organs dislodged. His taunts continued. Who do you think you are, huh? Just a good for nothing leeching off his sister? I told you, I'm her brother. If you don't believe me, ask Serena. Call her now. I'll talk to her. I struggled to explain, but the man in front of me just ignored it. It wasn't until I started feeling dizzy that he raised a hand, signaling them to stop. He nudged my shoulder with the tip of his leather shoe, looking at me triumphantly. You better settle the Bill today and cough up another half million. That's the consequence of you interfering in my relationship with Serena and spending her money. I'm not afraid of trouble. Serena will handle any fallout for me. I was curled in a ball of pain, weakly trying to argue. That's my own money, I told you. If you don't believe me, go ask her. His face changed. He kicked me, and the two security guards immediately understood, their punches and kicks raining down on me again. I knew he wouldn't listen to anything I said. If this continued, I could be seriously hurt. After I coughed up a mouthful of blood, I used my last ounce of strength to grope for my phone on the floor. Stop! I'll pay. He seemed satisfied with my submission, signaling the two security guards to stop, squatted down and patted my swollen cheek. See? Wouldn't it have been easier to just do that from the start? You chose the hard way. Two million, not a cent less. I lay sprawled on the cold floor, gasping for breath, my lungs burning. I ignored him and dialed my friend Leo Rodriguez's number. The phone was answered quickly. Leo, bring two million to my sister's restaurant. I need it now. Leo, on the other end, paused, then said something was wrong. Adrian, what's wrong, man? Your voice sounds. Don't ask, just hurry. I cut him off and hung up. Brendan's eyes instantly lit up at the mention of two million. A greedy glint flashed in them. He probably thought I was beaten into submission, offering more money to beg for mercy. The triumph on his face was now impossible to hide. Smart move. Leo's speed was astonishing. Soon the storeroom door was violently shoved open from the outside. Leo, accompanied by two bodyguards, strode in quickly. He was shocked to see the blood on my mouth, my disheveled clothes, and my pathetic posture propped up on the floor. He rushed over to help me up. I shook my head, subtly signalling him to stay silent, then took the bank card he handed me with the PIN attached and tossed it to the man. The man took the card and didn't bother me further. Waving his hand, if that's a fake card, I have countless ways to find you. Get lost! Enduring the excruciating pain throughout my body, I limped out of that sickening place, leaning on Leo's arm. When we reached the entrance, I thanked Leo. Thanks, Buddy. I'll get this sorted and pay you back quickly. He looked at me worriedly. Don't worry about the money. It's nothing. But what happened to you, I sneered. My sister found herself a fine boyfriend. I guess I have a score to settle with her. I pulled out my phone and found the number for the restaurant's assistant general manager, Mr. Peterson. Mr. Peterson was the restaurant's actual manager, someone I had personally recruited, and he was quite loyal to me. The call connected. I wasted no words, my voice devoid of emotion. You have 10 minutes to fire a manager named Brendan Miller. Otherwise Hayes Enterprises will withdraw all investment from the restaurant. Every last cent. Mr. Peterson, on the other end, was scared shitless the moment he heard my voice. He must have heard the weakness and the unusual edge in my voice as he agreed in quick, terrified succession. Not even daring to ask why, I hung up the phone and without a moment's pause, told Leo to take me straight to the police station. With the clearest, calmest logic, I recounted everything that had just happened to the officer who assisted me. After giving a detailed statement at the police station, I went to the hospital for an injury assessment. I held that thin report in my hand, and the fury of betrayal, as if fueled by hot oil, burned hotter and fiercer within me. I needed an explanation. I needed Serena Hayes to give me an explanation herself. My assistant found out Serena was at her villa. My driver and bodyguards arrived, and we headed straight for Serena's place. That villa was also a gift for me. However, when I arrived, I was greeted by blaring heavy metal music and the raucous sounds of men and women echoing through the doors and windows. She was throwing a party. No wonder she hadn't answered my calls. The villa's main door was ajar, and on a strange impulse, I didn't push it open immediately. Soon I heard a familiar male voice. It was Brendan Miller. He was pouring out his story to everyone, painting himself as a poor, helpless victim bullied by an arrogant third party, EMI, who then had the audacity to turn the tables and accuse him. I just asked him to pay the Bill, and he threw $2 million in my face, then found people to get me fired. Serena, he's gone too far. He doesn't respect you at all. He just wants to humiliate me. He just wants us to break up. Inside, Serena's circle of friends, mostly hangers on and troublemakers, echoed his outrage. Serena, in turn, was loudly comforting Brendan in her arms, her voice full of Tenderness and indulgence. Brendan, don't worry, I won't let you suffer this injustice. Then, as if to prove her resolve, she promised everyone confidently, when I get my hands on my brother, I'll make him beg for your forgiveness on his knees. Inside, those spoiled brats were still backing Brendan, shouting about how they would make me pay. Serena, just say the word and we'll go drag that bastard out right now! Yeah, let him know who truly owns this place! I couldn't listen anymore. I raised a hand and my bodyguard kicked open the villa's front door. The booming music screeched to a halt, the noisy laughter instantly vanishing. Dozens of stunned eyes all at once turn towards the doorway. No need to drag me out, I'm right here.

These eyes, belonging to Jack, have been quietly observing her for the past 20 years. Every time the couple leaves for work, Jack becomes the master of the house. He opens the refrigerator, pairs breakfast and even does the housework. Yet no one suspects a thing. Her husband, believing she did all of it due to her amnesia, has never noticed anything unusual. Jack, over time, has come to see himself as part of the family, hiding in the closet or pondering her thoughts. His affection for her grows. And one day, unable to resist, he steps out of the shadows, lies on her bed and inhales the lingering scent of her presence. In that moment, he realizes he has fallen in love with her. But one day, while hiding in the closet, Jack sees Anna's husband bringing his mistress home. Listening in silence, Jack can no longer bear to watch the woman he loves being treated this way. Riven by anger, he devises a bold plan. He lures bees into a trash can. And when the husband opens it, a swarm attacks, stinging him to death. Jack watches it all from a distance, and from that moment, the husband is gone, leaving only Jack and Anna. As time passes, Jack can't hold back any longer. He steps out of the closet, slips into Anna's bed. And wraps his arms around her as she sleeps. Anna knows everything, and without protest, she quietly accepts his presence. The two of them, in their strange, silent understanding, are finally alone.

But before he could even savor his victory, a tentacle shot out from the shadows, snatching them off the ground. They were yanked high into the air. Helpless was a Luna bug, and they were its prey. Just as they were about to be swallowed whole, a little monkey dashed in, swooping down like a hero to save them at the last second. But the monster wasn't finished. Its massive tentacles thrashed wildly. Relentless, the little monkey darted into the razor sharp grass, using the blades as cover. But the tentacle monster was enormous. Undeterred by the grass cutting into its thick skin, Yacho wasn't about to let this monster win. He felled a giant tree with one swift strike, and used the falling trunk as a makeshift springboard. With the agility of a predator, he launched himself into the air and in one clean slash took down the beast. Victory in hand, Yatcha turned the monster's tentacles into a sizzling barbecue. He even tossed a piece of meat to the little monkey as a reward. But instead of gratitude, the monkey spat at him, a defiant gesture. I think she's marking you, someone said with a smirk. It was clear the little monkey was growing fond of Yatcha, mimicking his every move as if claiming him as her own.

With a rush of panic, they whisked her away to the hospital. The man, frantic, kept protesting, I didn't do anything, I swear! But then the doctor entered and with a heavy heart, confirmed the truth. She was in the final stage of cancer. His world froze. Regret washed over him. A few days later, he returned, bringing dinner to her hospital room, desperate to apologize. But by then it was too late. She had already lost all respect for him. He had ruined her final wish, her dream to wear a beautiful dress and dine at a fine French restaurant.

So I decided to show off my driving skill. But the examiner wasn't nervous in the slightest cause there was a brake pedal on the passenger side, too. I sternly warned him not to step on it or the car would lose its balance. Seeing how confident I looked, the examiner started to get nervous and quickly buckled his seatbelt. Excited, I slammed the gas pedal and the engine exploded right then and there. The examiner thought I had completely lost my mind and immediately canceled the test. But I didn't give up. The next day, I went back to find the examiner and begged him for another chance, saying I would pay for any damages from yesterday. When the examiner took the cash, he realized it was several times more than what was needed. Then it dawned on him. The extra money was an advance for any future damages. Tempted by the cash, examiner finally agreed. This time I didn't make a single mistake. I completed every task at lightning speed, drifted perfectly into the parking spot, and confidently stepped out of the car.

After the guard left, the woman, whose legs seemed to extend from her neck down, lifted her leg to retrieve the guard's key FOB. She then concealed the keys beneath of the car in a particularly ingenious manner. With preparations complete, Jackie Chan, concealed within the military base, initiated his operation. Relying on his cutting edge gear, he piloted himself right under the guards noses. He then executed a drift maneuver, accelerating toward a window. Ducking his head, he fired a micro missile to shatter the glass, successfully escaping the base building and landing smoothly on the ground. Only then did the guards realize it wasn't a car but a man. The entire team actively pursued Jackie Chan, but the guard captain discovered the key box in the guardhouse was missing. Jackie successfully slipped into the tunnel. With enemies closing in from both ends, he crawled under a car and slid along the wall. The pursuers turned the corner to inspect the wall. He dived back under the vehicle. The pursuers checked beneath the car but still couldn't find him. He burst out of the tunnel. Guards fired their guns, but it was too late.

He hid behind rocks, waiting for the enemy vehicles behind him to pass before diving under. 1, two vehicles drove down the mountain to join the blocking force. The moment they stopped, Jackie burst out from beneath the rear vehicle, knocking down the guard. Facing enemy trucks closing in from the front, he leaped to the cliff's edge, skillfully evading danger. He returned to the ground only to be startled. Having narrowly escaped death, enemy roadblocks now blocked the mountain's base. He skillfully dodged them using the walls. But the pursuing motorcyclist wasn't so fortunate. With enemy fire unleashed, he dove into a roadside sewer as planned. Emerging from the sewer, his teammate piloted a helicopter to catch him. The operation was a resounding success. Ultimately, Jackie Chan and his female assistant safely returned to their homeland.

When I asked, my dad said, it belongs to your sister. But I showed them every deposit and one in court. Growing up, I Learned early that fairness wasn't something our family believed in. My sister Lily got everything. Ballet lessons that cost hundreds a month, a brand new Honda at 16. College tuition paid in full without her lifting a finger. Me, I got a bus pass and a lecture about building character. When I asked for help with community college costs, dad said I'd appreciate my education more if I earned it myself. So I did. I worked weekends at a grocery store, picked up night shifts at a warehouse, took out loans I'm still paying off. Every dollar I made went toward tuition or rent or keeping myself fed. Meanwhile, Lily posted Instagram photos from spring break trips I could never afford. But I kept grinding. Got my engineering degree, landed a solid job, and started saving obsessively. No fancy dinners, no vacations, no new clothes, unless the old ones had holes. For five straight years, I funneled every bonus, every overtime check, every tax refund into one account. My house fund. When I finally had enough for a down payment, I found a small two bedroom condo on the edge of town. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. I called mom crying when my offer got accepted. She actually seemed happy for me. Threw me a little Celebration. Dinner that weekend. Lily showed up late, sat in the corner stirring her wine glass. Must be nice having that engineering salary, she muttered. Some of us are still paying off grad school. I tried to ignore the sting. Mom changed the subject quickly. The day I closed on the condo, dad came by to see it. Walked through every room, nodded slowly. Smart investment if you did it right, he said. I thought that was his version of being proud. Two weeks later, a process server knocked on my door. Legal paper. My parents were suing me for the house. I called dad immediately, hands shaking. What is this? His voice was cold. Matter of fact, that house belongs to your sister. Your mother and I discussed this with our attorney. The down payment came from inheritance money that was meant for Lily's first home. I felt like I've been punched. What inheritance? Grandma split everything equally. I never touched that money. Every cent for this house came from my paychecks. You're making this more complicated than it needs to be, he said. Lily needs that house more than you do. She's planning for it. You can buy another one later. I hung up and immediately called my bank. Pulled every statement from the last five years. Every deposit had a clear paper trail. Payroll transfers, direct deposits. Nothing from any inheritance account. When we got to court, their lawyer painted this picture of a greedy daughter who'd stolen Her sister's dream. Dad took the stand first. Confident and calm. He testified about a long standing family understanding that grandma's inheritance money was earmarked for Lily's first home purchase. Mom went next, dabbing her eyes with a tissue.
