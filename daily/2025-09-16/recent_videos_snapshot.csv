But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd discuss, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nurse free and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision, my husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

So my kids daycare had some family emergency and shut down for the day. They sent this email at like 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my stepbrother's girlfriend, Ashley. She doesn't work, just sits around all day while my stepbrother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, a whole designer purse collection. been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years. But whatever, I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200 for six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family Discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked a day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my stepbrother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My stepbrother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together. Now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency. My babysitter bailed, and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. Then I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the Day, the typing bubbles appear and disappear, like, five times. Then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. Just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me. You said it was the family rate, remember? You said you took this very seriously. She completely lost it. Started calling me every name in the book, saying I was petty and vindictive and that she was in a real emergency. I told her that's exactly what I said to her two years ago. The best part? She ended up having to call out of work anyway because nobody else would watch her kid for free on such short notice. And apparently, her manager was not happy about it.

This rich kid at my college paid me $500 to take his final exam. For him not cheat. Literally show up as him. See, Brad was this trust fund baby who partied through freshman year while I worked three jobs just to afford ramen. His dad threatened to cut him off if he failed chemistry. And Brad was looking at a solid F. Problem was, Brad and I looked almost identical. Same height, same messy brown hair. Even wore the same thick rimmed glasses. People mixed us up constantly. Which gave Brad a brilliant idea. He cornered me outside the library one Tuesday, panic in his eyes. You're a science major, right? Just walk in, take the test, walk out. 500 cash. I thought he was insane, but $500 was two months of rent money. My bank account had $47 in it, and my landlord was already leaving threatening notes. So I agreed to the stupidest plan ever. For two weeks, I lived and breathed chemistry. I memorized Brad's textbook, practiced his signature until my hand cramped. Even Learned to write with my left hand, since he was left handed. I studied his social media to copy his mannerisms. The kid barely knew what carbon was, but I was determined to nail this thing. I even got his roommate to help me practice. You need to slouch more, he said. Brad never sits up straight, and he always taps his pen when He's thinking the day of the exam, I showed up 20 minutes early, put up trying to look casual. My hands were shaking as I walked into the lecture hall. 200 students, and I was pretending to be someone else. The professor barely glanced at Brad student ID when I handed it over. Good luck, Bradley, he said without looking up. I found Brad's usual seat in the back corner and sat down. My heart was pounding so loud, I thought everyone could hear it. When they handed out the test, I felt confident. The first 30 questions were exactly what I'd studied. Molecular structures, chemical equations, periodic table stuff. I was flying through it. Then I hit question 47. Describe the quantum mechanical model of electron behavior in metallic bonding under extreme pressure conditions. I stared at the question for five full minutes. This wasn't just advanced chemistry. This was graduate level theoretical stuff. I'd never seen anything like it in Brad's textbook. That's when it hit me. Brad had been skipping so much class, he'd missed entire units. The professor had been covering cutting edge research while Brad was passed out in his dorm. I was complete. We screwed. Panic set in. I looked around the room. Everyone else was writing furiously. Some girl in the front row was already on the back page. I had two choices. Leave half the test blank and guarantee Brad fails, or make something up and hope for partial credit. So I Started inventing chemistry. I wrote about electrons forming pressure cascades and quantum tunnels under extreme conditions. I made up equations that sounded scientific but were complete nonsense. I described metals becoming molecularly fluid and electrons fade. He's shifting into higher dimensions. It was like writing science fiction, but with chemical formulas. When I handed in the test, the professor actually looked up from his papers. He flipped through my answers with raised eyebrows. Interesting approach, Bradley, he said slowly.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? I whispered. She wouldn't look at me. Just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot, next to me. That night, she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons. Just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them. Finger shaped bruises on her upper arms. Dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard. My hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the PE teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team. The one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything. How Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class. How he made her play a secret game. How it hurt. How he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at six am. Not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first. That calling police was premature. That Mr. Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

The Disney princess stopped mid autograph, stared at my ankle, then at my six year old daughter, Emma, then back at my ankle. Sir, is that she started clearly breaking character, which apparently requires something serious at the Happiest place on earth. It's not what you think, I said quickly, but Cinderella was already flagging security. Within minutes, I was surrounded by three guards and mouse ear hats trying to look threatening, while tourists took photos of what they assumed was part of the show. Here's the thing. I'm not a criminal. The ankle monitor was court ordered, but not for the reason everyone assumes. My ex wife, Patricia, claimed I was a flight risk during our custody battle. Said I might take Emma to Brazil because I'd renewed my passport. I renewed it for a work conference in Toronto. Judge still ordered the monitor as a caution until custody was finalized. I've been wearing it for three months, setting off every metal detector in Orange County. Emma didn't understand why Cinderella looked scared. Daddy, why is the princess sad? I knelt down, ankle monitor clicking against the pavement. She's just confused about daddy's special bracelet. Security moved closer. One spoke into his radio, we have a code yellow in fantasy land. I didn't know what that meant, but it sounded bad. Tourists started pulling their kids away from us. One mom loudly whispered, that's why we check The registry, Karen. The head of security, a surprisingly intimidating man named Raul, escorted us to Disney jail. Yes, that's a real thing. It's a small office behind Main Street that smells like churros and broken dreams. Emma thought it was a VIP experience. Are we getting special Mickey ears? She asked. Raul pulled up my information on his computer. His expression shifted from suspicious to confused to sympathetic. City battle? He asked quietly. I nodded. He sighed. My brother went through the same thing. Judge made him wear one for six months because his ex said he'd flee to Cuba. He's never even been to Cuba. Raul made some calls 20 minutes late. Later, we had a Disney escort. Not because I was dangerous, but because Raul felt bad. No kids should have their Disney trip ruined by adult problems, he said. Our escort, Jerome, was a former NBA player who'd retired to work at Disney because he loved making kids happy. Emma rode on his shoulders the entire day. We skipped every line, got front row seats to every show. Jerome told everyone I was a special guest, which technically wasn't a lie. The ankle monitor kept setting off the sensors on rides. Space Mountain stopped three times because of me. They had to manually override the system. By the third ride, the operators knew me by name. Ankle monitor dad is back, they'd radio ahead. It became a running joke. One operator said, you know, we've had Weapons, drugs, even a snake once. But you're our first ankle monitor. I chose to take that as an achievement. Plot twist came at dinner. We were at the character meal when goofy sat down at our table. He pointed at my ankle, then did an elaborate MIME of being arrested, going to court, then being innocent. Emma laughed hysterically. Goofy's silly daddy. But then goofy pulled out his phone.

So I gave him exactly what he asked for. It started when I wore a tank top and shorts to the grocery store on a 90 degree day. You're not leaving the house dressed like a SLT, my dad said. While I was grabbing my car keys, I looked down at my completely normal summer outfit. Cover yourself up because I'm not having my daughter walking around looking like she's for sale, he continued. His face red with anger. I went back upstairs and changed into jeans and a hoodie despite the heat. And he nodded approvingly while saying this was about respect and dignity and protecting my reputation. That night I did some online shopping with his credit card since he cared so much about my clothing choices. Thank you for helping me understand modesty, I said. The next morning wearing a full length denim dress that covered everything except my hands and face. He seemed pleased until we got to his office barbecue where everyone kept asking if I was feeling okay and why I was dressed for winter. She's exploring modest fashion, he explained uncomfortably, while his co workers exchanged concerned looks and I stood there sweating through three layers of fabric. Monday, I wore a beekeeper's suit to school because dad had been very clear about covering up and protecting myself from unwanted attention. The principal called him within an hour asking if Everything was alright at home and whether I was being forced to wear extreme religious garments, it just a phase, my dad told them. But I made sure to explain loudly in the main office that my father said my body was shameful and needed to be completely hidden from men's eyes. The counsellor started taking notes while my dad's face turned purple. Tuesday brought his important client dinner at the country club and I arrived in a full birka. I'd ordered express shipping from Amazon. This is our daughter, my dad said weekly, as his Japanese investors stared in complete confusion. They kept asking questions about our family's religious beliefs and whether this was common in American households while I sat silently eating through my face covering. His biggest client pulled him aside to discuss their concerns about doing business with someone who had such extreme views about women. And I heard my dad desperately trying to explain it was just teenage rebellion. Wednesday, I upgraded to a hazmat suit for his company picnic because he'd mentioned Protection so many times that biological Protection seemed appropriate. His boss's wife cornered him by the potato salad to express her deep concern about what was happening in our home. If you need resources for controlling behavior or religious extremism, we have employee assistance programs, she said, while I stood nearby in my yellow containment suit explaining to anyone who asked that my dad said my skin was too dangerous to be Exposed to the public, Thursday was parent teacher conferences and I wore a Victorian morning dress, complete with a black veil that covered my entire face. My teacher asked my dad Point Blank if he was abusing me or forcing me into a cult while I sat there looking like a Gothic ghost from 1850. She seems to be crying for help, the teacher said sternly, while my dad tried to explain that I was doing this to myself. But she'd already seen my essay about how my father called me a slut for wearing normal clothes. Friday, I went full throttle when I wore a full medieval suit of armour to his promotion announcement dinner because nothing says covered up like actual metal plating. The clanking drew everyone's attention as I walked in and his regional manager immediately asked why his daughter was dressed like she was going into battle. My dad says my body is a weapon that needs to be contained. I announced to the entire restaurant and several people took out their phones to record while my dad tried to disappear into his chair. His promotion was put on hold pending an investigate into his home situation. Saturday morning, the neighbours had organised an intervention after seeing me mow the lawn in a radiation suit all week. We're concerned about your daughter's well being, Mrs. Jacob said, while six other concerned parents stood behind her. They documented everything with photos and time, time stamps, creating what they Called evidence of escalating abuse. My dad kept insisting I was doing this to spite him, but I maintained perfect innocence and said I was just following his rules about modesty and covering my shame full body. By Sunday, his girlfriend had dumped him via text, she couldn't date someone who psychologically tortured his daughter. His boss had suggested he take family leave to deal with his issues and Child Protective Services had opened a case file after receiving 17 different reports from concerned citizens. He sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while I stood there in my newest purchase, which was a full deep sea diving suit, complete with brass helmet. Please stop this, he begged. But I reminded him that he said I dressed like a slut and needed to cover up. Fine. Wear whatever you want, he said in defeat. But then his phone rang and his lawyer's name appeared on the screen. My mom had heard about everything from concerned friends and was filing for.

The compensation was $800 plus a hotel voucher. This businessman in an expensive suit storms over and taps my shoulder. Hey, you should volunteer. I have a million dollar deal closing tomorrow. I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position. I ignored him completely and moved to a different seat across the gate area. He actually follows me and sits down again. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area, starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally and He's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly to Anyone who'll make eye contact, then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now. Just take the voucher, I told him.

I froze in the chair, Scissors still hovering over my head. What missing person poster, I asked. But Tony was already walking to the window. He pointed at a flyer taped to the glass outside his shop. That one missing guy named Jake Morrison. Same eagle tattoo on the left shoulder blade, same scar through the wing. From what I can see. My stomach dropped because my name was Jake Morrison and I definitely had that exact tattoo. Tony, that's probably just a coincidence. Lots of people have eagle tattoos. But Tony was shaking his head, studying my reflection in the mirror. Jake, I've been cutting your hair for two years. Never seen your full name anywhere until today. And this poster says, Jake Morrison went missing three months ago. He showed me his appointment book, but you've been coming here every month like clockwork. I twisted around to look at the poster through the window. The photo was grainy and taken from a distance, but it definitely looked like me. Same build, same hair color, same general features. This has to be some mistake, I said, but my voice sounded shaky even to me. Maybe there's another Jake Morrison with a similar tattoo. Tony pulled the poster off his window and brought it inside. Says, here, he disappeared from Portland, Oregon, on March 15th. His family's offering a ten thousand dollar reward. He looked at me carefully. Jake, where were you living before you moved here? I tried to remember, but my memories before arriving in this town were surprisingly fuzzy. I came from the East Coast, I said. But even as I said it, I wasn't sure if that was true. Been traveling around for work. Tony raised an eyebrow. What kind of work? I opened my mouth to answer and realized I couldn't remember what I told him. Before construction, I said finally, but it felt like a guess. Tony set down his Scissors completely. Jake, this is serious. If this is you on this poster, your family thinks you're dead or kidnapped. Are people looking for you? He pulled out his phone. Maybe we should call the number and clear this up. My heart started racing and I didn't know why wait, I said, grabbing his wrist. Let me think about this first. If I call that number and it's not me, I'll be wasting everyone's time. And if it is me, I trailed off because I couldn't finish that thought. If it was me, then I had no memory of having a family or disappearing from anywhere. Tony sat down in the chair next to me. Jake, when you first came to my shop, you paid cash, said you were new in town, starting fresh, but you never talked about where you came from or why you moved here. That seemed normal at the time, but now he Just should at the poster now it seems like maybe you were running from something. I stared at my reflection trying to remember my life before this town. I had an apartment here, a job at the hardware store, a routine. But when I tried to think further back, everything got blurry. I think I might have been in an accident, I said slowly, hit my head or something. My memory of the past few years is pretty foggy. That would explain a lot, Tony said gently. Head injuries can cause amnesia. Maybe you disappeared from Portland because you were hurt and confused, ended up here without remembering who you are. He showed me the poster again, says here you have a wife and two kids. They've been searching for you for three months. The words hit me like a punch to the. A wife and kids I couldn't remember. People who loved me and thought I was dead. Tony, what if I don't remember them? What if I call this number and these strangers claim to be my family? My hands were shaking now. What if I've built a life here that I have to give up for a life I can't even remember? Tony stood up and locked the front door of his shop, flipping the sign to closed. Jake, we need to figure this out properly. Let me call my brother in law. He's a cop. He can help us contact the right people and make sure This gets handled safely. He was already dialing. If you really are this missing person, there might be reasons why you left that have nothing to do with memory loss. While Tony talked to his brother in law, I studied the missing person poster more carefully. The physical description matched perfectly, 5 feet, 10 inches, brown hair, Hazel eyes, 32 years old. Even the birth date was right. But the address listed was completely unfamiliar. 1,247 Maple street, Portland, Oregon. I've never heard of that street in my life. 20 minutes later.

Like bro, are you a charger or a puzzle? Every single time I plug it in, it's like flipping a coin with my life on the line. I plug it in and the phone's like charging, not charging, charging, not charging. Bro, make up your mind. Why are you playing hard to get? You are a cable. You have one job. And don't let it be night time either. You're in bed, lights off, trying to sleep, and now you're having to hang your phone half off the edge of the table, hold the charger with your foot, and balance a water bottle on top of it just to keep it charging. And if you breathe too hard. Boom. Disconnected. Back to 2%. Game over. Like, who manufactured this thing? A leprechaun with commitment issues. Why do I have to enter a cheat code for electricity? And the worst part? It's always that one charger in the house. You don't want to throw it away because it technically still works, but it also technically ruins your life daily. So now you're telling your friends, hey, don't move the cable or the whole house might explode. Like bro, this is not a medical ventilator, this is a phone. Why is this situation so tense? And don't even get me started. When someone else tries to use it, they plug it in casually like, oh, it's not working. Yeah, because you didn't turn it 74 degrees northwest with the tablet tilt and the moon phases aligned. I hate it here.

He's sweating so bad it's dripping on our test papers and he keeps checking his phone every few seconds. I look for our teacher, but she left to make copies 10 minutes ago and never came back. The man doesn't even say his name, just stares at all of us breathing heavily and then asks really loud whose parents work in the downtown offices, you know, the big buildings. Nobody raises their hand because we all know about stranger danger and this guy seems dangerous. He gets mad and his face goes from red to almost purple. He yells, I know some of you have parents there. This is important. Finally, me and four other kids slowly raise our hands because maybe something happened to our parents and he needs to tell us. He points at us and says, you 5, stay after the bell rings. Everyone else, leave as fast as you can. The girl next to me grabs my wrist and whispers, run with me, but my legs won't move. What if my mom needs me and this man is supposed to take me to her? The bell rings and everyone practically runs out like the rooms on fire. The man locks the door behind them with this loud click and my stomach drop like on a roller coaster. He won't even let us near our backpacks where our phones are. The Quiet girl starts crying and he doesn't even care, just keeps checking the window. Then his watch saying 15 minutes. We wait 15 minutes, which makes no sense because our parents usually pick us up in five minutes. Classroom phone rings and he rips it from the wall, like actually rips it out and throws it in the trash. And now I'm really scared because why would he do that unless he's kidnapping us? We hear sirens outside, lots of them getting louder. He stands in front of the door, blocking it with his whole body. The football player kid who's bigger than some teachers rushes the door. The man catches him with one hand. It didn't take him any effort to stop the biggest of us. He keeps saying no calls, not yet. Your parents can't know you're here. And those sirens aren't for us, but they're connected. I think maybe he did something bad downtown where our parents work. Maybe we're hostages. The room smells like his sweat now, sour and wrong. The Principal's voice crackles on the intercom saying all students proceed to evacuation positions immediately. But the man doesn't move from the door. We hear hundreds of feet running in the hallways, doors slamming, teachers yelling. There were more sirens than I've ever heard before. Like every fire truck and ambulance in the city is coming here. The quiet girl throws up on her desk from being so scared. He tosses her his jacket to clean Up. And when he does, I see he has an empty gum holster under his arm, which makes me almost scream, but I cover my mouth. Teachers are banging on our door, yelling to open up. But he yells back, official emergency protocol, these students are accounted for, and keeps mumbling as he checks the time, 12 minutes, 11 minutes, 10 minutes, like he's counting down to something bad. I can hear my phone in my back.

I'm a court stenographer and last month I witnessed the most savage 16 year old absolutely destroy everyone in juvenile court. Meet Tyler. He got arrested for spray painting math is stupid on his high school. Officer Johnson is presenting the case. Your honor, the defendant was caught red handed vandalizing school property with anti educational graffiti. Tyler raises his hand. Object action. Judge Williams looks confused. Son, you're not a lawyer. You can't object. But your honor, Officer Johnson said I was carted handed but I was actually caught blue handed because I was using blue spray paint. That's false testimony. The entire courtroom goes silent. Officer Johnson's eye starts twitching. Tyler, that's not how objections work then how do they work? Because nobody explained the rules and I don't want to accidentally break more laws. Officer Johnson continues, the defendant caused $200 in property damage and showed no remorse when arrested. Tyler raises his hand again. That's also incorrect, your honor. What now? I showed plenty of remorse. I said sorry when Officer Johnson tackled me. I also said ow and get, get off me, you're heavy, which shows genuine emotion. Officer Johnson jumps in. You also said this is stupid and math still sucks. Those were factual observations not related to my remorse level. Judge Williams is trying not to smile. Tyler, why did you write math is stupid on your school? Because it's true, your honor. Math Is objectively stupid. That's your opinion. No, sir. It's science. Why do we need to find X? X doesn't wanna be found. X is probably in witness Protection for a reason. The prosecutor tries to jump in. Your honor, the defendant is being disrespectful to education. Tyler turns to the prosecutor. Ma'am, education is being disrespectful to my brain cells. They're making me learn about imaginary numbers. If they're imaginary, why can't I just imagine I passed the test? Judge Williams asked Tyler, do you understand why vandalism is wrong? Yes, sir. It's wrong because I got caught. If I hadn't gotten caught, it would just be a mysterious street art and people would call me Banksy junior. It's not art. It's vandalism. Your honor, that's discrimination against my artistic vision. Michaelangelo painted on ceilings without permission. I painted on walls. We're basically the same person. Officer Johnson is getting frustrated, your honor. He compared himself to Michaelangelo. Tyler looks at Officer Johnson. Officer, don't be jealous of my artistic talents. You wrote math is stupid and bubble letters. Bubble letters are a legitimate artistic choice. They're fun and approachable. Judge Williams tries a different approach. Tyler, what do you think your punishment should be? Well, your honor, I think the real criminal here is whoever invented algebra. I should get a medal for warning future students about mathematical torture. That's not how the legal system works. The prosecutor is getting annoyed. Your honor, I recommend 40 hours of community Service and restitution. Tyler raises his hand. I'd like to cross examine that recommendation. You can't cross examine a recommendation. Why not? This is America. I have rights. I demand a trial by combat. That's not a thing. It should be. I bet I could beat math in a fight. Judge Williams is openly laughing now. Tyler, what's your response to 40 hours of community service? Your honor, that's cruel and unusual punishment. It only took me 10 minutes to create my masterpiece, so I should only owe 10 minutes of community service? That's not how it works. Then math is even more useless than I thought. Also, why should I pay $200? My graffiti increased the property value by adding character. Officer Johnson can't take it anymore, your honor. He thinks he improved the school. Tyler nodded seriously. Officer Johnson, before my artwork, that wall was just boring brick. Now it's a conversation starter. You vandalized public property. I enhanced public property. There's a difference. Judge Williams makes his decision. Tyler, I'm sentencing you to 20 hours of community service and $200 restitution. Your honor, can I appeal this decision? On what grounds? Temporary insanity caused by pro longed exposure to quadratic equations. Also, I think Officer Johnson has a personal vendetta against artistic expression. That's not a real legal defense. It should be. I have nightmares about the Pythagorean theorem. As we're wrapping up, Tyler asks, your honor, can I get a copy of the transcript? Why I Want to use it for my college application essay.

What are you talking about? I'm not part of a freaky gang. I had no idea who the Kitty crew was or why anyone would think I of people was part of it. The guy looked down at my feet and shook his head. Not with those shoes on. You gotta take those kicks off immediately. Those mean something around here. What? What's wrong with my shoes? He just walked away, leaving me confused in the hallway. I made it to art class, thinking maybe that guy was just messing with freshman. But when I sat down, missus cook stopped mid sentence and stared at my feet. Young man, do you really think it's appropriate to wear those shoes? Her voice had that teacher tone that meant I was in trouble. I really don't know what you're talking about. I was getting frustrated now because nobody would explain what was happening. Girls sitting behind me started giggling and taking pictures of my shoes with their phones. I could hear them whispering, but couldn't make out what they were saying. One of them leaned forward and tapped my shoulder. You're either really brave or really stupid, she said, before going back to her phone. Throughout the entire class, people kept staring at my feet. When I got up to sharpen my pencil, everyone went silent like they were waiting for something to happen. This is a cook. Kept glancing at my shoes nervously like they might explode. By the time the bell rang, I was paranoid and confused. In the hallway between classes, it got worse. It's would see me coming and move to the other side of the hall. A group of sophomores pointed, and one of them made a slashing their neck motion across his throat. My locker neighbor, who usually said hi every day, grabbed his stuff and practically ran away when he saw me. By lunch, my phone was blowing up with Snapchat notifications. People had posted pictures of my shoes all over their stories with crying emojis and comments I didn't understand. R I P. And he doesn't know, and someone tell him before it's too late. I sat alone at lunch because nobody would come near my table. Even the lunch ladies gave me weird looks when I went through the line. One of them actually blessed herself like she was warding off evil. I tried to eat my sandwich, but my appetite was gone. What was so wrong with my shoes? In chemistry class, my lab partner asked to switch seats. The teacher agreed without even asking why. So I did the experiment alone while everyone whispered and stared. Someone had written brave or stupid on the board with an arrow pointing to my seat. During passing period, I saw a memorial plaque on the wall I'd never noticed before. Someone said the name Matthew and I tried googling it on my phone, but the school Wi-Fi blocked all the results. The few snippets I could see mentioned tragic incident and gang violence, but nothing specific. My hands were shaking as I walked to gym class. During gym class, I thought things would be normal since we all had to wear the same uniform sneakers. But Coach Wiley blew his whistle as soon as I walked in and pointed at me. You step outside in the hall now. I follow.

The first thing I noticed when I entered the patient's room was her deep sunken eyes and pale cracked lips. I approached her cautiously, remembering how the charge nurse warned the girl refused all male staff. We all knew what that meant. And she looked as broken as I imagined. I pulled up a chair next to her bed instead of standing over her and gently asked if she wanted some water first. She nodded. Sweetie, you're safe here, I said, keeping my voice soft like I do with my anxious patients. Male staff won't come near you, I promise. It's just us girls here. She looked at me for the first time and whispered, he's here. I asked who. And at first she refused to even say his name. I handed her my pen and clipboard. After a second, her hand moved her Percy. My blood boiled at the name. He was my everything, she finally whispered and started showing me photos on her phone of them together at college, confirming that it was the same Percy who is now a resident at the hospital. I did everything for him, everything. Her voice cracked as she swiped to screenshots of assignments, time stamps showing her submitting his biochemistry homework at 3:00am, his pathology essays at 4:00am, his anatomy exams that she taken for him. She showed me his Instagram from those same nights, him doing beer Pong and body shots with other girls while she was writing his thesis on cellular biology. The day after graduation, after I'd spent three years making sure he got into residency, he sent me this, she said, and handed me her phone. The text made me want to throw something. Babe, you're too clingy and it's honestly suffocating. Need to focus on my career without distractions. And honestly, doctors are supposed to date doctors and you're not one. We're done. Please don't contact me again. I waited until she was stable and sleeping before I stormed into the break room where three other nurses were charting. You guys are never going to believe what I just found out about Percy, I said. I told them everything and watched their faces go from confused to furious. And within 10 minutes, we had half the female staff crammed into that tiny. I knew something was off when he asked me to explain what antibiotics were sent. June from pediatrics and Doctor Sydney are attending walked in right as someone said we should report him. And she closed the door behind her. Actually, I've been documenting his knowledge gaps for weeks, she said, pulling out her phone to show us pages of notes. But this explains everything. The room went quiet while we all looked at each other. And then Lita from the I C. U. Said, what we were all thinking, ladies, we don't need to destroy him. We just need to Let him destroy himself while we enjoy every second of it. The plan rolled out so naturally. It was almost beautiful to watch. Percy started getting paid for every.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say, or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal one and right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered. And I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass. I mentioned one day while folding towels, you're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since door stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded in ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping. And I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end. So I ducked behind my mirror blind spot like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle, a teenage girl while hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned, dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe the way.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50, 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face he starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. She's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I Tell her fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the t V and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that.

When my little sister Lena got diagnosed with Ms, she didn't cry. She just looked at me and said, I guess I won't beat you in races anymore. She said it with a smile. Can you imagine a 12 year old girl knowing her body is betraying her and still trying to make me feel better? So naturally I became her personal security guard, walking her to school, carrying her books, telling her dumb jokes to make her laugh on hard days. But I wasn't ready for Jason. Jason was the kind of teenage parasite that grows in a locker room and feeds off axe body spray and misplaced confidence. Captain of the basketball team, hair like a shampoo commercial, rain like overcooked broccoli. I was walking Lena to class one day when she dropped her books. Her hands were shaking. Ms does that. Before I could help, Jason and his buddies walked by laughing. He pulled out his phone and said loud enough for everyone to hear, dude, is she glitching? Someone reboot her. I froze. Lena turned bright red and then Jason topped it off by uploading it to his story with the caption error 4:04, dignity not found. The school took it down too late. The damage was done. Lena didn't talk for 3 days. I didn't sleep for 7. See there this thing people don't understand about revenge. It's not about Anger. It's about patience. And I've got the patience of a monk who's just been ghosted. Step 1, confusion. I got access to Jason's locker. Don't ask how. Let, let's just say the janitor smokes menthols and owes me a favor. Every couple of days. I moved things around, switched his notebooks, swapped one shoe for a size smaller, took out his lunch and replaced it with tuna that had been sitting in my garage for a week. He thought he had early onset dementia. I just smiled when he walked by muttering, I swear I packed my red folder. Step 2, sabotage. Jason took ADH meds. Nothing crazy, just enough to keep him focused. I swapped them with over the counter melatonin. Suddenly he was nodding off in history like a narcotic cat that teachers noticed. They didn't think drugs. They thought he was lazy. His grades dropped. College scouts stopped calling. Shame. Step 3, psychological erosion. Jason lived with his grandma because both his parents peaced out when he was in middle school. She was sweet, the kind of grandma who knits ugly sweaters and gives you those hard candies no one actually buys. I ran into her at the pharmacy, helped her carry her bags, complimented her ugly sweater. She called me a nice young man. I called her Nana. Boom, Instant trust. Then I planted the seed. Jason's been acting a little off lately, huh? Talking to himself a lot. She nodded slowly and said, I've Noticed that, too. She took him to a doctor. The DOC upped his meds. I kept swapping them. The result, he started hearing things, whispering, humming. At one point, he said the school lockers were laughing at him. He punched one, broke his wrist, cried in the nurse's office. Step 4, identity removal. I hacked into a student portal, changed small things, wrong birthday, switched his emergency contact from his grandma to a number I bought at a gas station. Then I forged a school psych report stating Jason might be suffering from dissociation. Next thing you know, Jason gets pulled from class and is forced into a mental health evaluation. He passed barely, but now every teacher looked at him like he was a ticking time bomb. In the final nail, I broke into his room while he was out, moved furniture around, rotated his posters, replaced a photo of him and his grandma with a nearly identical one, but with slightly different outfits. It drove him insane. He screamed at her one night that she was in on it. She cried. He got sent to a psych ward for evaluation. He didn't come back. A week later, his grandma bumped into me outside a grocery store, said Jason wasn't himself anymore. I said, maybe he never was. She just nodded, sighed, and handed me a bag of those disgusting candies. Oh, and Lena, she started smiling again, drawing again, talking again. As for Jason, he went from being The king of the school to being a ghost in a hospital gown who doesn't know if the voices in his head are real. And the best part, he still doesn't know who did it. He just knows someone did that. Paranoia, it'll live rent free in his head until the day he dies. And me, I sleep just fine. After all, some glitches can't be fixed.

My brother is married to Haley and they're expecting a baby together. Last year, I officially changed my first name from Evelyn to indie, which was a nickname form of my original middle name. My parents gave in after realising how serious I was about being indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. My brother and Haley want an older vintage name for their baby. And Haley asked me about five months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change it. At the time, she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names me. They sound really old fashioned. I said the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like indie instead. I didn't mind her asking the first time. She brought it up again a week later and asked the same question, pressing more about why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked, she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening To her, she also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to step in. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either. Two weeks ago when she brought it up again, she said she felt I had made a mistake changing my name and that 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name indie and that it seems like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kind of lost my temper. She started asking the same stuff again and the baby is almost ready to be born, so I know it's coming to an end. But she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped. I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change. And her comments Are not going to change my mind. I said I don't like old fashioned names. I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing how much better they supposedly are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me. My parents were also like, why did you have to speak to her so harshly?

I've got 5 kids. This is about three of them. Casey, Alex, and Tom. Casey, my 26 year old daughter, is getting married this winter. She's been with her fiance, Max, for about four years now. He's from another country, and with the currency difference, his family can't really afford to contribute to the wedding and also afford the travel costs. So I offered to cover the majority of the wedding expenses. No problem. She's my little girl. I've always dreamed of walking her down the aisle. It was supposed to be one of those proud, emotional dad moments you never forget. Then last week, two of my kids, Alex and Tom, came over with their families. We were catching up, talking about life, and naturally, the wedding came up. I casually asked if they were excited, thinking we'd all be there together for the big day. That's when they both got quiet. They hadn't been invited. At first, I figured maybe Casey hadn't sent out all the invitations yet. Maybe it was some mailing mix up. But then my oldest daughter, who's also there, said she had received her invite already. Same with my youngest, and both of them had been invited with their partners and their kids. So I called my sister to check, and yep, she and her whole family had been invited weeks ago. That's when I Knew this wasn't some oversight. Casey had specifically left Alex and Tom out. Now, here's what makes this even more painful. Alex is non binary and married to a man. Tom is gay, also married with adopted children. And Casey has always been supportive. She stood by them when they came out. She used to call herself their fiercest defender. We're not some rigid, divided family. We're close. Or at least we used to be. So I called her and I asked her why, Max's family isn't comfortable with non traditional couples. It's against their culture. And she hopes I'll understand. Understand? No. Absolutely not. I told her straight up, if she's okay excluding her own brothers, who've done nothing wrong, just to make her fiance's family more comfortable, then I'm not walking her down the aisle. I'm not paying for the wedding either. Let Max's family, with all their backward opinions, pay for it. I told her, if your family suddenly doesn't fit into your picture perfect day, then maybe we're not part of that picture at all. Called me an asshole and hung up crying. My other kids are all on my side. Even my wife, who usually tries to stay neutral, was heartbroken. She adores our son's in law. Loves those kids like they're her own grandkids. She doesn't support Casey's decision at all, even if she's trying to stay open. In case our daughter eventually wakes up and realizes how messed up this Is. But as of now, I'm not budging. I'm not rewarding exclusion and cowardice, and I sure as hell won't smile in a tux pretending it's all okay.

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. 3,000 dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you, you sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake? Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name. And track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look, the same guilty look they've been giving each other for months. Whenever grandma brought up gifts or money, I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The Same design, the same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop, making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought you a 3,000 dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara's been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents cause last month she asked me for $20 for gas money. The month before that, she needed $50 for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Lauren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Alara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing and everyone at the table knew it. Grandma leaned forward. Her eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

Now they're homeless with kids and I refuse to let them back in my life. When I was 22, I inherited our grandmother's house, a beautiful Victorian with enough space for my brother and his family to stay while they saved for their own place. They moved in with their two kids, promising it would only be temporary. Just six months, my brother assured me, will be out of your hair before you know it. His wife despised me from day one. She'd make snide comments about how I decorated, complained that I was too loud when I came home from my nursing shifts and acted like I was invading her space in my own house. She'd rearrange my kitchen without asking, throw away my mail, claiming it was junk, and lecture me about proper household management while I was paying all the bills. The passive aggression escalated weekly. She'd use my expensive shampoo, then deny it when confronted. My leftovers would disappear from the fridge and she'd claim she thought they were communal food when I started labelling everything with my name. She complained to my brother that I was being petty and territorial. I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour, but he always made excuses. She's stressed about money. She's not used to living with other people. You're being too sensitive. Every conversation ended with him defending her and dismissing my concerns. The breaking point came six Months later, I arrived home exhausted from a double shift to find her screaming at me in the hallway. She claimed I've been stealing money from her purse and eating her food from the fridge. Both accusations were ridiculous. I made decent money and kept my own groceries clearly labeled. You've been sneaking into our room, she shrieked, her face red with manufactured rage. I know you took $40 from my wallet last Tuesday. I stared at her in disbelief. I worked 12 hour shifts. When exactly would I have time to rifle through your belongings? Don't lie to me, she spat. I, I have proof. My brother stood behind her, silent as she launched into a tirade about how I was jealous of their family and trying to sabotage their marriage. When I tried to defend myself, she burst into tears and ran to their room. That night, my brother knocked on my door. His face was stone cold, a look I'd never seen directed at me before. We need to talk, he said. He told me his wife had been documenting everything. Times I allegedly took money instant. This is where I supposedly threatened her when he wasn't around. Photos of missing food items. None of it was true, but he believed every word. She'd created a detailed log with dates, times and descriptions of my supposed crimes. You're toxic and you're tearing our family apart, he said. We're done enabling your behavior. I stared at him in Disbelief. This was the same brother who'd cry.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried. To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. She's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

My mom would literally set a kitchen timer when I logged on. When that thing rang, I had 30 seconds to shut everything down or I'd lose screen privileges for a week. Didn't matter if I was saving a game, watching a movie or in the middle of a school assignment. Time was time. So at 14, I found a loophole. The rule said very specifically, one hour of screen time. That was the phrase. No qualifiers, no details, just screen time. So I decided to maliciously comply in the most annoying, obnoxious way I could think of. I started using my one hour in the most unproductive, mind numbing and absolutely ridiculous ways possible. I'd boot up the computer, then spend 20 full minutes just staring at the loading screen of a game I never actually played. Or I'd open Microsoft Word and type complete gibberish random strings of letters like d, F, F, J, class, Jeff, ol Kashi while making over the top sounds of excitement. Wow, this is so fun, I'd say dramatically. Best screen time ever. Sometimes I'd open up paint, draw one pixel and then sit back and admire it like it was the Mona Lisa. My mom got confused at first. She peeked in during one of these Sessions and asked if something was wrong with the game. Nope, I replied cheerfully, just enjoying my screen time. It only got weirder from there. I watched the Windows defragmentation tool. I mean, watched it like it was a nature documentary. Oh look, block 42 just moved. I'd narrate in fake excitement. The breaking point came one afternoon when my dad walked into the kitchen and found me sitting cross legged in front of the microwave. I wasn't cooking anything meaningful, just heating up a mug of water, timer set for 15 minutes. And I was staring at the digital display completely zoned in like I was watching the series finale of my favorite show. My dad blinked. What are you doing using my screen time? I said innocently, this is a screen, right? I didn't even blink, just kept watching the numbers tick down. 1342, 1341. That was the beginning of the end. I kept pushing it, sat in front of the washing machine while it.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me. Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh, really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your tech support agent sending you willy pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you. Anyway, we're done. Wait. Not only did you cheat on me, it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better and pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me? Bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Tight. What do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries his laptop. In a suitcase. So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make a e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it. Once he sends it, block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's got to work in fast food now. And he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. But it's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favorite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10 and he'll get a warning. With this, do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food. Now he can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water. Add on that if he does this, he gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me! You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

My girlfriend, Molly, put her hand under my desk. And please, Missus Dodson, you have to legally let us go. Missus Hy Dodson was crying now with mascara running down her cheeks. I'm sorry, but if I let you all run out of the class, the gunman might get you. We need to wait. I looked at Molly and tried to keep my voice steady. Don't worry, babe, I'm going to figure out a way out of this. Missus Dodson had kept our entire class trapped in the room. She'd been acting strange all week, but today she locked the door during last period because she sensed a warning. Missus Dodson suddenly screamed and pointed at the door there. Did you hear those gunshots? Everyone get down. We all looked at each other confused, but Missus Dodson was shaking and clutching a rosary to her chest. She heard it all, 20 of us to the back corner of the room furthest from the windows. She started praying in Latin while we huddled together. Some kids were crying. Others were texting their parents frantically. The school had probably already called wondering where we were. Basketball practice had started two hours ago. Drama rehearsal was happening without half the cast. This is Datson. I have an idea, I said, interrupting her prayer. How about you let us out through the window since we're Only on the first floor and we can all escape and get help. She shook her head violently. No, the government has friends outside. They'll shoot all of you the second you climb out. I won't let you leave. She started going around hugging each student and telling them she loved them. Kids were flinching away from her touch. This woman who usually graded papers with perfect posture was now wild eyed and sweating through her cardigan. Bradley was the class troublemaker who usually slept through lessons, stood up and crossed his arms. Missus Dodson, you're so insane that you make me want to actually do my homework. Let us out, you crazy witch. School dismissal was four hours ago. Her face twisted into something ugly. The only dismissal you're going to have is straight to hell. I should let you out of the classroom and let the gunman unload on you. Fine, then let's do it. Bradley walked toward the door. Missus Dodson immediately crumbled. I'm sorry, sweetie, you know I can't let you leave here. I have to keep the door locked so I can protect you all. While she was focused on Bradley and trying to pull him back to the group, I saw my chance. Her keys were hanging from her belt loop. I carefully reached over and unclip them, trying not to jingle the metal. Molly saw what I was doing, created more distraction by fake crying loudly. I crawled toward the door, staying low. Like we were actually in danger. I didn't realize till later that we really were. My hands were shaking as I found the right key. The lock clicked open and I yanked the door handle. Run, I shouted. All 20 students rushed for the door at once. Missus Dodson screamed and tried to grab people, but we pushed past her. We ran down the hallway and burst through the front entrance into the parking lot where police cars were everywhere. The cops had their hands on their weapons until all they saw it was just a bunch of terrified teenagers. They immediately asked us what happened. Our teacher went insane and trapped us in there for four hours. I told the nearest officer. He nodded grimly. We're sorry we took so long. We just got the call about you guys. After we searched in Missus Dodson's house, you won't believe what we found. Full story on channel link below.

I was 12 when my stepdad Mark gave me a cute nickname and that was a lazy n word. You see, for two years straight, Mark had one rule. I wasn't allowed to sleep. While my white siblings could sleep from eleven PM to 7:00am, I was only allowed to sleep from 12:00am to 4:00am. Luckily, I didn't even have to set an alarm clock because every morning at 4:00am, Mark would burst into my room with a flashlight in my face checking if I was ready to do my character building chores. This include it's scrubbing bathrooms, organizing the garage, prepping breakfast for when his boys woke up. But that wasn't even the worst part because if I made any sort of noise, I'd lose privileges. The privilege just in question, eating enough food, drinking enough water. And since my mom worked 12 hour night shifts as a nurse, she never saw any of it. Mark had this whole philosophy about modern kids being soft. When I was in Afghanistan, he'd start every lecture. We functioned on two hours of sleep for weeks. Kids today can't even handle getting up early. I'm sure you can guess why. His rules only applied to me. By month 3, I was practically schizophrenic with how much I was hallucinating, shadows moving in my peripheral vision, hearing my name when no one called. I'd fallen asleep on the toilet twice at my desk, dozens Of times and once while standing in the shower. The other black kids at my school started calling me the raccoon N word because of the dark circles under my eyes. My grades made like a girl's chest during puberty when from A's to D's, all because I couldn't stay conscious long enough to finish tests. Teachers thought I was on drugs and said I fit the stereotype. Even the counselor pulled me aside ask if everything was okay at home. The breaking point came during midterms. I literally fell asleep standing up during my history presentation, face planted right into the whiteboard. Twenty minutes later, the school nurse called my parents and Mark showed up in his veterans cap like he was on a rescue mission. This is what I'm talking about, he said, shaking his head in the nurse's office. No self control. I've tried everything, structure, discipline, consequences. Some kids just don't want to succeed. The counselor ate up every word. I don't blame you, Mark. Most white folk wouldn't even bother trying to civilize a kid like this. You're fighting genetics here. I tried telling my mom when I got home, but she was exhausted after a double shift and Mark was right there, arm around her shoulders. He's exaggerating, Mark said calmly. Teen boys are dramatic. Just teaching him discipline, bruh, I only get 4 hours of sleep, I managed to whisper. Mark laughed. See what I mean? The kid can't even keep his lies. Straight. My mom just sat there saying nothing. Plus, didn't your guys ancestors used to spend all day in the cotton field? Anyway, you should be used to this by now. He then threw his head back and cackled. That's when I realized my mom was too scared of Mark to defend me. I wanted to call CPS, but I knew Mark would just sweet talk his way out of it. So instead I did something I never done before. I went through my mom's jewelry box to find my dead dad's old phone there, found his brother Jerome's number. I texted him on my phone and asked if he wanted to go on a run with me at 4:00am. Mark would be at his peak performance by then. When he agreed, I felt a chaotic excitement fill my veins. So on Thursday night, I made sure to be extra lazy at dinner, dozed off twice, knocked over my water. Mark's eye twitched with anticipation. Looks like someone needs extra motivation tomorrow, he said. His boys snickering. At 4:00am sharp, the flashlight hit my face. But this time Mark brought props, a bucket of ice water and an airhorn. He was so excited to abuse me that he didn't even hear the front door open. Rise and shine, you lazy n word, he cheered. Today we're trying something new since you can't seem to be disciplined. He was then interrupted by the sound of my bedroom door creaking open. What The f did you just call my nephew? My uncle's voice bellowed through the house. Behind him, my cousins Desean and Tyrell. Mark's flashlight swung toward them, his face draining color. This.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating. Drunk guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just. Trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her. Eating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height. Told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson real fighters don't fight in bars. Much liability. Too much to lose. My instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements. He slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch. Told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school. He grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about twice. The brunette pulled Away from his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now, some people whispering, shooting me, suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years, was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly, holding it up for the bar to see, while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly, spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up, then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there, doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist, immediately, insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't Safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp.

My mother is the most baby obsessed psycho I've ever met. Starting when I was 8 years old, she made me and my sister Daniela wear these pregnancy simulation suits for hours every single day. 20 pounds of sand strapped to our stomachs while we practice breathing exercises and watch birthing videos. If we complained about back pain, she'd add more weight and tell us, real mothers don't whine. She even made us practice breastfeeding with these baby little dolls that would cry if you didn't hold them right. While I spent every session plotting my escape, Daniela embraced it as if it was her one true purpose. She'd waddle around the house with perfect posture, rubbing in her fake belly and talking to it out loud. By the time she turned 16, she was begging mom to let her be a practice surrogate for her infertile work friends. And when she turned 18, Mom threw her a massive party, not for graduating high school, but for signing her first surrogacy contract. Everyone was calling her a blessing and an angel, while I sat in the corner feeling like I was at a livestock auction. Within three years, Daniella had carried three babies for three different couples. Each time she came home from the hospital, mom would parade her around town like she'd won a Nobel Prize. Look at my generous daughter giving the gift of life. Meanwhile, I was getting a biomedical degree. Volunteering at women's shelters and learning about bodily autonomy. But none of that mattered. Such a waste of a perfectly good uterus. Mom would tell anyone who'd listen. Her sister has blessed three families, while this one hordes her fertility for herself. The most terrifying part was watching Daniela deteriorate after her fourth pregnancy. At 22, she could barely walk without pain, her hips were destroyed, she had constant infections, and her hair was falling out in chunks. When I tried to talk to her about it, she grabbed my hands with tears in her eyes. Maria, this is what I was made for. My body is a vessel for miracles. Why can't you understand that? That's when I knew she was gone. So I played along just enough to keep mom off my back. Told her I was considering pregnancy, wore looser clothes to family events, even googled fertility clinics in front of her, all while secretly taking the LSAT and applying to law schools across the country. Lol. I specialized in reproductive rights and medical ethics, spending years helping women escape forced pregnancy situations. By 28, I was finally making a difference. So when mom invited me to Daniela's Celebration dinner, I figured it was just another pregnancy announcement. Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it was an effing intervention. Sweetie, you're not getting any younger, mom announced while Daniela sat beside her belly swollen with pregnancy. No. 5. So I've taken the liberty of starting your fertility Treatments. Before I could respond, she pulled out a syringe filled with hormones. Just a little boost to get those eggs flowing. I jumped back, but Daniela grabbed my arms from behind. Please, Maria, just try it. I've already found the perfect couple for your first baby. I screamed and fought, but mom was already coming at me with the needle. That's when I noticed the other syringes on the table. They've been planning this. Mom punched the needle into my thigh. I felt the cold liquid burn through my muscle. Within minutes, my vision blurred, and my ovaries felt like they were on fire. Through the haze, I heard mom on the phone. Yes. Started the protocol. She'll be ready for harvest in two weeks. That's when I realized this wasn't just about family pressure anymore. This was trafficking. I woke up in the ICU with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome so severe, they nearly had to remove everything. My mom stood towering over me. We only brought you here because we wanted to save your womb, was the first thing she said. I pressed the red button for the nurse. We took one look at my mom and escorted her out to perform private examinations. As soon as we were alone, I felt even worse because she wrapped her arms around me and asked if I was okay. I broke down crying because the whole thing.

You know, the PP, the schlong, Mr Johnson. Oh, why do you want to know? Cause I'm curious. Cause it felt like everything I've ever wanted, but you said we had to do it with the lights off, so I never got to see it. Yeah. Just know it is what you wanted. What is that supposed to mean? Just tell me how big it is. Are you sure? Yes. Tell me. Well, it is really three inches. Three? Stop lying to me. That was way bigger than three. I know, cause I didn't use it. What are you talking about? You said you wanted it to be extremely large and very dark, but I'm extremely light and very small. So I came up with a solution. What was your solution? I turned the lights off and used my fist. Huh? What? Honestly, come back. You hit all of the right spots and there are no pregnancy scares with a fist. So you don't think I should be embarrassed? And you should definitely feel embarrassed. Like I could not imagine having to deal with only 3 inches. But that fist did wonders. I know I lost my whole arm in there. You used your whole arm. Yeah. You kept saying deeper and it just kept going. So that is why I felt it in my lungs all the way from my cat. Yeah. Well, whatever you used, it got the job done. Can I Come clean. Actually. What do you mean come clean? I thought you already did when you said you had 3 inches and just use your fist. It was a joke. I turned off the lights cause I was just too drunk and didn't wanna see any lights. But I actually did use. Mr Johnson. That was your snake. There is no chance. One more thing. What could it be now you didn't pull out? Actually, yes. What? You try to pull out on time when it is like two foot long. Fair. I'm having a kid, though. What? Why? Cause whatever genetics you have to have a snake like that need to continue. Fair.

At 5 7 and 140 pounds, I wasn't exactly the most intimidating drunk. Guys at bars always picked me when they wanted to look tough in front of women. So when I saw this 6 2 gym bro marching over to where I was chatting with a pretty brunette, I already knew how this would go. He wedged himself between us, his massive frame completely blocking me out. Didn't even look at me, just turned his broad back like I was furniture. Let me get you a real drink, beautiful, he said. Flag down the bartender, not whatever this little guy was boring you with. She glanced around his shoulder at me, clearly uncomfortable. Actually, we were just, trust me. He cut her off, placing a protective hand on the bar in front of her, creating a wall. You need someone who can actually take care of you. He ordered her a martini without asking, then finally acknowledged my existence with a dismissive glance. You can go now, buddy. When I didn't move, he shifted his weight, using his size to push me further down the bar. The edge of the counter dug into my ribs. Still, I stayed put, sipping my beer. He'd expected me to scurry away by now. He turned to me fully for the first time, looking me up and down with theatrical disgust, asked If I, I was deaf or something. When I calmly said I was just finishing my drink, his hand shot out and swiped my glasses off my face. They clattered across the bar. Everything went blurry. He made jokes about me not being able to see up to his height, told the girl maybe that's why I hadn't gotten the hint. I stayed still, breathing normally. 10 years of training had taught me the most important lesson, real fighters don't fight in bars. Too much liability, too much to lose my instructor certification, my gym, potential lawsuits, all gone over some drunk idiot. I reached for my glasses with measured movements, slid them further away with one finger, told me to leave them. I walked around him to retrieve them, keeping everything neutral. When I sat back down with my glasses, he spun around to face the entire bar and announced loudly that we had a creeper situation. His voice boomed over the music as he pointed at me with his beer bottle, claiming I've been bothering this nice lady for an hour. The brunette tried to protest, but he interrupted, putting a possessive hand on her shoulder that made her flinch, told everyone not to worry, he had it handled. His buddies at a corner table started laughing and shouting. Someone asked if I was in middle school, grinned and turned to the bartender, suggesting I should be carded again because I looked about 12. The brunette pulled away. From his hand, but he kept talking over her, telling her she didn't have to be polite anymore. Half the bar was watching now. Some people whispering, shooting me suspicious looks. My reputation at this place where I've been a regular for two years was being destroyed in real time. Then he decided to demonstrate my weakness. He grabbed my wrist, suddenly holding it up for the bar to see while comparing it to his 12 year old nephew's arms. I didn't resist, keeping my breathing steady as he squeezed harder, his thumb pressing into the pressure point. He yanked me off the bar stool, effortlessly spinning me around to show the girl what would happen if real danger showed up. Then shoved me back against the bar. Not hard enough to be considered assault, but enough to make his point. The edge dug into my spine. He stood there waiting, telling me to push back, show her I was a real man. I stayed relaxed, hands at my sides, no aggressive stance, nothing that could justify what he wanted to do. His face darkened at my non reaction, called me pathetic. He turned to the girl, explaining this was why she needed someone like him around, painted scenarios of what could happen with me just standing there doing nothing if he was actually dangerous. The brunette stood up, said she was leaving. He grabbed her wrist immediately insisting he'd walk her to her car because the streets weren't safe. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the fear underneath. When she told him to let go, he tightened his grip slightly, still smiling, saying he was just trying to help. She tried to pull away, but he held firm, told her to relax. He was just being a gentleman. His grip tightened enough to make her gasp. She was getting genuinely scared now. Panic in her voice as she pushed against his chest with her free hand. That's when something shifted in his eyes. The drunk bravado turned into something ugly.

Y'all were always talking, laughing at dumb stuff, venting, being weird together, making the most unhinged inside jokes that nobody else would get. And now they're just gone. Not even gone like we grew apart, but, like, replaced. Like they found a new group and suddenly forgot you existed. And they swear they still care. But the I'm going to sleep early is getting old. Especially when I see you online, in games, in calls with your new little friend group. Like, bro, I'm not stupid. I see the green dot. I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stopped choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now. Like I'm being kept around just in case the new group drops you or switches up. Like I'm the in case of emergency friend. I'm not a fostering safety net. You used to need me. Now I'm just convenient when you're bored. And I see it, I feel it, and it sucks. But you know what? I'm done begging for space in your life. I'm done waiting for a text back just to see you on Facetime with the new crew. I'm done being loyal to someone who already left me without saying a word. So, yeah, it hurts. It hurts like hell. But I'm not gonna sit here and cry over someone who doesn't miss me. I'm Gonna wipe my tears, put on lip gloss or chapstick, whatever. And remind myself I'm not the problem you fumbled. I was a real one. And when that new group starts acting funny, when you remember what it felt like to have someone who actually cared, just know this friendship doesn't do returns.

My brother Jake, has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I, I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I. Tried to explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with.

Wait till they find out what I do for a living. Seven years since graduation, and these women still had me mentally catalogued as the virgin who cried during health class. Lena took it upon herself to arrange a reunion for our high school friend group. I was curious what everyone had been up to, so I went. Big mistake. Second I walked in. Oh, my god. You look exactly the same. Still our innocent baby. They handed me an actual juice box while they opened three bottles of wine. We got you apple juice since you probably don't drink, Ashland said. Like I was 12. Sit here, sweetie. She pointed to the floor. All of them took the couch and chairs. Every single seat except the floor. So there I was, 25 years old, sitting cross legged on Lena's carpet, holding a juice box while they clinked wine glasses above my head. They really thought I was the same shy bookworm from high school. Sure, ladies. Whatever helps you sleep at night. They started playing Never Have I Ever. But stopped. Actually. Wait. She won't have done anything. Ashley nodded to me, and they all laughed. I sipped my juice box. They told relationship stories, then caught themselves. Oops, forgot innocent ears were here. More laughing. Lena actually covered my ears during one story about her honeymoon. I'm 25 years old, and this grown woman covered my ears. They asked me to grab More wine from the kitchen. We need to discuss something real quick. I knew what this was. I walked slow, came back to sudden silence. They've been talking about me, obviously. We were just saying you'd be perfect for Lena's cousin. He's also. Ashley paused. Inexperienced. They all nodded like they'd solved world hunger. But wait, it got worse. Lena took my phone. No phones during Girls Night. You're always so anti social, reading your little books. My phone literally had 57 unread Instagram notifications. But sure, Lena, I'm anti social. We're going to Ashland's Bachelorette next month, April said. But it might be too much for you. The stripper stuff would make you so uncomfortable. They all agreed I'd be traumatized. Remember when she didn't even know what a thong was? That was freshman year. Eleven years ago. I leaned over to grab my juice box from the side table and saw Ashland's phone lit up next to it, the notification preview at the top. Adults only. No Virgin Mary. April. She actually believes the cousin thing. LMAO. I was about to say something when Lena's boyfriend Mark came home with one of his friends, Cooper. Ashlyn practically ran to stand next to Cooper. Nice to see you again. I wondered how often she was invited over, if she recognized him. Lena introduced me as the most innocent person she knows. Mark barely looked at me. Then his neck snapped to look again. His eyes went wide. Really wide. He pulled out his phone. Type something quick, and his face went from confused to shocked. Holy. Mark showed Cooper his phone. The girls stopped talking. What's wrong? Lena asked. Mark looked at me, then at Lena, then back at me. Your innocent friend is. He couldn't finish. Just turned his phone around. Whatever was on that screen made Cooper's jaw drop. No way. No way. He started frantically googling something. The girls tried to see, but Mark pulled the phone back. She. There's a special guest at Denver Con and Seattle. And Cooper kept scrolling, eyes getting wider. This can't be her, Lena said, trying to grab Mark's phone. She doesn't even wear makeup. But Mark and Cooper were having their own conversation now. Both staring at their phones, then at me, then back at their phones. The one from TikTok, Cooper whispered. 3 million views, Mark confirmed. His eyes went huge. Is that. The girls were getting angry. What are you looking at? Ashlyn demanded. Cooper turned red.

I pretended to be my cousin, the substitute teacher for a day and accidentally got my dream job. I was 19, broke as hell, and still waiting to hear back from community college. My cousin Tyler was a substitute teacher who sometimes paid me to drive him around since his car was trash. One Tuesday morning, he calls me, freaking out. Dude, I just rear ended someone. I'm supposed to be at Westbrook Middle School in 20 minutes. If I miss another day, they'll cut me from their sub list. I was eating cereal in my pajamas. That sucks, man. Wait, he said you still have my school I D. From when you helped me move those boxes last month? Yeah, why? I'm serious. Let's go pretend to be me. Take attendance. Keep them quiet. It's just study hall. I laughed. You're insane. Please. They won't even check. Most subs just sit there anyway. It's one period. Something about the desperation in his voice got to me. Plus, I needed money. I threw on Tyler's spare button down shirt that was way too big and drove to the school with his laminated badge. The front desk lady barely looked up. You must be the sub for Miss Peterson's class. Room 2 13. Here's your clipboard. I walked down that hallway trying to look confident while my heart was pounding. The kids were loud, but not crazy. I took attendance, reading names off The roster. When they asked where their teacher was, I said she had a family emergency and today was independent study. Can we work on homework? This girl asked, absolutely, I said, having no clue what else to tell them. For an hour, I just walked around pretending to supervise while they did whatever. Some kid asked me about math, and I said I'd get back to him. Another wanted to use the bathroom, and I let, like, five kids go because I didn't know the rules. The bell rang, and a whole new group of kids walked in. Nobody had told me there were multiple periods. I panicked, but tried to play it cool. Same routine independent study day. The projector wasn't working, so sorry, no video today. I made them read silently and told them I'd be grading papers instead. I just stared at Tyler's lesson plan book, trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Third period came, then fourth. I was making it up as I went. When kids got too loud, I'd say stuff like, remember, this affects your participation grade, even though I had no idea how grading worked. During lunch, I hid in an empty classroom and texted Tyler updates. He kept saying, you're doing great. Just get through the day. Fifth period, this kid asked me about the Revolutionary War assignment. I panicked and said, what do you think the most important battle was? Then I made them debate It. While I googled stuff on my phone under the desk. By sixth period, I was actually getting comfortable. These kids weren't that different from my little brother and his friends. I started a trivia game about random stuff, and they were actually into it. Then the assistant principal walked in. My

I was 15 when my crush, Lucia, pulled me aside after chemistry class. We've been close since sixth grades. I need you to promise me something, she whispered. Her pretty eyes not meeting mine. For a moment, I thought she was going to ask me to the dance. I've been working up the courage for weeks. But something in her voice made my chest tighten. Anything I said, that's when she told me about Friday, how she'd been planning it for months. The teachers who ignored her cries for help, her parents who only cared about her grades. She taking her mom's gun from the locked drawer. The next day she was going to publicly end her life. She planned it all out, a live stream during third period when Miss Lillian would be teaching, when Mister Cole would be in the faculty lounge, when everyone who'd failed her would be watching. She'd make sure they'd see, make sure they'd carry it forever. But not you, she said, squeezing my hand. Don't watch. You're the only one who ever really saw me stood there frozen, feeling her fingers intertwined with mine. Something I dreamed about for months, but not like this. Never like this. Lucia, you can't, I whispered. It's the only way they'll learn. She's the only way things will change. That night, I didn't sleep. I stared at her Instagram, scrolling through photos where her smile never quite reached her eyes. Had I missed It the way she'd stopped eating lunch, how she wore long sleeves even when it was warm. The poem she'd started posting, beautiful but dark. So dark I thought about Miss Lillian who was tough but had three kids at home. Mr Cole who was new and trying his best. The other students who'd see it happen live. The trauma that would ripple through our school like a stone dropped in still water. But Lucia trusted me. She'd held my hand. She'd chosen me to confide in. Wasn't that worth something? By the time three a. M. Hit, I was typing and deleting texts to. What if I was overreacting? What if she hated me forever? What if I lost the only girl who'd ever made me feel like I mattered? Then I imagine the alternative, her empty desk and chemistry. Her parents at a funeral instead of graduation. A live stream that could never be unseen, all because I stayed silent. 5:00am, I called the sewer's light prevention hotline. They connected me to the police. My voice cracked as I explained everything. The officer's tone grew urgent asking for details. I wished I didn't have. Lucia's full name, her address, the exact time she'd mentioned you're saving her life, the officer said it felt like I was ending it. They got to Lucia at 7:00am just as she was setting up her phone in her bedroom. Pills were already laid out. The note was already written. The local news Called it a mental health crisis intervention. They interviewed our principal, who promised better resources, more counselors, real change. They never used our names, but Lucia knew. She didn't come back to school for two months. When she did, she wouldn't look at me, wouldn't answer my texts. Her new friends formed a protective wall around her in the hallways. I heard whispers that I betrayed her, that I violated her trust, that I only did it because I couldn't handle rejection. The school did change. They hired two new counselors, started a peer support program, trained teachers on warning signs. Everyone said I'd done the right thing, but I felt like I'd lost everything. Three years later, on graduation day, I found a note in my locker. I instantly recognized Lucia's handwriting. What I read made my heart drop full.

When mom married Garrett, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown. Like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking first you can and speaking. Hi, I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking. And showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described.

Just because you were really kind to me and I thought it might be nice to get to know you better. Hmm. I don't know, Vicky. I mean, you. You're telling me all this now, and it sounds great, but once.

I had an eight year old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, she'd be dead in six months. I called the mother in to explain the situation. When I, I told her, she was totally relaxed. Oh, I know about the diabetes. The other doctor mentioned it last week. We're handling it naturally, though. No insulin needed. I thought I misheard her. Your daughter needs insulin to live. Her pancreas doesn't work anymore. She will die without it. The mother smiled. We're doing carrot juice therapy instead, 60 ounces a day. Diabetes is just toxin build up in the pancreas. The juice flushes it out. She said it like she was explaining a recipe. I tried showing her the test results. Her blood sugar is 680. She could slip into a coma any moment. The mother stood up and helped her daughter to her feet. Well, thanks for your opinion, but we're good. The carrot cleanse takes three weeks to work fully. We're only on week two. I blocked the door. You can't leave. She's in diabetic ketoacidosis. She needs emergency treatment. The mother laughed. This is why people don't trust doctors. You create fake emergencies. Move or I'm calling security on you. She pushed past me with her barely conscious daughter. After she left, I immediately called my supervisor and hospital legal. We needed an emergency ethics meeting. A child was going to die within an hour. We had social services, the chief of pediatrics and legal on a conference call. The mother had been flagged at three other hospitals. Each time she left when doctors mentioned insulin. I explained the situation. She's giving her type 1 diabetic daughter only carrot juice. The kids in active ketoacidosis. She'll be dead in weeks, maybe days. Legal said without immediate danger, we couldn't force treatment. The chief suggested we call the mother for a formal care meeting, make it sound routine. When I called, she was surprisingly cheerful. Oh, a second opinion? Sure. I love educating doctors about natural healing. She came back that afternoon with a rolling suitcase. Inside were printed Facebook posts, blog articles and a Powerpoint on her laptop she set up like she was giving a business presentation. Let me show you how Big Pharma created the die diabetes lie. She actually had slides. Slide 1, Insulin is made from GMO bacteria. Slide 2, diabetes didn't exist before 1920. Slide 3, every culture has a vegetable that cures diabetes. Chief of pediatrics interrupted. Ma'am, your daughter's blood sugar was 680. She's dying. The mother clicked to her next slide. That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this graph I made. Couple days later, the school called 9, 1 1. The daughter had collapsed in the cafeteria, completely unresponsive. When they arrived, I recognized her immediately. The orange tinted skin was unmistakable. Blood sugar was 1,100. She was in a diabetic coma. The Mother rushed in 20 minutes later carrying her suitcase of documents. She fainted because they gave her school lunch instead of her juice. That processed food is poison. The kids started seizing right there on the gurney. Foam.

How did you do it? My ex, Ashley, thought our relationship was charity work. Every time we went somewhere together, she'd find ways to remind me I'd never find someone like her again. It started with her introducing me as just a friend at bars. When guys hit on her, she'd let them buy her drinks, then mention she had a boyfriend after. You should see their faces when I point to you. She'd laugh later. The shock is hilarious. The worst was when she just disappeared one Saturday. No text, nothing. Then I saw her Instagram story. Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami. Tom has this insane condo. He wanted to fly me to Ibiza next week. She pinched my cheek. But I came back to Jersey to my little computer nerd, my anxious overthinker who's mad about a boat party. She kicked off her heels and collapsed on my bed. I looked past all these red flags with rose colored glasses until the one year anniversary incident happened. I planned everything perfectly just for her on our anniversary. Flowers in hand, champagne in my car, reservation at her favorite restaurant. I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I stepped closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice asked. Eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

This morning, my phone exploded with 32 missed calls. It happened at Connor's birthday party. Lauren stood up during dinner and announced to our entire friend group, I've been seeing someone else. I need a real man, not a kindergarten teacher who makes 30 K a year. Everyone went silent. Then Connor actually started clapping. Finally. We've all been saying, you deserve better. The whole table nodded like they'd rehearsed this. I just smiled, put down my fork, and walked out. No drama, no begging. What? They didn't know. I've been teaching kids during the day, but spending nights getting my pilot's license. My broke teacher savings account actually had 180 K from cryptocurrency investments I'd made 3 years ago. But here's the real kicker. My uncle had been battling cancer for months. He owned a small aviation company that did scenic tours and flight training. Two days before Connor's party, he'd asked me to take over the business when he retired. The company was worth 1.2 million, debt free. I've been keeping it quiet while I finished my commercial pilot certification. Lauren knew about my uncle's business, but thought it was just some tiny operation with a couple old planes. She had no idea about the government contracts, the corporate partnerships, or the fact that we were expanding into helicopter tours next year. The night she humiliated me, I called my Uncle and said yes to everything. We started the paperwork immediately. I'd also been secretly applying to international schools. Teaching abroad had always been my dream, but Lauren constantly shut it down, saying it was unrealistic and running away from responsibility. The next week, I put in my transfer request to teach at an international school in Dubai. Posted one photo on Instagram. Me in the cockpit of a small plane with the caption new adventures. Lauren's new real man. Turns out he was married with two kids. His wife found their texts and posted everything on Facebook, tagging Lauren's workplace. She got fired from her marketing job for the drama. The guy's wife also sent screenshots to Lauren's parents, were mortified their daughter was involved with a married man. Meanwhile, my Dubai teaching position came with an 80 five k salary, free housing, and I started a weekend flight instruction business. But the real money came from taking over my uncle's company. Within two months, I'd expanded to corporate charters and landed a contract with a luxury resort chain worth 400 k annually. Connor started following my Instagram again after seeing photos of me flying over Dubai skyline. Even posted a comment, dude had no idea you were doing all this. Tanya from our friend group sent a DM. We all feel terrible about that night. Too late for fake friendship. And even faker.

Cynthia convinced me treating everyone equally meant giving them more. Because they weren't really Mine. But you were always my real daughter. The twins hated me for it. They wind I was too controlling and making them look bad. All while draining his savings on vacation. When I confronted Brittany, she just smirked. Dad wanted us to be happy. He's not going to live forever, so we might as well enjoy it now. His decline was brutal. I stayed up nights holding his hand. Cynthia and the twins locked themselves in their rooms, claiming they couldn't handle it. He. He passed away on a Tuesday morning while I was feeding him oatmeal. They were at the mall. The funeral was theater. Cynthia sobbed in designer black. The twins post for selfies captioned love you forever, dad. I said nothing. Just whispered goodbye to the man who finally remembered me.

Suddenly, she demanded a divorce, saying, you're useless to me now. I replied, don't regret this later. Lol. The funeral was Tuesday. By Friday, she was already shopping for a mansion in Beverly Hills. I don't need you anymore, she said, tossing divorce papers on our kitchen table next to my unemployment check. I'm finally free from dead weight. I just smiled and signed them without reading. She thought I was an idiot who'd given up. But here's what she didn't know. I've been having secret conversations with her father for months. Before he died, he'd called me one evening, voice shaking with disappointment. Son, I need to tell you something about Kimberly. She's been pressuring me to change my will. She wants me to cut out her brother and sister completely. Says they don't deserve anything because they abandoned me. That wasn't true. Her siblings lived across the country, but called him daily. Kimberly barely visited unless she needed money. There's more he can continued. I caught her going through my financial documents last week. She was photographing my bank statements and investment portfolios. When I confronted her, she said she was just helping me organize. That's when he told me his plan. The will Kimberly knew about. It was fake. He'd shown it to her on purpose to test her character. The real will was locked in a different lawyer's safe. Two weeks after the funeral, we're at What she thinks is the final divorce meeting. She struts in wearing a five thousand dollar Chanel dress and diamond earrings that cost more than my car. She's already bragging about her new Porsche in the mansion she put a deposit on. This is so exciting, she tells the lawyer. I can finally live the life I deserve. No more supporting a jobless husband who brings nothing to the table. The inheritance lawyer walks in with a thick leather folder. I recognize him immediately. It's Martin Lee, her father's real attorney, not the junior associate who'd been handling the official proceedings. Missus Benjamin, son, I'm afraid there's been a significant misunderstanding, he says calmly. Smile falters slightly. What kind of misunderstanding? The will was clear. I inherited everything. He opens the folder and slides a document across the mahogany table. This is your father's actual will, executed just three months before his death. The document you've been referencing was. Let's call it a preliminary draft. She grabs the papers, her manicured nails clicking against the desk. What are you talking about? This can't be right. Martin points to the highlighted section. Your father was quite specific. He left the entire estate to your husband, Benjamin here, with explicit instructions that you receive nothing if you initiated divorce proceedings within two years of his death. The color drains from her face. That's impossible.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After being homeless for two years, sleeping in parking lots, showering at truck stops, I finally saved enough to buy my own place. A small three bedroom house. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. The irony wasn't lost on me when I was homeless, begging them to let me park my camper in their driveway for just a few weeks. They called it an eye sore and told me to figure it out myself. My brother Dan actually laughed, calling me a homeless bum while his wife took pictures to mock me on social media. Now here they were, all four of them plus Dan's pregnant wife, going up at my door unannounced. They didn't even have my address. I never gave it to them. They must have followed me from work or something. Equally creepy. The moment I opened the door, they pushed past me like they owned the place. Dan's wife immediately started taking pictures again, but this time with dollar signs in her eyes. My parents were walking through my house like real estate agents, pointing at rooms, measuring spaces with their eyes, discussing which kid would get which bedroom. This is way too much space for just you, my mom declared, running her fingers along my kitchen. Counters. It's wasteful. My dad was already outside circling my property. Good luck. Size close to Dan's work, too. This will save us money on gas. That's when Dan pulled me aside into what used to be my peaceful living room. His wife and kids had already made themselves comfortable on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, tracking MUD across my carpet. Look, this is simple, Dan said, not even looking me in the eye. You don't need all this space. We're moving in next weekend. Can live in that camper out back. No discussion, no asking, no would you consider, or we'd really appreciate just informing me like I was a tenant getting evicted. The kids need stability, he continued. Olivia's pregnant again. We can't keep cramming everyone into mom and dad's place. I actually laughed. Absolutely not. That's when my mom marched back in from inspecting in my bedrooms. Daniel has four kids and another on the way. You're being selfish, living in all this space alone. My dad nodded from the doorway. It's time you helped family instead of just thinking about yourself. We raised you better than this. The audacity was breathtaking. These were the same people who wouldn't let me park in their driveway when I was literally homeless. Now they wanted to kick me out of my own house. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Let me get this straight. Do you want me to give up the house? I Bought with my own money. That I'm paying the mortgage on. So you can live here for free? We're not asking, Dan said, stepping closer like he was trying to intimidate me. We're telling you. Family comes first. You owe us. After everything we've done for you. Everything you've done for me? I almost choked. You literally called me a homeless bum.

Except my daughter, because she's not part of the family. Christmas morning, eight kids unwrapping identical iPhone boxes. My nine year old daughter, Grace watches as her cousins celebrate. Where's mine, grandma? She asks innocently. My mother in law, Brenda smiles coldly. These are for real family, sweetie. Blood, grandchildren only. Grace's face crumbles. Twenty relatives go silent. This woman has lived rent free in my house for six months, eating my food, using my utilities. Mom raised Grace since she was two. I tell Brenda she is family. Brenda shrugs. My money, my rules. I don't owe stepchildren anything. My wife Victoria just stares at her coffee, saying nothing. Grace runs upstairs crying. I hear her bedroom door slam. The other kids are already setting up their phones, completely oblivious. Brenda's watching with this satisfied smirk. You really think this is okay? I asked the Moria quietly. She's just old fashioned. Victoria whispers. Maybe we can talk to her. Later that night, after everyone left, I called my lawyer. She has no tenant rights. He confirmed. House guests become trespassers when asked to leave. Document everything. The next morning at breakfast, you have 24 hours to pack and go. Brenda laughs, nearly choking on her organic oatmeal. You can't throw out a poor old woman. I'll call the police. I'll call social services. Go ahead. This is my house, my name on the deed. Victoria Tried defending her. She's family. She didn't mean to hurt Grace. She's just said in her ways, she meant every single word. Choose right now. Your mother leaves, or you both do. Victoria's face went white. You can't make me choose. Victoria moved to the couch that night. Playing victim. You're destroying our family over a phone. Our six friend is already working the phones, calling every relative. He's kicking me out over nothing. I'm documenting everything with my phone. Every lie, every manipulation. Our 12 friend is calling distant cousins, spinning sob stories. He's throwing me on the streets. Victoria won't even defend me. The relatives start calling Victoria, pressuring her to fix this. Hour 18. The neighbors show up. Brenda's been telling them I'm financially abusing an elderly woman. Is everything okay here? Missus Baker asks nervously. Brenda seems really upset. I show her the security footage from Christmas morning. Brenda deliberately excluding Grace, calling her not real family. Missus Baker's face hardens. That poor, sweet baby, Brenda. You should be absolutely ashamed. You don't understand! Brenda protests. That's not even his real daughter. She's been his daughter for seven years. Mrs. Baker snaps out. 4:20, Brenda tries emotional blackmail on Victoria. I raised you alone, work two jobs. This is how you repay me? You raised her to abandon her own daughter? I reply calmly, that's not her daughter! Brenda screams. She calls Victoria, mom. What more do you need? Hour 22. Victoria is crying now. Caught Between loyalty and love. Maybe mom could apologize to Grace. It's too late for apologies, Victoria. She showed Grace exactly who she really is. But she's my mother. And Grace is your daughter. Act like it. Hour 23.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She look uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease, and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself. Then I started a long conversation with Daniel about this Epic party happening at some remote barn outside town. I made it sound exclusive, secretive, like something a paranoid mom would totally freak out about. I mentioned the address random dirt road I found on Google Maps that LED to absolutely nothing. I talked about how it was starting at midnight, how everyone was going to be there, how I couldn't wait to finally do something without my mom knowing. Then I put my phone down and waited. At 1:00am, the app logged that she opened the conversation. At 1:00am, I heard her bedroom Door Creek open. At 1:00am, I heard the garage door at

I've been planning Miranda's dream Valentine's Day for weeks. When she destroyed me over brunch, I just pulled out my phone to confirm the reservation at the restaurant she'd been dying to try, when she interrupted me. God, you're so clingy and needy. We need to talk, she said, pushing away the flowers I'd brought. I can't do this anymore. It's suffocating. You're always trying to be romantic, always wanting to do couple stuff. My heart broke. We're about to be a year, Miranda. Exactly why we need to set boundaries now. From now on, we're best friends who happen to sleep together. Treat me exactly like you treat Nate or will. No flowers or special treatment. Just buddies. I'm just someone you have sex with. She said it like I was pathetic for wanting more. Next to us, looked horrified. If that's what you want, I said quietly. She rolled her eyes. Finally. Maybe now you'll stop being so desperate and embarrassing. Valentine's Day arrived. Miranda texted asking about if we had plans. I responded that I was going to Nate's to watch the game. She could come if she wanted. Dead silence for an hour. Didn't we have a reservation? She finally asked. I reminded her that I don't make romantic reservations for my buddies. That night, she showed up at Nate's in a red dress and heels. Handed her a beer without Looking up from the TV and went back to the game. When she tried to sit next to me on the couch, I pointed to the recliner across the room. Dude, you're blocking the TV! Nate looked confused. Miranda's face went red. She spent the night watching us play video games and talk about sports. Her birthday came three weeks later. I got her what I got all my bros. A six pack of beer and buffalo wings from the sketchy place near campus. Stared at the grease stained container like it was radioactive. Where's my actual gift? She asked, voice shaking. That is your gift. Same thing I got will last month. Pretty good wings, too. But I'm your girlfriend. No, you're my friend who I occasionally sleep with. Your exact words. Didn't speak to me for two days. The real entertainment started at her company Spring Gala. She begged me to come, bought me a suit, and said it was important for her promotion. When her boss approached asking how long we've been together, I corrected him immediately, oh, we're not together. Her boss looked bewildered, but she said you were her boyfriend of 10 months. Nah, she doesn't do the relationship thing. We're buddies who hook up occasionally. She was actually just telling me how suffocating real relationships are. Miranda grabbed my arm so hard it left marks. Her coworkers started whispering. At her cousin's wedding in may, the disasters multiplied when they called for couples photos. I stayed seated, playing on my phone. We're not a couple, just friends with benefits, I explained to the photographer, who asked three times if I was sure. During the slow songs, I was at the bar with other guys talking about basketball, while she stood alone on the dance floor. Her family kept asking if we'd broken up. I explained cheerfully that Miranda didn't want to be together, just friends with benefits. Her grandmother nearly fainted. Her mom pulled her aside for a long conversation about self respect and not letting men use you. By month three, she was getting desperate. She tried to hold my hand in public. I'd give her a fist bump instead. When she leaned in for a kiss at dinner, I went for the high five. Bros don't make out at restaurants, I said. The waiter smirked.

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. Path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pan. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept pushing. To work at my house I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. I said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really I just didn't wanna trap him in a car with my smell. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space it took.

I need to be practical about my future. After she pulled out a prenup that could leave me with nothing. Allison and I had been together three years, engaged for six months, with our wedding planned for four months away. I'm a software engineer making $120,000. She works in marketing making $75,000. We. We're supposed to close on our first house in two weeks. I was contributing thirty five thousand dollars of the fifty thousand dollar down payment. Last Sunday she invited me to dinner at her parents upscale home. Her mom had prepared an elaborate spread and her dad, Greg was being unusually friendly, asking about my work and laughing at my jokes. Normally he treated me politely, but distantly. I thought they were finally accepting me as family. Halfway through dinner, Allison suddenly got this serious, rehearsed look. Sean, I think we should sign a prenuptial agreement before the wedding, she said, pulling out a Manila folder and sliding it across the table. My stuff like dropped. This whole dinner had been a setup. Her parents were nodding along. The prenup demanded complete financial separation. Separate bank accounts, separate credit cards, separate everything. But the real estate clause was the worst part. The house we were buying together would be titled solely in Allison's name. If we divorced, I'd walk away with nothing. Regardless of contributions to mortgage payments or improvement. I'd be paying Allison to live in a house She owned. When I asked why she suddenly wanted this, her mom jumped in. It's just smart financial planning, Sean. Surely someone in your field understands protecting assets. Her dad added, nothing personal, just business. This is how people like us protect what we've built. But when we started house shopping, Allison put for both our names on everything, saying it would show we were truly committed as partners. Now suddenly, she wanted legal separation of everything. I said I needed time to review it with a lawyer. The silence was deafening. A lawyer? Allison's voice pitched higher. I thought you'd be more mature about this. Monday morning, my lawyer, James, reviewed the document. His reaction was immediate. Sean, this is one of the most one sided documents I've ever seen. Don't sign this. He explained I'd pay half the mortgage, taxes, and maintenance on an asset entirely hers if we divorced. This reads like someone already planning for divorce while expecting you to subsidize her life until that happens. So I made two decision. I wouldn't sign the prenup, and I was withdrawing from the house purchase. I called our realtor and removed my name. Since Allison couldn't qualify for the mortgage alone without my contribution, this killed the deal. I also moved my $50,000 from our joint savings back to my personal account. When Allison discovered this, she called screaming, accusing me of sabotaging our relationship. Her family launched desperate attempts to pressure me. Her mother showed up, At my workplace, crying, her father offered to personally guarantee I

I replied, he changed mine, too. She didn't know he was my divorce lawyer. Celine had been acting weird for months. It started small. Suddenly caring about her appearance again, buying new clothes she couldn't afford on her teacher's salary. Then came the secret phone calls, where she'd step outside or lock herself in the bathroom. When I'd ask who called, she get defensive and say it was just her sister. The mysterious meetings were next. Working late at school again, she text. But when I drove by the parking lot at eight PM, her car wasn't there. She'd come home smelling like expensive Cologne and wine, claiming she'd grab dinner with colleagues. I'm not stupid. I knew something was happening. But after eight years together, I figured I owed it to us to try counseling first. That's when I started secretly meeting with Elias Thorn, the best divorce attorney in town. We've been planning my exit strategy for three months. Protecting my business, our joint accounts, the house I bought before we got to together. When she asked to talk last Friday, sitting at our kitchen table with this nervous energy, I knew what was coming. I'm leaving you, she said. And for the first time in months, she looked genuinely happy. I met someone incredible. A successful lawyer who actually understands me. She went on and on about how amazing he was, how intelligent, how sophisticated, how different. From me. He's handling this huge divorce case right now, making tons of money. He took me to that new French place downtown last week. You know, the one with the $200 steaks you said was too expensive. I just sat there, letting her paint this picture of her new life. She was practically glowing as she described their relationship. How he understood her need for finer things, how he made her feel valued and desired. He's taking me to Napa this weekend, she continued, her eyes bright with excitement. Says he's going to change my life forever. We're staying at some resort that costs more per night than you make in a week. The dig was unnecessary, but typical Celine. She'd always resented that I ran a small construction business instead of wearing suits and working in an office. I kept my voice calm and asked, that's nice. What's his name? Elias Thorn. She seemed like she was announcing she'd won the lottery. He's brilliant. Drives an Audi RS six, has this gorgeous office downtown. Everything I've always wanted. My stomach dropped, but I kept my face completely neutral. Elias Thorn wasn't just any lawyer. He was my divorce attorney. The one I've been secretly meeting with every Thursday for three months. The one who knew every detail about our finances, our relationship problems, our joint asset. Sounds great. I managed. When are you leaving? Tonight. He's picking me up at 7. I already packed a bag. She gestured. Toward her suitcase by the door, like she couldn't wait to escape. After she went upstairs to shower and get ready, I sat in my truck and called Elias. Straight to voicemail. I texted, emergency. Need to talk before Monday. Two hours later, while Celine was doing her makeup, he called back.

I watched my mom slowly dying over Facetime for months because I couldn't make enough money to go see her. She wanted to pay for my plane ticket, but I knew she wouldn't be able to afford her treatment if she did. So I begged her not to. I promised I'd come see her soon and started constantly picking up shifts at the restaurant I worked at. But one night, her doctor phoned me telling me he wasn't sure if she had much longer. It started coughing up blood but didn't want me to know so I wouldn't worry. It was then that I realized I wouldn't be able to save enough to go see her in time. I stayed up crying that entire night but still had to go to work the next day. Halfway through my shift, I saw Leonardo DiCaprio come in with who I think was his mom. I could tell he didn't want to be bothered because he had a hat, sunglasses and unshaven. I still knew it was him and just pretended that I didn't realize who he was. This was right after Titanic, so I was completely freaking out inside. I didn't tell anyone and treated him like any other customer as best as I could. However, at the end of the meal, I couldn't resist. Before I brought him the check, I wrote, your movies are awesome, I hope. You like the food on his receipt. When he got up to leave, I could see him looking around and smiled when he saw me. I thought this was the coolest thing ever. And when I went to go clean their table, I saw he wrote back, thank you so much for not blowing my cover and left a 500 dollar tip. At the time, this was so much money, I thought it was an accident. I was about to go run outside to give it back, but he was already gone. I remember feeling like I literally couldn't breathe and just tried to act normal. As soon as my shift ended that day, I booked the next flight out to see my mom. I phoned to tell her I was coming and I literally ran through the hospital to her room. I got there in time to spend her last 20 minutes with her. Because of him, I got to hug my mom one last time as she passed.

My sister announces she has stage 3 lymphoma at family dinner and mom immediately starts crying while dad opens his wallet. Everyone's posting prayers on Facebook. Within minutes, I asked to see medical paperwork and get screamed at for being jealous. Jealous cancer. She launches this 50,000 dollar gofundme for experimental treatment insurance won't cover. And money starts pouring in from strangers, 500 here, thousand there. She's posting daily in grey hoodies with sad selfies and inspirational quotes about fighting. So I noticed she's eating sushi at lunch. Raw fish. You can't eat that on chemo. It'll literally kill you with your immune system gone. I point this out and my family calls me heartless. My, my sister makes this crying TikTok. Even my own sister doesn't support me. I get death threats in my DMS, actual death threats. My cousin texts, you're disgusting. She's dying and you're jealous. Then my sister posts this, quote, you know what hurts more than cancer? Having a sister who wants me dead. My stomach drops. She's turned everyone against me for asking one question, one question about paperwork. My mom won't even look at me at Sunday dinner. My dad says I should apologize for causing stress during her treatment. Treatment, right? Anyway, I start taking screenshots of everything. Tuesday, she posts at chemo all day, but she's tagged at a wine tasting two hours away. That same afternoon. I Screenshot both with time stamps. Then I find her Amazon account still logged in on the family computer. Order history shows real plastic bald cap. Forty seven dollars and ninety nine cents delivered last month. I screenshot the receipt. My hands are shaking. No one will believe me. They'll say I photoshopped it. But I keep going. I check the hospital visitor parking website, the one that validates tickets and it says her license plate never appears in the entire 3 months of her supposed treatment. I call the hospital building department and record the entire call. Legal in my state. They said they had no patient under her name. The woman on the phone sounds confused when I ask again. Meanwhile, my sister posts about chemo brain making her forget things. But that same night she wins a game of trivia at the local bar. She receives a 20 five dollar gift card to Red Lobster. I'm starting to feel crazy. Maybe I'm wrong. But then I see her doing perfect cartwheels in the backyard in the morning. She's training for a 5K. How? However, she'll bring up cancer fatigue anytime the family needs something done. Then her go fund me hits $38,000. I find her Venmo and see she's literally buying designer bags, not medicine. Every purchase was dated after her diagnosis. So I create a folder on my phone, 147 pieces of evidence. Each screenshot feels like an extra layer of armour in my fight to reveal The truth, I became a detective not because I wanted to, because nobody else would. However, my sister announces she's getting a bravery award at my aunt's charity gala. I tried to tell her this gala is for real pediatric cancer patients, kids who are actually dying. She scoffed at me and said she was a real patient, that she deserved this award for everything she had been going through. That's when I decided this ends tomorrow. On gala night, there are 200 guests, including real cancer survivors and sick children. My sister's on the stage in a silk head wrap giving a speech. Cancer taught me that angels walk among us. I noticed the bald cap edge peeking out. When she goes in to hug the mayor, he hands her the award plaque and she starts fake crying, dabbing carefully under her eyes. I walk on stage with my phone. Before we celebrate, can everyone look at the screen? I connect to the projector prearranged with the AV tech up top who lost his mom to actual cancer. The Amazon bald cap receipt appears. My sister's name and address on the big screen for all to see. Gasps. And there's the wine tasting screenshots, her Venmo purchases with gofundme money. Someone drops a champagne glass. My sister's frozen, stammering. This is, you don't understand. I walk up to her. Let's show them what's really under there. I pull off the head wrap, then peel the bald cap off. Perfect. Blonde hair tumbles down. A child in the front row starts crying. Her mother stands up. You stole from dying children. My aunt grabs the microphone. Security escort her out. My sister runs with the cap still dangling from her hand. Turns out the only thing terminal was her credibility.

So in my junior year, I had this horrible cavity that was killing me, but I couldn't get to the dentist for another week. The pain was unbearable. So I started carrying this little bottle of clove oil my mom gave me. If you've never used it, clove oil numbs your gums when you have tooth pain. Anyway, I'm sitting in English class, and this wave of pain hits me. So I pull out my little dropper bottle and put some on my finger, then rub it on my gum. My friend Marcos leans over and whispers, dude, are you taking drugs in class? I explain it's just clove oil for my tooth, and he asks, try it. Because his wisdom teeth were coming in, I let him have a drop, and within minutes, he's like, whoa, this stuff is amazing. By lunch, Marcos had told, like, five people about my magic potion, and they all wanted to try it. The next day, three different people showed up with their own little dropper bottles. One girl had peppermint oil, claiming it helped her focus. Another guy brought lavender oil, saying it calmed his test anxiety. By Wednesday, our chemistry teacher, Missus Patterson, noticed half the class pulling out tiny bottles before the quiz. She stopped the class and asked what was going on. When we explained, instead of shutting it down, she got excited and started talking about aromatherapy and Essential oils Thursday morning the morning announcements included a warning not to share oils because of potential allergies. This obviously made everyone want them more. Friday the hallways smelled like a weird combination of eucalyptus tea tree and something called Thieves Blend that apparently fights germs. The following Monday, some senior girls started wearing those little glass vial necklaces filled with different colored oils. By Wednesday, those necklaces were everywhere. The drama kids started wearing multiple vials color coded to their emotional needs for the day. Red for energy, blue for calm, purple for creativity. The football team got in on it, claiming peppermint oil improved their reaction time. They started rubbing it on their temples before practice. Our principal finally had to call an assembly about proper essential oil etiquette, which is possibly the weirdest assembly topic in school history. Actually made rules like no applying oils during class and no diffusers in lockers because someone had rigged one up with a small fan. The yearbook committee created a two page spread called the year of Essential Enlightenment with photos of students and their favorite oils. They interviewed me as the trend originator and I tried explaining I just had a toothache, but that part never made the final edit. The school nurse eventually started a scent free zone in her office for kids with allergies or sensitivities. The funniest part was parents started complaining about having to buy these expensive oils because their kids insist did they needed Them. The local health food store actually created a student starter kit with five tiny bottles for $25. My dentist finally fixed my cavity, but I kept carrying my clove oil as a weird good luck charm. Even teachers got into it. Our math teacher claimed lemon oil helped her grade papers faster, all because I had a toothache and couldn't get to the dentist. Sometimes the dumbest trends start from the most random necessity. Four years later and my younger sister says kids still bring oils to school, though now they claim it's for focus and emotional support, rather than admitting they're just following a trend that started because of my bad dental hygiene.

I looked at her confused. What trip? I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She and even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took the One thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station just to afford my rent and groceries. I continued my voice, getting stronger, eating ramen Noodles for dinner. While watching them feast like royalty, I thought maybe you'd forgotten about my graduation. Or maybe you were disappointed in me. But this whole time, they were living off money meant for me. Grandma scrolled through the photos, her face getting redder with each. This hotel cost $800 a night. I know because I stayed there last year. And this restaurant, their appetizers start at $50. My dad tried to interrupt, loosening his collar nervously. Mom, if you'd just let us explain the situation. Explain what, Nelson? How you forged my grandson's signature on bank documents? How you intercepted mail addressed specifically to him? How you've been lying to my face for months while spending his money? She reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope with legal documents. I brought copies of everything. Bank transfer with Diego's name, the hotel reservations in his name, the flight confirmations, the detailed itinerary. I spent weeks planning for his graduation gift. My mom started crying. But not the sorry kind of crying. The angry, caught kind, where she knew her game was over. You always liked him more than Estonia anyway, ever since they were kids. Because he works for everything he has. Grandma slammed the envelope on the table, making the wine glasses shake. While you've raised a spoiled princess who thinks the world owes her everything just for existing. Estonia finally spoke, her voice shaky and small. I didn't know it was Diego's money. I Swear! I thought it was just family money. Bullshit, I said, surprising myself with how calm and controlled I sounded. You knew exactly what you were doing when you posted those photos and tagged them. Living my best life while I was pulling double shifts and sleeping four hours a night. Other diners were definitely staring now, but I didn't care anymore. Years of being invisible in my own family was finally coming to an end. Grandma opened her purse and pulled out her phone with steady hands. I'm calling my lawyer tomorrow morning. Every penny gets repaid within 30 days, or I'm pressing charges for theft and fraud. My parents started begging, their voices overlapping and desperate. Please. But he was already walking away toward the exit. As she hugged me goodbye in the parking lot, she whispered, pack your bags. Tonight you're coming to live with me and finishing that master's degree you wanted. I'm also buying you that Europe trip again. And this time, you're actually going. The next morning, they found out grandma had already frozen their access to all her accounts. The repo man showed up for Dad's motorcycle by noon, and the bank called about their overdue credit card payments by evening.

My mom had two rules that she drilled into me since I was 8 years old. Never mention dad to anyone. Never use our real last name. Your dad was a bad man, an evil man. If he finds you, he'll hurt us both, she'd tell me. It confused me because he always seemed friendly. But now, because of him, we were constantly on the run, moving to a new school every year, using a new name, wearing a new personality to match. When I was a bit older, mom explained in detail how dad was in prison for armed robbery, had a family with ties to the cartel, how mom testified against them and was now stuck in witness Protection. It destroyed my social life and made me really hate him. That is, until the real truth came out. I secretly made a fake Instagram account at the school library just to see what normal kids lives look like. While I was scrolling through photos of old friends and classmates, got a message from an account with no picture. Is your mom's name Angeline? My heart stopped. I almost deleted everything right there. But something made me respond. Who are you? I'm your dad. Prove it, I said confidently. When the stranger actually sent me evidence, I felt the entire room spin. According to Mom, Dad was in prison. But this person claiming to be Him managed to send photos I'd never seen before. Me as a baby in his arms. My birth certificate with a completely different last name. Private investigator reports showing he'd been searching for us for eight years. And not a single arrest record. I kept it a secret from mom. Came home acting normal, only to spend time at the library computers again the next day chatting with him. We started having weekly video calls, explaining things little by little. Your mom took you? The day I discovered she'd emptied my business accounts. Told me one afternoon $400,000 meant for employee payroll. She had a gambling problem I've been trying to help her with. When I found out about the theft and started calling the police, she picked you up from school and disappeared. Somehow I believed him. It made more sense than anything mom had been telling me for years. Why didn't you have her arrested? I asked. If I did, she said she'd take you down with her. And that scared me. Dad started tearing up on camera, but all I could think of was what now? One day after school, mom smiled and introduced me to a man with tattoos. This does the kid? He asked in a raspy voice. Yes. Say hi to your Uncle Tony. He's visiting all the way from Vegas. I stared at him, frozen. Something about the sharp suit, Cuban cigar and brass knuckles made my body too weak to say hello. Now go do your homework upstairs. Mom sent me away. I sat upstairs peeking at them from an angle on the stairs where they couldn't see me. I watched them set up cards, pour drinks, laughing. Angeline, I still can't believe you pulled off that 400,000 score from your husband. Tony said mom giggled. Easiest money I ever stole. He was too trusting. That was legendary. Cleaned out his whole construction business, then vanished with the kid. Brilliant. Well, I Learned from the best. Besides, I knew he couldn't do anything. Not if he wanted to.

My parents banned me from learning the local language because they said it would dilute my cultural purity. We moved here when I was 18 months old for dad's job, and 17 years later we were still here, living in an expat bubble where nobody had to interact with locals. My parents sent me to the International Academy, where everything was taught in our language by imported teachers who cost more than most locals made in five years. They genuinely believed learning the local language would erase my heritage and turn me into someone they couldn't recognize, pointing to other expat kids who'd gone native as cautionary tales. I lived in a country where I couldn't talk to 90% of the people. Every interaction outside our bubble required a translator or embarrassing hand gestures that made me look like an idiot tourist. I watched local kids my age hanging out in coffee shops and playing soccer in the park, but I couldn't join them because I literally couldn't communicate beyond pointing and smiling. My parents said this was good because local kids would be a bad influence, teaching me their backward ways and making me forget my superior education. They didn't understand that I had no connection to a homeland I couldn't even remember while being locked out of the only country I'd ever known. When I turned 14, I started secretly learning the language using a phone I bought with birthday Money and hid in my school locker. Every lunch break, I'd sit in the furthest bathroom stall with headphones, work, looking through language apps and watching local shows with subtitles. After two years, I was nearly fluent, but had to pretend I couldn't understand anything around my parents. The hardest part was stopping myself from reacting when people talked about us in public, assuming we couldn't understand their comments about rich foreigners who thought they were too good to integrate. Sometimes locals would say horrible things about my mom's clothes or my dad's attitude while we stood right there, and I had to keep my face complete, completely blank. My whole double life worked perfectly until that Saturday at the imported goods store my parents loved because all the staff spoke our language. We were shopping for Mom's birthday party when a man burst through the entrance waving something metallic that caught the fluorescent lights. He was shouting instructions that made everyone drop to the floor immediately except for us and two other foreign families who just stood there confused. A man's face was covered with a Bandana and his eyes were wild as he pointed his weapon at the cowering cashiers and kept yelling the same phrases over and over. My parents were complete frozen because they had no idea what was happening beyond the obvious threat. Dad actually started walking toward the exit, which made the man spin around and scream directly at him while jabbing the weapon. In his direction. Dad just kept walking because he didn't understand the man was telling him to get on the ground or he'd make an example out of him. And started counting down from five in the local language, his finger moving toward what was clearly a trigger. And my parents just stood there like confused tourists, waiting for someone to translate, get on the ground right now, because he's about to shoot dad! I screamed at my parents in our language while dropping to my knees. The shock on their faces wasn't from the death threat, but from hearing me translate perfectly. Mom's mouth fell open as I rapidly explained that the man wanted everyone's phones in a pile, women's jewelry in a bag, and nobody to look at his face.

You ever meet someone so arrogant that you just know they're gonna hurt themselves? Well, that's exactly what happened when I met this clueless woman at a dog park. I ended up watching her own dog bite her literal arm after she ignored my warnings. I've been a veterinarian for 12 years in Denver, Colorado. That morning, I taken my golden retriever, Max, to Cheeseman Park. The place was packed. Probably 40 dogs running around, kids on the playground nearby, and people doing yoga on the grass. Max was doing his usual thing. Sing every blade of grass like it held the secrets of the universe. That's when I noticed this Jack Russell terrier near the water fountain. Something was clearly off about him. The dog was stumbling slightly. Not the playful tumble of a happy dog, but that distinctive neurological wobble I'd seen too many times in my clinic. Then I saw the foam. Not just a normal dog drool, but thick white foam collecting at the corners of his mouth. The real tell was his eyes, dilated pupils, despite the bright morning sun and this vacant, unfocused stare. When another dog approached to play, the Jack Russell snapped at it. My stomach dropped. They were textbook rabies symptoms, and everyone at the park could potentially be in danger. The owner, this woman in designer workout clothes and pristine white sneakers, was simply scrolling through her phone, completely oblivious. I approached Her carefully keeping Max behind me. Excuse me, is that your Jack Russell? She looked up. Smile proudly. Yes, that's Winston. Isn't he precious? I kept my voice calm, professional. Ma'am, I'm a veterinarian and I'm concerned about your dog. He's showing symptoms that could indicate rabies. We need to get him contained and to an emergency vet immediately. Her face transformed instantly from proud mom to outraged defender. Excuse me, what did you say about my baby? Did you just call him dangerous? I tried again, pulling out my veterinary license from my wallet. Look, I'm a veterinarian. Your dog has neurological symptom, excessive salivation and aggression. When was his last rabies vaccination? She actually laughed. Oh, my god, you're one of those people. Winston is perfectly healthy. He's just excited to be at the park. The phone was getting worse, dripping onto the ground now. Ma'am, please, this is serious. Rabies is fatal. If she cut me off. Voice rising to a shriek that made everyone turn. Oh, please. You're just jealous because my dog is purebred and yours is just some mutt. I know your type. Bitter, judgmental women who can't stand seeing others happy. Now she was making a scene, waving her arms. This crazy woman is harassing me about my dog. She's probably not even a real vet. Other dog owners were starting to stare, some pulling their dogs closer. I showed my license to anyone who'd look. Please, someone help me convince her that Dog is sick. But he kept going louder now. Get away from us! You're ruining our morning. Winston is perfectly fine. Aren't you, baby? She bent down toward the dog, and I saw him tense up. That pre bite body language I knew too well. Don't touch him, I warned. She flip me off. Go away, you psycho! Find someone else to bother with your fake expertise. I walked away, but my years of experience wouldn't just let me leave. Instead, I sat on a bench about 30 feet away, where I could watch them while animal control on my cell. The dispatcher said they'd send someone, but it might take 20 minutes. I kept Max close, my eyes locked on Winston. The woman went back to her phone, occasionally baby talking to her dog, completely unaware he was now growling at shadows. I started recording on my phone, partly for evidence, partly because I knew what was coming. Other dogs instinctively gave Winston a wide birth. Animals know when something's wrong, even

Because she deserves comfort. I was at work when I got the call. Pack your stuff, my mom said without even saying hello. Emma's moving into your apartment this weekend. I literally had to sit down. my 22 year old sister who's never held a job longer than three weeks. It's apparently more deserving of the one bedroom apartment I've been renting for two years. What are you talking about? I asked, but mom was already in full explanation mode. She broke up with her boyfriend and needs somewhere to live. You make good money, you can afford something bigger. Emma needs the comfort right now. The comfort of my apartment that I paid one thousand and two hundred dollars a month for. I drove straight to my parents'house. Emma was already there, surrounded by boxes growing through apartment listings on her phone. Expensive ones. Oh, good, you're here. Dad said like I'd come to help move. Emma found some nice places downtown. Two bedrooms, pools, the works. With what money? I asked. Emma finally looked up. Well, since you're moving out anyway, I figured you could co sign. You know, help family. They wanted me to give up my apartment and co sign for her upgrade. Absolutely not, I said. That's when mom pulled out the trip. After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us? Emma's going through such a hard time with the breakup. What about when I was going through a hard time? I asked. When I was working three jobs just to make rent. That's different, dad said dismissively. You're stronger. Emma's more sensitive. Sensitive, right. Is that what we're calling someone who quits jobs because the manager looked at her wrong? Look, we already called your landlord, mom said casually. My blood went cold. You what? Just to let him know about the transition, Emma will take over the lease. Mike seemed very understanding. They had called my landlord about my apartment without asking me. Emma's already picked out new furniture, mom continued. She showed me her Pinterest board. A white leather couch, one of those big sectionals. Emma beamed. Jake loves modern decor. He's gonna help me set everything up. Jake who you've been dating for two weeks? I asked. Three weeks, she corrected indignantly. And he's different. He has his own business. What business? She waved her hand vaguely. Like consulting or something. The point is, he's mature. Not like your ex who couldn't even afford to take you anywhere nice. My ex who worked construction and saved every penny? The one my parents constantly criticized for not being ambitious enough? Besides, dad added, Emma's got potential. She just needs the right environment to flourish. Your apartment has good energy. Good energy? The apartment I'd scrubbed on hands and knees when I moved in. The one I'd furnish, piece By piece from thrift stores. She's already planning a housewarming party, mom continued excitedly. Emma's finally ready to be social again. Emma nodded enthusiastically. I'm thinking next Saturday. I already invited some people. Jake's bringing his friends. With what money? I repeated, but they all ignored me. Oh, and Emma's going to need your security deposit back from Mike, Dad added. Matter of fact, for the new furniture. I stared at them. They wanted my apartment, my landlord relationship, and my security deposit. This is insane, I said quietly. What's insane, Emma snapped, is how selfish you're being. I'm going through a major life change, and you're acting like I'm asking for a kidney.

While my sister's daughters were laughing. I adopted Sophia when she was two years old. From the first moment I saw her, those big eyes, shy laugh, I knew she'd be my world. It doesn't matter that she doesn't carry my blood. To me, she's my daughter in every sense. But my parents never accepted her. When I told them about the adoption, my mother's face twisted with disgust. Why don't you find a woman and have your own children? My father was more direct. She's not our blood, Esteban. It's not the same. Despite their rejection, I maintained a relationship because as I believed, family should be united. When they lost their jobs, I agreed to pay their mortgage a considerable sum every month. Meanwhile, my sister Clara's daughters deliria and Camilla were treated like Queens at my parents house, while Sophia was barely included in games. One day I decided Sophia should spend time with her cousins while I had an important work meeting. Don't worry, my mother said with a fake smile. She'll be fine here. I left Sophia with her pink back pack, huge smile on her face. I'm going to play with my cousins, daddy. The meeting dragged longer than expected. When I returned that evening, something felt wrong. The front door was a jar and I could hear harsh voices. My Mother was yelling. Wash those dishes well, you useless girl! Look, there's still dirty! I entered silently, and what I saw shattered my heart. Sophia was standing on a wooden box in the kitchen, hands deep in soapy water. Her tiny arms could barely reach the dishes, her face red, with tears streaming down her cheeks. She was sobbing, trying to clean a large plate she could barely hold. Meanwhile, Clara's daughters were mocking Sophia while playing with toys. My parents had forced my little girl to do chores like a servant. What's going on here? I shouted, storming into the kitchen. Sophia looked up and ran into my arms, hands wet and trembling. Daddy, I'm sorry. I don't know how to wash dishes well, she sobbed against my chest. I felt Siri I'd never experienced before. Why is Sophia washing dishes while Valeria and Camilla make fun of her? My mother approached dismissively. We're just teaching her to be useful. Don't be so dramatic. She's a six year old girl. She should be playing with her cousins, not scrubbing dishes she can't even reach. While you call her useless, my father spoke up. Clara's girls don't have to do that because there are real granddaughters. Those words hit like a punch to the stomach. Real? I said, voice full of contempt. So Sophia isn't real? Is that why you treat her like trash? You don't love her, you've never loved her! What kind of grandparents do that? My father Raised his voice this is our house and we do things our way. If you don't like it, take the girl and leave. I took Sophia in my arms and walked out. On the way home, she asked quietly, daddy, why don't grandma and Grandpa love me? I felt the world come crashing down that night. I made a decision. If they couldn't love Sophia as she deserved, they deserved nothing from me. I called the bank and canceled the mortgage payment.

I said no. Next day, I found my car smashed to pieces. My cousin Emma was getting married and apparently needed $15,000 for her dream venue. The family meeting was called on a Tuesday night, and I knew something was up when everyone gathered in the living room like some kind of intervention. Emma's wedding is in six weeks, mom announced, and the venue fell through. The new place cost more than expected. Emma sat there with crocodile tears streaming down her face. I just don't know what to do. This was supposed to be perfect. That's when dad dropped the bomb. We've all agreed to chip in. Your uncle's covering the flowers, your aunt's handling catering, and you're going to sell your car. I nearly choked on my drink. Excuse me. Your Honda Civic should get around $15,000, mom said. Matter of factly, it's the perfect solution. Are you you insane? That's my car. I need it for work. Emma looked up with those manipulative eyes she perfected since childhood. Come on, cousin. Family comes first, right? I do the same for you. Which was absolutely hilarious, because Emma once stole my prom date two days before prom and laughed about it at the family barbecue. She'd also borrowed my college textbooks and never returned them, costing me $800. But apparently, I was supposed to forget all that for family. Unity? I'm not selling my car, I said firmly. The room went silent. Dad's face turned red, that vein in his forehead starting to throb like it always did when someone dared challenge his authority. That car is sitting in our driveway, he said slowly. You live under our roof. You'll do what's best for this family. Or what? But mom jumped in with her favorite weapon, emotional manipulation. How can you be so selfish? Emma's always been there for you. Remember when you were sick in high school and she brought you soup? That soup incident happened once, seven years ago, and she'd complained about it for weeks afterward. Uncle Ray nodded approvingly. In my day, young people respected their elders and helped family without question. Emma started crying harder. I guess I'll just have to tell everyone the wedding is canceled because my own cousin wouldn't help me. The guilt tripping session went on for another hour. Every family obligation, every time they'd help me, every reason why I owed them this favor got thrown in my face. But I held firm. Finally, dad delivered his ultimatum. Sell the car by Friday or pack your bags and find somewhere else to live. And don't expect any help from this family ever again. Fine, I said. Stay. Ending up. I guess we'll see what happens Friday. That night, I overheard them in the kitchen. Mom's voice carried through the thin walls. She'll cave. She always does when we threaten. To cut her off. Dad agreed. She's too dependent on us. Where's she gonna go? She can't afford rent. Anywhere decent. Emma laughed that nasty laugh of hers. Maybe this will finally teach her that family.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her coworker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball. Scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. Remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms. Would grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror. Practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of texting Back or giving him some weird speech? I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favorite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finish.

We're done being your servants, mom announced, slapping a contract on the kitchen table I'd scrubbed an hour ago. This says that you will do exactly 50% of all household chores. Sign it. She started recording on her phone while dad stood behind her, arms crossed, exhausted from carrying you. The irony was incredible. I've been doing way more than 50% of everything for two years. While they couldn't even tell you where we kept the laundry detergent. Mom hadn't cooked since 2022. Dad hadn't touched a vacuum in forever, yet they genuinely believe they were doing most of the housework. 50% or find somewhere else to live, dad added, wearing the shirt I'd ironed that morning. I looked at the contract, then at their smug faces. Then I signed it with a smile. You're absolutely right. 50% starting tomorrow. I promise I'll never do more than my exact share again. Actually high fived each other like they just won a free slave in the lottery, not realizing their problems were about to skyrocket. The next morning, mom was on the phone with her sister at 6 a m, bragging about their breakthrough and parenting. We finally taught him responsibility, she gloated. Kids these days need firm boundaries, dad chimed in from the bathroom. Should have done this years ago. Watch how smooth everything runs now that he knows we mean Business. They moved through their morning routine with the confidence of people who never had to think about clean clothes magically appearing in their closets or lunches mysteriously packing themselves. That's when I decided to follow exactly what the contract said. Twenty minutes later, I started the laundry and pulled my clothes out midcycle, leaving the machine full of soapy water. Dad discovered his work shirts floating in cold, gray water at 7 a m, his confident whistling dying mid note as he started screaming from the laundry room. He missed his critical client meeting trying to dry a shirt with Mom's hair dryer still damp, patches visible during his afternoon presentation. Mom fared no better. She'd assumed her presentation outfit would be clean as always, only to find it buried under a week of their dirty clothes. She did her zoom presentation to in a wrinkled gym shirt, her credibility evaporating as quickly as her promotion chances. By Wednesday, the house reeked. I'd taken out exactly one trash bag, mine leaving theirs to ferment in the summer heat. When Mom's book club arrived, I watched from my spotless half of the living room as her best friend's face contorted at the smell. We're doing exactly fifty fifty now, I explained cheerfully, showing them Mom's recorded contract. She was very insistent about fairness. The women exchanged glance before suddenly remembering other commitments. Mom's smile cracked like old paint. The real collapse came Friday when Dad's boss arrived for dinner. I'd Vacuumed exactly half of each room, leaving a perfect line down the middle like a bizarre art installation. Dining table was set only on my side, where I sat eating takeout while dad frantically tried to explain why half their home looked abandoned. Where's the food? Dad hissed in the kitchen. I only bought my half of groceries. Cooking for others would exceed my share. I called out loud enough for his boss to hear. The man left after 15 minutes, muttering about family choose. When they realized they'd messed up, they attempted gaslighting me into going back to how things were. You're being deliberately difficult, mom accused during another family meeting. This isn't what we meant, and you know it. I pulled out my phone, playing back her video from the first meeting. You said, and I quote, exactly 50% of all household chores. No more free rides. I have spreadsheets showing I'm doing precisely 50%. Dad tried a different angle. You're supposed to be mature enough to under

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the I R S. And I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly, and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My. My neighbor, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to Be this helpless single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? The cashier is asking for I D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5 or an S? The scratching messed it up. I gave him completely fake numbers, mixing up digits, going super slow. After 20 minutes of this, he got frustrated. Ma'am, those numbers don't work. Go buy new cards. So I did the whole routine again. Drove to Walmart, called him back, crying harder. The first store's cards didn't work. Are you sure you're really from the IRS? This time I really went for it. I'm in the Walmart parking lot fake crying so loud. Other shoppers were staring. My kids are asking why mommy is buying $5,000 worth of iTunes cards. My daughter wants to know if we're going to be homeless. The scammer actually tried to comfort me. Don't worry, ma'am, just read me the numbers and everything will be fine. I fed him another set of fake numbers, this time adding sorry, my baby spilled juice on the card. Let me clean It off. Three hours in, this guy had wasted his entire afternoon on me. I could hear other scammers in the background getting impatient. His supervisor was probably wondering why he hadn't closed the deal yet. That's when I went for the kill shot. You know what's funny? I just got off the phone with my cousin Jake. He's the police officer standing right next to me, and he says, you're not from the IRS at all. Dead silence. Then what? Yeah, Jake says the IRS

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Gregs when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis Instagram on his own phone. A skateboarder? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere. Right there over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said, while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school. Well, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up except for Gregs. Gregs showed up mysteriously in my Valorant lobby. Hey, Mel, it's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things, school friends. My strict parent, he never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I'd vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, he said once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break, she asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay. My heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it. After she left, Greggy messaged, maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregory on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends. Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring, can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he'd be home. She tried calling her parents, but they didn't pick up. And I didn't have my own parents number.

You visiting mom every single day makes me look like a bad daughter, she says while scrolling through her phone. You're babying her. She's only 72 and you're acting like she's some martyr. It's creating an unhealthy codependency. I read about it in my therapy group. Then she drops it. New rule you visit once a month just like me, or I'm changing mom's locks. I already talked to a locksmith. And don't even think about making copies. I'm getting those special locks that can't be duplicated. Get mom for backup. But she just shrugs and says whatever we think is best, though she does quietly add that she enjoys the daily visits. Classic mom avoiding conflict. I noticed she puts her keys in the refrigerator, but I don't say anything because what's the point? Fine. I tell my sister once a month. But when this goes wrong, remember, this was your idea. Week one without my daily visits and the neighbor calls me at work. Your mom was outside at 3:00am looking for her cat. Thing is, mom doesn't have a cat. Never has. I want to rush over, but my sister already threatened to change the lock, so I call her instead. The neighbors being dramatic, she says. Haven't had time to check myself, but Mom's fine. Week 2, mom calls me crying that someone stole all her Food. My sister checks, text me a photo of a full fridge like I'm the crazy one. Doesn't notice it's all expired. The milk dated three weeks ago. Week 3 gets worse. The bank calls because mom tried to withdraw 30,000 in cash for the nice man fixing my roof. There is no man. There's no roof damage. My sister still insists I'm overreacting. Stop hovering. She can manage her own money. After the bank incident, I can't help myself. I drive by Mom's house anyway. Her newspapers are piling up. I leave groceries on the porch and run before my sister can find out. I keep my distance like she demanded. Then mom shows up at my house one morning. She walked here. That's eight miles. In her slippers. Where's your father? She asked me. Is he picking me up? Dad's been dead five years. My sister says she's just having a bad day. The grocery store calls next. Mom's been there four hours, putting items in other people's carts, telling everyone she's waiting for her husband. The manager says she's been returning the same item to different aisles over and over. My sister arrives first, and I hear her frustration over the phone. Mom, stop being difficult. Mom's response breaks me. I'm sorry, miss, but I don't know you. When I finally get there, mom immediately relaxes when she sees me and grabs my hand. Oh, good, you're here. That angry lady keeps following me. A week later, Three towns over, police find mom at a McDonald's. She. She's been there since morning, telling everyone she's waiting for her kids after school. She thinks it's 1987. She keeps asking the female officer if she should wear her red dress to see Tom sell it tonight because he likes when I show a little leg. When my sister shows up, mom backs away from her. I don't go with strangers, but she sees me and lights up. Oh, thank god. This woman keeps claiming she knows me. My sister's crying now. Mom, please. I'm your daughter. Mom turns to me. Whisper, that woman seems angry. Is she bothering you? The doctor's appointment mom missed three times finally happens because I drive her there. He pulls us both aside after the brain scan. How long has your mother been showing signs of dementia? My sister actually laughs. She doesn't have dementia. The doctor turns his computer screen toward us. She's stage 4. These symptoms have been building for at least a year. And she's lost 15 pounds. My stomach drops. We didn't notice under her cardigan. My sister's still arguing when he asks who's been managing her care. No one. I mean, my sister used to visit daily, but I made her stop. I told her it was unhealthy. Codependency. I read about it online. The doctor's face changes completely. You stopped her care routine. Why? The doctor looks straight at my sister. Your sister's daily visits were probably the Only thing keeping her stable without routine and familiar

My parents were obsessed with this article they'd read about teenage sleep cycles and peak growth hormone production. At 15, I had the most humiliating bedtime of anyone I knew. 7 p m. Sharp. No exceptions. While my friends were doing homework, studying for tests, or just living normal teenage lives, I was lying in the dark, listening to the world continue without me. It didn't matter if I had a chemistry exam the next morning or a group project. You. Mom would physically take my textbooks away at six forty five PM and march me to my room. Your health is more important than anything, she'd say. While dad would at his favorite line about how the teenage brain needs 12 hours of sleep for proper development. I'd failed three tests this semester alone because I couldn't study. And my teachers were starting to think I didn't care about school. The worst part was hearing my Xbox notifications going off every night at 9 p m. When my friends logged on to play together. They'd given up inviting me months ago. My parents had installed blackout curtains, removed all electronics from my room, and even put a baby monitor. Yes, a baby monitor at 15, to make sure I stayed in bed. So I started getting creative. First, I tried the classic pillow under the blanket trick. But the baby monitor's night vision caught me sneaking out immediately. Then I discovered That if I position myself just right, I could hide under my desk in the monitor's blind spot and use my phone with the brightness all the way down. But mom figured that out when she did a random wellness check. Ten PM. After that, they started taking my phone at six thirty PM, too, so I got more desperate and smarter. They installed a smart lock on my door that would alert their phones if it opened after seven PM. I Learned to pick it with a Bobby pin. They put tape on the door frame to see if I'd left. I Learned to carefully remove and replace it. This went on for months, an exhausting war of attrition where I was fighting just to have the base freedom. Then one fateful night, I'd finally won a small victory. My parents had been at a dinner party and came home exhausted, going straight to bed without their usual final check. I waited until I heard dad snoring, then carefully positioned myself under the desk with my phone, ready to finally join my friends online for the first time in forever. I was just about to text them when I smelled something wrong. A sharp chemicals smell that made my nose tingle. At first I thought maybe I was imagining it from being cooped up in my room too long, but it got stronger. Then I recognized it. Gas. Natural gas. Like when mom had accidentally blown at the Pilot Light last year. My heart started racing as I crept to my door and carefully opened it. The smell hit me like a wall. The entire hallway reeked of it. I ran to the kitchen and saw the problem immediately. One of the burner knobs was turned to the on position, but there was no flame. Gas had been pouring into our house for who knows how long. My hands shaking, I turned off the burner and opened the kitchen window, then ran to my parents'room. Mom

So I packed my things and left, but now she's begging me to come back. Last Sunday at my in law's house for their 30th anniversary dinner, everything seemed perfect. My wife Emma was helping her mom arrange flowers while I watched the game with her dad. My buddy Josh was there, too. He's been like family since college, always invited to everything. The whole extended family was there, maybe 20 people total. Emma's cousins, her weird Uncle Dave who likes vintage spoons. Her grandmother, who still asks when we're having kids even though we've been trying for three years. After dinner, her Aunt Linda starts this thing where everyone shares their sliding door moments. Those what if scenarios that keep you up at night. Everyone's going around the table sharing cute stories. Her cousin Sarah talks about almost moving to Japan to teach English. Uncle Dave mentions nearly buying Bitcoin in 2,010. Her brother Tom jokes about almost joining the military instead of becoming an accountant. Normal, harmless stuff that gets people thinking. Then it's Emma's turn. She's had a few glasses of wine, and she gets this dreamy, distant look in her eyes, like she's somewhere else entirely. Honestly, she says, looking directly at Josh across the table, I sometimes think I should have dated Josh instead of Mark back in college. We just click so naturally, you know, the entire table goes Dead silent. Her dad literally chokes on his coffee and starts coughing violently. Her mom drops her fork with a loud clatter. Her grandmother's mouth falls open. I'm sitting right there like a complete idiot, watching my wife of eight years fantasize about my best friend in front of our entire family. Josh's face goes bright red. He starts stammering something about how that's not appropriate. But Emma just keeps going like she's in some kind of trance. We have so much more in common than Mark and I do. Josh actually listens when I talk about my art projects. He gets my sense of humor. He remembers little things I say. Sometimes I wonder if I settled too quick. That last part hit like a freight train. Settled? After eight years of marriage, two miscarriages, buying our first house together, and me working overtime to pay for her art supplies. I settled. I excused myself to the bathroom. But really, I just sat in my car for 20 minutes trying to process what had just happened. My hands were shaking. I called my brother Mike, but couldn't even form words to explain. When I came back inside, everyone was pretending nothing happened, making awkward small talk about the weather in Emma's mom's new garden. But the damage was done. You could cut the tension with a knife. We drove home in complete silence. 45 minutes of pure hell. The next morning, I packed a bag and went to my Brother's place. Without saying a word to Emma. I just couldn't look at her. Here's where it gets really messed up, though. Josh calls me that afternoon, absolutely panicking. His voice is shaking on the phone. Turns out Emma had been texting him for months. And I mean hundreds of messages. She'd been telling him how unhappy she was in our marriage, how she'd made a mistake choosing me, how they were meant to be together. The whole time, I thought we were working through our fertility issues. She was planning her escape. Josh shows me some of the text. When we meet up, I think about you. When I'm with Mark. Do you ever imagine what our life could have been like? I married the wrong person. And I'm finally ready to admit it. The worst part. Josh had been telling her to work on our marriage this whole time. He'd been trying to talk her out of these feelings, suggesting couples therapy, telling her she was just going through a rough patch that all marriages face. Emma's been showing up at my work every day this week, crying in the parking lot about how it was just a stupid comment fueled by wine. She keeps saying she didn't mean it.

I'm 32 and my girlfriend's parents still think I'm pouring cheap beer at some dive bar. Last week her mother cornered me in their kitchen while my girlfriend was upstairs. She pressed $300 in my hand and whispered for gas money. I know those tips can't be much. My girlfriend comes from old money and I started working at 14. Her parents never miss a chance to remind me where I belong. We've been together two years, but every family dinner felt like a job interview. I was failing. Last night was her father's retirement party. Three hundred guests at the country club. At the entrance, her mother looked at my watch and frowned. The coat check had a lost and found if you need something more appropriate. It was a ten thousand dollar Rolex. She assumed it was fake. During cocktail hour, her mother dragged me around. This is Doctor Morrison, Judge Williams, then me. This is my daughter's boyfriend. He works in the service industry. Her Aunt Patricia asked what exactly I did. Before I could speak, her mother said, he pours drinks beer, mostly downtown somewhere. Patricia touched my arm sympathetically and asked about my career goals. Her father intercepted me by the bar. You parked in the member lot. Staff and vendors use the back entrance. The guard mentioned your car doesn't have a member sticker. I drove a hundred thousand dollar Mercedes. He assumed I'd stolen the spot. Then he pulled up his phone. There's a management training program at this restaurant chain. Six week course. I know the regional director. He showed me the application. Thirty five thousand to start, but it's steady. At dinner, they put us at table 23, near the service station. Her parents sat at the head table under a chandelier. Her father gave his retirement speech. He thanked his colleagues, praised his children's accomplishments. When he mentioned my girlfriend, he said, still waiting for her to find someone worthy of the family name. He stared at me while the room chuckled. After dessert, her parents ambushed us by the restrooms. Her mother had printed emails from her friend's husband. He owns several franchises. Fast food. But management track. 40,000 to start. My phone exploded with notifications. 50 messages, then 100. Major supplier threatening to pull out of tomorrow's contract signing. Monday morning, her father announced. Eight sharp. He's expecting you. Don't be late or hungover. The texts kept coming. My business partner, our attorney. The Japanese distillery representatives were furious about something. Five million dollar exclusive import deal about to collapse. Silence that. Her mother snapped. This is about our daughter's future. My girlfriend snatched the papers and ripped them up. He doesn't need your help. Listen to her. Her mother said to me. So desperate to defend you, she's become delusional. This is what you've reduced her to. Her father leaned in, his breath thick with scotch. Real men don't let their women pay for dinner. How often does she cover your rent? Her mother already had her phone out. I've been talking to my attorney. There are ways to protect her trust fund from certain types of people. Someone with ambition, her father added. Someone with education. Someone who doesn't smell like beer. And desperation. I excused myself to handle the crisis. When I returned, her mother was showing my girlfriend photos. Remember Christopher? Harvard Law, just made partner. He still asks about you. That's when Mister Fitzgerald stood up from his table near the stage. Everyone knew him. He'd been supplying restaurants in the city for 40 years. Excuse me, he called out, walking straight toward me. Are you Daniel? Her parents exchanged amused looks. Her father actually laughed. This is just the boyfriend. He tends bar somewhere downtown. He's Daniel Reeves, my girlfriend said, standing up. He owns Vintage Proof and the Sterling Room. Fitzgerald's face lit up. You're

And I already know this is about my daily visits. You visiting mom every single day makes me look like a bad daughter, she says while scrolling through her phone. You're babying her. She's only 72, and you're acting like she's some martyr. It's creating an unhealthy codependency. I read about it in my therapy group. Then she drops it. New rule. You visit once a month, just like me, or I'm changing Mom's locks. I already talked to a locksmith. And don't even think about making copies. I'm getting those special locks that can't be duplicated. I look at mom for backup, but she just shrugs and says whatever we think is best, though she does quietly add that she enjoys the daily visits. Classic mom, avoiding conflict. I noticed she puts her keys in the refrigerator, but I don't say anything because what's the point? Fine. I tell my sister, once a month. But when this goes wrong, remember, this was your idea. Week one without my daily visits and the neighbor calls me at work. Your mom was outside at 3:00am looking for her cat. Thing is, mom doesn't have a cat. Never has. Want to rush over, but my sister already threatened to change the lock, so I call her instead. The neighbor's being dramatic, she says, haven't had time to check myself, but Mom's fine. Week 2, mom calls me, crying that someone stole all her food. My sister checks, text me a photo of a full fridge like I'm the crazy one. Doesn't notice it's all expired. The milk dated three weeks ago. Week 3 gets worse. The bank calls because mom tried to withdraw 30,000 in cash for the nice man fixing my roof. There is no man. There's no roof damage. My sister still insists I'm overreacting. Stop hovering. She can manage her own money. After the bank incident, I can't help myself. I drive by Mom's house anyway. Her newspapers are piling up. I leave groceries on the porch and run before my sister can find out. I keep my distance like she demanded. Then mom shows up at my house one morning. She walked here. That's eight miles. In her slippers. Where's your father? She asked me. Is he picking me up? Dad's been dead five years. My sister says she's just having a bad day. The grocery store calls next. Mom's been there for hours, putting items in other people's carts, telling everyone she's waiting for her husband. The manager says she's been returning the same items to different aisles over and over. My sister arrives first, and I hear her frustration over the phone. Mom, stop being difficult. Mom's response breaks me. I'm sorry, miss, but I don't know you. When I. I finally get there, mom immediately relaxes when she sees me and grabs my hand. Oh, Good, you're here. That angry lady keeps following me. A week later, three towns over, police find mom at a McDonald's. She. She's been there since morning, telling everyone she's waiting for her kids after school. She thinks it's 1987. She keeps asking the female officer if she should wear her red dress to see Tom sell it tonight because he likes when I show a little leg. When my sister shows up, mom backs away from her. I don't go with strangers, but he sees me and lights up. Oh, thank god. This woman keeps claiming she knows me. My sister's crying now. Mom, please. I'm your daughter. Mom turns to me, whispers, that woman seems angry. Is she bothering you? The doctor's appointment mom missed three times finally happens because I drive her there. He pulls us both aside after the brain scan. How long has your mother been showing signs of dementia? My sister actually laughs. She doesn't have dementia. The doctor turns his computer screen toward us. She's stage 4. These symptoms have been building for at least a year. And she's lost 15 pounds. My stomach drops. We didn't notice under her cardigan. My sister still arguing when he asks who's been managing her care. No one. I mean, my sister used to visit daily, but I made her stop. I told her it was unhealthy.

So this actually happened at our house last month, and I still don't know whether to laugh or feel guilty. We were having a simple dinner. Spaghetti salad, nothing fancy. I had my usual glass of red wine sitting next to my water. My daughter, she's 7, tiny and adorable, but sneaky as hell, kept staring at my glass. I thought she was just curious, like always. Well, I turned my head for literally three seconds to grab more sauce, and when I look back, the glass was halfway to empty. She had taken two Big Gulps before I even realized what was happening. Her face scrunched up immediately, like she tasted vinegar. She coughed, smacked her lips, then started laughing. She said, Mommy, your grape juice is. Is dizzy. It's socks juice. She couldn't even find the words. She just kept pointing at her head and saying, brain, go. At first I panicked, like, oh, my god, my child just drank wine. But then she stood up and started wobbling around the table. Not like a cartoon drunk, just clumsy, tripping over her own feet. She put her hands on her hips, pointed at her dad, and slurred, daddy, you. You got pizza face. My husband froze, then started laughing so hard he almost spit his water out. Then she sat back down, rested her chin on her hands, and looked at me super serious. She said, Mommy, I love you, but your juice tastes like. Like toilet grapes. I swear I didn't know whether to laugh or hide under the table. My son was dying, tears rolling down his cheeks. The funniest part was how she tried to keep talking, but her words kept getting mixed up. She said, I'm not drunk, I'm. I'm funned. Fun funned up. Then she clapped for herself like she invented a new word. A minute later she whispered, Shh! The dog is my best friend. Don't tell daddy, and then she burst into random giggles. We gave her water right away and made her sit on the couch. She held the cup with both hands and said, this is boring juice. Bring the funny juice. I told her absolutely not, but she kept repeating it like a chant. Funny juice, funny juice. She eventually leaned back and started humming to herself all off key, like she was singing a secret song only she could hear. About 10 minutes later she just blurted out, sometimes I don't brush my teeth, I just lick the toothpaste. My son screamed, I knew it! I could didn't even stop laughing. It was like the wine unlocked her honesty button. She confessed to hiding candy wrappers under her pillow and stealing her brother's Legos. Every time she said something, she'd giggle and go, oopsies, don't ground me! After a little while, the drowsiness kicked in. She curled up on the couch holding her stuffed bunny and Mumbled Mommy, no more sock juice. Promise. Then she added, almost whispering no more toilet grapes. They made my tongue go zig zag.

My son Tyler is 8 years old. And until last month, he talked to both of us just fine. But then something changed and he started only talking to my wife, Emma, when he needed something. If I asked him a question, he'd walk over to Emma and whisper the answer to her, then she'd tell me. It was driving me crazy. At first, I thought maybe I did something wrong. Did I yell at him? Was I too strict about his bedtime? I kept asking Emma what was going on, but she just said Tyler was going through a phase and it would pass. But after two weeks of this, I was getting really frustrated. The breaking point came when Tyler scraped his knee falling off his bike in our driveway. I ran over to help him up, but he pushed me away and ran straight to Emma, who was watering plants by the front door. He was crying and pointing at his knee but wouldn't let me near him. Emma cleaned him up and put a Band Aid on while I just stood there feeling like garbage. That night, after Tyler went to bed, I confronted Emma. I told her this wasn't normal and something was seriously wrong. She kept saying it was just a phase, but I could tell she was hiding something. Her voice got all shaky and she wouldn't look Me in the eye. Finally, I said if she didn't tell me what was going on, I was going to take Tyler to see a therapist because this behavior wasn't normal for an 8 year old. That's when Emma broke down crying. She told me that three weeks ago when I was at work late, Tyler had walked into our bedroom while she was changing clothes. Instead of just telling him to knock next time, she freaked out and yelled at him saying he shouldn't see mommy without clothes.

Congratulations. That's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem. Scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs, tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time, definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like, oh my God, I'm so OCD. I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized, my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression unless you're diagnosed. I don't want to hear it. You're free to self pity in private. But self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

My class teacher responded, yes, he's here. My boy Oscar nudged me. Dude, what the hell did you do? That's when we heard it. BRR! Helicopters were filling the school yard. Attention, all students. Return to your classrooms immediately. This is a lockdown. Everyone ran at once. Miss Kelly's hand was digging into my arm. Jose, has anyone unusual tried to contact you recently? What? No. She pulled me away from the windows just as the helicopter noise became deafening. The lights went out. My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. Everything's going to be okay. I promise. Someone behind us muttered, maybe it's I C E. The principal spoke again to all staff and students. Code yellow. I repeat, code yellow. Counseling staff to designated areas. A spotlight swept across the windows. Everyone dropped to the floor. Miss Kelly pushed me under a table, her radio crackling with voices I couldn't understand. Mister Doran appeared out of nowhere, shirt soaked with sweat. Jose, get to the conference room now! I followed him out, trying to look normal while my heart was beating out of my chest. The hallways were full of cops. One cop looked directly at me, and his hand moved to his gun. Mister Doran stepped between us. He's with me. One cop spoke into his radio as we passed. I caught two words. Package secured. My mind went Straight to the bag of Mary Jane that I kept in my locker. But I played it cool. More cops ran past toward the gym. Someone shouted about medical equipment, head trauma, but we kept moving. Mister Doran's hand was firm on my back, pushing me forward. Jose, just so we're clear, you haven't been involved in anything illegal, right? Sometimes kids from your background get mixed up in things. Before I could respond, he opened the conference room door and shoved me inside. The room was dark except for the emergency lights. Miss Kelly followed us in. Click. The door locked. Just the three of us. She sat down across from me. There were tears streaming down her face. I had to fight back nervous laughter. Jose. Her voice cracked. Honey. That word made my blood freeze. Teachers don't say honey unless something terrible has happened. There's been an accident. The helicopters were still circling outside this morning at the warehouse where your dad works. A shelving unit collapsed. Your father was. She stopped, took a shaky breath. He didn't make it. Jose, I'm so sorry. I started laughing. This is a crazy prank, even for you, Mister Doran. I saw the helicopters, the police officers, they locked eyes with each other. And I saw Miss Kelly nod like she was silently agreeing to give the full explanation. Turns out the principal was calling for me right when a student had fallen through the gym skylight during maintenance. Coincidence? That made everyone think the helicopters and manhunt were connected to me. It felt like someone had drained all the color out of my heart. I curled up into a ball and started rocking back and forth uncontrollably. I was an orphan. Someone else entered the room, a woman with a clipboard and a blazer that screamed social worker. She started talking about emergency placement, foster care. I grabbed my vape from my pocket, not even caring that Mister Doran was standing right there. Miss Kelly rubbed my back while I heaved. Well, the social worker said, looking at her clipboard, this is what happens when these immigrants don't follow simple safety rules. She shook her head. Your people need to learn that. Excuse me? I looked up, tears still streaming. Mister Doran cleared his throat. What she means is these accidents are unfortunately common in certain communities. Even Miss Kelly nodded. I didn't want to be the one to say it, but, Jose, your people just don't follow safety rules. It's always the same with them. I've seen it 100 times. The social worker continued filling out forms. At least with foster care you'll be in a more stable environment.

And I already know this is about my daily visits. You visiting mom every single day makes me look like a bad daughter, she says while scrolling through her phone. You're babying her. She's only 72, and you're acting like she's some martyr. It's creating an unhealthy codependency. I read about it in my therapy group. Then she drops it. New rule. You visit once a month, just like me, or I'm changing Mom's locks. I already talked to a locksmith. And don't even think about making copies. I'm getting those special locks that can't be duplicated. I look at mom for backup, but she just shrugs and says whatever we think is best. Though she does quietly add that she enjoys the daily visits. Class like mom avoiding conflict. I noticed she puts her keys in the refrigerator, but I don't say anything because what's the point? Fine. I tell my sister, once a month. But when this goes wrong, remember, this was your idea. Week one without my daily visits and the neighbor calls me at work. Your mom was outside at 3:00am looking for her cat. Thing is, mom doesn't have a cat. Never has. I want to rush over, but my sister already threatened to change the lock, so I call her instead. The neighbor's being dramatic, she says, haven't had time to check myself, but Mom's fine. Week 2, mom calls me, crying that someone stole all her food. My sister checks, text me a photo of a full fridge like I'm the crazy one. Doesn't notice it's all expired. The milk dated three weeks ago. Week 3 gets worse. The bank calls because mom tried to withdraw 30,000 in cash for the nice man fixing my roof. There is no man. There's no roof damage. My sister still insists I'm overreacting. Stop hovering. She can manage her own money. After the bank incident, I can't help myself. I drive by Mom's house anyway. Her newspapers are piling up. I leave groceries on the porch and run before my sister can find out. I keep my distance like she demanded. Then mom shows up at my house one morning. She walked here? That's eight miles. In her slippers. Where's your father? She asked me. Is he picking me up? Dad's been dead five years. My sister says she's just having a bad day. The grocery store calls next. Mom's been there for hours, putting items in other people's carts, telling everyone she's waiting for her husband. The manager says she's been returning the same item to different aisles over and over. My sister arrives first, and I hear her frustration over the phone. Mom, stop being difficult. Mom's response breaks me. I'm sorry, miss, but I don't know you. When I finally get there, mom immediately relaxes when she sees me and grabs my hand. Oh, good, you're here. That angry lady keeps following me. A week later, three towns over, police find mom at a McDonald's. She. She's been there since morning, telling everyone she's waiting for her kids after school. She thinks it's 1987. She keeps asking the female officer if she should wear her red dress to see Tom sell it tonight because he likes when I show a little leg. When my sister shows up, mom backs away from her. I don't go with strangers, but she sees me and lights up. Oh, thank god. This woman keeps claiming she knows me. My sister's crying now. Mom, please. I'm your daughter. Mom turns to me, whisper, that woman seems angry. Is she bothering you? The doctor's appointment mom missed three times finally happens because I drive her there. He pulls us both aside after the brain scan. How long has your mother been showing signs of dementia? My sister actually laughs. She doesn't have dementia. The doctor turns his computer screen toward us. She's stage 4. These symptoms have been building for at least a year. And she's lost 15 pounds. My stomach drops. We didn't notice under her cardigan. My sister still arguing when he asks who's been managing her care. No one.

Again? I stared in shock. Again? I don't want to compete. Oh, sweetie, mom said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The monthly room assignment builds character. Winners get the master suite. Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca, wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes, no heat, and spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. I didn't want to win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. The next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for Four a m. Just to beat us to the kitchen. By week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together. Stop helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look at that competitive spirit! Dad beamed. One morning, after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement, constantly checking for spiders. Bianca developed anxiety attacks. Harvin started pulling out his hair, leaving bald patches. He tried to hide under hats. The monthly meeting came like an execution. We sat in the living room while our parents tally points on their laptops. Bianca, 78 points. Marvin, 81 points. Mom paused dramatically. And Marcus with 92 points. I'd won by doing extra shifts at the food bank, sacrificing sleep I couldn't get anyway. Bianca burst into tears. Marvin threw his notebook at the wall and stormed out. Pack your things, dad said cheerfully. You get the master suite. I stood up slowly. No. The room went silent. Mom smile froze. Excuse me. I'm not moving upstairs. I'm staying in the basement. Dad's face turned red. You earned that room. You're moving up there. Tonight you turned us against each other, I said, my voice shaking. Bianca cries herself to sleep. Marvin won't even look at us anymore. We used to be best friends. You're being dramatic, mom said, but her voice wavered. That night, I dragged my mattress to the basement's main area. Bianca found me there an hour later with her sleeping bag. Marvin appeared in the doorway with his pillows. Without speaking, we built a fort with our mattresses, the way we used to when we were little. I sabotaged your science project, Bianca confessed in the darkness. I know, I said. I deleted your essay. I put laxatives in both your lunches, Marvin whispered. We started laughing. Horrible. Broke

My older sister London was always the pretty one because she hit puberty first and got the good genes. When I turned 14, I begged my parents for money for skincare products since my face was breaking out everywhere. Paris, you're too young for expensive products, London said, examining her perfect complexion in the mirror. Maybe when you learn to wash your face properly. My skin was basically a minefield of cystic acne, blackheads, and scars from picking. London skin glowed like she had a filter on in real life. She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointments. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom. Half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serums she'd abandon for the next trending thing, but somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful. High School ended. London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties. I went to community college, worked at a pharmacy where I Learned about ingredients. Saved every penny for a dermatologist. London would Snapchat me from clubs while I was studying chemistry. Why are you wasting your Friday night? She'd text. Oh, wait, not like anyone's asking you out anyway. I'm investing in my future. I'd respond, you're just jealous you can't get into the VIP section. After two years, I transferred to state school for nursing. Started understanding how skin actually worked. Learned about retinoids, chemical exfoliants, moisture barriers. Started seeing changes. London kept baking and tanning beds twice a week, sleeping in her makeup after nights out, living on vodka sodas and whatever guy was buying her dinner. She was still gorgeous at 22, but the foundation was getting thicker, the filters working harder. By 25, I had clear skin for the first time in my life. Proper routine, consistent habits, monthly facials. I saved for London. Had her first Botox consultation. Convinced the nurse practitioner missed something when she said it was sun damage, not expression lines. Last month was our cousin's wedding. I walked in feeling confident for once. Hair healthy from years of no heat styling. Skin glowing from retinol and sunscreen. Body Strong from consistent exercise. London cornered me at the cocktail hour. Paris. Oh, my god. What happened to you? Her voice had that desperate edge she used when she needed something. Thanks, London. Just taking care of myself. No, seriously, what are you using? What's your dermatologist's name? Did you get something done? She grabbed my face, turning it side to side in the light. I need to know everything. The

My college roommate Derek saved my life sophomore year. I've been drunk at a party and decided to climb onto the frat house roof to impress a girl. When I slipped, Derek caught my arm just as I was going over the edge. Three story drop onto concrete. I would have died. You owe me big time, he'd said, pulling me back up. One day I'm gonna need something huge, and you better deliver. I figured he'd ask me to write his thesis or loan him money after graduation. Normal stuff. Instead, seven years later, I get a call at 2 a m. Remember that favor? Derek's voice was strained. Yeah, of course. What do you need? Long pause. I need you to be my boyfriend at my family reunion this weekend. I laughed, thinking it was a prank. Good one, man. I'm serious. I've been telling my family I have a boyfriend for two years. His name is Jake. You're Jake now? Turns out Derek had come out to his ultra conservative family, but softened the blow by saying he was in a committed relationship with a successful doctor. Doctor part was true. I'm an ER physician. The boyfriend part, not so much. I'm straight, married with a kid on the way. Derek, I can't pretend to be your boyfriend. I don't even know how to. You saved my life. Now I'm asking you to save my relationship with My family. My grandmother is 94. This might be her last reunion. She keeps asking when she'll meet Jake. The desperation in his voice got me. What about my wife? What do I tell Sarah? Tell her the truth. Tell her everything. Sarah thought it was hilarious. You literally owe him your life, babe. Toby, Jake for a weekend. That's how I found myself at a massive family reunion in Ohio, holding Derek's hand while his aunt Martha grilled me about our love story. Derek had created an entire fictional history. How we met at a medical conference, first date at an Italian restaurant, even what I supposedly said when I first told him I loved him. The worst part was his cousin Brandon, who kept trying to set me up with his friend. If things don't work out with Derek, he'd whisper, call me. Everything peaked at the talent show. Apparently, Jake had promised to perform a couple's dance routine with Derek. I can't dance at all. We stumbled through three minutes of what was supposed to be a tango while 60 relatives filmed it. But the real awkwardness came when grandma pulled me aside. I know, she said quietly. My blood went cold. Know what? You're not really dating my grandson. She patted my hand. Derek's actual boyfriend posted on Instagram yesterday from Cabo. But you're a good friend for doing this. Are you going to tell anyone? She's smiled. I'm 94, sweetheart. I just want my grandson. To be happy. If he needs this little show to feel comfortable, that's fine. But next reunion, tell him to bring the real one. Derek finally brought his actual boyfriend to Christmas dinner that year. Turns out his name really is Jake, which LED to a very confusing introduction when they explained I was the other Jake from the reunion. We're still friends. Sarah still calls me Jake sometimes just to mess with me. And yes, that Tango video went viral in the family group chat. I'm never living it down.

I've been at this company for three years. When Donald completely humiliated me during a big meeting in front of everyone I worked with. Maybe we could save time by changing how we handle these reports. I suggested holding up this diagram I'd spent my whole weekend making. Let's not work above our pay grade, shall we, Tom? He said with this condescending laugh that made everyone uncomfortable. Your entry level, not management. You need to learn your place. Do what you're paid to do, nothing more. He moved to the next slide like he hadn't just insulted everything I'd done. Stay in your lane, Thomas. I set down the marker quietly. Okay, then. Staying in my lane it is. He practically glowed with satisfaction. See how easy that is? Everyone just doing their assigned tasks, no overstepping. The very next morning, April from accounting showed up at my desk with her usual panic. Thomas, can you fix this spreadsheet real quick? You always know how to handle these things. I kept typing without looking up. Sorry, that's above my pay grade. Tech support handles that stuff. But you've literally always helped me with this. Donald made it clear yesterday that I need to stay in my lane. Call I T. Her face went through three different expressions before settling on disbelief. That afternoon, Donald himself appeared with his laptop, looking stressed Need you to polish these slides for tomorrow's big presentation. I didn't even glance at the screen. That's design work, Donald. Above my pay grade. His left eye started Twitch. You've been doing my slide since you started here. Which was wrong of me. You were right yesterday. I was overstepping. This presentation is critical. Then you should probably do it yourself. Or hire someone. He stood there for a full minute before storming off. The real fun started when the new guy arrived. Sandra from HR brought him to my desk. Thomas always trains our new people. He's the best at explaining everything. I looked up briefly. Training is a supervisor job. Not in my job description. Sandra looked like I'd spoken in a foreign language. But you've trained the last five people we hired. Which was me working above my pay grade. Donald corrected that behavior on Monday. The kid, it stood there clutching his folder, looking lost. So who's supposed to train me? Someone at the appropriate pay level. Donald materialized within 15 minutes, looking furious. What's this about refusing to train, Kevin? Training isn't in my job description. We don't have anyone else who knows everything. That sounds like a management problem. His face turned red. Thomas, be reasonable. I'm being exactly what you told me to be. Thursday at 4:47 p m. Donald rushed over in full panic mode. Emergency important. Client needs updated numbers for their 5:30 call. I was already packing my bag. My hours are 9 to 5. This can't wait until tomorrow? Overtime requires authorization and higher pay rate. Thomas, don't do this. I'm doing exactly what you instructed. Staying in my lane. I logged off while he stood there speechless. The contract is worth 2 million. Sounds like something management should handle. Friday's department meeting turned into a complete

Now you really look like your loser father. While my nieces were laughing. The next day her account was frozen and the bank for closed on her house. For three years, I've been financially supporting my younger sister Jessica to her divorce. I paid her mortgage, utilities, groceries, everything so she and her daughters wouldn't struggle. Jessica worked at a hair salon, but barely made enough. Over time, I noticed her attitude. She never said thank you, only criticized our life. If we bought a car, she'd say we were showing off. If we took Isabella on vacation, she'd complain that some of us aren't so lucky. Isabella, my daughter, has always been sweet with long, shiny brown hair. Sometimes she'd come home saying Aunt Jessica scolded me or Aunt Jessica said my dress was ugly. Those comments bothered me. Everything changed one Saturday. Isabella was invited to a friend's birthday party and wanted to look like a princess. I decided to take her to Jessica for a special haircut. I called and said, make Isabella look like a princess. I'll leave extra money. Jessica responded dryly, alright, leave her with me, but don't come too late. I dropped Isabella off at Jessica's house. Isabella was happy in her pink dress and sparkling shoes. I kissed her forehead and said I'd be back in a few hours. When I returned at five PM, I heard heartbreaking crying as I approached. I heard Jessica shouting, now you look like your father's failure. Bald and horrible, just like him! Then came laughter, Jessica's laugh and her daughter's giggles. I slammed the door open. Isabella was sitting in a chair with her head lowered. At her feet was a pile of hair, scattered like trash. When she lifted her face, my world collapsed. She was completely bald. Called Jessica had shaved her head, leaving not a single strand. My little princess had red eyes from crying, her face filled with shame. Jessica stood beside her with a razor, laughing. Her daughters were pointing at Isabella, mocking her look. She looks like an egg, Sophia said, laughing. How ugly! Added Lucia. I hugged Isabella tightly. She clung to me, shaking and threw her sobs. Said daddy, why did she do this to me? I just wanted to look pretty. What did you do to my daughter? I roared at Jessica. She stopped laughing, but didn't seem sorry. Calm down, Antonio, it was just a joke. I told her I was giving her a modern cut. She looks unique, she said with a mocking smile. A joke? You shaved my daughter's head! You humiliated her! She shrugged. Don't be dramatic, it's just hair. Plus that girl is always showing off with her long hair. Like my daughters aren't as beautiful. She's a 7 year old girl who wanted to feel pretty. You did this out of envy! Jessica exploded. Don't come at me! With envy crap. You're always showing off your perfect life while I'm struggling alone.

So on day 21, I made it permanent. 20 days of silence. That's what my wife decided I deserved after I suggested she help with household responsibilities instead of treating me like her personal butler. But here's the thing about playing the silent treatment card. Sometimes the other person decides they prefer the quiet. I finished a 12 hour shift and walked into what looked like a tornado hit our kitchen. Did. She's piled high. Take out containers scattered everywhere. And her on the couch scrolling through her phone. I made the apparently unforgivable mistake of saying, hey, think you could give me a hand cleaning up before dinner? The look she gave me could frozen hell over. Excuse me? I work, too. I'm not your maid. I never said you were. I thought we could tackle this together since we both live here. That's when she stood up, grabbed her purse, and delivered the line that would define the next three weeks. Figure it out yourself. And don't expect me to talk to you until you learn some respect. Front door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. When she came back two hours later, I thought we'd have a normal conversation. I was wrong. She walked past me like I was invisible and went straight to the bedroom. Day two rolled around and still nothing. I tried the reasonable approach. If I came across wrong yesterday, we should talk. She poured her coffee, walked past me, and left for work without acknowledging I existed. By day 5, I realized what this was. This wasn't about dishes or respect. This was control. She decided freezing me out would make me grovel and apologize for something I shouldn't apologize for. Day 7 was when something clicked. I was eating a sandwich, watching her perform her silent tantrum routine, and I started laughing. Here was a grown woman who thought giving me the cold shoulder was going to break me down. Instead, it was showing me exactly who I'd married. By day 10, the house had gotten remarkably peaceful. No arguing about whose turn it was to take out trash. No passive aggressive comments about the dishwasher. No dramatic sighs when I wanted to watch sports. I was starting to see the upside. Day 15 brought reinforcements. Her sister called asking if everything was okay because my wife seemed stressed. Told her everything was fine. I was giving my wife the space she'd requested. When her sister tried to dig deeper, I said, she knows how to end this anytime she wants an adult conversation. But here's what she didn't realize during her tantrum. I was using this time to think about what my life had become and what I wanted it to be. Day 20 arrived with her pacing around like a caged animal, looking at me with this.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charge charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability. Buddy, don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl? Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the Busy terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family

I didn't argue. I just closed our joint accounts and changed the locks instead. Last Tuesday, I received divorce papers from my wife, Natalia, after four years of marriage. But she didn't deliver them herself. Her new boyfriend, Gabriel, showed up at my doorstep with the envelope. Natalia wants you out by Friday, he told me with arrogant, confident. Find somewhere else to stay. I looked at this guy, who'd clearly been sleeping with my wife, and simply replied, okay. He probably expected me to break down or punch him. Instead, I closed the door and started making calls. First to my lawyer, then to the bank. What? Gabriel and Natalia didn't know the house was solely in my name. I bought it before we married with inheritance money and never added her to the title. Gabriel had been living there for a month while I was away for work. Natalia claimed he was an acquaintance going through tough time. Complete lie. When he demanded I find somewhere else to stay. He was trying to kick me out of my own house. By Wednesday morning, I changed all the locks. That afternoon, I canceled Gabriel's access to everything. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime. He'd even added himself to my 90 Dollar Family Gym membership. Canceled that too. Thursday night, Gabriel appeared, banging on the door. What the hell is going on? Why did you change the locks? Cause this is my house. I Replied from inside, Natalia can get her things, but you have to leave. She's my partner. Now we're together. Perfect. Go be together somewhere else. His tantrum was epic, screaming that I was vengeful that he had rights. Meanwhile, I recorded everything. I texted Natalia, you have 48 hours to collect your belonging. Gabriel is not welcome here. Her response you can't do this. Gabriel lives here now. Check the property title. He's nowhere on it. The next morning, Gabriel's lawyer showed up, claiming Gabriel had tendency rights because as he'd lived there over 30 days. I showed him the recording of Gabriel screaming that he was there as my wife's partner, not a tenant. There's no lease, no rent payments, no contributions, I explained, showing the property title with me as sole owner. The lawyer went pale and left quickly.

Twitch chatter. Sarah came home from her 12 hour hospital shift to find me in the same spot at my computer. Twitch stream on one monitor, spreadsheets minimized on the other. She dropped her bag with that familiar exhausted sound. Mike, eight months. You've been unemployed for eight months watching gamers play Fortnite? My mom keeps asking if you're depressed. I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages and actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. Truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after 6 months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, able management systems. Stuff I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store. Again, Sarah deflected questions about our future, saying we were figuring things out. Maybe he could drive For Uber, her mother suggested. Loud enough for me to hear. Everything unraveled because the doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbor's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? Their returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them. What the hell is this? I couldn't hide it anymore. Opened my laptop and showed her the Shopify dashboard. 300 orders this month. Inventory spreadsheet showing zero stock because everything shipped directly from suppliers to customers. You're selling things? Gaming accessories. Mouse pads, mostly. She stared at the revenue numbers. Last month was my best yet. Enough to cover our mortgage twice. But you don't have any products here. They ship from the supplier. I handle marketing and customer service. I showed her the Facebook ads running in the background, the email campaigns, the abandoned cart sequences. This. This is real money. I opened the business checking account. Six months of deposits from Shopify. Not fortune, but solid middle class income from selling LED mouse pads to gamers. Why didn't you tell me? Remember when I tried explaining dropshipping? You said it was a pyramid scheme for people who watch too many YouTube gurus because you explained it while watching someone play Minecraft at 2:00am, her sister was reading over her shoulder. Wait, he's been running a business this whole time? Sarah scrolled through customer emails, reviews, the business registration, tax documents, everything legit, just invisible. I've been telling everyone you're unemployed. I cried to my therapist about supporting you. I know my dad offered you minimum wage out of pity. I make more than his offer in three days selling mouse pads. Her phone started buzzing, family group chat exploding as her sister shared the news. Her dad asking how online selling actually worked. Her mom confused about what dropshipping meant. Why all the secrecy, though? It wasn't supposed to be secret. But every time I tried explaining, you'd see me on the computer and assume I was wasting time. Eventually, I stopped trying.

Penny cornered me at lunch Monday, Monica and Christina flanking her like bodyguards. Jenna, this is an intervention, she announced. Monica snorted. You text me literally every five minutes. You waited outside my math class yesterday, even though yours is across campus. You got weird when I went to Monica's sleepover without you. She crossed her arms. It's honestly embarrassing. Monica's best friend has her own life, her own friends. They're independent. You're, like, obsessed with me or something. Christina laughed. No offense, but it's giving desperate. Penny shrugged. You need to get your own life and stop making me her entire personality. I felt my face burn, but looking at Penny's expression, I realized she was serious. Had I really been that bad? After my parents divorced, penny was my rock. Maybe I'd held on too tight. Maybe I depended on her too much emotionally. I'm sorry, I said quietly. I didn't realize I was making you uncomfortable. Starting Tuesday, I gave her exactly what she asked for. No morning texts. Said they were too much. I saw her in the hallway and just smiled instead of running over. She wanted space. At lunch, I accepted the Art Girls invitation to sit with them. They've been asking for weeks, and I'd always said no to stay with penny. They were genuinely excited to have me. Finally, Lorelai said, We've been wanting to be friends forever. But you were always with penny. They were so welcoming, teaching me their inside jokes, including me in their group chat. Thursday morning hurt the most. We bought tickets together weeks ago for the school's talent show. Front row seats to support our friends band. I sat there alone, saving her seat with my backpack until the lights dimmed. She never came. During intermission, I saw her Instagram story. She was at Starbucks with Monica and Christina, laughing over Frappuccinos. The caption read, so much better than boring school events. My eyes burned with tears. I wouldn't let fall. She'd known and didn't show up. And worse, she seemed happier without me. I deleted the text I'd started typing, asking where she was. She wanted space, and clearly she was thriving with it. After the show, I joined the drama club, something penny had always made fun of. When Romeo from drama asked if I wanted to practice lines after school, I said yes. Immediately. I posted a selfie with him captioned new drama partner with heart emojis. Penny viewed it in 10 seconds, but didn't like it. Lorelai invited me to a party Friday. Penny will be there, too, she mentioned. At the party, I stayed with my new friends, but kept checking on penny discreetly. She was with Monica and Christina by the pool. When Monica loudly said, at least you finally got rid of your stalker. I pretend ended not To hear penny laughed along with them, that stung. But if that's how she felt, I'd respect it. Everything crashed down Tuesday. I was heading to art club when I heard someone crying in the bathroom. Harsh, painful sobs. My heart knew it was penny before my brain did. Soph, are you okay? I asked softly through the door. Leave me alone, Jenna. I don't want to guilt you into caring about my problems. What? Penny, please let me in. The door unlocked. I look destroyed. Mascara streaking, eyes swollen. My parents are getting divorced, she whispered. Dad's been cheating for months. I found out Sunday night. My heart broke. I pulled her into my arms, feeling her whole body shake. She told me through gasps how she'd wanted to call me Sunday night when her dad moved out, but Monica had convinced her not to be a hypocrite. How she'd seen my Instagram.

Last summer, my parents decided we needed a technology free family bonding road trip to Yellowstone. They announced this planet dinner looking way too proud of themselves. No phones, no tablets, no Nintendo Switch, dad declared. We're going to reconnect as a family and appreciate nature. My 16 year old sister Denki and I just stared at them in horror. A week long road trip with no electronics? They might as well have suggested we travel by covered wagon. But what if there's an emergency? Denki asked, already plotting. We'll have our phones for emergencies only, mom said. But they'll be locked in the glove compartment. The night before we left, Denki and I held an emergency sibling meeting. We were not going down without a fight. Operation Digital Rebellion is a go! She whispered, pulling out a duffel bag full of contraband electronics. We spent hours hiding devices throughout our luggage. Denki sown a secret pocket into her pillow for her phone. I hollered out a thick book and stuffed my Nintendo Switch inside. We even hit a portable charger inside a bag of trail mix. Day one started with Dad's enthusiastic announcement. Isn't this great, kids? Look at all this beautiful scenery. Let's play the license plate game. Wow, dad, A Nebraska plate! Riveting. Denki deadpanned while secretly texting her boyfriend through her pillow. By hour three, mom was getting suspicious because we were being unusually cooperative. About her car games. Little did she know, I was playing Pokemon under a blanket while pretending to nap. You kids seem awfully quiet back there, she said, turning around. Just enjoying the family bonding, mom, I said, quickly shoving my switch under my fake book. Denki had gotten creative with her rebellion. She downloaded audiobooks and was listening through earbuds she threaded through her hoodie strings. Every time mom asked her a question, she pretend to be deep in thought about nature. By day two, we'd established an elaborate system. Denki would be the lookout while I game, then we'd switch. We communicated through coughs and sneezes. That meant parents incoming or coast is clear. The funniest part was when dad stopped at this scenic overlook and insisted we all take a family photo. While he was setting up his camera, Denki was frantically trying to finish a level on her hidden phone game. Denki, Smile! Dad called out, just a second. I'm appreciating the natural beauty, she said, thumbs flying across her screen. Our rebellion reached peak chaos on day three when we discovered the hotel had terrible Wi-Fi. Denki had a complete meltdown because she couldn't upload her secret vacation selfies to Instagram. The bathroom has better no! She whispered to me during dinner. So there we were, taking turns hiding in the hotel bathroom, desperately trying to get one bar of service while our parents thought we had digestive issues from the road trip snacks. You Kids have been spending a lot of time in the bathroom, mom observed suspiciously. Must be all that healthy trail mix you packed, I said innocently, while Denki was literally sitting on the bathroom floor trying to connect to Wi-Fi. Day 4 brought disaster. Dad decided to surprise us with a spontaneous hike and grabbed our backpacks to carry water bottles. That's when he discovered Denki's secret phone charging station she'd set up using the car's USB port. What is this?

Now my, he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning, I was almost 17, practically an adult and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big twitch star. I was devastated but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house, nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise, we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, reggis, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis's Instagram on his own phone. Escape border? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Greggus. Greggus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl. He winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was, just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

Brian thought college was a four year party with a diploma handed out at the end. I was just a nerdy roommate who'd somehow help him pass his classes. We weren't paired by choice. Housing lottery put us together freshman year. The football player and the scholarship kid. From day one, he made it clear what he thought of me. Seriously? You're studying on a Friday night? He'd laugh. This is college, man. You're supposed to be making memories. His memories involved coming back at 3:00am, stumbling into my desk, and. And occasionally vomiting near my backpack. Things shifted in October when he realized he was failing economics. The coach had warned him, maintain a 2.5 GPA or get benched. Hey, you're good at this stuff, right? He dropped his textbook on my keyboard. I need help. I agreed to tutor him, explain supply and demand curves created practice problems. He nodded along, then asked, so can you just write my paper for me? I've got a game this weekend. I refused, offered to review his draft instead. He laughed like I. I told a joke. Come on, nobody will know. I'll pay you. I can't do that, I said. It's academic dishonesty. We could both get expelled. His smile faded. Whatever, man. Thought you were cool. After that, our fragile roommate peace collapsed. He'd invite friends over when I had exams. Accidentally Spill drinks on my notes, hide my alarm clock. Before important classes, I started spending more time at the library, coming back only to sleep. I was working two part time jobs alongside a full course load. Midterms came. Brian failed economic specta. Got benched for two games. One morning, I woke up to find him staring at me, eyes bloodshot. You could have helped me, he said. Now coach says I might lose my scholarship. I tried to help. I replied, you wanted me to do it for you. Then came the real breaking point. I saved for two years to buy my first car. A used Honda with 120,000 miles. Nothing fancy, but it meant I could live off campus next year. The morning after Brian received his final warning from the athletics department, I found my car with all four tires slashed. Loser scratched into the door. Windshield crack. Campus security said they couldn't.

My older sister is super jumpy. Like she gets scared if the toast pops up too loud. So when I found out she'd been watching creepy sleepwalking videos all week, I saw my golden opportunity. One night I stayed up late and waited until I knew she was asleep. Then I slowly opened her bedroom door, walked in barefoot with my eyes half closed and started mumbling random garbage like the bees are listening. They can smell light. She's screamed full panic. I pretended to snap out of it like I didn't know what was going on. And the next morning I told her I had no memory of it. That's what really got her. She was convinced I was actually sleepwalking. So I did it again the next night. This time I stood at the end of her bed holding a spoon and just went spread, I am the serial. I was holding myself from bursting out laughing. After that, she started locking her door. So I got creative. I'd rattle the doorknob or just whisper her name through the air vent until she freaked out. I kept telling her I didn't remember any of it. My acting was elite. She even started filming me to prove it was real. But I would just delete the videos when she wasn't looking. It became this little war. Honestly, it was the most fun I'd had in weeks. I never Meant to actually scare her, just mess with her a little. But then one night she ran into my room looking pale and said, I need to show you something right now. I followed her down the hall thinking it was just another one of her overreactions. she opened her phone and pulled up a video from the night before. The footage showed her room in the dark and a figure slowly pushing the door open. Me or someone that looked like me. I watched the figure step into her room, stand completely still for a full minute, then start whispering. But it wasn't gibberish this time. It was my name. Over and over, whispered slowly, almost like then it tilted its head and said, I know you're awake. That's when the video cut out. I tried to laugh it off and said, okay, I admit it, that one was actually kind of good. But she didn't laugh. She looked at me and said, that wasn't from last night. That was from the night you slept over at Sam's house. My stomach dropped. I'd spent that night two neighborhoods over crashing on my friend's couch. I pulled out my own phone to double check the text. There it was, a message from me at 11:08 saying, crashing here tonight. Tell mom that video was recorded at 203:00am. I stared at the screen and tried to find some logical explanation. Maybe someone was messing with us. Maybe she faked The whole thing. But then she said, I didn't want to tell you, but a few nights ago I saw you standing in the hallway. I called your name and you didn't answer. You just walked into the bathroom and never came out. When I checked a minute later, the light was off and the room was empty. That was the part I couldn't explain because I remembered.

My parents discovered I wasn't their biological child when I was 16, not through some dramatic DNA test, through my little sister's science project. She was doing genetics homework, mapping out eye colours and couldn't make our family tree work. Brown eyes plus brown eyes can't make blue eyes, she, he said, pointing at me. Mom went white. Dad started stuttering about recessive genes. That night I heard them screaming through the walls. Mom admitted she had an affair 17 years ago. Dad wasn't my father. The man who raised me, taught me to ride a bike, helped with homework for 16 years, suddenly looked at me like I was a stranger. The change was immediate and brutal. Dad stopped coming to my baseball games. When I try talking to him, he'd respond with one word answers or just leave the room. Mom kept insisting nothing had changed, but he'd flinch whenever dad was cold to me. Then came the comparisons. Every family dinner became a catalog of how my sister and I were different. Look how naturally athletic Sophie is, dad would say, watching her throw a ball. She gets that from me. The implication hung in the air like poison. They started treating me like a house guest. My curfew got earlier while my sister stayed the same. My allowance got cut because money is tight. But Sophie got new clothes whenever she asked. When I brought it up, mom said, I Was being dramatic. The worst part was watching them rewrite history. Photos of me got moved to the back of albums. My baby pictures disappeared from the mantle. Dad started telling stories about Sophie's milestones while pretending mine never happened. It was like they were erasing 16 years. My breaking point came during Christmas. Extended family was over and Uncle Mike asked about my college plans. Dad said, well, he's not really academic like Sophie. Different genetics, you know, he said genetics like it was a dirty word. That's when it clicked. Didn't just learn I wasn't blood related. They decided I wasn't family. So I made a choice that destroyed them. I found my biological father. His name was John Sins. He lived three states away, had no idea I existed. When I called him, he cried, actually cried. Said he'd wondered about my mom for years, hoped she was happy. Two weeks later, John drove 400 miles to meet me. He brought photo albums of his family, told me about my half brother who played baseball like me, showed me pictures of my real grandmother who had died the year before. But here's what broke my parents. John didn't just accept me, he celebrated me. Within a month, he'd driven back twice more. He came to my games, met my friends, me car shopping for my 17th birthday. My parents watched this man give me everything they taken away. Dad became obsessed, calling John a stranger, trying to Steal his son. Mom begged me to stop seeing him, said it was destroying our family. I told them they'd already destroyed it. The night they decided biology mattered more than 16 years of love. The final blow came at graduation. Both my family showed up. John sat in the front road.

Like we're talking about a man who buys generic cereal and then pours it into name brand boxes so the neighbors think we eat the good stuff. He drives a BMW that's literally held together with duct tape and prayers. He parks it at the front of the driveway so everyone can see it anyway. I'm a senior in high school and college application season is here. All my friends are talking about where they're applying and their parents are stressing about tuition costs. Meanwhile, my dad keeps making these weird comments about how I better figure out my future because money doesn't grow on trees. But he never actually said he wouldn't pay for college, so I just assumed he would. Big mistake. I applied to my dream school and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I was so pumped and ran downstairs to tell my parents. My mom was excited and started crying happy tears, but my dad just looked at me and said, that's nice, honey. Hope you can afford it. I was confused and asked what he meant. He shrugged and said college was my responsibility now that I was becoming an don't. I felt my stomach drop. This man had literally never told me I'd be paying for college myself. We'd never had that conversation. I Was so angry and hurt that I decided to be petty about it. If you wanted to embarrass me, I'd return the favor. The next week was my 18th birthday party at our house. All my relatives were there, plus some family friends and neighbors. My dad loves showing off in front of people, so he was in his element, talking about his successful business and giving everyone financial advice. That's when I struck. During the cake cutting, I stood up and tapped my fork against my glass like I was making a toast. Everyone got quiet and looked at me. I smiled real big and said, thanks, everyone, for coming to celebrate with me. I just wanted to share some exciting news about my future. My dad looked proud, probably thinking I was about to thank him or something. I got into my dream college with a scholarship, which is amazing, because my dad just told me he's not helping pay for my education at all.

One? Probably the one where a man sought advice on how to handle his cheating wife, was advised to file for divorce, followed through and then news broke in the real world of a mother murdering her two children to prevent her soon to be ex husband from taking custody of them. The op later confirmed the news story was indeed about his wife and children. Horrendously sad. 2, the one where a dying mother told her teen that she was the product of an affair. Reddit encouraged the girl to tell her dad the truth. She took the advice and he kicked her out. Since he was the legal father, the state made him take her back in and he reacted by making life really difficult for the girl who by this point had no one else. She posted one last time on a sub about suicide saying that she'd taken something to end her life. 3, that dude that shot his dick off, cooked it and ate it, you slash worthless. 3, 19. 4 I don't remember the sub. There was this post by a woman who said she was worried about getting raped while out at night in the city. She was asking the area she should avoid and what would have to happen for someone to get away with raping her. People figured out the post was written by a guy trying to rape someone and Get away with it.

I couldn't remember a single time that she complimented me on my appearance. So I said that to her. I said, you know, I always tell you how beautiful you are and how attracted to you I am, but I never recall you ever saying that I look good or that I look handsome. She stopped applying her mascara long enough to dismissively roll her eyes at me. So I made the mistake of asking her, do you even find me attractive? And she flatly said no. I asked, why did you marry me then? And she said, I didn't think it was important at the time. I never felt so ugly and unloved.

Two, the Dunbar armored robbery, the largest cash heist in US history. A six man inside job to rob an armored cash depot. They set up a house party as an alibi, use the keys to get into the cafeteria and waited in there until all employees came in on break, ambushed and subdued them without firing a shot or raising an alarm. They then loaded the money bags with over $18 million into a U Haul, destroyed the CCTV tapes and returned to the party. Then they sat on the money for six months before hiring a crooked lawyer to set up a real estate money laundering scheme to avoid suspicion. Two years after the robbery, one of the men paid a real estate broker with a stack of money still wrapped in the original currency strap. The broker immediately reported it to the police. After being arrested, he cracked under interrogation, confessed to the robbery and ratted out his partners. All the men have since finished their prison sentences. And most of the money was never found. So there's a chance they still won in the end.

What's the most embarrassing situation where you've been mistaken for your twin? One, my twin brother recommended a restaurant to me, said that he and his wife went there all the time. Good food, really friendly staff. So I took my wife there. Food was as advertised, but the service somewhere between cold and openly hostile, like they resented our presence. I was puzzled by the contrast between what I'd heard and what I saw. Suddenly from the front of the restaurant, explosion of laughter, much rapid talking. Suddenly the waitress is there smiling and all, just as my brother and his wife walk around the corner. They thought my brother was cheating on his wife with some blonde. Yeah, it's funny now. 2, I was dating a girl in college. The first time I went to her house, she opened the door. I told her I liked what she did to her hair and kissed her. She kissed me. We went inside. She then yells, your boyfriend is here. They were weird girls. 3. Not a twin, just Asian. Constantly asked at work about projects I am not involved in. Realize co workers think I am the other Asian guy. 4. Not me, but a co worker has two sets of twin daughters. The younger pair are identical and both work at the same McDonald's. The manager often puts one on the pay window and the other on the food window just to mess with Customers. 5, I've been called my twin sister's name my whole life. So one day I accidentally introduced myself to someone as her. When I caught and corrected myself they thought I was straight up crazy for not knowing my own name. 6, a friend and his wife go to the same supermarket every week. His identical twin also goes there with his wife. One day after summoning up the courage, the cashier pulls my friend's wife aside and says, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I've seen your husband here several times with another woman. 7, my friend said hi to his brother one morning. Well, it turns out his brother was actually his own reflection in a window. His mom witnessed it and has never let him live it down. 8, my twin had recently committed suicide and I was at a bar drinking away my rage and a friend of his came up and flipped out on me saying how awful of a joke it was and took everything I had not to remove their teeth with my fist.

I woke up, watched Buffy, ate pizza, called my brother, went to work, came home and watched the end of the series of Buffy. It may sound like a joke, but I got up after finishing Buffy the Vampire Slayer and went walking. I kept listening to Gangsters Paradise on my iPod until I reached the Aurora Bridge. I live in Seattle. If you know the bridge, you may know that in the last couple years, they have built very high fences around it. But when I was there, there was just a small handrail. I walked to the middle of the bridge and looked down for a while. This part of the bridge was overland and not water, so I continued to walk until I wasn't above someone's yard. I was probably 100 yards before the end of the bridge. I stood looking over the railing for 10 minutes, maybe more. A man got off the 16 bus at the stop right before the bridge and walked toward me. He stopped beside me and asked if I was okay, and I didn't reply for a while. He just stood next to me for a while and just kept talking. He never stopped talking. He talked about the bridge and the bus and his family and about his work and chattered away for a solid 10 minutes. He asked where I lived and I told him Put his hand on my back and coerced me off the bridge and onto a bus. He bust me home and walked me to my front door. I never got his name and I haven't seen him since. But he saved my life. I don't know that I would ever have killed myself, but that's the closest I ever came to it. A stranger saved me and I really hope he knows that. 2. I treated it like a normal day. I got up, went to school, came home and went for it. I tried to enjoy the last moments I had with friends. I wanted to tell somebody but decided not to. I didn't want to bring anyone down. The day before, I wrote letters to those closest to me. On my last day, I left them on the kitchen counter, headed up to the roof and just stared down. It was around nine PM so when I glanced down, I saw nothing. It was pitch black. My right foot hovered around the edge. Right when I was about to leap off, I looked up cross the street. I saw a few people staring at me from their apartment window. This little girl, though, her gaze caught my eye. She shook her head then covered her face. Because of her, I didn't go through with it. 3, my younger brother texted me early that morning in a really good mood saying what a great day it was going to Be then he apparently went around giving out his stuff, buying people lunch and telling his close friends his bank info, etc. He wanted to make sure his friends were covered. I was at work so I didn't get the I love you Dragon flexo text until after he was in the hospital. The sad thing was when I read that text, I knew something was wrong. 4 my friend put on his Facebook the day before he did it, if you had one day to live, what would you do? The day he did it, he went around to all of his close friend and just spent a little time with them, like a half hour, just hang out and shoot shit as usual. Later that night, he texted everyone goodbye. He drove down to one of our favorite smoke spots and obviously no one knows after that except him. But that's where two of my friend found him the next day.

One, I didn't find this loophole, but my friend did. A few years back, an online store had this promotion where whoever spent the most money over a month would get free round trip airplane tickets to anywhere in the world. My friend who's a fucking genius found that one thing you could buy on the site was a gift certificate. So he bought a 25 dollar gift certificate and kept spending it on another 25 dollar gift certificate. So he ended up spending 25 dollars on round trip tickets to Australia. 2. My brother once yelled last one to jump in the pool is gay and then jumped into the pool. However, I figured out that if I did not jump in, then technically he would be the last one in the pool and he is still gay to this day. 3. I used to work at papa John's to pay my way through college. There was a contest we had where if you got someone to upsize their pizza from like a medium to a large for an extra $2, you got points towards movie tickets. A large was simply $2 extra normally anyways, anyone that ordered a large, I simply put in a medium and up sized it. I won every fucking week my co workers didn't notice this obvious loophole and it didn't cost the customer extra. So I didn't have a problem with this morally gray Area, free movie tickets every week was a huge in college. Four, there was a drink machine in college that was 75 cents for a juice. If you put a dollar in, it gave you five quarters in change. I got a juice every day for months before they finally fixed it. 5. When I wear glasses, white people aren't afraid of me. I can blend in anywhere. Nobody wants to be the guy who asks if the black guy really works there. I can walk straight in. Area 51, edit. I'm in the hospital. They shot me in the leg and said I was trespassing. Thanks whoever told me to bring that clipboard. It deflected a bullet. Probably saved my life, honestly. 6, that you can jiggle the handle of certain gumball machines to get free gumballs. 7. For a while, McDonald's had a promo where when you walked in, you could scan a QR code and possibly get free food. However, different locations and different cutouts had different codes. I took pics of as many unique codes I could find, put them all on a handy PDF and scanned them all using an Android device and an Los device. Before lunch, I got free extra value meals regularly. In fact, I still had a couple free ones left over when they stopped the promotion.

One. I had a friend I was crushing on, and I thought he liked me, too. One day we were chatting online and he had to leave for work. Before logging off, he said, I'll be back later to spend more time with my favorite Asian. Confused, I asked, who's that? For as long as I knew him, he thought I was Asian. Once he found out I wasn't, he ghosted me. Two. I was at a dinner party and people kept offering me drinks that I continued to decline. Eventually, one woman's eyes lit up as she looked between me and my husband, and then she asked, oh my gosh, are you pregnant? Everyone around us got quiet, and I laughed and said, no, I have epilepsy. I was handed no more glasses of wine after that. 3. My ex wife was convinced I had another family in another state simply because she heard a kid's voice in the background when I was traveling for work and sitting in a restaurant. Once during divorce depositions, I spent a full day being questioned, and half the questions were slightly different wordings of so you have another family, kid, etcetera. 4. One time in Japan, I asked an old lady for directions in Japanese. I was still a beginner, but I tried my best to speak in their language rather than asking stuff in English. So this lady Assumed I spoke very good Japanese and started chatting. I tried telling her I couldn't understand and everyone else on the bus was trying to hide their laughter. The conversation went on for 10 minutes and I still have no idea what she was saying. She was very nice though. 5 I live in a very Hispanic slash Latino area and one woman heard me speak English and yelled at me for not speaking Spanish, calling me a traitor to my ancestors and bringing shame to my past family history in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Imagine her surprise when I told her I was Arab and Middle Eastern. Still felt guilty for not knowing Spanish for some reason lol. 6 people assumed as high school I was eating nothing but junk because I was rapidly gaining weight while my twin wasn't. In truth I was starving myself because I couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight. It wasn't until my 20s I found out I had a tumor on my thyroid and that's what caused the weight gain.

Second time we all stuck around in the school parking lot to witness the aftermath. His dad was apocalyptic. You hit the same pole. How? How? He got a used banana yellow wagon after that. It was hilarious. 9. Messed around with a German foreign exchange student on the principal's desk during a Pep rally. Instant expulsion. Exchange student was sent back to Germany. In his defense, it was consensual and she was devastatingly attractive.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? I practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't. His girlfriend Ava read over his shoulder then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason, did something happen to Isabella? He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like Usabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Miss. As a Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening, I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve have been helping Mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody, look me in the eyes and said I would never keep your children from you. For six months, she actually kept her word and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup and there was a for sale sign in the yard and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour dissociating because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles away. For months while looking me in the eye every Friday, The next morning a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took 3 days for me to get through to her. She answered and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous. I accepted and she passed the phone to my 8 year old. He cried instantly. Why can't we see you this weekend? My ex immediately answered, daddy's too busy with work. Then hung up on me. My calls wouldn't go through after that and she texted that I had just used up my call for the month. I was so pissed and refused to let her get away with this. So the next week I liquidated my entire 4 o one k to pay a lawyer who told me I was fighting an uphill battle, but at least we could try. I quit my traveling job that I'd worked so hard for and the local position making 40% less. All this was to show the court I was prioritizing my children. Every other weekend I maxed out credit cards to fly to Seattle and my kids would run to me in the airport like I was returning from war. We spent weekends in cramped hotel rooms making blanket Forts and eating McDonald's because that's all I could afford. But they didn't care because we were together. Those weekends were perfect until Sunday drop offs when my ex would make sure to say things in front of me like, daddy doesn't live here. This is just vacation. Remember that your dad is Steve now. I just smile through it while documenting every text where she denied me extra time. After two years of never missing a single visit, the judge finally granted me a week each summer. And when my kids got older, they started asking why mom lied so much about me. I was glad they didn't fall for her lies, especially because she couldn't even acknowledge how hard she made all of this. But her karma came a year later. My phone rang at midnight and when I heard her crying, I almost hung up because I didn't want to deal with her drama.

I refused. And the next day before I left, I found them tearing up my lottery ticket, laughing because I'm envious. But I laughed my head off because that ticket was fake. See, I saw this coming from a mile away. My sister Ruby has always been the golden child and my parents have always made me give her everything. When I got my first job at 16, they made me give Ruby half my paycheck to teach me about sharing. When grandma left me her ring, they gave it to Ruby because she'll get more use out of it. Every birthday, every achievement, every moment of my life, Ruby had to get equal or more. So when I won, I knew they'd pull this exact stunt. The moment I told them, I could see the wheels turning in their heads. Dad immediately launched into his speech about family responsibility while Ruby sat there with that smug smile she gets when she's about to take something that's mine. That night, after they delivered their ultimatum, I heard them whispering in the kitchen, she'll cave, Ruby said confidently. She always does. Mom agreed, saying, I'd never actually leave because I'm too dependent on family. They had no idea they were dealing with someone who'd finally had enough. I spent all night creating a perfect day. Fake ticket. I Work in graphic design, so I knew exactly how to make it look authentic. Same paper, texture, same fonts, everything. The only difference, completely different numbers. That definitely hadn't won anything. I made sure it looked slightly worn, like I've been carrying it around since the drawing. Meanwhile, the real ticket was safely locked in my bank's safety deposit box, already verified and ready for claim. The next morning, I acted devastated. I came to breakfast looking like I've been crying all night. Fine, I said quietly. I'll pack and leave today. I made sure to accidentally leave the fake ticket in my wallet on the kitchen counter. When I went upstairs to pack, the bait was set. Sure enough, 20 minutes later, I heard screaming from downstairs. Amelia, get down here now. Dad's voice was shaking with rage. I walked down to find all three of them huddled around my wallet. The torn pieces of the fake ticket scattered across the counter like confetti. How does it feel now? Ruby laughed, holding up a piece of the the ticket. No lottery money for you. Maybe next time you'll think about what family means. Mom was nodding approvingly. This is what happens when you choose greed over family. Amelia, Dad crossed his arms. Hopefully this teaches you a lesson about sharing. I just stood there a moment, taking it all in. Then I started laughing, quietly at first, then louder. You're absolutely right, I said, still chuckling. That ticket was Completely worthless. Their triumphant expression started to alter. Something in my tone wasn't matching their expectations. I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app, making sure the screen was facing them. 1, 847 30, 329, 18, deposited yesterday at three forty seven PM the silence that followed was deafening. Ruby's mouth literally fell open. Mom grabbed the counter to study herself. Dad just stared at my phone screen like it was showing him a ghost. The real ticket was never in my wallet, I continued calmly. It's been in my bank safety deposit box since the day after I won. That piece of garbage you just tore up, I made it last night specifically for you to find. Ruby's face went from pale to bright red. You, you tricked us. You tricked yourselves. I replied. I just gave you enough rope to hang yourselves with. And boy, did you ever. Amelia, wait, mom started her voice suddenly much. We can work this out. We were just trying to teach you. Teach me what? I interrupted that my own family would destroy what they thought was my future out of spite. Message received loud and clear. Dad tried his authoritative voice. Now hold on just a minute. We're still your parents and, and you just prove that means absolutely nothing to you when money is involved. Ruby was getting desperate. Now, Amelia, come on. We're family. Families fight, but they work things out, right? I mean, we can share The money now, can't we? 50 50, just like we originally talked about. I grabbed my keys from the counter. You're right, Ruby. That ticket you destroyed was worthless, just like this family apparently is. As I I headed for the door, I heard Ruby screaming behind me. You can't just leave. We're your family. You owe us, Amelia. But I was already in my car, driving away to my new life, a life where I'd never again have to pretend that blood relation means more than basic human decency. Ruby's still calling and texting every day, begging for another chance, and I don't answer. Some lessons are permanent. The best part, I'm happier now than I've ever been. Turns out, when you remove toxic people from your life, even winning the lottery feels like the smaller victory.

I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she got to ninth grade, but also had another kid who would constantly bug her. He was always trying to flirt with the girls in my class, which ended with them slapping him on numerous different occasions. I sent him to the office so many times that he had to sit in the front, but one day he practically begged me to sit in the back. I don't know why, but I said yes. We were in the middle of an assignment, and our entire class was silent when at one point, I could hear whispering coming from the back. I looked up, and all I saw was him showing another student what, at first glance, looked like a handgun. It honestly took me a second to process what I had just seen. I didn't have a clear enough view to be sure, and I just sat there trying to stay calm. I knew I had to get a better look, so I stood up to go help one of my students. Now I was sure it wasn't a toy. It was real. I remember my sweat literally dripping off my face and tried my hardest not to pass out. My hands were shaking like crazy while I dialed 9 1 1 on my phone, but it was too quiet to say Anything. Couldn't just walk out of the room. I had to keep my students safe and knew I had to get my daughter out of there. I texted our assistant principal in all caps exactly what I had just seen, and waited minutes for a response. Eventually, I knew I couldn't wait, so I called that same girl over to my desk. I wrote her a note that said, ask me to use the bathroom. Go get the assistant principal, get him to check his phone and leave. The school immediately tried to keep a calm look on my face, but she could see something was horribly wrong. She left without saying anything, and I tried to act like everything was normal. Five excruciating minutes later, he knocked on the door. He walked inside and started chatting with a few students, acting as if nothing was wrong. I think they started to catch on something was going on, too, and eventually, he asked the boy to come out into the hall with him. He stood up, and those few seconds as he walked by my daughter to the door were the most terrifying of my life. As soon as he stepped out, he was tackled to the ground. Apparently, he was planning to use it on another student that lunch. And since then, I homeschool my daughter.

So my sister has been having kids since she was basically a teenager. She got pregnant at 18, married her boyfriend because both sets of parents pushed it. And now at 29, she's got five kids, 11, 6, 3, 2 and 1. And now she's pregnant again. Close with our parents, so we have family dinners a lot. And every single time she starts in on the same routine, how her life sucks, how her body is ruined, how she can't get surgery, how she never has money, never gets time for herself, how no one will watch her kids. It's constant. Her husband works all the time and can't stand her, so she just dumps it all on us. And honestly, her kids are wild. Sitting through those dinners feels like surviving a war zone. What pisses me off is that none of this was forced on her. Our parents gave us the talk at 16, gave us birth control, told us to focus on school and careers before starting families. She wanted a baby at 18. She kept choosing to have kid after kid. She had options. She ignored all of them. So Christmas rolls around and sure enough, she's sitting there with her pity party going on and on about how I don't understand because I've got a degree, a good job, a boyfriend, no kids, can afford to go to the gym. I get to live life. While she's trapped and I just snapped. I told her to shut the fuck up. I told her she's in this mess because she's a moron who made terrible choices and nobody feels sorry for her. My brother started laughing. My parents stayed quiet, which says a lot because behind her back, they complain about her all the time too. And she lost it. Now she's crying on Facebook, making sad TikToks about how society hates mothers and where's her village? And even my family doesn't care about me. But the truth is she built this life herself and I'm done.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

Last month at the dog park, this couple approached me while I was throwing a tennis ball for my dog waffle. The woman immediately started sobbing when she saw him. Her husband had his arm around on her shoulders and explained through his own tears that I had their dog, their baby, who'd escaped from their backyard, and they'd been searching everywhere since I'd found waffle wandering around the parking lot behind my apartment building six months ago. No collar, ribs showing through his matted fur, and figured someone had dumped him. Husband pulled out his phone, showing me dozens of photos that definitely look like waffle. Playing in their backyard, swimming in their pool, sleeping on their couch. He said his name was Cooper, and when he called that name, Waffle's ears perked up and he barked, which made my stomach drop because I've been so sure he was abandoned. The wife was crying into Waffle's fur while he licked her face, and her husband pulled out his wallet and started counting hundred dollar bills. We'll give you five thousand dollars for him, he said, his hands shaking as he held out the cash. I know you've been taking care of him, and we want to reimburse you for everything, food and vet bills and your time, because you saved our baby's life. We thought our lives were over when he got out. I stared at the money feeling sick because I Didn't want their money, and I definitely didn't want to give up waffle. This dog had been my only friend through the worst breakup of my life, sleeping next to me every night when I couldn't stop crying about my ex forcing me to go outside when I wanted to rot in bed forever. But watching this woman sob while showing me more photos of their family vacations with him made my chest hurt. These people were destroyed by losing their dog. And here I was keeping him from his real family when I just been the person who found him. If they were willing to pay $5,000 just to get him back, he must mean everything to. I told them to keep their money and just take him, that I was glad he had people who loved him that much. The woman hugged me so tight I couldn't breathe while thanking me over and over. Waffle kept looking back at me as I handed his leash to the husband, probably confused about why I wasn't coming with them. The woman coaxed him toward their car with an excited voice, telling him they were going home. I told myself he'd be happier with his real family, with a yard and another dog to play with, like in their photos. The husband shook my hand and said, you're a good person. Not many people would do this. And I stood there in the empty dog park trying not to cry. But I couldn't stop myself. Waffle was such a good dog, and I had no idea when we woke up that that was my last day with him. The next three weeks were exactly as horrible as I expected. I kept looking for waffle every time I opened my door, kept saving bacon scraps before remembering he wasn't there to beg for them. I bought a goldfish just to have something alive in my apartment, but it wasn't the same as having someone genuinely excited to see me exist. I started taking different routes home to avoid the dog park, and threw out his bed because looking at it made me want to scream. But I told myself at least he was back where he belonged. I kept hoping I'd hear from his family, that maybe they'd send me a picture of him all settled in, but they never did. Then yesterday, I was scrolling through next door looking for a used coffee table when I saw a post that made me drop my phone. Someone had written warning dog kidnappers active in our neighborhood with a blurry security camera photo attached. The post explained that criminals were stealing purebred dogs from yards and dog parks and selling them to puppy Mills and collectors overseas for massive profits. They worked in pairs, usually a couple, and used fake sob stories about losing their beloved pet to guilt owners into giving up their dogs. My hands were shaking as I clicked on The photo to enlarge it. Even with the terrible quality, I could see it was them. The same couple from the dog park leading someone else's German bird into the same car waffle had climbed into. The post said golden retrievers like mine were especially valuable, particularly the English cream variety, which could sell for $20,000 to collectors in China. I hadn't even known waffle was anything special, just thought he was a regular golden retriever who needed a home. They'd stolen my dog by pretending to love him, using my own decency against me. And we're probably selling him to some.

Whenever grandma brought up gifts or money, I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at two forty seven PM signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a 3,000 dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The Same design, the same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. The Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm. Where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved up. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought to a 3 thousand dollar bracelet. Mom jumped in. Alara's been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents because last month she asked me for 20 dollars for gas money. The month before that she needed 50 dollars for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Warren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Lara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know, maybe my phone case, which cost like $30. The math wasn't mathing. And everyone at the table. Knew it. Grandma leaned forward, her eyes locked on Alara's bracelet. Show me that bracelet now. I don't wanna take it off, Alara said, her voice getting smaller. It might fall.

Back when I was 14, my dad and I were cleaning off his workbench. I found what I thought was a melted piece of metal wrapped up in a cloth. I asked him what it was and he said something along the lines of, wow, I didn't think I still had that. He told me that one day when I was over 18, he tell me what it really was. For four years, that thing consumed my thoughts. I'd sneak into the garage during family barbecues, Christmas mornings, random afternoons just to stare at that wrapped object in Dad's toolbox. The cloth was old and stained. Sometimes I pick it up, feeling its weight, trying to guess what could require an 18th birthday revelation. My friends thought I was crazy. Just unwrap it when he's not home, they'd say. But something about Dad's tone that day stopped me. I tried everything to get him to crack, bribery, guilt trips, bargaining. What if I get straight A's? What if something happens to you before I turn 18? Nothing worked. He'd just get that same distant look and say, when you're 18, son. The mystery drove me insane. I'd lie away creating elaborate theories, each more dramatic than the last. Uncle Mike used to be Dad's business partner and best friend. Small construction company, always laughing. At family gatherings, Mike was like a second father, teaching me football, sneaking me extra dessert. When mom wasn't looking. Then when I was 8, Mike just disappeared. No goodbye, no explanation. When? When I'd ask, mom would get this weird look and change the subject. Dad would mumble about Mike moving to Arizona. Our house changed after Mike left. Dad started locking the garage at night. He'd get jumpy whenever someone knocked on the door. Mom would find him staring out the kitchen window at 3:00am just watching the street. They thought I didn't notice, but kids pick up on everything. Years passed. No Christmas cards, no phone calls, like he'd vanished. But sometimes I'd catch dad staring at old photos of them together. The morning after my 18th birthday, I cornered him in the kitchen. Today's the day, dad. He sat down, his coffee with shaking hands. You sure you wanna know some things? Once you know them, you can't unknow them. I nodded. Heart pounding. He disappeared into the garage and came back with that familiar bundle. We sat at the kitchen table as he slowly began unwrapping it. His hands were trembling. This is about Mike, he said quietly, about why he really disappeared. The cloth fell away, revealing something jagged and twisted. Mike and I were doing well with the business, but Mike started getting greedy, skimming money from job sites, overcharging clients. I kept covering for him, thinking he'd straighten out. Dad's voice got quieter. One night, Mike showed up here completely drunk, eyes wild. Your mom?

The most gorgeous boy in our school, Parker, slid a signed Taylor Swift vinyl across the cafeteria table and asked me, so, can you teach me Japanese? I nearly choked on my apple juice. Parker was the guy every girl wanted. Soccer captain, perfect smile, the kind of handsome that made teachers forget what they were saying mid sentence. And he was talking to me, the girl who spent lunch reading. Why do you need Japanese? I told Akira I lived in Tokyo for a year. He rubbed his neck. Stupid first day lie. Now she keeps speaking Japanese to me, and I just nod like I understand. Akira Suzuki, of course. The exchange student who'd basically become our school's Akira in character. She had Disney princess eyes and a smile that made every guy melt. Her cousin's birthday party is in three weeks. She invited me. He pushed the vinyl closer. This is signed from the heiress tour. It's yours if you help me. His brown eyes actually looked panicked. Not like other girls. She cares about real things. I can't mess this up. I held the vinyl up to the light to examine it. Pen pressure, check. Letter spacing, check. It really was an authentic signature. You got yourself a deal! I exclaimed. First lesson, Parker showed up with coffee and colour coded notebooks. Adorable. Okay, basics first, I said. Konnichiwa genki desu ka no He leaned forward. Teach me how to flirt in Japanese. How to not sound like a tourist. I wanna talk to her about things she cares about. That was sweet. I expected him to want cheesy pickup lines. Start with pronunciation. Say Akira. Akira. No, you need to soften the R. Like this. Akira. He tried again. Failed. I sighed. Here. I took his hand and placed it on my throat, ignoring how my pulse jumped. Feel how gentle it is. Akira. His fingers spread against my neck. Akira, he whispered, and suddenly the room felt too small. Better? I stepped back. Practice that. Something in my chest fluttered. You're a really patient teacher, he said on Wednesday, after finally nailing a difficult phrase. You're a good student, really. He grinned, and I realized I never seen him truly smile before. Not the popular guy smile. A real one. By week two, we moved past basics. I caught him Haiku in his car after practice. He'd repeat lines about cherry blossoms while I tried not to notice how the sunset made his eyes look like honey. What does this mean? He showed me a line he found. When I think of you, I forget both time and place. Throat went dry. It means love makes you lose track of everything else. Huh? He stared at the words. That's beautiful. Thursday we practice traditional dance moves. I wasn't sure why, but he insisted that it would come in handy one day. Anything for a Taylor Swift signed vinyl, I guess. Terrible at this. He laughed as he stepped on my foot again. You're not. I adjusted his hand position. Just follow my lead. His mom walked by his room and smiled at us. Sorry about her, he said. She thinks we're. Never mind. What? Nothing. But his ears turned red. The final week, something shifted. He text me Japanese puns late at night. Bring me mochi because I mentioned loving it once. Stay after our sessions just to talk in English. You know what's weird? He said. Tuesday night, lying on his bedroom floor while we studied. I started this to impress Akira, but now I just really love the language. Yeah? Yeah. Like this. He sat up. How do you say I lose track of time with you? Key me to IRU to jikan wo suru tsuretsushimae. He repeated it, looking right at me. The air went thick. That's, um. That's good. Akira will like that, right? Then came our last session. He was fluent enough to hold conversations, quote poetry, even make jokes. He Learned an entire language in three weeks. Let's do one final practice, he said. Full romantic confession. My stomach hurt. Okay. He took my hands. I tried to memorize the feeling. Kimi to iru to subete GA imi WA motsu Kimi WA zutto bokunoko kocoron iita. When I'm with you, everything has meaning. You're like a song that was always in my heart. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't stop wishing those words were for me. Perfect, I whispered. You're going to sweep her off her feet. Something crossed his face. Think Akira will feel it, too? How could she not? Friday, the whole school watched Parker approach Akira at her locker. I stood by the water fountain, feeling sick. Oh, hi. You Akira San Yankee. Good morning, Akira. How are you? She turned surprised. Then he started speaking the Japanese I taught him.

My ex husband remarried three years ago to this woman, Beth, who came with twin daughters Madison and Mackenzie. They're both 15, same age as my daughter Chloe. When Chloe stays there every other weekend, she has to share a room with both of them because apparently there's no space for her to have her own room in their four bedroom house. Last month, Chloe came back from her dad's place looking exhausted. I asked what was wrong and she just shrugged it off like usual. But when she fell asleep on the couch at seven PM, I knew something was up. My kid never goes to sleep early unless she's sick. The next weekend she came back looking even worse, dark circles under her eyes, cranky all day, complaining about everything. Finally, I cornered her in the kitchen while she was making cereal. What's really going on at your dad's place, I asked. She stirred her lucky charms for like a full minute before answering. The twins think it's funny to make me sleep on the floor. They told me their beds are too good for someone who doesn't really belong in their family. My stomach dropped. What do you mean sleep on the floor? She looked up at me with these tired eyes. They took my pillow and blanket the first night and hid them when I asked, dad. And Beth about it. Madison said I was lying and that I probably just lost them. Beth believed her instead of me. I felt my face getting hot. Where does your dad think you sleep in the bed with them. That's what they tell him. But every night after everyone's asleep, they wake me up and make me get on the floor. They say if I tell dad, they'll make sure he knows what a troublemaker I am and maybe he won't want me visiting anymore. That was it. I grabbed my phone and called my ex immediately. Your daughters are making Chloe sleep on the floor, I said as soon as he picked up. What? That's not true. She shares the bed with them. Ask them right now if that's what really happens at night. There was silence and I heard him calling for the girls. Five minutes later, he called back. They admit they've been making her get on the floor, but they say it's because she kicks in her sleep and keeps them awake. the solution is to make a 15 year old girl sleep on a hardwood floor with no pillow or blanket? Are you insane? We'll figure something out, he said. But I could tell he was already making excuses in his head. No, we won't. I've already figured it out. The next Friday when it was time for Chloe to go to her dad's, I drove her straight to the Hampton Inn down The street from his house. Instead, I walked up to the front desk with my credit card. I need a room for my daughter for the weekend, just her. She's 15. The desk clerk looked confused. Is there an adult staying with her? No, but her father lives two minutes away. If there's an emergency, here's his number. I handed over a piece of paper with my ex.

The reunion was at Lake Tahoe. 60 relatives I hadn't seen since I was 12, all pretending we were some perfect family. My sister Katie had organized the whole thing, rented this massive cabin, matching t shirts with Henderson Family Reunion 2019 in cursive, a photographer, the works. I should have known something was up when they insisted I ride separately. Your car has better gas mileage, dad said. Follow us. We'll stop for lunch halfway. The drive from Portland was eight hours. I'd taken three days off from my job at the bookstore, or spent money I didn't have on gas and a gift for my grandma's 80th. Katie had guilted me for months about missing family events. You never show up for anything, she'd said. Just this once, please. Halfway through Nevada, they pulled into a Chevron outside Reno. Desert heat shimmering off the asphalt. I parked behind Dad's Escalade, went inside for Red Bull and trail mix. The cashier was counting change for some kid buying candy. Maybe three minutes total. When I came out, they were recording me on their phones through the windows, laughing as they peeled out of the parking lot. Mom was filming from the passenger seat. Even my teenage nephew Jake, had his phone up. The group text lit up immediately. 23 messages before I could even process what happened. Hope you brought a map. First one home wins. It's just a prank. Bro, don't be such a baby. Katie sent a gift of someone crying. They thought I'd panic. Panic, call them crying, beg for help. Classic Marcus. Right, the sensitive one. The theater kid who cried during Pixar movies. The one who still went to therapy. The one they called too soft at every family dinner. I sat in my Honda for 20 minutes, engine off, reading their messages. Dad posted a video to the family Facebook group. 67 likes, comments flooding in. Hilarious. Marcus will laugh about this later. Great prank. My aunt commented. He probably needs this. Toughen him up. That's when something shifted. This crystalline moment of clarity. They didn't leave me as a joke. They left me because they genuinely thought I needed to be taught a lesson. About what? Being myself. I turned my car around and drove to San Francisco. No dramatic goodbye text, no explanation. Just turned off my phone and drove west toward the bay. Found a hostel in the tenderloin that first night. Sketchy as hell, but it was 40 bucks and they didn't ask questions. Found a studio apartment that same week. Fourth floor, walk up in the mission. Bars on the windows. Radiator that sounded like it was dying, but it was mine. Bartending job at this dive called the Broken Clock. The owner, Tommy, was this ex Marine who hired me on the spot when I made him laugh during the interview. Deleted Facebook, changed my number the hardest Part was explaining to my old co workers why I needed my last paycheck mailed to a California address. For three months, I built a new life, made friends with the other bartenders, started dating this girl, Sarah, who worked at the coffee shop next door. Joined a community theatre group. Nobody knew about my family. I was just Marcus from Portland who moved for a fresh start. Then the email started. Six months after the Chevron incident, my cousin Derek sent an email to my work address. The one from the bookstore website, apparently

What happened afterwards with your life? I've been dating Sophia for four years when I finally decided to ask the big question. Her parents treated me like their own son, especially after they found out I grew up in foster care. Her little brother would literally follow me around their house, begging me to teach him how to fix engines. Someone who never had a real family, being part of theirs felt like everything I've been missing my whole life. I've been saving every extra dollar from my job at Murphy's Auto Shop for months. The ring wasn't fancy, just a simple band with a small diamond. But it was real, and it was all I could afford. I planned everything perfectly. Sophia's dad was turning 60, and they were throwing this big backyard BBQ. All her family would be there, plus her closest friends. She always said family was the most important thing to her, so I figured proposing surrounded by everyone who loved us both would be perfect. The party was going great. Sophia's mom made her famous brisket. Her dad was telling embarrassing stories about Sophia as a kid, and everyone was laughing and having a good time. After they brought out the birthday cake and saying happy birthday, I figured it was the perfect moment. My hands were shaking as I tapped my beer bottle with a fork to get everyone's attention. The whole backyard went dead silent. Sophia looked confused. At first. Then her eyes went wide. When I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring box, her mom gasped and started tearing up. Her dad had this huge smile on his face. Her friends were already pulling out their phones to record the moment. I opened the box and said all the things I've been practicing in my head for weeks. How much I loved her, how she changed my life, how I wanted to spend forever making her happy. The words just poured out of me. But Sophia just stood there, frozen. Not good. Frozen like she was overwhelmed with happiness. Add frozen like she'd seen a ghost. Liam, she finally said, and I could hear the panic in her voice, I love you so much, but I'm not ready for this. I'm so sorry. The silence that followed was the worst sound I'd ever heard. 30 people just staring at us, not knowing what to do or where to look. I stayed on one knee for probably five seconds too long, trying to process what had just happened. Then, and I slowly stood up, shoved the ring box back in my pocket, and nodded. Okay, I said, because what else could I say? Sophia reached for my arm, but I stepped back. I couldn't deal with her trying to comfort me in front of everyone. I mumbled something about needing to go and walked straight to my truck. The drive home was the longest. 20 minutes of my life. I stayed up all night staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation we'd ever had. About the future. We talked about getting married, about kids, about buying a house together. How had I read everything so wrong? The next day, I was under the hood of a broken down Chevy trying to lose myself in work, when I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up expecting to see my boss, but it was so.

Someone stole my mountain bike from my apartment's bike rack last month. This wasn't some cheap Walmart bike, it was a 2,800 dollar trek that I'd saved for months to buy. I filed a police report, but honestly I didn't expect much help. The bike had GPS tracking built into the frame, part of the anti theft package I paid extra for. Most thieves don't know about embedded trackers. So I pulled up the app to see where my bike ended up. It was moving through downtown, then stopped at an address about 3 miles away. I waited a few hours to see if it would move again, but it stayed put. The GPS showed it was in someone's garage. I drove over to check it out. Sketchy neighborhood, run down houses, and sure enough, it was my bike. In this guy's open garage next to about six other expensive bikes that definitely didn't belong to him. Here's the thing. I couldn't just call the cops and say my bike is in that garage. They'd need proof it was actually mine, and this guy would probably just deny everything. So I came up with a plan. I went home and printed out fake flyers advertising a cash for bikes business. Made it look like I was buying used bikes, no questions asked. The next day I knocked on the guy's door. Mid 30s, covered in tattoos. Looked exactly like someone who'd Steal bikes for a living. Hey, man, I saw you've got some nice bikes in your garage, I said, showing him the flyer. I buy bikes for cash. Interested in selling any? His eyes lit up immediately. Yeah, I've got some bikes. What kind of prices are you talking? Depends on the condition and model. Mind if I take a look? He LED me straight to the garage, where I counted eight stolen bikes, including mine. My Trek was right there. Still had the custom handlebar grips I'd installed. This Trek looks nice, I said, examining my own bike. How much you want for it? That's a good one, he replied. I'm thinking $800. Perfect. He was trying to sell me my own stolen bike. Tell you what, I said, I'm interested in this track, but I need to check with my business partner about the price. Can I get your contact info and maybe come back tomorrow?

No, ain't nobody gonna think that. And the teacher always got the nerve to turn off the lights like that's gonna stop bullets. Oh yeah, great job, Karen.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything, my location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part, she started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out. And my mom replied, sure thing, buddy, with way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me? My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid, but friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

He said, wouldn't you rather drive straight to the hospital? Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk typed something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She. I knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beeping machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

I work in semiconductors, where precision matters in circuits and apparently not in HR complaints. This started when management moved a new girl, 22, to my department, and I, thirty four, had to train her. This woman had quite the reputation around our facility. Multiple guys had mysteriously disappeared from the company after working with her, with whispered break room stories about false reports and HR drama following in her wake. Her personnel file probably needed its own storage cabinet at this point. From day one, her behavior was off. At first, she was oddly shy around me, but that quickly evolved into something else entirely. As the days passed, she got increasingly flirtatious and super hands on. All touchy feely. She'd even mention how cute she thought I was and so on. I'll admit I did play along with her, but never in any kind of inappropriate way. She added me on social media and we swapped info since she'd mentioned wanting to hang out. So I guess one weekend she saw on social media that I'd gone to the park. When Monday rolled around, the atmosphere had shifted dramatically. She barely spoke to me, slammed equipment down, and gave me death glares across the clean room. Turns out she was mad that I didn't call her, which felt really immature and honestly just nuts. Especially since we never actually made any real plans or anything. A few Weeks later, that same flirty energy was still going strong. Then I ended up out sick for a few days with a nasty stomach bug. I couldn't keep anything down, not even water. So I stayed home.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

I had this one kid in my class whose IQ was probably a few points higher than Homer Simpsons. I found this on my first day when he took out a blender, then interrupted class to ask if anyone had any fruit so he could make a smoothie. That same day, I left the class for a minute to laminate something, and when I came back, he was at my desk eating my lunch. He said that he needed something to eat with his drink and thought it was out there for everyone to snack on. Two weeks later, during his first test, he wrote your name beside the write your name heading at the top. He was by far the worst performing student in the class because he was always on his phone, even during tests. Whenever he'd stay after school to catch up on work, he'd tell me he's always on his phone because he's making money. At the time, I just brushed it off and told him he still can't use it in class. But one day, in the middle of a test, he screamed, oh, my god! Yes! In one motion, he stood up and took off running to the bathroom, accidentally knocking down the girl who was in the chair beside him. He came back 10 minutes later, and I told him to stay behind after class. I asked him what that was. All about. And he went on to tell me that when he said he makes money on his phone during class, he wasn't lying. He then told me that he does that stock trading thing and said while checking his green and red arrows, I noticed one of his stocks boomed and made him a lot of money. I didn't believe a word, but then he showed me the proof. He opened an app called Bloom in front of me and showed me his portfolio. This kid who was genuinely failing Algebra 1, had made over $400 profit in a couple of months. He told me he started from zero and just use the rewards the app gives you to start. I was sort of interested by this and asked him if he could give me some tips to start myself. He replied, I don't really know what I'm doing. Just get bloom.

When I was in elementary school, my best friend was a girl named Raquel. And because I was a very anxious and shy kid, I let her walk all over me. I did her homework for her and gave her the treats out of my lunch. And in return, she'd throw me under the bus constantly. I remember people started rumors about me and my family, but instead of defending me, she laughed at me with them. The worst part was how the very next day, she'd come up to me acting like nothing happened, and then once again asked me to do her homework. We're best friends, and best friends do things for each other, she'd say. There was one time she began punching my arm for seemingly no reason, so I grabbed her hands to make her stop. She suddenly began crying loudly, and everyone came to her defense, including our teacher, who told me, why don't you back off? I think you did enough for today. I was kept alone in the classroom during lunchtime, and when everyone came back, there was a rumor that I had tried to choke her to death. I tried to tell everyone I just held onto her hands when she was punching me, but no one believed me. And there she was in the middle of the crowd, not saying a word, taking in all the love and attention from the Class. I somehow finally came to my senses when we were 8. She invited me for a sleepover at her place. We were watching Pirates of the Caribbean, fangirling over Johnny Depp, when at one point during the movie, she told me I could rest my head on her if I felt tired. I did just that towards the end of the movie, and she shrugged me off of her. I asked why she did that, and she said, I never said you could put your head on me. If you do this again, I'll stab you. I laughed awkwardly, thinking she was joking or something. She said, I'm serious. There's a knife in the kitchen I stole from my mom. It's under the fridge. If you touch me again, I'll unalive you.

When I was 12, I called CPS, but not to protect myself. I just been adopted by a couple who could never have their own kids. And they seem so nice. At first, they never yelled at me like my bio mom or dad did. They gave me ice cream just for existing. And they tucked me into bed with hot chocolate by my bedside every night. I was convinced any kid would be lucky to have them as parents. That's why when I found out they had miraculously gotten pregnant, I cheered. However, that's when things changed. It was like a switch. But not in the way they treated me, rather, in the way they treated him. My adoptive parents instantly became obsessed with Raising Jacob as this perfect and gifted child. They hung this huge chart in the kitchen marking every milestone the day they took him from the hospital. If Jacob didn't sit up, walk, or talk exactly when the internet said he should, they get this anxious look and start whispering to each other. By the time Jacob was nine months old, they were already making him do these daily flashcards. I watched from the hallway as my dad sighed heavily whenever Jacob got distracted or confused. It felt weird and uncomfortable, but I thought maybe they were just stressed out about being new parents. It got worse when Jacob turned 2. They signed him up For these advanced toddler classes, trying to teach him Latin on top of English at home, they spent hours drilling him on letters and numbers. If Jacob got something wrong, they tense up, their faces showing clear disappointment. Sometimes Jacob would cry at night. Instead of comforting him, they'd stand over his crib with their arms folded until he stopped. They said it would build character. I started noticing how anxious Jacob got all the time. He'd pick nervously at his fingers. His eyes always looked like he was waiting for someone to yell at him. One night after a preschool meeting, I heard his teacher mention that Jacob was struggling socially. On the drive home, my parents lectured Jacob non stop about embarrassing the family. He sat silently in his car seat, tears rolling down his cheeks. From that day, dinner became a nightmare. Jacob was no longer allowed to eat until he perfectly recited whatever they drilled him on that day.

I was 17 when my sister Lucy called me crying from school. She was 14 and had gotten her first period during gym class. She had no supplies and was too embarrassed to ask anyone at school. Lucy called me instead of our parents because I was only 10 minutes away while they were both at work. I rushed to the pharmacy and grabbed pads, tampons, and even some chocolate because I wasn't sure what she needed. Got to the school in eight minutes flat. Lucy was hiding behind the gym building, tears streaming down her face, trying to cover the stain on her shorts with her backpack. I met her at the side gate and handed her the bag through the fence. He thanked me and ran inside to the bathroom. I waited in my car to make sure she was okay, playing some music and texting my mom about what happened. Everything seemed fine, then I saw this older teacher walking toward my car. He looked angry and was talking on his phone. Within minutes, three more staff members surrounded my Honda as security guard knocked on my window and told me to step out immediately. The teacher said he witnessed me talking to a distressed female student behind the building. He claimed the girl looked scared and ran away after I gave her something. They asked for my ID and started questioning me about why I was On school property during class hours. I tried explaining that Lucy was my sister, but they weren't listening. The counselor said the student was too upset to talk and that my story didn't add up. They called the police. Before I could even get Lucy to come outside and verify who I was, two cops showed up and separated me from the school staff.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes when I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. David, I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before. I drove to my old elementary school playground and sat On the same swing where dad used to push me before work completely consumed his life. Before he became just a distant voice I sometimes heard. Coming home at 2:00am, something inside me finally broke that night. All the anger I'd bottled up for years spilled over at once. I pulled out my phone and texted him.

And in it she admitted she'd lied about who my real father was. My dad Trevor, had always been this gentle guy who worked nights at the factory and came home smelling like metal and machine oil. Mom would heat up his dinner plate at 2:00am when his shift ended. He'd kiss my forehead before I went to school, even when I pretended to be asleep. Normal dad stuff. But I always wondered why I looked nothing like him. I'm tall with dark hair and green eyes. Dad's short with blond hair and brown eyes. Mom always said I got lucky with the gene pool. That sometimes kids just look different. I believed her, because what kid questions that? When Grandma Rose died last month, she left me this speed up leather diary from 1987. I almost threw it away until I found the page with my name on it. She'd written about the night I was born. How mom was crying in the hospital room, begging grandma to never tell anyone the truth about who my real father was. Turns out my actual father is Mom's boss at the insurance office where she worked before I was born. His name is David Walsh. Grandma wrote that mom had an affair with him for six months when she got pregnant. He wanted nothing to do with it. He was married with two kids of his own. Mom was terrified and ashamed. So when Trevor asked her to marry him three months later, she said yes and never told him I wasn't his. I sat in my car outside Mom's house for an hour, holding that diary, trying to figure out what to say. When I finally went inside, she was folding laundry in the living room. I just put the diary on the coffee table and watched her face go white. She didn't even try to deny it. She just started crying and said she never wanted me to find out because Trevor had been such a good father to me. She begged me not to tell him because it would destroy him. The weird part was, I wasn't even angry at her. I was angry at this David guy who basically abandoned me before I was even born. So I looked him up online. He still works at the same insurance.

My client Nico was being sued for $50,000 by his ex business partner Tony, who claimed Nico stole their food truck secret sauce recipe and started a competing business. Tony had hired the most expensive, expensive law firm in town and was going for blood. Their partnership had ended badly six months earlier when Tony suddenly decided Nico wasn't contributing enough and forced him out with just 48 hours notice. Now Nico was running a single food truck while Tony expanded to three locations, and Tony wanted to crush any competition. The evidence look damming. Tony had screenshots of Nico's new menu featuring Nico's famous sauce, and bank records showing Nico bought identical ingredients and Marzano tomatoes, aged balsamic, specific herbs a week after their partnership ended. He even had photos of Nico's sauce bottles that looked nearly identical to theirs. He copied everything, Tony testified smugly, adjusting his expense of suit, the recipe, the marketing strategy, even the bottle design. I have the original recipe cards with my handwriting from 2019 when I spent months perfecting it through trial and error. Tony's lawyer presented a thick folder of evidence, handwritten notes, ingredient lists given customer feedback forms praising the innovative sauce. The judge seemed convinced, nodding along as Tony described his creative process. Nico looked completely defeated beside me. His hands were shaking as he watched his former partner lie under oath. This food truck was his only income. After he kicked him out and he couldn't afford to lose everything over a bogus lawsuit. When it was my turn to cross examine Tony, I kept it simple.

Screaming babies, drunk college kids, people holding bloody towels to their faces. We got there around 9:30.

My friends and family thought that it was part of the surprise, but seeing my reaction now, they weren't so sure. I felt devastated knowing that no one else was genuinely surprised. I spent the rest of the afternoon hold up in the room crying over emotions. I Couldn't control. Through the door, I heard my mother in law call me dramatic, saying that I should be happy she helped us out. My sadness turned into anger and I flung the door open to confront her. You do not get to decide whether I'm grateful for something or not. You also don't get to control what people should bring to our party.

They developed a family channel where cameras were in every room, scripts were taped to the fridge, and every holiday, every family dinner, every moment was filmed. Made us rehearse how to laugh, how to hug, how to cry. If you cried wrong, you did it again. And if you still made a mistake, they would pull out a small bottle of lemon juice and place two drops in each eye. So I Learned how to get it right the first time. People online called us perfect.

Mom practiced sad speeches in the mirror to start her day, while my dad made my brother refilm lines for brand deals at 4 in the morning, right before classes. They taught me how to smile and flirt with the camera. My parents controlled all of my meals. Keep being at just below 1,000 calories daily. It was really bad, but I was told that I had it good compared to everyone else. It wasn't until I turned 15 when my health collapsed that I started saying no. I refused a product because it gave me a rash so severe that I had to go to the hospital and take topical treatment for two weeks. Was the last time I smiled for a camera. I didn't set up myself. The day after I recovered, my parents set me up for another makeup brand, saying that it wouldn't give me a rash this time. I said no and hid in the bathroom. Before filming, my mom tried saying sweet and encouraging things through the stall door, but when it didn't work, she started kicking and violently pulling on the handle. She screamed out that I was being selfish and was just a stupid teenager who needed to learn how to listen to my parents. When she gave up, she filmed me crying in the stall, pretending to be a caring person by giving me space to control my emotions. Afterwards, she called me difficult and took my phone privileges away for a week. When I got it back, I started recording everything. I had clips of my mom feeding my brother spicy food to make him cry, my dad scream.

This generation is completely wack. I remember being 14 and still having braces and wearing ugly blue eyeshadow to school every day. But this was before social media, so all of my friends were just as ugly as me. But on my daughter's 15th birthday, we went out to Chili's, and what she wore was shocking. Not because it was anything crazy revealing. It was just a corset top and some cargo pants. It made me realize the pressure she had to grow up faster. She even did her makeup. And I swear, my baby Annalise looked 23 years old. And as we sat down, the waiter began to flirt with her. I wasn't really paying attention because I figured she'd turn him down or just act really shy. But in the corner of my eye, I saw her batting her eyes and looking up at him with a single finger twirling her hair. Motherly rage flooded my system. I literally saw the bulge in his pants. Hey, do you guys have a birthday candle with the No. 15? Because that's how old my daughter is turning today. Luckily, the guy went super red and started stammering, so I knew that he had simply been blindsided. And we even got switched to a new later. As for my daughter, I didn't want to ruin her birthday, so I let her change the topic, and we just Talked about something else. But when she woke up the next day, I asked her what the f she thought she was doing. That she could wear what she wanted, but there was no way I'd ever let her date anyone over the age of 17. We did that teenage angst thing where they pinch the bridge of their nose and roll their eyes like. It was the most original move in the book. So I grabbed her phone and unlocked it with her facial recognition. This time, something in her eyes changed. She begged me not to go through it. It was a good effort, but not good enough. I love you. And if you were a mother, you'd do the same thing. I then walked into my room and locked the door. There wasn't anything too bad. I did find what people call thirst traps on her TikTok, but her account was private and her following was mostly girls. The worrying part was her Instagram. There were bikini pictures plastered everywhere with extremely intimate songs and angles.

Jokes on you, I'll sit here till the end of time. It was the late 90s. I was still drowning in flannel and keeping up my lifelong habit of hoarding library books way past their due date. I had a paper to write for my sophomore global studies class, so, of course, I checked out more books than I could possibly get through, wrote the essay, then totally forgot about the stack gathering dust in the corner of my room. After a steady stream of overdue notices showing up in my homeroom, I finally returned the four or five books one sunny afternoon via the anonymous drop box during a study hall, then promptly moved on to bigger and better things. About two weeks later, I was called down to the assistant principal's office. In that space of time before classes officially started that was reserved for one thing and one thing only. The reprobates and delinquents were in trouble. I walked the halls thinking that surely this was just a timing mishap, and I was being summoned to receive congratulations for some kind of award I didn't know I had entered into competition for. Yep, he just wants to prepare me for the surprise ticker tape parade. I was wholly unprepared to hear that I was receiving lunch detention to start immediately, because I had not returned a single book that I still remember was slim and had a white and red cover from My G S. Paper research. I tried to argue that there was a mistake, since I was sure, like I am sure that I have fingertips, I had returned it, but he could not be moved, and I was sentenced to indefinite lunch detention until I either return the book or paid the 16 bucks to replace it. I left the office late for first period, defeated, but kept my head held high at lunch later that day, as I walked past the entirety of the cafeteria, which held a couple hundred of my peers, plastic food tray in hand, I went down the hall to the old shop classroom that had since been moved and the awaiting detention. I checked in with missus brown at her desk in front and took an inconspicuous seat in the back, staring down at my canned peach slices. I braced for the worst. A murderous ruckus was going to break out any minute, I could tell. But once my ears stopped ringing, I discovered that it was really a calm escape from the crowded and rowdy.

Here, let me show you something. I'm driving to work a few months ago. Almost there. Two turns left, maybe half a mile total. Just neighborhood streets, nothing fancy. This guy in a black BMW crawls up my ass and stays there. I can see him in my mirror, phone in one hand, making these angry faces at me like I personally ruined his morning. I speed up a bit. 5 over the limit. He gets closer. Now he's maybe two feet from my bumper, still checking his phone every few seconds. Real genius move there, buddy. Anyway, I take the first turn, and now I'm on the street where my building is probably about 600 yards ahead. The assholes still tailing me, riding just inches from my bumper, and clearly pissed that I'm still sticking to the speed limit. Maybe around 35 on this stretch. So I press the gas a bit and sure enough, he matches my speed. I drive an 8 year old Toyota truck. Not huge, not tiny, just a regular truck that's seen some shit. All terrain tires, decent suspension, and I've definitely treated it like a truck should be treated. Pastures, rocks, curbs. My baby's been through it all. So as I'm getting closer to my building, there's this big speed bump in the road meant to slow people down before they reach the parking garage entrances. I plants back and yep, assholes still glued to my bumper. I remember thinking, I've got to ease up for this speed bump, and then thinking again, if I hit the brakes, this guy's gonna plow right into me. That's when the plan starts to form in my head. And I hit the gas. I'm going about 45 when I hit that speed bump and Yeehaw! Caught a little air and came down hard. Never even touched the brakes. Didn't tap him once. Gave him absolutely no heads up for what was coming. I'm locked on my rearview mirror through the whole thing cause I wanted to catch his reaction. He's got his phone.

After what I saw today, I'm quitting my job for good. Most people think YouTube is just a website to watch cat videos or makeup tutorials, but behind closed doors, there are thousands of disturbing videos that never make the homepage. It's my job to make sure it stays that way. You would think after watching thousands of these gruesome videos, I would build some type of tolerance. But after what I just saw on a random channel, I'm convinced that I'm gonna die soon. The channel was called marbles, and it didn't have a profile picture or bio, but what it did have were four videos with creepy titles and weird thumbnails. When I first saw the videos, I couldn't make out what the thumbnails were because the images were too pixelated. Thought it'd just be another person uploading abuse videos or someone making staged content to shock people, but I was dead wrong. The first video was titled doggy, and all it showed was just footage of a sleeping dog. No violence, no audio, and literally nothing. I watched it five times to see what the problem was, but I couldn't find anything, so I reinstated the video and moved on to the next one. But that's when things got creepier, because this video was titled six PM and it showed a man walking through a forest. His breathing was off and the camera was shaky, but then out Of nowhere, the video cut to him standing still while he wore a mask and stared down at the camera. His eyes didn't blink, and it felt like he was staring straight into my soul. The third video was called clouds, and this time the camera was pointed down while someone was lying on the ground with their legs cut off. He was screaming in pain for the first 30 seconds, but just when I thought I saw it all, he stopped screaming completely, looked directly at the camera, and whispered something before the video went black. I couldn't tell what he said because he was too quiet, but that didn't matter. The video clearly violated the terms of service, so I immediately removed the video and decided to watch the last one. The fourth video was called Bad Day, and this time the first three minutes were just footage of a blank white wall. I thought it would be a repeat of the first video where nothing happened, but right as I was about to click off the same.

I'm now convinced I'm going to be dead tomorrow. I was just eating pizza a few nights ago when out of nowhere I got an email replying to my audio technician job listing on Craigslist. I was super excited to finally have some interest in my work, but when I saw that the pay was $100,000 for just three days of work, I was a bit skeptical. I thought this was just a fake email and was about to click off until I saw that there was an audio file attached underneath. We've listened to your samples and your sound processing skills are exactly what we're looking for. If you're interested in the job, please reply within 48 hours. Additionally, you will need to sign an NDA before you accept the position. After listening to the audio, I assumed I was just wrong about it being fake and decided I was willing to sign whatever I needed to. But the second I opened up the NDA to get some more details on the job, I found that one of the clauses said I would need to sign a waiver with a fine print saying that I might die. I had a bad feeling about it, but I only had 80 cents to my name and needed the money, so I signed it anyway. The moment I finished, I got an email from the company with an address under the text Come to this location tomorrow at 8:00am to start working with us. I didn't think much of it and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day, I put on a suit, wear my brand new Cologne, and started driving over to the location. But when I pulled into the parking lot, I knew something was off because there were no signs, no windows, and the location looked almost deserted. I figured I was probably just early, but the second I stepped inside the building, a super weird woman called Elizabeth came up to me, put me inside a creepy room, and said, you'll soon understand why we had you sign that death waiver. Was already regretting coming here, but it was too late. After a couple minutes passed by, she introduced me to this guy called Darren, who looked like he hadn't slept in like 20 years. Before I could even ask what the hell I was supposed to do, Darren pointed to a weird black box in the corner with a speaker and keyboard attached to it. That device can hear the dead. I immediately started laughing in his face and even glanced around for cameras, hoping all of this was just a

My wife Jenna has this thing where she's always late. Not just fashionably late, but, like, 30 to 45 minutes late to everything. Dinner with friends, movies, work meetings, family gatherings. You name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it. Started telling her events start an hour earlier than they actually do, but she caught on and now just shows up even later. Last month was the breaking point. We were supposed to meet my parents for my dad's birthday dinner at this nice restaurant. I told her we needed to leave by 6:30 to get there on time. At 7:15, she's still doing her makeup, telling me to chill out because they'll wait for us. He showed up at 8:20. My parents had already ordered appetizers and were halfway through their main course. My dad looked hurt, my mom was pissed, and I wanted to disappear. But two weeks ago, something happened that Jenna had been talking about for months. Her favorite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue. Downtown. She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats, and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone canceled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at 8 p m. On a Saturday. The venue was small.

Emma was frantically texting me links to normal name lists. Kyle's dad kept muttering Nebuchadnezzar under his breath like he was trying to practice saying it. For the next three weeks I got calls every single day. Janet would call with alternative suggestions like Theodore or Michael. Emma sent me a 47 item list of actually cute names that aren't completely insane. Even Kyle's normally quiet aunt called to tell me about a nice couple she knew who named their daughter brunhilda, and she got teased terribly in school. The best part was watching them try to be supportive while obviously dying inside at the grocery store. Janet introduced me to her friend as my daughter in law. Who's expecting little Bartholomew or brinhilda? The poor woman didn't know what to say. Kyle was having the time of his life. He'd randomly bring up baby preparations like I wonder if they make monogrammed blankets with a G for Gaylord, just to watch his family squirm. Finally, at 38 weeks, we had the gender reveal party. Everyone was there with their fake smiles, probably praying we'd announce some last minute name change. We cut into the blue cake and Kyle goes well, looks like we're having a little Bartholomew. Janet actually gasped. Emma looked like she was about to Cry. Even the neighbors who'd been invited were giving each other these worried looks. That's when I started laughing.

There are lines in life you don't cross. And when you do, you don't just break the law. You break people. For me, that line was drawn the day my sister's case went to court. She had been through hell, hurt in a way I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. She did everything right. Reported, gave statements, endured interviews, sat across from lawyers who asked her the most degrading questions you can imagine. She just wanted justice, um, recognition that what had been done to her mattered. I sat behind her in the courtroom, wearing the same suit I used for every hearing, notebook in hand. Not as a detective that day. Just a brother. Her attacker sat across the room, smug, relaxed, like he was at a casual lunch. Instead of facing charges for what he'd done. I kept staring at his hands, remembering how they'd shaken during questioning when I'd first confronted him off duty. That moment when you know someone's guilty, but they still think they can worm their way out. The trial wasn't long. Evidence lined up, witnesses were ready. The DA was confident. But when the judge walked in, I felt something I couldn't name. He wouldn't meet our eyes. Kept shuffling papers like he already hated being there. The DA made his opening statement clear and firm. Then came the defense, and it was pathetic. No alibi, no counterproof. Just character attacks and Cheap shots at my sister's credibility. But here's the thing. They didn't need a defense. Not when the judge himself was on their side. It started small. Objections overruled when they shouldn't have been. Evidence questioned that it had already been cleared for admissibility. The defense attorney practically smirking every time the judge leaned in their favor. Then the hammer blow. Halfway through testimony, my sister's voice trembling as she recounted the night everything changed, the judge actually cut her off. Said her words were too emotional to be considered reliable. He struck her testimony from the record. I felt my blood pressure spike. My fist clenched so tight, my nails dug into my palms. I wanted to shout.

Same booth in the corner, same hot chocolate with extra whipped cream. Same ritual of decompressing until my hands stopped shaking. The diner was dead quiet.

I own a small cafe in a college town. Not a chain, not fancy, just a cozy spot with good coffee, fresh pastries, and regulars I'll have their order started before they even reach the counter. Business was steady. Not booming, but enough to pay my barista as well and keep the lights on. Then out of nowhere, we started getting one star reviews. Not just any bad reviews. These were daily, always posted in the early morning, always detailed, and always personal. Coffee was lukewarm and the owner rolled her eyes when I asked for milk. The croissants are clearly frozen, not fresh baked. Owner talks too much to customers, slows down the line. None of it was true. We bake pastries at 4:00am every morning. My espresso machine hits 200 degrees like clockwork. And if I do talk to customers, it's because they're usually happy about it. I brushed off the first few, even replied politely offering to make things right. But they kept coming and they got nastier. She's rude, unprofessional, and probably microwaves the muffins. The weirdest part, the reviewer names were always different. The writing style was identical. Overly specific complaints, same sentence structure, same weird phrasing. Like coffee lacked robust notes. My rating dropped from 4.8 to 4.1 in under a month. In the cafe world, that's deadly. People really do skip over you for the place next door. If Your stars are lower. That's when I started digging. I created a fake Google account and responded to one of the fake reviews pretending to agree, just to see what would happen. Within an hour I got a private message from another customer account saying you should try Roast House instead. Much better coffee and service. This house, the other cafe three blocks away.

I've been driving ride share for six years. I've seen everything. Couples breaking up mid ride, people trying to eat spaghetti in the backseat, even a guy who brought a goat.

Five star passenger rating. Easy money, I think. I pull up and see him. Expensive suit, loosened tie, hair gel that could withstand a Hurricane. The kind of guy who calls waitresses sweetheart and tips with exposure. He stumbles toward my car, beer in hand. First red flag. Hey, buddy. I say, no open containers. He grins like I'm an adorable toddler. It's fine. I know people. Translation I'm about to be a pain in your ass. We get maybe three blocks before he starts making phone calls on speaker, loudly to people with names like Vince and Chad about closing the deal Monday. He keeps kicking the back of my seat like a bored five year old. Then out of nowhere, hey, driver, how much you make doing this? Like 40 grand. Pathetic. I keep it professional enough to pay the bills. That's when he leans forward, beer breath hot on my neck, and says, you're lucky to have me in your car. If I wanted to, I could Have your job by tomorrow. My company works with corporate for your app. Sure you do, champ. We're about two minutes from his address when he decides to really flex. You know what? I don't feel like paying tonight. Consider it a networking opportunity. You scratch my back, maybe I'll throw you some real work later. I smile in the rearview. You're saying you're refusing to pay for this ride? He laughs like it's the funniest thing he's ever heard. What are you gonna do, call the cops? I'll have them eating out of my hand before you can finish dialing. Here's the thing. I could call the cops, but I had something better. See, earlier that week, I driven his company's

I never thought I'd be that mom who cried at a Walmart checkout because her card got declined. But there I was last year, staring at a cart full of groceries I couldn't afford, while my 17 year old daughter, Anna, pretended not to notice the cashier's annoyed sigh. We'd been struggling since I lost my marketing job during the pandemic. Those unemployment checks barely covered rent, let alone everything else. Kept telling Anna everything would be fine, that I'd figure it out, but honestly, I was drowning. We started turning off heat in rooms we weren't using. I'd eat a sleeve of crackers for dinner and tell Anna I wasn't hungry. The pink envelope from the bank came on a Tuesday. Final notice. 30 days to pay or lose the house. I opened it in the kitchen and just collapsed right there on the linoleum floor, sobbing like a kid. I thought Anna was at school, but she'd come home early because she forgot her textbook. She found me there with that letter in my hands, hyperventilating. Mom, what's wrong? I tried to hide it, but she grabbed the paper and read it. Her face went completely white. How much do we owe? I couldn't even look at her. 43,000 back payments fee. He's everything. The next morning, Anna wasn't in her bed. Her backpack was gone, but her school clothes were still hanging in her closet. I called Her phone, like 20 times. Nothing. I was about to call the police when she finally texted back around noon. I'm fine at work. Talk tonight. Work. She worked part time at the grocery store on weekends. Maybe 15 hours total. What was she doing there on a Wednesday? When she came home that evening, she had this look on her face.

I run a barbecue food truck, and let me tell you, street vending is like the Wild West. No matter how good your brisket is, you're always one bad inspection away from losing everything. There's this one corner downtown that's gold. Heavy foot traffic, office workers at lunch, weekend festivals, you name it. The city only allows one truck there at a time, and you have to book it through their online permit system months in advance. It's first come, first served, and if you miss your day, too bad, you can't just swap in another truck without city approval. So I book my Friday slot three months ahead. I'm there early, set up smoker going, the works. Around 11 a m, another food truck rolls up. Bright neon paint job, giant Cartoon Taco plastered on the side. It's Taco titan, run by a guy named Vince. Vince jumps out in sunglasses and a leather jacket because apparently he's auditioning for Food Network's Douchebags in the wild. I'm taking this spot today. He says like it's a done deal. I laugh, thinking he's joking. Uh, no. I've got the permit. You can check with the city. He smirks. Oh, I don't need to check. See, your truck's a Dinosaur. I'm bringing in something fresh, Instagram worthy. People want tacos? Cool. I say you can give them tacos somewhere you're actually booked. Then he drops it. I've been parking here for Years without a permit. They never check. And you know what? If you call the city, I'll just tell them you invited me. Now, I'm a reasonable guy, but this is my living. My smoker takes four hours to get to 10. Moving is not an option. So I tell him straight, if you park here without a permit, that's on you. He parks anyway, right in front of my truck, like, literally blocking half my signage. At first I'm pissed, but then I remember something. Fridays are when the city inspector does his random rounds downtown. They check permits, sanitation and fire safety. And the inspector, he's a no BS kind.

When I was 16, I lied on a job application and said I was 18 so I could clean these massive vacation houses in Aspen. My mom had died three months before from diabetes complications because we couldn't afford her insulin consistently. I was living with my aunt, who worked double shifts at a gas station just to keep our tiny apartment. These houses I cleaned were insane. Like bathrooms bigger than our entire place, with marble everything. And those fancy toilets that cost more than my aunt made in six months. I'd scrub these pristine kitchens that probably got used twice during their whole vacation. One Thursday afternoon, I was mopping the hallway in this ridiculous mansion when I heard screaming from upstairs. This 14 year old girl named Sienna was having a complete meltdown at her dad because he wouldn't buy her a second iPhone just for making TikToks. She already had the newest model, but apparently she needed a separate one for content creation. I tried to keep working, but then I heard her yell something that made my blood freeze. She screamed at her dad, if you're gonna be so annoying about money, why don't you just divorce mom and marry someone richer instead? I gripped that mop handle so tight, my knuckles went white. My mom had died on the same couch I slept on every night. We'd eaten ramen for Dinner probably 300 days that year. See, Sienna stormed out of the room and saw me standing there in the hallway. She rolled her eyes and said, uh, I hate when the help just stands around doing nothing. I wanted to say something, but I needed this job desperately, so I just kept mopping and pretended I didn't hear anything. Later, I was cleaning their kitchen when Sienna came in, talking to her friend on speaker phone. She was still ranting about the phone situation, saying stuff like, my dad is literally so cheap.

My daughter Rosie was six when she started limping around the house. At first I thought maybe she twisted her ankle at the playground or something. Kids are always falling and getting bruised up, right? But then she started crying about her legs hurting, especially at night. She'd wake me up at 2:00am, sobbing that her bones felt like they were on fire. I'd give her some children's Tylenol and rub her legs until she fell back asleep. This. This went on for about a week before I decided to take her to our pediatrician. Doctor Mitchell had been our family doctor for three years. He was this older guy who always seemed rushed, like he had somewhere more important to be. When I brought Rosie in, he barely looked at her for five minutes before giving his diagnosis. Well, she's carrying some extra weight, he said, looking at her chart. Kids her age should be running around more. Put her on a diet and try getting her outside more often. The leg pain is probably just from the extra strain. I stared at him. Sure, Rosie was a little chubby, but she was active. She rode her bike every day and loved playing at the park. But Doctor Mitchell was already writing something in her file and moving toward the door. But she's crying in pain every night, I said. She can barely Walk some mornings. He turned back with this annoyed look. Kids exaggerate. She's probably trying to get attention or avoid school. Just stick to the diet plan. I left feeling confused, but figured maybe he knew something I didn't. So I started packing healthier lunches for Rosie and taking her to the park every single day after school. But nothing changed. If anything, she got worse. Two weeks later, Rosie couldn't even get out of bed without help. Her little face was so pale, and she kept saying her legs felt heavy. I called Doctor Mitchell's office and managed to get another appointment. This time he seemed even more irritated when I walked in. He didn't

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming. And they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I've been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off and college was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash.

The kid can roast me in Mario Kart and crack one liners that make my mom choke on her coffee. This year, all he wanted for his birthday was to go to the big shopping mall downtown. The one with the massive food court, arcade, and the store that sells those custom sneakers he's obsessed with. We've been planning it for weeks, saved up to buy him a pair. Mom took the day off work. Even the weather seemed like it was cooperating. We got there around noon, Ethan in his wheelchair with a brand new Marvel hoodie, beaming like it was Christmas morning. He spotted a balloon stand near the entrance, and the vendor tied one to the armrest of his chair. It floated above him like a little red exclamation Mark. We spent the first hour just browsing, Ethan pointing out things he wanted to totally buy when he's rich, me joking that he'd better remember his big brother when that happened. Eventually, we headed to the sneaker store. Ethan had been talking about this moment for months. He rolled right up to the display, ran his hand over the shoes, and looked at me like, is this real life? That's When it happened, out of nowhere, this guy in a mall manager badge strides over. Tall, late 40s, perfect hair, gel helmet. He stops a few feet from us and says loudly, sir, you can't just roll in here and block the displays. I thought he was joking. Ethan was completely in the clear, nowhere near blocking anyone. I said, he's just looking at the shoes. The manager gives me this fake customer service smile and says, I understand, but maybe you could take him somewhere more suitable. We don't want accidents. I felt my stomach drop. Ethan smile vanished. People around us turned to look. My mom froze midstep, gripping the handles of Ethan's chair. The manager laughed, an actual chuckle, and added, besides, this is a busy store. Someone might trip over him. Trip over him? Like my brother was an obstacle? Ethan's

Uncle Henry banned all technology from his house the day we moved in. I was 16 when the plane went down over the Atlantic with both our parents inside. Noah was only 13 and barely spoke for the first three months after the crash. Uncle Henry was Dad's older brother who lived alone in this massive house in the mountains, completely off the grid except for one landline he kept for emergencies. He'd been preparing for the collapse of civilization for 20 years, stockpiling food and ammunition while ranting about government surveillance and mind control through Wi Fi signals. The social workers thought it was perfect that we had family willing to take us, never bothering to check if Uncle Henry was actually equipped to raise two traumatized teenagers. The technology band was absolute and immediate. Uncle Henry went through our suitcases that first night, confiscating our phones, Noah's Nintendo Switch, my laptop, even the smartwatch mom had given me for my birthday. He locked everything in a metal safe in his basement, saying we needed to detox from the digital poison that was rotting our generation's brains. He actually believed that cell towers were transmitting thoughts into people's heads and that social media was a government program to catalog citizens for future imprisonment. The only electronics he allowed were an ancient radio that only got three stations and an emergency landline that barely worked half the time. At first, I Thought Noah was handling it better than me because he'd always been the quiet one. He went to his new school without complaining, did his homework by candlelight when Uncle Henry decided electricity usage needed to be minimal, and ate the weird survivalist meals without comment. But after six months, I started noticing things that terrified me. Noah was wearing long sleeves in summer, spending hours locked in the bathroom. And I found him sitting on the roof at three in the morning, just staring at the sky. When I tried to talk to him about mom and dad, he just say they were lucky they didn't have to live through what came after. I found the cuts on his arms when I walked in on him changing after he thought I left for school. They were deliberate, organized parallel lines from his wrist to his elbow, like he was keeping track of something. I begged him to talk to me, but he just pulled his sleeve down and said there was no point.

My brother had said the same. Even my mom had accused my dad of misplacing cash from her purse. My dad finally asked Preston, are you serious? Preston nodded, dead eyed. Then he explained his system. While we were cooking, watching football, or cleaning up dinner, he'd sneak into bedrooms, take cash from wallets, purses, even my grandmother's coin jar back when she was alive. Then he'd drive to the casino on his way home, convinced he'd win big and surprise us all by paying for next year's Christmas. The room detonated. My mom shouted about all the time she thought my dad had lost grocery money. My brother realized why his savings jar was always light. My dad sat there calculating eight years of stolen cash in his head and looking like he was about to explode. We demanded to know if he'd ever actually won. Preston admitted he'd lost every single dollar. Thousands of our dollars vanished into slot machines. He insisted it wasn't theft, it was an investment strategy. That's when my dad stood up so fast his chair toppled backward. Preston immediately started inching toward the door, babbling about how we did understand his entrepreneurial vision. He grabbed his coat mid sentence, muttered something about next year will be different, and basically fled the house. We later added it up. He'd skimmed almost $4,000 from us over the years. The casinos had been getting rich off Our holiday gatherings. While we all thought we were just forgetful with cash, now we keep our wallets locked up every Christmas. And Preston? He hasn't shown his face since. Which is probably for the best, because if he ever does walk back through that door, my dad's still got the running total in his head, and it's going up with interest.

His mouth opened and closed like he was choking. This isn't how he stammered. Isn't this the official employee handbook we all signed? I smiled. Would you like to see my documentation of industry timeline standards? He stormed into his office without another word. Two hours later, HR called an emergency meeting. Derek sat there sweating while I presented my case. That same afternoon, I found another beautiful clause buried in the handbook. Managers found in violation of reasonable workplace policies face immediate performance review by end of week. Derek's boss called me personally. We've reviewed your timeline assessments, and they're completely accurate. Derek has been violating company policy for months. She paused, then continued with obvious respect, in five years, no one's ever actually cited the handbook like this. Congratulations. You found a legitimate loophole. Derek became obsessed with finding ways to write me up for other violations. One day, he tried citing me for excessive bathroom breaks, six minutes total. Another time for inefficient email communication because I use bullet points instead of paragraphs. HR tried a different approach. They offered me Derek's position if I'd agree to mentor him through Improved management practices. When I declined, they offered a 20% raise and full remote work. The desperation was beautiful. During my performance review, HR handed me an updated handbook personally. The new project timeline requirements were highlighted in bright yellow with Derek's signature. Checkmate. By the next quarter, Derek had been transferred to a different department. I got my Japan vacation, my bonus, and a reputation as the guy who actually reads company policies. Sometimes the best way to beat the system is to use the system's own rules against itself.

My job had this ridiculous policy where you couldn't take vacation days if any project was behind schedule. Missing deadlines meant losing your bonus completely. I've been saving up for a two week trip to Japan for over a year, but my manager Derek kept assigning me impossible deadlines right before my planned vacation. Derek was basically a micromanager on steroids. This guy would literally schedule meetings at four fifty five PM on Fridays. Just to show he was dedicated. He kept a spreadsheet tracking everyone's productivity. It already cost three people their bonuses that year. Everyone hated him, but everyone needed their jobs more. After he assigned me an urgent project due the day before my vacation, he smirked and said, Guess Japan will have to wait until next year, buddy. I was furious that night. Instead of working on his impossible project, I. It's something no employee ever does. I actually read our employee handbook. All 47 mind numbing pages of it. At midnight, exhausted and frustrated. I found gold buried in Section 12.3. For purposes of project deadline policies, work assignments must be distributed with reasonable timeline expectations based on standard industry practices. I nearly jumped out of my chair. The policy specifically required reasonable timelines, but Derek was assigning two week projects with three day deadlines. By their own definition, his assignments weren't valid at all. The next morning, I set the trap. I Submitted a formal timeline assessment for Derek's project. Copied HR and his boss. I documented that the project required minimum 10 business days based on industry standards, but I've been given three. I requested either additional resources or timeline adjustment per company policy Section 12.3. Derek didn't even try to hide his anger. This project is Wednesday. No exceptions. He was already typing furiously. You can explain to corporate why you missed deadline and lost your bonus. I smiled calmly, then pulled out my highlighted handbook. Actually, there have been zero valid project assignments this quarter under current company policy. His typing froze mid sentence. What?

Missus Malik, Leo physically assaulted another student today. Our zero tolerance policy. It's automatic suspension with possible expulsion pending review. I was genuinely shocked. In 16 years, Leo has never been in a fight. He's the kid who rescues instead of squashing them. The boy who gave up his movie seat so a family could sit together.

Yet. Before we discuss consequences, the school counselor, m's patella, interrupted. There's context you should see. She slid a phone across the desk. The security cameras captured everything. The video showed Carter and two teammates crowding around a freshman girl named Nina by her locker. She was clearly uncomfortable, shoulders hunched, pressing herself against the wall as Carter leaned closer, whispering something that made his friends laugh. When she tried stepping around them, Carter grabbed her wrist. That's when Leo appeared, stepping between them. I could read his lips. Let her go! Carter's Face transformed from amused to angry. He shoved Leo hard. Mind your business, nobody. According to Miss Patel's narration, Leo didn't shove back. He just positioned himself between Carter and Nina.

He was incredibly rude to every staff member who approached our table. But the absolute worst part started during the main course. Sunny began getting increasingly aggressive. Whenever I disagreed with literally anything he said, his voice kept getting louder and other diners were starting to stare.

I really felt like I connected with my subject. that's interesting, because technically, I just got reverse prank called. There was dead silence, and I could hear them processing what just happened. They said, wait, you're not actually conducting research? I said, nope, but congratulations, you just spent 20 minutes teaching.

So my mom borrowed my laptop the other day to check her emails, and in doing so she stumbled across the folder. The folder is an absolutely massive couple thousand page long document that contains Wikipedia like profile descriptions of my entire family. I've been crafting it for over a decade now and it's finally come out now. Gotta be clear, I didn't mean for her to find it, but in retrospect, naming the folder family lore highly confidential was probably a bad call. Anyway. The first thing she did when she found it was walk back into my room and spin the screen around so I could see that she had found it. At first my stomach absolutely dropped, but then my mom hit me with a deadpan stare saying, so since when am I a former milkshake enthusiast turned reluctant bird watcher? I completely froze. Not because she found the document, not because she read it, but because that is what she pulled out of all the chaos in there. See, this file was comprehensive. I'm talking everything from her shoe size in 1997 to the exact date that that one time she screamed at a squirrel for ruining the vibe. It's all in there. Cross referenced, hyperlinked, footnoted. There's even a controversy section formatted exactly like Wikipedia's details. The infamous Tupperware incident of 2,012 where She blamed me for losing the lid to her favorite container when in fact, she left it on the grill during a barbecue. She asked me to explain to her what this was, but I couldn't even bring myself to respond. And so naturally, she just.

I picked up my grandma's phone call, and all I heard was crying. Not regular crying, but that broken kind of crying that old people do when they feel completely helpless. She was sitting in her car outside McDonald's trying to explain what happened. All she wanted was a small black coffee. That's it. One dollar and nine cents worth of coffee that she'd been ordering the same way for 20 years since Grandpa died. But the kids working there had other plans. She said when she walked up to the counter, this teenage girl with pink hair just kept looking at her phone. My grandma stood there for five minutes before someone even acknowledged her. When she finally ordered her coffee, the girl rolled her eyes and rang up a large caramel Frappuccino instead. Grandma tried to correct her politely. The girl called over her manager, who was maybe 19 years old, with a face full of acne and an attitude bigger than the restaurant. He told my grandma she was confused and needed to speak up. She repeated her order louder and clearer. Small black coffee. They gave her a Coke. When she went back to the counter to explain the mistake, a different worker started filming her with his phone. He was laughing and saying something about another Karen video for Tik. My 80 year old grandma, who still writes thank you cards and calls everyone, sweetie didn't Even know what TikTok was? She asked one more time for her coffee. They gave her chocolate milk. By this point, three employees were gathered around, filming and laughing. One of them actually said, come on, lady, just crash out already so we can go viral. They wanted her to lose it. They wanted her to scream so they could post it online and make fun of the crazy old lady who couldn't handle a wrong order. Instead, she just started crying and left.

I start going to this 24 hour diner at like 2:00am because I literally cannot sleep. It's one of those old school places with cracked vinyl booths and fluorescent lights that make everyone look dead. First night, I order coffee and pancakes and just sit there scrolling through my ex's Instagram like the masochist I am. The waitress, this woman in her 50s with kind eyes, just keeps refilling my coffee without saying anything. Second night, same thing. Third night, she finally asks, rough patch, honey? I nod and try not to cry into my syrup. By the end of week two, I'm there every single night at exactly 2:00am. Same booth, same order, same pathetic scrolling routine. That's when she sits down across from me. Alright, sweetie, you've been here 14 nights straight crying into pancakes. What's his name? And I just break. I tell her everything. How he cheated, how he moved in with her immediately, how all our mutual friends picked. She listens to every word while bringing me free pie. The next night, she introduces me to the cook. Hank, this is Pancake Girl. She's having serious boy troubles. Hank, this massive guy with tattoo sleeves, looks at me and Goes. What kind of idiot breaks a heart like that? Then he makes me these incredible chocolate chip pancakes shaped like a heart. Soon, the whole night shift knows my business. There's Madison, the other waitress, who gives me brutal but honest dating advice. Cameron, the dishwasher, who barely speaks English, but always pats my shoulder and says, no cry, Mija. Even the manager, Frederick, starts checking on me. They give me a nickname, pan.

My teenage son kept bragging about how he could outeat anyone. Every dinner came with the same speech about his legendary stomach. What Logan didn't know was that I grew up with four brothers in a house where food disappeared faster than Halloween candy. His boasting amused me until his 16th birthday party. I'd spent all morning grilling burgers for his friends when I overheard him telling everyone, my dad thinks he's some grill master, but wait till you see me crush these burgers. His friends laughed. I didn't. After the party, while cleaning up, I casually mentioned the local diner's burger challenge. Finish their 5 pound monster in 30 minutes. It free. Plus your photo on the wall. I could destroy that challenge, Logan said without looking up from his phone. Twenty bucks says you can't. He finally looked up. Only 20? Weak, dad. Fine. If you win, I'll let you take my vintage Mustang to prom. The car was my pride and joy, a 1967 fastback that I'd restored myself over five long years. Same car I proposed to his mother in. Logan nearly dropped his phone. For real. You never let anyone drive it. And if you lose, I continued, you have to come to work with me every Saturday this summer. No video games, no sleeping in. Just learning what real work looks like. I own a construction company. Logan had been avoiding real labor. Like it was homework. His mother thought I was being too hard on him, but I knew he needed to learn some grit. Deal, he said instantly, sticking out his hand. We shook on it, and I saw a flicker of doubt in his eyes, but it vanished just as quickly. That Friday, we walked into Geek Big Joe's Smokehouse. The place was packed with the usual crowd of truckers and locals. Conversations hushed when we approached the counter. The burger challenge was legendary in our small town. The

I just found out the horrifying reason. Ever since I was 9 years old, my dad would go into the living room at exactly 11:05 p m. Every single night and put a tape in his old Panasonic. He wouldn't talk, blink, or even eat dinner until the tape was finished. But to make things even more strange, he would always tell me to never watch the tape or to disturb him while he was watching it. I used to think it was something inappropriate, like cornhub. So one night when everyone was sleeping, I snuck into the living room to check the tape and found that it wasn't anything. All the footage showed was some random static for a full hour. I decided to just head back to sleep and didn't think much of it. And for the next 12 years, he never missed a single night. Not on holidays, not when he was sick, and not even when he broke both of his ribs. Every night he would go on the couch and watch the tape like his life depended on it. And I'm starting to think it did because of what happened last night. I was just playing with my meat while my mom was making dinner when we heard my dad yelling for help in the shower. We immediately rushed over to him and took him to the ER. But the Whole ride there. He kept pointing at his watch, which read 10:30. I assumed he was just worried about missing his little tape and just told him that it was okay to miss one day. But after 15 minutes in the ER, the doctors told us that he needed to stay overnight for some blood work. So we told the doctor that we'd come tomorrow and went back home. By the time we arrived back home, it was already 11:15. So I told my mom good night, and she went upstairs into her bedroom. But right as I was getting into mine, I saw the tape sitting right next to the TV. It was already half ejected into the Panasonic. So I went over to take it out when I heard some scraping in the hallway. It sounded like nails were dragging across the car. And when I looked around to see what it was, nothing was there. I thought I was just hearing thing. But the second I turned back around to take the tape out, the TV turned on by itself. But this time, the video wasn't static. It showed a creature walking through a long hallway. What made it even more creepy was the fact that the house layout looked identical to mine. I just stared at the screen, praying that this creature was gonna vanish.

What's the darkest thing you've ever seen? During that time, I was extremely skinny and constantly hungry. I had finally saved up enough change to buy myself a sit down meal at this small diner on the corner, something I hadn't done in months. The smell alone was overwhelming, like fresh toast and eggs. And warm. I walked in and barely made it three steps before the owner came storming over. He didn't even ask what I wanted. He just told me to leave. Said he didn't want me scaring the other customers off or making anyone uncomfortable. His voice was loud enough that everyone turned to look at me. Some of them even nodded along with him. I didn't argue. I was used to this. So I went back outside and sat down on the curb, trying not to let it get to me. About 10 minutes later, this very well dressed woman walked by with a small group of people. He was wearing this expensive coat and heels that probably cost more than I'd made in a year. As they passed, she stopped and handed me a folded hundred dollar Bill. I couldn't believe it. For a second. I thought it was fake, but it was real. I looked up at her, stunned, and the people she was with praised her for being so kind. I thanked her about a dozen times and she smiled and told me to stay safe as they walked off. I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. Hope. That money meant I could get a motel room for a couple night, maybe even a hot shower and a proper bed. But about 30 minutes later, she came back alone. She stormed up to me, all that warmth gone from her face. She held out her hand and demanded the money back. Said she needed it, that she hadn't meant to give me that much. Tried to reason with her, but she didn't want to hear it. She kept saying I had no right to her generosity, that I should be grateful. She even looked at me. I hesitated, but I handed the Bill back. Then she kicked over my cup of coins, scattering everything I had on the sidewalk. I asked her why she was doing this, why she was being so cruel. She looked down at me with disgust and said people like me were what's wrong with the country. That she only gave me the money to look good in front of her clients.

At family dinners, everyone talked about their private jet gets a million dollar watches, while I sat there in my twenty dollar target shirt, feeling like an alien who'd crash their party.

He was going to offer me money to leave his daughter alone. Instead, he asked about my work. I started talking about fixing cars, expecting him to be bored, but his eyes lit up. Turned out, before his success, he'd worked as a mechanic too. For the next two hours, we talked about engines and restoration projects. As I was leaving, he said something I'll never forget. You know why I like you? Everyone in this house asks me about my money. You're the only one who talks to me like I'm just another guy who loves cars. A month later, he helped me open my own auto shop. Not because I asked, because we share the same passion. Now I run the most successful luxury car Restoration business in the state.

I met the children again after briefly meeting them in the morning and asked what extracurricular activities they needed me to drop them off to. I know for a fact that wealthy families always enroll their kids in spin classes, music lessons, and foreign language classes. I'd probably be tracked down if I revealed how much money goes into those classes. These parents usually make sure their kids receive an education. You Definitely can't afford. You can imagine my surprise when the wealthiest 16 year olds in America told me, we don't have any extracurriculars. We study at home. After eating dinner, they disappeared into their rooms and stayed there the whole day. Before I left, I asked their father why he didn't enroll his kids in any extracurricular classes.

The judge ordered supervised visits that same day. Three years passed before Kelsey made her final move. She decided at 17 that she wanted to drop out of school completely. I told her education wasn't optional in our family. Two days later, police arrested me at work. She had filed a report claiming years of psychological torture and food withholding. She said I stole from her grandmother's education trust fund. Then she told the detective, he gets weird when he drinks. He comes into my room at night and sits on my bed. I haven't touched alcohol since my brother died from liver failure. I sat in that jail cell and realized she would never stop escalating. The system believed her tears every single time. Something cold settled in my chest. I stopped feeling hurt and started thinking clearly. If she wanted freedom from me, she would get it. The charges were dropped for lack of evidence after three days. I hired a new lawyer.

This whole thing started after I got promoted to senior developer last month. I had been dealing with imposter syndrome for years, and one thing that really helped me was rubber ducky bugging, which is this programming thing where you explain your code to a rubber duck, and it helps you figure out problems. Every time I fixed a big coding issue, I bought myself a new duck to celebrate. And I had five of them sitting in this rainbow arc on my desk self. There was a yellow one from fixing my first major bug, a green one from when I saved the server from crashing, a blue one from solving that database issue, a red one from speeding up our main program, and a purple one from the project that got me promoted.

His face was pale despite the summer heat, and he was staring at my back with genuine horror. What? I stopped mid dial because something in his voice made me realize this wasn't what I thought. Don't move! He pulled out a whistle and blew it three sharp times. Teenage lifeguard came running over. Within seconds, the man pointed at my back and the lifeguard's eyes went wide. He immediately started yelling for everyone to get out of the lake. Families were grabbing their kids and rushing toward the parking lot. People were looking at me like I had the plague. Ma'am, I need you to stay completely still, the lifeguard said in this forced, calm voice. Parker, get Brooke over here now! Another lifeguard jogged over, took one look at my back, and immediately threw up in the sand. What a sissy. Now I was really freaking out what the hell was on me that was making people freak out like this? I tried To turn my head to see. But both lifeguards yelled at me not to move. Is it a spider? A snake? What's on me? My voice was getting higher with each word. The first man who'd approached me was standing a safe distance away. Now I saw them when you sat up to adjust your towel. I've seen this once before, when I was stationed at a lake in Minnesota. We need professionals. The lifeguards were on their radios calling for paramedics.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious. I have a boyfriend, mom, and dad like him. He helps me at school. I felt grateful hearing her sound happy about normal teenage things. But when I came home two years later for her graduation, I realized she was living anything but a normal.

When I was in secondary school, which is basically high school for you Yankee Doodle dandies, I was 13. I was stuck in that awkward phase of life where everything about you keeps shifting. One of those changes was the increasing amount of gas my body produced. Thanks to the endless stream of curries and chilies, my family regularly cooked cheap and convenient meals. Plus, despite being as English as Paddington Bear, we loved spicy food. In French class, I kept clashing with our petty teacher, missus F. She handed out detentions like candy. Sure, it made sense for kids who chatted or skipped homework, but me? I was a decent student, polite and respectful. Still, if I accidentally let one slip and someone made a fuss, that alone earned me detention. I tried everything to dodge her wrath, sitting by an open window, even pleading with my parents for less gassy meals. But the detentions kept coming without any clear reason. This school didn't have to justify them, and the teacher certainly didn't. I kept it quiet for a while. Both my parents worked late anyway, and I didn't think they could do much. That is, until I landed in detention on my 14th birthday. My parents always made a big deal out of it since it was close to Christmas. A day just for me, with any dinner and whatever I wanted all night long. Now, this detention was scheduled to last for two hours, so there was no way I was getting home before mom and dad did. They were pissed when they found out that for nearly two months straight, I been losing break times, lunch times, and hours of my home life to this woman's insanity in her efforts to get me to stop farting. Now, my dad was home after my mom every day, and he asked my brother where my mom and I were, as my mother had come to get me after calling the school to find out I was in after school detention. She was, after all, planning to be ready to take us all out for a paid reservation at an Italian restaurant. As my favorite food is

When the judge saw me walk into the courtroom, he gave me an old brother face because he knew that this case was rigged. I walked into that courtroom knowing the Lozano family had already paid everyone to go against me. Their son sunny was pathetically sitting there in a wheelchair he didn't need, with bandages wrapped around his head like a kid who just discovered toilet paper. His parents sat behind him in Gucci suits that probably cost more than my car.

I could literally smell his breath from across the yard. It's not hard to recognize whose breath smells like sweaty raccoons. The girl looked terrified, and nobody else was doing anything about it. He kept touching the girl's hair and telling her she was playing hard to get, while she was fake laughing and begging him to leave her alone. When she tried to duck under his arm, he grabbed her wrist. That's when I decided to step in, still not even knowing this Guy wipes his ah with hundred dollar bills. I approached them calmly and asked if everything was okay. The girl immediately said no and tried to move toward me. Sunny turned around along with his yellow teeth and told me to mind my own business. I suggested maybe he should get some water and cool off. That's when his face turned red like a tomato and he started screaming about how nobody tells him, a grown ah man, what to do. The situation escalated faster than I expected. His acidic spit was hitting my cheek while he ranted about how his dad would destroy me. I kept my hands at my sides and told him to just walk away. The girl had moved behind me at this point and I could feel her shaking. Then sunny swung at me. His drunk fist connected with my and my lights went out for a second. Pure instinct kicked in and I pushed him away from me. It wasn't even hard, it was more like a flick. But sunny was so wasted he stumbled backward over a garden hose that was lying on the ground.

I pointed at the screen where Blake was now shirtless, making breakfast. Entire studio went silent. 25 girls in coordinating workout sets just staring.

Someone else had tissues, the good ones with lotion. Another girl was already fixing my mascara with her emergency makeup kit. Four years! Natalie shrieked.

Are you being effing for real right now? I turned on Facetime and showed myself crying my eyes out. And that's when she started shouting, I'm getting my mom and we're coming right now! Don't effing move! She hung up, and I just stared at my phone like, okay, Ellie kinda ate. Oh, this is about to be good. Someone whispered.

When I took her to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for our third date, she panicked looking at the menu prices and whispered that maybe we should go somewhere cheaper. I grew up with wealth, but Paula grew up sharing a two bedroom apartment with her mom and three siblings. She worked two jobs through high school just to help with bills. The first time I picked her up in my B M W, she joked that my car cost more than her entire childhood home. Early in our relationship, she'd get nervous when I wanted to treat her to nice things. She'd insist on using coupons at restaurants or suggest we just get coffee instead of dinner. One time, I surprised her with a three hundred dollar coat she'd been eyeing. She cried and tried to make me return it, saying it was too expensive. Things got tense when I invited her to my parents annual Christmas party. She spent weeks stressing about what to wear, finally settling on a dress from target that she got on clearance. When we arrived, my mom greeted us wearing head to toe Gucci. Paula squeezed my hand so tight I thought she might break it. During dinner, my dad casually mentioned buying a new vacation home in Aspen. Paula nearly choked on her wine. Later, she overheard my Aunt asking my mom if I was really serious about dating someone from that background. My mom just sighed and said she hoped it was just a phase. Paula ran to the bathroom crying. When I found her, she said maybe we were too different and should break up. That's when I knew I had to show her what really mattered to me. The next day, I sold my BMW.

His dad owned half the city's commercial real estate. The penthouse alone was worth 10 years of my salary. Every mutual friend suddenly had plans. When I called, my best man admitted we. We all saw this coming. That destroyed me more than anything. But here's what nobody expected. I channeled every ounce of humiliation into the LSAT and scored 99th percentile. Got into law school with a full ride. Three years of pure rage fueled studying. Slept four hours a night, memorized every case about hidden assets. Morrison and Associates recruited me because I'd become obsessed with one thing. Learning exactly how rich people hide money during divorces. My professors called it unhealthy. I called it motivation. While I was becoming their best forensic analyst, Nate was buying Vanessa a yoga studio. They got married in Bali. The wedding cost more than my entire education. Instagram showed me everything. Private jets, designer everything. A life I could never give her. But I knew something they didn't. Rich people always betray each other eventually. Four years later, I heard her voice outside my office. My boss was saying, our best

The first time my lunch disappeared, I figured it was an honest mistake. The second time, a coincidence. By the fifth time, it was unmistakably theft. My homemade Italian sandwiches, carefully packed salads, leftover pasta, all vanishing from the company fridge, despite clear labels with my name, Alex Marino, do not eat. I tried everything. Labelled containers with red warning stickers, used an insulated bag, even left passive aggressive notes in the breakroom. Nothing worked. HR was useless. Without proof, we can't accuse anyone. Security cameras, privacy concerns, and common areas. They suggested I keep my lunch at my desk. Why should I adapt to a thief? One Tuesday, I added a small camera to my desk plant angled toward the breakroom door. By Wednesday afternoon, I had my culprit, Derek Williams, Marketing Director, one pay grade above me, friend of the CEO, on camera. He casually strolled in at 12:15, opened the fridge, scanned its contents, then deliberately selected my container. No hesitation, no confusion. He even smirked slightly before walking out with my chicken pesto sandwich. Confronting him directly seemed risky. Outranked me. And office politics at Patterson and Burke heavily favored management. Filing another HR complaint would lead nowhere. I needed something more memorable. My opportunity came with the announcement of the annual holiday party theme. Patterson Burke Family Feast, a potluck where executives would judge dishes in various categories. Got a five hundred dollar gift card and company wide recognition. Derek, according to office gossip, prided himself on his culinary expertise. He won the appetizer category three years running with his secret family recipe. Buffalo Chicken Dip. Perfect. For the next two weeks I let him take my lunch without complaint. Each meal more tempting than the last. Aromatic curry. Gourmet.

At my school, it was Marcus Chen. Everyone just knew he was going to make it big someday. He was the kind of guy people pointed to and said, that one, he's going places. Captain of the basketball team, straight A student, and somehow still the most grounded, humble person you'd ever meet. But what made Marcus legendary wasn't just his skills on the court. It was how he treated people. He wasn't just admired, he was respected. Genuinely, the guy knew everyone's name. Not in a fake politician way, either. He remembered little things. If you mentioned your grandma was sick and passing, he'd ask how she was doing a week later. If you were struggling in class, he'd sit with you at lunch, walking you through the assignment like it was no big deal. He made you feel like you mattered. And came senior year, and with it something none of us expected. Mister Patel, our math teacher, was diagnosed with cancer. He was one of those rare teachers everyone liked. Strict but fair. Always willing to help, even if it meant staying late. We found out his insurance wouldn't cover the experimental treatment he needed. Words spread quickly. The mood at school changed overnight. Everyone felt it. The very next morning, Marcus got on the PA system. Calm and direct. This Saturday, we're hosting a charity basketball tournament. $5 to watch, 20 to play. All proceeds go to Mister Patel's treatment. Bring your friends. Let's pack the gym. No Pep rally? No.

Two years later, I walked into his family's house as his brother's fiance. It was the last day of high school senior year, the day I planned on confessing my feelings to my childhood friend Jeremy. Before I could, Taylor, the pretty senior everyone wanted to date, cornered me by my locker after third period. Her smile was sweet, laced with bitterness. I need to stop hovering around Jeremy, she said, flipping her gorgeous blonde hair over her shoulder. He doesn't want you around. I felt my cheeks burn. Yes, he does. We're friends. He doesn't mind it. Oh, let's go ask him. Before I could protest, she grabbed my wrist and dragged me across the cafeteria where Jeremy sat with his basketball teammates. Everyone was watching. She dropped my arm by the entrance and hopped over to them. My. My heart pounded as she put on her sweetest voice, practically purring as she leaned against his chair. Hey, I've been wondering, she said, playing with his shoulder, is Sarah your girlfriend or what? Everyone at that table laughed. Sarah, the nerd with the braces? Are you dating her, man? One of his teammates asked. I would never go out with her, he said, loud enough for the nearby tables to hear. We're not even friends. She just likes doing homework. Oh, that's cold, they said, bursting into laughter. Taylor glanced back at me with a smirk that said everything. I ran straight to the bathroom, where I locked myself in a doll and cried until my eyes were too swollen to hide. Ever since we were little, we've been best friends. We studied together, played together, went on family trips. We even made matching friendship bracelets at summer. And the way he looked at me when it was just the two of us. I really thought he'd fallen for me, too. But after that day in the cafeteria, I disappeared from his life completely. I took different hallways to avoid him. I ate lunch in the library. I stopped coming to Sunday dinners, telling my mom I had too much homework. He started dating Taylor the day after, hurting me. Eventually, I had the courage to return all of his stuff. Everything he had given me over the years. I made sure to go when he'd be at practice. But when I walked into

My husband's sister Rachel, has always been one of those people who thinks politics is her whole personality. Like, she literally cannot have a conversation without bringing up whatever conspiracy theory she read on Facebook that morning. During family dinners, she'd corner people and lecture them about voter fraud or whatever, while everyone else just wanted to eat their mashed potatoes in peace. I Learned pretty early on to just excuse myself whenever she started going off. My husband warned me when we got married that his family was intense about politics, but I figured I could handle it. I was wrong. Things got really bad during election season last year. Every family gathering turned into Rachel giving speeches about how the country was going to hell. She'd send these long text chains to the family group chat with links to weird websites and videos. I muted that chat after she sent a 47 message rant at 3 in the morning the week before the election. I was making dinner when our doorbell rang. I opened it and there was a package sitting there with my name on it. No delivery guy in sight, which was weird because usually they at least wait for you to grab it. The return address said it was from Rachel. I brought it inside and set it on the kitchen counter. My husband was working late, so I figured I'd wait for him to get home. Before opening it, something about getting a random package from Rachel just felt off. When he finally got back around 9, I showed him the box, he looked at the return address, and his face just fell. He goes, oh, no, what did she do now? We opened it together, and inside was this massive political flag with some really offensive stuff written on it. Like, genuinely nasty, hateful messaging that I'm not even going to repeat. There was also a note that said something like, thought you might want to show your true colours finally, with a winking face drawn.

Hope you're feeling better for the judging. As executives made their rounds, sampling each dish, Derek hovered nervously near my meatballs, warning people, careful with those. I heard they're extremely spicy. Our CEO laughed. These? They're delicious and perfectly mild. He turned to me. Alex, I didn't know you could cook like this. Family recipe, I replied. Though I do make a spicier version sometimes. Not everyone can handle it. The confused looks as people enjoyed my perfectly mild meatballs while Derek grew increasingly agitated was priceless.

My 13 year old son, Lucas got invited to a birthday party at the local community pool. This was a huge deal. Lucas is autistic and struggles with sensory overload, but he's been working hard in therapy lately. He's been asking constantly to do normal kid things, and when his classmate Henry asked him to come, there was no way I was saying no. I spent days getting him ready. We talked through possible scenarios, practiced ways to cope, and packed his noise canceling headphones. I even reached out to Henry's mom to make sure she knew Lucas might need breaks or might have to head out early. When we arrived, he hesitated at the gate, grabbed my hand, and whispered, mom, I'm nervous, but I really wanna try. My heart nearly burst. Everything was perfect. Lucas stayed in the shallow end, laughing with two other boys. He ate cake without getting overwhelmed by the singing. I started to relax, watching from a distance so he could feel independent. Then some teenagers cannonballed right next to him. The splash, screaming, and sudden chaos triggered him instantly. I saw his face change, that distant look I know too well. He started stimming, flapping his hands and making his high pitched humming sound. I rushed over, but before I could reach him, Lucas was in full meltdown. He covered his ears, screaming and rocking.

He was the kind of kid whose homework got passed around before tests. More than once. A teacher used his assignments as the grading key. Still, he stayed invisible. Never bragged, never joined any clubs. Never even looked up from his desk unless called on. Then came AP Calculus. Our teacher, Mister Hoffman, was infamous. He'd randomly call on students during lectures and mock anyone who didn't have the answer immediately. Not light teasing, either. Full on public humiliation. He once made a guy cry during a pop quiz review. It was a cold Tuesday morning when it happened. Mister Hoffman was in rare form, tearing through problems on the board, peppering the class with questions like he was trying to thin the herd. Then he turned and called on Derek. Derek, he said, tapping the chalk on the blackboard, let's see you solve this one. He wrote out this monster equation. Long, dense, intimidating just to look at. Everyone turned in their seats. You could feel the room lock into silence. Derek didn't flinch. He stood up, walked slowly to the Board and just stared at it. No twitch, no awkward fidgeting. Just calm. Then he reached for the chalk, but instead of solving it, he erased the equation completely and wrote something.

Not having to explain yourself or feel different. But one Friday, I had a spelling test I couldn't skip. I went to school, stomach twisted in knots. When lunchtime came, I grabbed my usual free tray and walked to the table, already bracing for it. All around me, kids were tearing open greasy cardboard boxes, laughing and trading slices. That's when the kid whose dad owned the town's car dealership looked at my tray and said, loud enough for everyone to hear you. What's that even supposed to be? The table exploded with laughter. My ears burned. I stared down at the gray Lump on my tray and said quietly, Salisbury steak. That night, I couldn't hold it in. I begged mom for pizza money. She emptied her purse on the table, counting out coins and old receipts. She gave me a small, tired smile and said, next week, baby. I promise. The next Friday, I opened my backpack and found $2 folded in a scrap of paper. For three weeks, I had pizza like everyone else. I laughed. I felt normal. But then mom lost her second job, and that Friday, I was back to the government tray. I tried to keep my head down. I sat quietly.

My dad thought the whole thing was as weird as I did. He'd raise his eyebrows and shrug whenever mom went on whistling patrol, but he never challenged her on it. That was their marriage in a nutshell. She made the rules, he went along to keep the peace. I made it almost a month without another slip up. Then one night, I was hanging in my room, headphones on, when I caught myself whistling along to the beat. I didn't even realize I'd done it until my door flew open. Mom stood there, tears streaming down her face. I yanked my headphones off. Mom. Instead of saying, strike three, she just buried her face in her hands, sobbing.

I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages. Actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs. Supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. The truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after six months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, cable management systems. I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store. Again, Sarah deflected questions about our future, saying we were figuring things out. Maybe he could drive for Uber, her mother suggested, loud enough for me to hear. Everything unraveled because a doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbour's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? There returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them.

Schiller kicked more glass toward her. Faster! I stood up, holding the heavy ceramic plate over my head. Yoo hoo! I whistled before dropping it onto the marble floor. Crash! Everyone gasped. What the? He spun around just as I picked up another plate and dropped it. Sir, what are you doing? That's $700 each! I shrugged, picked up the window glass and dropped it too. Then I walked over to the next tail and swept everything off. Stop! Stop! I'm calling the police! Good! I said. Call them! I kept going. Schiller rushed over and grabbed my collar. You'll pay for every piece! And you'll pay for everything everyone has had to deal with under you! I grinned back at him as he blew up in my face. Everyone stood still, watching us, wondering the same thing. Why? Why was a stranger suddenly throwing around plates? Well, it was for a good reason. The police arrived quickly, walking in, looking just as confused as everyone else was. Mister Schiller grinned, letting my collar go finally. Officers, arrest this man?

I convinced my entire high school I was colorblind for three years just to win a fifty dollar bet. It started in freshman biology when our teacher was droning on about genetic disorders. Jake Miller, cocky, rich, and always looking for entertainment, leaned over and whispered, I bet you couldn't fake being colorblind for a whole month without getting caught. I've never been able to resist a challenge. Especially from someone like Jake, who drove a BMW his daddy bought him while I worked weekends at Dairy Queen. Make it until graduation and you've got a deal, I whispered back. Fifty bucks says you crack in a month. He smirked, extending his hand. We shook on it right there between plastic models of DNA strands. That night I researched everything about red green color blindness. I Learned about Isihara tests, those dotted circles doctors use, how color blind people navigate traffic lights, and common mistakes they make. By morning, I had a game plan. Day one, I accidentally mixed up my red and green folders in front of our math teacher. Sorry, I mumbled, just loud enough for him to hear. They look the same to me. He paused mid equation. Thomas, are you colorblind? I feigned embarrassment, staring at my shoes. Yeah, I don't really talk about it. Words spread through the teacher's lounge like wildfire. By lunch, my history teacher was asking if I needed special accommodations for map activities. By the end of the week, the school counselor called me in to discuss my learning needs. I committed fully. I bought special colorblind glasses online that did absolutely nothing but look convincing, wearing them dramatically during school events and removing

The first text came around 4 p m. Hey, the key isn't working. Did you lock the deadbolt? I didn't answer. The call started escalating from different numbers. First Olivia, then Marie. By 6 p m, the tone shifted from annoyance to panic. What did you do? There's a storage receipt taped to the door. Are you kidding me? Apparently, they'd spent the night sleeping in the U Haul truck because they had nowhere else to go. When Hannah finally called, screaming about me being a psychopath, I calmly explained, I didn't throw anything out. Your belongings are safe and climate controlled storage. You were a guest who tried to move two other people in and relegate the homeowner to the couch. I just declined your terms. They tried everything. Police, welfare checks. So social media campaigns, lawsuit threats. When police came, I showed them Hannah's texts about me sleeping on the couch and doorbell footage of them screaming at my door. The officer sighed and said, so she tried to move friends in without permission, and now she's claiming you're unstable? I compiled screenshots of their defamatory posts, sent them to Hannah's tech company HR Department. I contacted their old property management company with evidence of their harassment from Marie, the aspiring influencer. I sent her smear campaign screenshots to every brand she'd tagged. Three weeks later, Hannah was fired for violating her company's social media policy. Olivia and Marie were blacklisted from reputable apartments. Marie's influencer dreams imploded when brand started blocking her. The quiet in my house feels like justice.

What I saw will haunt me forever. I've been doing water rescue for eight years now, and most calls are body recovery, not rescue. People don't survive long in these freezing northern waters. But what I found last Tuesday has me ready to quit and never look back. The all came at 2 p m. When a father took his seven year old daughter, Emma, fishing at Crystal Lake. He turned away for 30 seconds to untangle his line. And when he looked back, she was gone. No splash, no scream. Just gone. I knew she was dead before we even arrived because the water temp was 42 degrees. Even if she could swim, hypothermia would kill her in minutes. But we had to try. My dive partner Jake and I searched the main area for three hours, but we found nothing. The current was brutal from recent storms. And that's when I noticed something odd. One of the old creek beds that had been dry for years was flowing again. And heavy rains must have opened it back up. I followed the creek and realized where it LED, which made my blood go cold. The dead zone. That's what the older divers called the deepest part of Crystal Lake. Hundred yard stretch where the water drops to over two hundred feet. We're strictly forbidden from diving there because unpredictable currents will kill you. They Always said. But the creek LED directly into the dead zone. So if Emma got swept into that current, her body would be down there. Jake was searching the other side of the lake, so I made a decision that still haunts me. I geared up and dropped into the forbidden waters alone. The first thing I noticed was how wrong the older divers were, because there was no current at all. The water was eerily still, like swimming in black suit. And I descended fifty feet, then a hundred, with nothing but darkness below. At 150 feet, my light finally hit something, and I thought it was seaweed at first. Long, pale strands swaying in the water. But as I got closer, I realized what I was really looking at. Arms. Hundreds of human arms, growing from the lake bottom like some twisted underwater forest. They were all different sizes, from tiny baby arms no bigger than my thumb, to adult arms thick as tree branches. All of them were pale green and moving slowly, grasping at the water around them. And they had roots spreading through the sediment, like they've been planted there.

I was 14 and I was walking through the mall when I saw a girl my age sitting alone at the arcade playing a racing game by herself. She looked really lonely, mashing buttons and talking to the screen like she had someone to compete with, making sound effects and celebrating when she won races against nobody. So I decided to go over and challenge her to try and make her day better. I walked up to her and asked if I wanted to race against her and I saw her face just completely change. Really? You really wanna play against me? I told her yes and I asked her which game she wanted to play so I could show her some moves. I knew she got excited and was about to pick a two player game, but then at the last second she stopped. She grabbed her backpack and said, the last time someone asked to play games with me and I let them use my quarters, they took all my money and left me standing there with nothing. My mom called me stupid and said stupid kids don't deserve more arcade money and I had to save up my allowance for three weeks just to come back here. I'm not stupid anymore and I'm not sharing. She turned around clutching her bag tight and my heart broke for her. I walked back over and Pinky promised her I wasn't going to take her money and told her I'd use my own quarters right next to her so I couldn't steal anything. I even showed her my wallet to prove I had my own money. She ended up agreeing to play, and when I showed her the combo moves, she was absolutely amazed. She yelled, that's so awesome! Teach me how to do that! She then started practicing really hard, and although she was messing up the timing at first, she seemed so focused and determined. I'll beat you, just you watch, she said with this fierce look in her eyes. And then after a full hour of trying and failing and trying again, she pulled off the combo perfectly. When she did, she was so thrilled she jumped up and down screaming and called me her awesome new gaming buddy. We took turns playing different games the rest of the afternoon, and she kept getting better and better at everything I taught her. When I told her I had to go home, she looked disappointed, but then asked me if I wanted to meet.

I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30 she yawned and said she was getting Tired? What time is your bedtime? I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by 8 p m, she said. Matter of factly locked? That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes.

And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to? Promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay. I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock. This was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key. Downstairs, I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice.

I ran inside. Kathy was sitting on the edge of the bed, eyes open, but she wasn't Breathing, I called 9 1 1, screaming for help. Paramedics arrived and rushed her to the hospital, while I followed behind and called her brother and sister. When I arrived, I begged to be with her, but they wouldn't let me back. The nurse told me they're doing the best they can. I begged her to ask the doctor if I could sit with her. A few minutes later, he returned and let me inside. The room was full of doctors and nurses fighting to bring her back. We have to make a decision. She's not going to make it. I broke down completely and we had to pull the plug. Everything stopped. Kathy was gone. I never got to say goodbye. I was outside waiting for the ambulance, but my stepdaughter told me Kathy's last words. I'm ready.

In fourth grade, a kid named Tyler walked up to me during recess and said, I'll give you five bucks if you pretend to be my twin brother for the whole day. I looked at him completely confused, because Tyler and I looked nothing alike. I had dark hair, he was blond. I wore glasses, he didn't. He was short, I was tall. But five bucks was five bucks, and I wasn't about to turn down free money. So I shrugged and said, deal. That's when I Learned he had already been telling everyone in our class that he had a secret twin who went to another school. Apparently, this started as a joke, but then people actually believed him. And instead of admitting he was lying, he doubled down. Now he needed me to prove it. The plan. Every time someone asked him something, I'd answer for him and vice versa. If a teacher called on him, I had to answer like I was also Tyler. If someone asked me a question, he'd respond like we were one person. It was the stupidest thing ever, but for some reason, people actually bought it. Then in gym class, things went very wrong. We were playing dodgeball when a teacher stopped the game and yelled, Tyler, why are you on both teams? I panicked. Tyler panicked. We both just stood there staring at her, waiting for the other to say something. Then Tyler grabbed his knee, fell over and yelled, Mrs. Davis, I think I'm seeing double. She genuinely looked concerned. She walked us both to the nurse's office, where Tyler kept acting dizzy, saying he felt weird, like there were two of him. We sat there for twenty minutes while the nurse gave him crackers and told him to breathe slowly. By the end of the day, he so committed to the bit that he even wrote my name on his homework and tried to turn it in. The next morning, he handed me a single dollar Bill and said, sorry, I only have this. But you were the best fake twin ever. I never got the rest of my money. Most importantly, Sophie has been dead for three years. What's in that room is something else. Something that found her body and decided to wear it. We can't get rid of it, so we contain it. We've been looking for someone young and healthy, too. Well, you'll understand soon enough. The doors are locked from the outside. There's no cell service here, no landline. You can't leave. We're sorry, but Sophie needs to feed, and we can't do this anymore. Good luck. The Morrisons. P S. If you're reading this,

Something was waiting for us. It was ten thirty one PM when my phone buzzed with an emergency alert that said do not enter underground structures such as basements. Stay above ground until they all clear. My husband Mark looked up from his own phone and we stared at each other, both having received the same message. What do you think's going on? I asked, glancing toward our basement door. Our five year old daughter, Emma had been asleep for an hour upstairs. Could be a gas leak or radar issue, Mark replied, but his voice sounded uncertain. I ran upstairs to check on Emma, who was sleeping peacefully in her bed, then came back down to find Mark staring at the TV. The local news channel was displaying the same emergency alert in blocky white letters on a black screen, but when he flipped to CNN and other networks, there was nothing about any emergency in our area. I pulled out my phone and searched Google for any news about the alert, but nothing came up. I texted Sarah, a neighbor from two streets over, asking if she'd gotten the same message. No response. I think we should leave, I said, grabbing a duffel bag from the closet. We can go to my sister's place until this clears up. But Emma has school tomorrow and I have work, Mark protested. Don't you work from home on Mondays, anyway? I replied, already packing clothes and Emma's favorite stuffed animals into the bag. While Mark hesitated, I walked over to our basement door and noticed the chain lock was latched. I hurried to the kitchen, grabbed some duct tape, and started sealing the cracks around the basement door. What are you doing? Mark asked. If it's some kind of gas leak, I don't want it getting into the rest of the house, I said, pulling another strip of tape across the bottom gap. Within 10 minutes, I had packed our essentials and was ready to leave. Mark finally agreed to wake Emma, and we carried her out to the car. Wrapped in blankets. She stirred sleepily, but didn't fully wake up as I strapped her into her car seat. As we pulled out of our driveway, I noticed how quiet the neighborhood was. If everyone had gotten the same alert, wouldn't more people be leaving? The houses on our street were all dark except for automatic porch lights, and there were no other cars on the road.

Here's what this jerk didn't know. Emma had been telling us all week how nervous she was about proving herself to her Family. How she wanted to earn every promotion, every bit of respect. How she was terrified people would think she only got opportunities because of her last name. She'd been working at McDonald's.

They kicked me out at 17 when my girlfriend Thea got pregnant. Not asked to leave. Literally threw my stuff on the lawn and changed the locks. Dad screamed I was throwing my life away. Mom cried about the neighbors. Their ultimatum. Break up with Thea and give the baby up or never come home. I chose Thea. We lived in my car for two months, then a friend's basement. Those first weeks were hell. Thea had morning sickness so bad she couldn't keep anything down. I'd hold her hair back in gas station bathrooms, both of us crying. I remember one night in November, the car windows fog up from our breathing. Thea was shivering despite three blankets. She whispered, maybe your parents were right. Maybe we're too young for this. I held her tighter and said, no, we're going to prove them wrong. But honestly, I was terrified. I'd wake up at three a m. In panic attacks, wondering how we'd afford formula or doctor visits. Thea would rub my back and remind me we had each other. The worst part was driving past my house for school. I'd see mom watering her flowers, dad washing his car. Normal life continuing like I'd never existed. Thea caught me staring once and just squeezed my hand. They don't deserve you, she said. But I still missed them every single day. Her parents weren't thrilled either, but they never abandoned her. Mom Delfine started buying prenatal vitamins and baby clothes. Her dad taught me basic car maintenance so I wouldn't get stranded. Family sticks together, Delfine told me one night. Blood or not, that hit different when my own blood relatives had written me off. Christmas was the hardest. Thea's family invited me.

I've been working at this upscale steakhouse called the Prime Cut for almost four years now, and I've seen more first dates than I can count. Most blend together in my memory, but there was one last Tuesday that I'll never forget. The evening rush hadn't started yet when this woman walked in. Late 20s, wearing a sundress that still had the tags tucked in, clutching a small wrapped gift that looked like it came from the bookstore next door. She was 50 minutes early for her reservation and asked for a specific spot at the bar that she requested when booking. As I set up her area, I noticed her hands trembling slightly as she placed the gift on the empty stool beside her. She kept checking her reflection in the mirror behind the bar, are adjusting her earrings and practicing what looked like conversation starters under her breath. So how was your drive over? She whispered to herself, then shook her head and tried again. Is this your first time at the prime cut? The nervousness was radiating off her in waves. For those 15 minutes, she just sat there nursing a Diet Coke, rearranging her purse, and checking her phone every two minutes. Our manager even asked if everything was okay, and she assured us her date was coming at 7:00. When he finally arrived, the contrast was immediate. He was polished, expensive watch, tailored jacket. But He barely acknowledged her as he slid onto the stool. Before she could even hand him the gift, he pulled out his phone and started scrolling, saying, sorry. Client stuff. You know how it is. The woman's face fell for a split second before she plastered on a smile and gently placed the gift on the bar between them. I brought them water and took their drink orders. A simple wine spritzer for her, a specific brand of Bourbon with exactly two ice cubes, not crushed, for him. When I returned with their drinks, he was still glued to his phone. She was desperately trying to connect, asking about his work, his weekend plans, his thoughts on the restaurant, while he gave one word answers without looking up. The few times he did engage, it was to interrupt her

The worst part was watching my social life disappear. My friends stopped inviting me places because I'd either cancel last minute or fall asleep during movies. I remember one time at my best friend Maya's sleepover, all the girls were up talking and laughing at 2 a m. And I was passed out on her couch like I'd been drugged.

He told me I was no fun anymore and that I cared more about sleeping than spending time with him. That destroyed me because I desperately wanted to be present, but I physically couldn't stay awake.

I just found my boyfriend's name on a murder list. I moved into apartment 42 with my boyfriend Marcus three days ago. We've been together for five years and finally saved enough to leave our parents houses. He's 24, I'm 22. And this was supposed to be our fresh start together. The apartment was way too good for our budget. Two bedrooms, city part views, balcony deposit free with a five year lease option. The landlord said no inspections, no questions asked. It felt too good to be true, but we were desperate. On our first morning, I found a handwritten note in the kitchen cupboard. Beautiful cursive writing that said new occupier of apartment 42 on the outside. Inside was a 12 rule survival guide from the previous tenant. Missus Prudence Hemmings, who lived here 35 years before her husband died in some kind of incident. Rule seemed insane at first. Never use the elevator between 1:11 and 3:00am. Ignore the window cleaner who appears on the balcony. Don't talk to neighbors claiming to live in apartment 65 to 72 because those burned down in the 80s and everyone died. Keep weapons in every room. Don't babysit Terry's kids from Apartment 26. I thought it was some sick joke until everything started happening exactly as described. At 11:00am, a friendly window cleaner knocked on our balcony door on the seventh floor. He exactly 30 minutes tapping and Calling out, never breaking eye contact through the glass. When he left, I checked every balcony in the building. He vanished completely. That afternoon, I heard the animal noises from apartment 48. Not dog barking or cat meowing. Something else. Something that sounded like it was in pain. Dying slowly, over and over again. At 8:00am the next morning, the postman, Ian, knocked. When I opened the door, he looked at me with sad eyes and said, missus Hemmings left something for you, didn't she? I'm sorry about what's coming. What do you mean? I asked. The rules aren't suggestions, he whispered. They're the only thing keeping you alive. This building feeds on people who don't follow them. That's when I noticed the damp patch on our bedroom ceiling had turned deep red overnight. Not rust or water damage. It looked like blood pooling and spreading, but never dripping. Marcus had been acting strange since we moved in. Distant, jumpy, checking the time constantly. Yesterday, he kept muttering about his early shift, saying he had to leave at 3:15.

I never got invited, but I could hear everything, including when she'd switch to German with her friends. What Heidi didn't know was that my mom is German. I grew up speaking it at home, but rarely mentioned it since moving to the city. Why would I? Every weekend, like clockwork, I'd hear Heidi and her friends laughing. Die amerikanerin und die banane ist so languish. The American next door is so boring. Or the hat kind gushmack. She has no taste. Once she even joked about my pathetic dating life after seeing me bring home the same guy twice. At first, I brushed it off. Just mean girl talk, right? But week after week, it started to wear on me. I'd catch myself standing in front of my closet, overthinking my outfits. Is my style really that bad? I started ordering takeout from different restaurants to seem more cultured. And walking through our hallway with bags. God, how pathetic is that? The worst was when my mom came to visit. We were speaking German in the elevator when Heidi got in. Mom was mid sentence about her garden back home when Heidi's eyes widened with recognition at the language. She stared at the floor numbers like they were the most fascinating thing she'd ever first Seen. My stomach dropped, not because she'd heard us speaking German, but because I realized how deeply I'd let her comments affect me. I hadn't even told my own mother about the situation because I was embarrassed about not stand standing up for myself. That night, after mom left, I sat alone in my apartment, listening to Heidi's laughter. Through the wall I could hear glasses clinking, music playing, and then, right on cue, hear a mutter zephanio languidly like alswiezie. Her mother looks just as boring as she does.

He's riding my bumper so close I can't see his headlights, flashing his high beams and honking. I don't speed up, he starts swerving into the oncoming lane, trying to pass on a two lane road with heavy traffic. Finally he finds a gap and floors it past me, but not before rolling down his window to flip me off and scream something about learning how to drive. Here's where it gets interesting. The guy immediately cuts back into my lane, nearly clipping my front bumper, then slams on his brakes to teach me a lesson about following distance. I had to break hard to avoid rear ending him.

I pull up safely behind the last car in line and watch through my windshield as this guy's truck gets stuck in wet concrete that the crew was pouring for a new sidewalk. The construction workers are yelling and waving their arms as his rear wheels spin uselessly and what's probably $1,000 worth of concrete mix. But wait, it gets better.

In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. Screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends that Weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary. I complained the whole time about taking

My heart drops because my six year old has zero filter. I rush over there thinking she cursed or something. Nope, way worse. This. Walsh sits me down and says, Zoe told the class that mommy and daddy wrestle really loud at night, and it keeps her awake. I'm like, excuse me, what now? She continues, she said, you guys slam into walls and make the house shake. Other kids were asking questions. Some parents have already called asking if everything's okay at home. Oh, my god. I wanted to crawl under that tiny plastic chair and never come out. My face is burning hot, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty. This woman thinks my husband and I are having some kind of domestic situation, and half the school probably does, too. I'm sitting there trying to process this nightmare when missus Walsh adds, Zoe also mentioned loud thumping sounds and you both breathing really heavy. Afterward, she said, daddy sometimes yells, come on! And you make frustrated noises. I literally choked on my own spit. This is not happening. This cannot be happening to me. Right now. I'm imagining the phone tree of gossip that's already started. All the judgmental looks at pickup time, the whispers behind my back. Missus Walsh, I Can explain. I start, but she holds up her hand. Look, I've been teaching for 15 years. I've seen it all. But when a child shares something like this, we have to take it seriously. I had to file a report with the counselor. Report? Jesus Christ!

I've been living with Jake for eight months when I started noticing my adderall running out faster than it should. At first, I thought maybe I was taking extra doses during final stress, but the numbers weren't adding up. I'm prescribed 30 pills per month, one daily, but by day 20, I'd only have five pills left. This happened three months in a row. Jake was the obvious suspect. He had access to my room where I kept my medication, and had been acting weird. New clothes, expensive dinners, always had cash when he used to be broke. Must be miscounting, he'd say when I mentioned running out early. ADHD brains, right? The thing is, I'm a pharmacy student. Tracking medication is literally what I do. For my senior thesis, I was researching prescription drug diversion, so I've been documenting everything. I decided to set a trap. I bought a small spy camera from Amazon and hid it in my bookshelf, aimed at my desk, where I kept my medication. Then I marked each pill bottle with a tiny dot and photographed every pill from multiple angles. I also started a spreadsheet tracking the exact number of pills, their characteristics, and when I took them. If Jake was stealing, I'd have proof. Three days later, I reviewed the camera footage. There was Jake, 2 p m. On Tuesday, going through my desk while I was in class. He opened my prescription Bottle shook out several pills and put them in his pocket, but I wanted to catch him in the act and see how deep this went. I checked our university's anonymous tip form where students buy and sell things. Sure enough, there was a post from username Jake M94 selling study aids for $20 each. The post had dozens of responses from desperate students looking for Adderall during midterms. I created a fake account and message Jake's username pretending to be a freshman needing study help. Hey, I heard you have study aids available. My roommate mentioned you might have adderall. Yeah, I got the good stuff. Prescription grade, $20 per pill. Meet at the library. He was selling my medication for $20 per pill. Pills that cost me $5.

She has a 115 degree fever. We exchanged glances, thinking, that's not a fever, that's cremation. If this girl's temperature was actually 115, she'd be cooking from the inside. We sped to the residence, like rushing to deliver triplets. Upon arrival, the dad was frantically pacing as if his world was ending. She's upstairs, burning up, won't respond. We charged up the staircase, prepared for severe intervention. When we opened the bedroom door, there she was. Crawled across her bed, pretending to be unconscious, whimpering. My insides are on fire! My bones feel like they're disintegrating. She appeared to be auditioning for a de less drama. As we moved to check her vitals, I noticed a washcloth soaking in scalding water, still limiting steam. I glanced back at her. She froze, eyes wide with panic. We didn't need to take her temperature. I turned to the father. Sir, she's completely fine. He squinted. What do you mean? She fabricated the whole situation. He looked at the steaming cloth, then at his daughter, and visibly deflated. Are you serious? The girl started scrambling. I didn't intend to. I just didn't prepare for my history presentation. Dead silence followed. Then he erupted. You summon paramedics over a school presentation? She attempted justification. I thought I'd get an F. He faced us. You're free to Go. Thanks. As we departed, he slammed her door. We heard objects crashing, yelling, and him declaring, your re. You're grounded till college. Just as we reached our ambulance, he hustled her outside, shoved her into their car, and sped towards school to make her do the conviction overturn. I sued the state for wrongful imprisonment.

Instead, they just delayed it until the moment it would hurt the most.

One day, this 19 year old kid walks in wearing designer everything, waving around a credit card his daddy gave him. He demanded to skip the basic training and go straight to advanced jumps because he'd played a lot of video games. When I refused, he pulled out his phone and showed me his social media. He had two million followers and made videos doing dangerous stunts. He threatened to post about how our school was refusing service to famous influencers unless we let him skip the basics. My boss, worried about bad publicity, asked me to give him a chance. The kid signed every waiver with a smirk, bragging about how he'd probably teach me some new tricks. He wouldn't stop talking about his parkour videos and how skydiving would be easy mode for someone like him. During the ground training, he kept interrupting me to explain how he'd seen it done differently on YouTube. When I tried to show him proper parachute handling, he rolled his eyes and said, I've watched literally every skydiving video on the internet. Morning of his first jump, he showed up hungover.

So I accidentally started a full scale latte art controversy because I said thanks wrong. Let me explain. It was Tuesday morning. I'm running on three hours of sleep and the emotional stability of a wet napkin. I stumble into this bougie coffee shop downtown. You know the type. Edison bulbs everywhere. Baristas who look like they exclusively date people with septum piercings and a chalkboard menu written in cursive so fancy it might as well be hieroglyphics. I order a simple cappuccino. Nothing crazy. No oat milk, no extra shots, no interpretive dance on top. Just caffeine in a cup so I can pretend to be a functioning adult. The barista, let's call her Luna, because of course, that's her name, makes my drink with the intensity of someone performing surgery. She's got this little metal pitcher steaming milk like she's summoning spirits. Takes her a solid five minutes to create what I can only describe as the Mona Lisa of foam art. She slides across the counter with this proud smile and goes, I made you a swan. I look down. It's beautiful. Beautiful, like, genuinely impressive. This foam swan is sitting there looking more elegant than I've ever looked in my entire life. I'm genuinely appreciative. So I say, oh, wow, that's really cool. Thanks. And Luna's face just drops like, I told her my dog died. She blinks twice and goes, cool. I pause mid Sip? Yeah, it's. It's really well done. She crosses her arms. I spent six years perfecting latte art. This isn't cool. This is craft. Ma'am, I said it was cool because I think it's impressive. That's. That's a compliment. But Luna's not having it. She turns to her coworker, guy with a mustache that definitely has its own Instagram account, and goes, he called my swan cool. Mustache. Guy looks at me like I just vandalized the declaration of independence, bro. That's dismissive. I'm standing there holding my swan cappuccino, thinking, when did coffee shops become art galleries? With attitude, I try to backtrack. I'm sorry. I meant it's beautiful. Really skillful. Luna gasped. Skillful? It's not

I tried to deny it, but I pressed on with complete seriousness. Sir, this is for scientific research purposes. I need to document various prank calling methodologies. Now, would you describe your approach as amateur or professional level? The caller was clearly thrown off and actually started answering my questions. They said, well, I guess I'm pretty good at it. Excellent. I said, now can you demonstrate your range of fake voices for my study? They actually started doing different accents like they were auditioning for a voice acting role. I took detailed notes and said, fascinating. Now tell Me. What inspired you to get into prank calling? They spent five minutes explaining how they started prank calling as a hobby in middle school. Very interesting. Now, for research purposes, can you rank your top three prank call? Top. They enthusiastically listed fake surveys, wrong numbers, and pizza delivery pranks. I said, excellent data. Now I need you to demonstrate each technique with a brief example. This person actually started performing different prank call scenarios while I pretended to take scientific notes. 20 minutes into this fake interview, I said, now I need you to rate your own performance today. They said, honestly, this might be my best work. I really felt like I connected with my subject. that's interesting, because technically, you just got reverse prank called. There was dead silence, and I could hear them processing what just happened. They said, wait, you're not actually conducting research? I said, nope, but congratulations.

My parents had this annoying habit of shutting down every request I made with the same exact phrase. When you pay rent, you can make the rules. Didn't matter what I asked for your bedtime, different dinner, friends over on weekdays, the answer was always the same. When you pay rent, you can make the rules. I was 14 and getting sick of hearing it, so I decided to take them literally. I started saving. Every birthday dollar, every allowance payment, every lawn mowing job. For three months, I hoarded money like I was planning to buy a car. My parents thought I was being responsible. Little did they know, I was plotting their destruction. I looked up our monthly rent online. Turns out we paid one 2 hundred dollars a month. I counted my savings and had exactly one 2:47 perfect. One Tuesday morning, I walked into the kitchen where my parents were drinking coffee and reading the news. I slammed a stack of cash on the table and said, here's this month's rent payment. My dad nearly choked on his coffee, and my mom just stared at the money. What is this for? I said, well, you always told me when I pay rent, I can make the rules, so I'm paying rent. My dad tried to hand the money back, but I stepped away from the table. Nope. A deal's a deal. I'm Officially a rent paying tenant now. My mom said, honey, we didn't mean it literally. I said, too late. The transaction is complete and as the new co landlord, I'm implementing some house rules. I pulled out a typed list I prepared and started reading my new regulations. Rule No. 1 mandatory family dance time every night at seven PM. No exceptions. Rule No. 2 pizza only Tuesday. We're ordering pizza every Tuesday from now on. Rule number three no news during breakfast. Only cartoons are allowed on the TV. My parents looked at each other like I'd lost my mind. My dad said, this is ridiculous. You can't. I just pay rent and take over the house. I said, actually, according to your own logic, I can. You've been telling me for years that rent equals rule making power. My mom tried reasoning with me. Sweetie, we'll give you the money back. Just stop this. I shook my head. Sorry, but I've already invested in this household. As a paying tenant, I have rights. That night at seven PM, I turned on music and announced it was mandatory family.

Not because I have my life together, but because I was up gooning to productivity videos and realized I hadn't eaten anything except sadness and energy drinks for 12 hours. I pull up to the drive through speaker and this voice comes through. Sound like it's been filtered through three layers of defeat and a broken dreams machine. What you want? Not welcome to McDonald's or how can I help you? Just pure, pure existential exhaustion in four words. So I respond the way my mom raised me. Good evening. Could I please get a Big Mac meal with a Coke? Thank you so much. Silence. Dead silence. Like I just spoke ancient Latin. What? A Big Mac meal, please, with a Coke. Thank you. More silence then. Why are you talking like that? I blink. Like what? All fancy and stuff. You making fun of me? No, I'm just ordering food. Nobody talks that polite at 2:00am. You being sarcastic? Ma'am, I said please and thank you. That's not sarcasm. That's basic human decency. But she's not having it. Hold on. I sit there for five minutes wondering if being raised with manners is now considered a hate crime. She comes back. My manager wants to talk to you. A new voice appears. Male, tired. Sounds like he's been managing teenagers since the Clinton administration. Sir, my employee says you're being Disrespectful? I said please and thank you. Right, but the way you said it was condescending. I'm getting accused of weaponizing politeness, like I'm some kind of manners terrorist. I was just trying to be nice. I explained. See, that's the problem. Nobody's that nice at 2:00am unless they're up to something. Up to something? I'm up to diabetes and poor life choices. That's what 2:00am McDonald's is for. Sir, I just want a burger. And I just want customers who don't mock my staff with fake politeness. Fake politeness? I've been accused of many things, but never artificial courtesy.

My Jewish family had a tradition called the debt book. Every child born into our family got their own Ledger on their first birthday. Every expense, diapers, food, clothes, school supplies, medical bills got logged with interest. On your 18th birthday, you were presented with your total debt. Mine was $247,000. Family takes care of family, my father would say. But family also pays family back. The tradition went back four generations. My great grandfather started it during the depression, supposedly to teach financial responsibility. Every adult child paid their parents back in monthly installments. Some took decades to clear their debt. My older brother Jake signed his repayment contract at 18, dropped out of college to work construction. 10 years later, still paying. My sister Maria became a nurse specifically because medical professionals pay off debt faster. When my 18th birthday approached, I did something nobody had ever done. I research. Found out child support is a parent's legal obligation. Not alone discovered that charging your children for their upbringing might actually be illegal. Learned that financial abuse is a real thing. The night of my birthday party, the whole extended family gathered. 50 relatives waiting to witness another debt book signing. My parents presented my Ledger like it was an honor.

My cousin Tommy weighed nearly 300 pounds by eighth grade. Kids at school were brutal about it, but at family gatherings, we never mentioned his size. He was just Tommy, the gentle giant who helped grandma pull weeds, always let the younger cousins win at board games, and laughed like a foghorn when something genuinely made him happy. He was everyone's favourite. Every Friday night, our entire family would gather at my aunt's house for dinner. That night, like always, Tommy was sitting cross legged on the floor playing Mario Kart with my little brother, while whiskers, our 17 year old family cat, slept in his usual warm spot near the sliding glass door. Whiskers was ancient. He had survived two house moves, four new babies, and more toddler tailpulls than any living creature should have to endure. We all joked he'd outlive us. Out of nowhere, my little brother came racing in with his new remote control car, zigzagging through the living room like a maniac, showing off to everyone. The car flew right under Tommy's legs. Just as he started getting up to grab a second plate of pizza, his foot caught on the corner of the carpet. He lost his balance. I watched it all in slow motion. His arms flailed his face, and then came the soft, dull crunch when he landed. Most people didn't even hear it, but I did. Whiskers didn't move. He didn't hiss. He Didn't cry. Just silent. The whole room froze. Tommy stayed on the floor, pale as a ghost, whispering no over and over while his eyes filled with tears. My dad crossed the room and gently picked up whiskers, wrapping him in the fleece blanket from the recliner, the one whiskers always curled up on. My mom quietly ushered the rest of us into the kitchen. From behind the doorway, I could see Tommy sitting there, shoulders heaving as he sobbed. My aunt knelt beside him, rubbing his back and trying to hold it together. But even she looked shattered. That blanket never came back. By the time we left that night, every trace of whiskers was gone. His toys, his bed, the food and water bowls by the fridge. It was like someone hit delete on his whole existence. We never talked about it again. No one.

Because genetics is a thing. Mr. Rodriguez, I say slowly, I don't take physics. Leans back in his chair like he just caught me in the lie of the century. Really? Then how do you explain getting a perfect score on yesterday's quantum mechanics exam? I blink. I don't even know what quantum mechanics means. I thought it was a type of car repair.

I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off. Zoe was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to Learn boundaries.

But he's nervous because they haven't spoken in 15 years. Apparently, his son died in a car accident. He blamed his daughter in law for it. He said some horrible things and she moved across the country with his grandson. He's been trying to reach out for years, but she won't return his calls. He finally decided to just show up at the graduation ceremony. I felt bad for him and told him about my own situation. How I was flying to interview for my dream job. But I was terrified because I've been unemployed for eight months and this was my last shot. We spent hours talking and he gave me advice about staying confident. When our flight finally boarded, we exchanged numbers and I wish each other luck. Three days later, I'm sitting in the waiting room for my interview and the receptionist calls my name. I walk into the office and nearly fall over. The hiring manager is the same old man from the Airport. We both just stare at each other in complete shock. He starts laughing and asks how Chicago treated me. I tell him I was too nervous to really see the city, but meeting him made the trip worthwhile. He looks at me seriously and says he has to ask me something before we start the interview. He wants to know if I still think he should go to his grandson's graduation. I tell him absolutely, and that life's too short to hold grudges. He smiles and tells me I'm hired. Then he pulls out his phone and shows me a picture from the weekend. It's him hugging a young man in a cap and gown. He went to the graduation and his grandson ran up and hugged him the moment he saw him. His daughter in law had been hoping he'd come for year.

We'd been together for five years, and everything seemed perfect. Emma was this sweet, caring person who worked as a nurse and made these incredible Sunday morning pancakes. She had this one weird thing, though. She was absolutely terrified of bugs. Like, completely loses her mind terrified. I knew about it from pretty early on. She'd see a spider in the bathroom and start hyperventilating. One time, she saw a roach in our apartment and locked herself in the bedroom for three hours until I could get rid of it. I always thought it was kind of endearing in a weird way. Like, everyone has their thing, right? We were at my buddy Tyler's house having one of those perfect summer nights. You know the kind sitting on the back deck, roasting marshmallows over this little fire pit, drinking beers, just talking about nothing important. Emma was laughing at some stupid story Tyler's girlfriend was telling about her coworker. That's literally the last thing I remember from that night. I woke up in the hospital with the worst headache of my life and Emma crying next to my bed. My forehead felt like someone had taken a blow torch to it. And there were all these wires and beeping machines everywhere. Emma's mascara was running down her face, and she kept saying, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, over and over. The doctor came In and explained what happened. Apparently, there was a spider on my forehead. Just a regular house spider, nothing dangerous. Emma saw it and completely lost it. She grabbed this metal citronella can

One day, my daughter came up to me and told me she didn't want to stay at daddy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when she outright refused to visit him for her scheduled week. I sat down beside her and asked her what was going on. Did daddy do something to upset you? Then she told me how daddy's new girlfriend would make her do strange things and also made her promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart dropped into my stomach. She would make my daughter sit in front of a laptop camera and answer personal questions about her body. Then she would record everything and tell her it was just a game. At first, my daughter thought it was normal, but she eventually realized that something felt wrong and became scared. So she asked her to stop. And my ex's girlfriend grabbed my daughter by the shoulders and shook her hard. She went to her daddy to complain and told him everything while sobbing. But instead of protecting her, he told her to stop making up stories. He was under the impression that I had coached our daughter to say this and simply refused to listen to her. I was so furious, but also heartbroken at the same time. The first thing I did was call the police, but the officer Who showed up was my ex's golf buddy, who basically laughed in my face. He told me the same thing that my ex said to our daughter. Stop making up drama just because you can't handle your ex moving on. I don't know what kind of father my ex husband was being that he didn't even consider the possibility of his girlfriend actually doing this. But I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. I sent my daughter to my sister's house before taking action. I was a regular at this gym where I had made friends with these two guys who had done some questionable things in their past. Both of them agreed to help me with my plan. We waited for my ex to leave for his business trip and broke into his house to find the girlfriend. I knew she worked from home, so she was probably in her office all day. She looked absolutely terrified when she saw me entering the house and tried to run, but we cornered her. You see, I was under the impression that she was just some creep getting her

Yeah, sure. Just a simple root retouch and haircut. Yep. Easy money. Yeah. Um, do you know her formula? I've got it written down in the system. Alright, cool. Well, then I will see you tomorrow. Thanks. You're a lifesaver. I promise. I'll tip you out for this. Hi. So I don't know if you were informed, but she did have to go family emergency. Uh, so I'm gonna be taking care of you today. Yes, I was told and I promise that I'm not trying to be a backseat hair stylist, but I think that she said my color isn't flat, meaning that she mixes a bunch of stuff to get it to this color. Do you know what you're supposed to use? Yes, ma'am, she does. It's in the system. So you have nothing to worry about. I will make sure to measure to 80 what she has written down. Thank you. I trust you and definitely I promise. Finishing up with this last section, uh, before I go and fold some towels, can I get you anything? A bottle of water, cup of coffee? No, I'm fine, but I do have a question. I've been trying To wrap my brain around it, how did she get you to do my hair? she just called and asked because I had a cancellation at this time. So it worked out. I hope I'm not overstepping, but I know that you haven't been doing hair as long as she has. So are you at a point yet where you're charging for your services? And if not, did she promise you anything?

No, I didn't read the computer wrong. Did you? No, honey, I didn't. I'm the one that scheduled the perm. Um, why? There's an appointment on my books. Yeah, and it was light gray, meaning that whoever's appointment it was has already paid and went. Did you not read the notes on it? It says do not schedule over me. Prepaid appointment still coming. I even texted you this. Oh, well, I don't check work texts on my days off, so. Okay, well, looking at the system, you have an opening, so I'll just move the perm to you.

So I'm getting married to my fiance in 6 weeks. I saved up for months to buy this gorgeous dress, $3,000. That took me forever to save working at a coffee shop while going to school. My future mother in law kept bugging me about trying it on since the day I brought it home. She'd text me constantly asking when she could see it. She'd show up to our apartment unannounced asking to peek at it. She even offered me a hundred bucks to let her try it on just once. I kept saying no because honestly, something felt off about how obsessed she was. Like, who gets that excited about someone else's wedding dress? My fiance thought I was being dramatic. He kept saying his mom just loves weddings and she's excited for us. But I stood my ground. The dress stays in my closet until my wedding day. Last Tuesday, I came home from my shift early because we were slow. I walked into our apartment and immediately heard my fiance panicking upstairs. He was texting someone frantically and blocking me from going to our bedroom. That's when I knew something was seriously wrong. I, I pushed past him and opened the door. There she was, his mother standing in front of my mirror wearing my wedding dress. My 3,000 dollar dress that I specifically told her she couldn't even look at. She had somehow gotten it on perfectly. The zipper was done up and everything. She was posing and taking selfies in it like it was some kind of photo shoot. When she saw me, her face went completely white. I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture before either of them could stop me. He started yelling at me to delete it, but I was already backing it up to the cloud. My fiance jumped in trying to calm everyone down saying it was just harmless fun and no damage was done. But I felt sick looking at the dress knowing she had been in it, taking pictures, probably planning to show all her friends. The whole thing felt violated. I told them both she had three days to Venmo me $3,000 for a replacement dress or I'm sending that photo to every single person in their family. Group chat, she burst into tears saying I was being cruel and that she just wanted to feel connected to our wedding. My fiance said I was overreact.

My daughter Emma is 25 and absolutely beautiful, not just physically, but she's charming in a way that makes everyone want to be around her. She's got this perfect smile and this laugh that makes guys lose their minds. Her boyfriend, Tyler, is head over heels for her. The poor guy follows her around like a lost puppy and talks about her like she hung the moon. But here's the thing, nobody knows. Emma is a diagnosed sociopath, has been since she was 18, though I knew something was off way before that. When she was 8, she locked her little sister Mia in the basement for three hours just to see what would happen. When I found Mia crying and scared in the dark, Emma was upstairs watching TV like nothing happened. When I asked her why she did it, she just shrugged and said she was curious. No tears, no sorry, nothing. School was a nightmare. Teachers called constantly about Emma lying to get other kids in trouble, stealing lunch money. And once she convinced a boy to eat glue by telling him it was candy. The counselor said she was just going through a phase, but I knew better. After years of therapy and medication, Emma Learned how to act normal. She, she studied other people like a science project, copying their emotions until she could fake them perfectly by High school, she was popular, dated constantly and had everyone fooled. The diagnosis came when she was 18, antisocial personality disorder. The doctor explained it in fancy terms, but basically Emma doesn't feel love, guilt or empathy. She can't. Her brain just doesn't work that way. We've had honest conversations about it since then. When her best friend died in a car accident last year, Emma cried at the funeral and gave this heartbreaking speech later that night. She told me she felt absolutely nothing. The whole thing was an act because that's what people expected. She's been with Tyler for almost two years now. He's a good guy, works as a teacher, volunteers at animal shelters, brings me coffee when he visits. He talks about marrying Emma constantly. Last week, he asked me for my blessing to propose. That's when I told Emma she needs to tell him the truth or I will. She laughed and said I'd never have the guts. She thinks I'm bluffing because she's my daughter and I love her. But Tyler deserves to know what he's signing up for. Emma flat out told me she doesn't love him, never has and never will. She likes the stability he provides and thinks he'll be a good father if they have kids. To her, marriage is just a business transaction. When I brought it up again yesterday, Emma got that cold look.

One first time I took a hot shower in our new home, the steam covered the mirror only to reveal the phrase, hello, I see you in large finger drawn writing. It freaked me out for a second but made me laugh soon after that. It was such an inconspicuous yet obvious thing to leave for the new homeowner. Me. Two, wasn't a purchase, but I was showing a house to a couple and we couldn't believe the reported square footage. It looked like a nice 1,700 square foot house in a semi rural community, but the square footage on the listing said about 4,500. I was sure it was a typo. Turns out most of it was in the basement. Think Buffalo Bills basement. That just goes on and on with random rooms. The place was vacant. The lighting wasn't great. We got to a dead end room down there and turned on the lights and there was this porcelain doll just chilling in the middle of the room. Only thing left in the house. Husband yells, screw this, and we all run out. We ruled out that whole neighborhood as an option for obvious reasons. 3, $1,200 in cash above the door on the inside of the closet. I found it while painting. 4, we bought a house being foreclosed on. We gave him an extra month after closing in. 2000 to help with his move. Still had to have the sheriff come to remove him. Anywho, I was doing some clean up and remodeling before we moved in. The whole house was carpeted. When I started ripping it out, there was a giant blood stain that started in a downstairs spare bedroom and then trailed up to the master bath where there was another stain. His wife had left him. So I had to call the realtor to find out if anyone knew where she was. Turns out he had taken out a deer in the yard and gutted it in the house. What a hassle. Had to rip up and install new sub floors. My vegan ex wife was not thrilled. 5. The property my wife and I moved to three years ago had a bucket full of wrapped Dinosaur bones. Took them to our local museum where they confirm they are roughly 68 million years old. Hadrosaur. Pretty cool. 6. We bought the house from the CEO of the company which we franchise from. It was her childhood home where her mother lived until the day she passed. In true rich person fashion, they didn't care to clean out the house before selling it. They just told us we can do whatever we want with the old lady stuff that was there. We found a hidden box of spicy letters from the old lady to her secret partner spanning many years. That was fun to give to the CEO 7, my uncle was renovating the house that he bought for his chiropractic practice. And when he knocked down a wall to enlarge a room, a few dozen pill bottles fell to the floor. They were each filled with about 25 US silver dollars, which at the time were worth more like $6 in silver each. So it was about $5,000 in vintage coins. 8, that they wired a room by connecting the outlet with an extension cord inside the wall. 9, a diary of an American soldier in World War 2 South Pacific Theater found it above a door when remodeling 20+ years ago. My wife and I tried everything we could think of to find a descendant, but to no avail. Ten, a basement room that was fully decked out as a dungeon. Fake stone walls, a stocks like where you lock your head and hands in Old England. Candle scones on the walls, a metal barred cage in the corner from floor to ceiling. Oh, and the closet had a load of toys, some normal, some not so normal. 11, an entire tribe of raccoons living in the attic.

One. The grandma who used coconut oil on her granddaughter who was extremely allergic and passed from it. As someone who works with toddlers, that story is a nightmare. Grandma nonchalantly caused the passing of her granddaughter. Not because she didn't know about the allergy, because she just didn't think it was a big deal. And in no time flat, a toddler is gone and two parents and two surviving siblings are forever traumatized. And grandma can't figure out why her daughter won't see her two. It wasn't as memorable or as big as most Reddit comments, but one has stuck with me. I forgot what the question was, but this guy commented that he was asked to bring like two gallons of milk to his girlfriend's family dinner. He thought, oh, they must really like milk. When he arrived, each family member had their own gallon of milk, and when dinner was served they all just started guzzling their own milk like animals. I need to try finding that. It was hilarious. 3 the one where the guy had an imaginary girlfriend, later wife, who was a giant cockroach, and his coworkers eventually found out that he had a whole fantasy life with his life size cockroach girlfriend slash wife. Four people seem to regularly post what Reddit post can't you get over? And I always drop in to say the pregnant woman whose husband and father In law decided she'd pass in labor and we're doing all the planning for that to happen. She never updated and I always wonder and worry a little. Wish I'd save the post. 5 the guy who was looking for legal advice because his landlord was sneaking in and leaving him notes while he was sleeping and someone in the comment section saved his life by realizing he was actually suffering carbon monoxide poisoning. Six the lady on ADA who unplugged her fridge to deep clean it while her husband had a box in there who told her to not open the box. I frequently wonder what was in the box. 7 the dude that bought a house with his GF and wasn't allowed upstairs. I want an update to this more than any unsolved mystery. 8 the guy who caught his wife cheating thanks to his Dyson fan epic. 9 the guy who Rick rolled Rick Astley.

I moved into my condo in 2011 and I introduced myself to my one neighbor next door to me but instantly forgot his name. We would see each other in passing for years and I would always just say hi and the casual conversation. I met my wife in 2018 from a long distance relationship. When she finally moved in with me, there was an awkward moment when I introduced her to him. I said this is my fiance and we're getting married next month. He said congratulations and nice to meet you, then walked away. She asked me what his name was and I said I have no clue. Later that day she said his name was Brad. And I was like, oh, he looks like a Brad. And she said he had no clue what my name was either, so no big deal. 2. 2 years. I used to be a club promoter and I had a guy that bought tickets for me for every event he went to. He told me his name when I first met him, but I forgot it soon after he told me. Meeting lots of people makes it hard to remember names, especially when I don't even know if I'll ever see them again. So what's the point of remembering everyone's names after a certain point? I saw him out partying often enough, but it was past the point where I could ask him his name without it being awkward. I had him saved in my phone as Sir Prince Albert since he told me about his piercing so that I'd know who was texting me if we ever texted each other. But I didn't think to add his name since I wasn't sure what it was. So that was no help. Eventually we ended up at a party together and some people walked in and asked, hey, have you seen Phil? After not remembering meeting anyone that night named Phil, I said, no, I don't think there's a Phil here. Then that guy whose name I couldn't remember came up and joined the group and said, I'm right here. Don't worry, these guys are cool. I invited them. At that moment, I finally found out his name and I played it off as, oh, okay, well, if they are your friends, then I guess it's cool if they stay and just went with it. 3. A whole school year I knew their names. I just didn't know which twin was which and they weren't identical. 4. My name is apparently Darren to this nice couple who own a restaurant in my town. My name is not Darren. I've known them for two years. We're even FB friends. They can literally see and read my name. But it's cool. I always wanted to try being a Darren. 5. I've lived in my townhouse for almost five years now and I Don't know the name of the guy who lives directly across from me. I have pretty regular interactions with most of my neighbors, but I've never talked with this one guy beyond just exchanging pleasantries while passing each other. When I moved in and first met him, I immediately forgot his name. I was almost positive he said it was Mike. So I went about four years just assuming that was probably his name, but not quite confident enough to actually call him Mike. Then a few months ago, I was talking to some other neighbors in the parking lot when he walked by and my other neighbors called out, hey. So it was confirmed that this guy's name is not, in fact, Mike. And I was relieved. I hadn't been calling him that for the past 5 years. But I immediately forgot again what his name actually is. So now all I know is that it is something other than Mike. Maybe I'll learn his name by the time I've lived here 10 years. Six, a whole date. Someone fixed us up, but my dude never told me her name, just the address. She wanted me to pick her up. I didn't have the guts to ask her name between the date. She became a longtime GF after that date and we laughed about it. 7. My nickname in college was the mayor and I had people I had known for years coming up to me at my graduation. Saying, I had no idea your name was actually Dan.

Men should absolutely start doing one. As a former cook and current welder, hand motioning. My dad refused to use hand lotion for a while and he kept getting big cracks in his knuckles. The cold would destroy his skin. He would only put lotion on when it was basically bleeding, by which point it can't really do much help. Moisturize. To steal from Bill Burr, guys, you can put lotion on places other than your weapon. It still looks brand new while the rest of you looks like an aging pirate. You need to increase the circumference of the lotion distribution. 2, going to the doctor before it's too late. I am a doctor and seriously, the wives are always dragging them in there. That was my mom with my dad. He got sick, wasn't eating enough, didn't want to go to the doctor, collapsed in the kitchen and then she had to call 911. Turned out to be sepsis and he almost passed. Married men live like five years longer than unmarried men or something like that because of their wives forcing them to be seen. 3. Squat in the shower and reach under my dude. Pro tip, use hair conditioner when shaving any body part that isn't your face. It's much better than shaving foam but does make things slipper. So be careful. Also, if you shave your butt, prepare for an unholy swamp butt. I refuse to shave my butt anymore because The grow back is horrific. Four, my husband never really did pedicures before we met and the first time I did one for him, he was in love with it. I used a scraper to get the dead skin off his heels. He calls them hooves. Haha. And he was horrified at how much came off. He'll even inspect my work now and say this toenail is a little jagged. Do want me to look a messy? He likes being pampered. I'm happy to do it for him. 5. I was trying on jeans for work the other day and I found this magical material that stretches but looks like denim. I was gushing over them and my wife laughed and said a lot of women's jeans use that material and a lot of hers are the same. Men should discover these jeans. 6. A man started carrying a satchel years ago and never looked back. I mean, Indiana Jones has one. I'm a new man. Breath stinky. Boom. Here's some gum. Headache, boom. Here's a pill. Phone dead. Boom. Here's a charger. My little bag carries so much and has saved me so many times. 7. Separate shampoo, conditioner and body wash. 8, making an effort to make their home smell nice. The way you clean, taking a shower does not actually clean your shower. Washing your bedding with more frequency, buy a few candles, etc. You will feel more relaxed at home. And clean sheets are better for Your skin and health. 9, buying clothes when they should be replaced. I see so many men with holes in their socks and shirts with stretched collars. Please just get new ones instead of putting it off. Lol. 10. Prior girlfriends and now my wife have said I should sand my feet. Calluses off his office office. I'm in work boots all day and they get dried, crack and bleed. Now I have this cheese grater thing that I use occasionally and rub lotion on my feet a few times a week. I'm happy to no longer bleed from my feet as it is quite painful to work with open sores on my feet. I do miss having Spider Man feet that had these little Velcro like hooks on them that I'd rub on her legs to annoy her while in bed. I could attach to the sheets and move them with the bottom of my feet. Hey, 11 p. Sitting down.

Some nights I'd find him literally sleeping face first in his dinner plate or passed out on the bathroom floor with the shower still running. Two nights ago, he finally stumbled through the door around midnight with this huge grin on his exhausted face. We did it, he said. Boss gave us the rest of the week off.

We're sitting there having coffee when my mom asks where Tyler is. Since his truck's in the driveway, he's still sleeping, I said. My mom's face went all pinched. It's past noon. That's unacceptable with a pregnant wife. Wake him up. I explained the whole situation. Three weeks of hell. Fifty million dollar crisis. Barely any sleep. My dad just shook his head like Tyler was some lazy bum. I'm not waking him up, I said. He needs to rest. Well, if you won't do it, I will, my mom said, standing up and heading for the stairs.

We both jumped up and ran upstairs, and I found My sister standing in her doorway crying, like full on sobbing. Ethan was right there in the hallway looking all flustered and red in the face.

She thought maybe he was lost looking for the bathroom, so she tried to be polite and tell him it was downstairs.

When I turned eighteen, my parents sat me down for what they called a long overdue conversation. You need to move out, mom announced. Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live. Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster. When mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans, and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. The Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzalez explained proudly to the electrician. Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats ended through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement incident. Gonzalez filled Dad's gas tank with what he called Super Juice, a mixture of energy drinks, lighter fluid, and glitter. The car made

The first time I met Angela's father, he served everyone homemade wine, but handed me store bought beer. He said something in Italian to his brother while smiling at me, and Angela told me he was praising my manners, but I caught one word I recognized. Americano. American. My stomach dropped because his tone didn't match Angela's translation at all. That night, I downloaded a language app. We've been dating two years. I figured I had time to prove myself. Three months later, I understood basic phrases, but sounded terrible trying to speak. Easter dinner, her father kept switching between English and Italian. He'd say something nice in English, like he seems responsible, then immediately say something in Italian that made his brothers laugh. I understood non capisce niente doesn't understand anything. Then Mangia come un Bambino eats like a child. I just sat there pretending I didn't understand. Angela asked me later why I was so quiet. I told her I was just overwhelmed. She's squeeze my hand and said her dad was warming up to me. I wanted to laugh, but I needed him to think I was clueless. By month six, I understood most conversations, but sounded awful when I tried to speak. My tutor kept making me repeat the same phrases over and over. She told me my comprehension was great, but my accent was rough. Angela worked Saturday Mornings, I was actually at the Italian American Center learning traditional cooking from this nonna named Rosaria. She was tough but honest. Told me I understood like an adult, but cooked like a child. Month eight, almost ruined everything. Angela found my Italian workbook with hundreds of pages of notes. The worst part was that I've been documenting phrases I heard. Vocabulary practice. She went through them excitedly. She suggested maybe I could say Grace in Italian at Christmas. I agreed, knowing I was planning way more than that. Month 10, her father started switching to Italian mid conversation. Whenever I walked in the room, he'd wave and say it was family business, but he was getting more dismissive. He told his brother, America

When I was 10, my dad told me I couldn't ride my scooter in the garage, but when they went out for dinner one night, I decided I was gonna do it anyway. My dad had just bought his dream car, but it wasn't like I was gonna scratch it or anything. I was literally having the time of my life until I tripped and fell face first into the car, putting a huge dent in the side. My heart was racing so fast, I started crying and knew I'd be dead as soon as they saw it. I tried to cover it up, but I just ran to my room and hid under my blanket. They came home a few minutes later and someone knocked on my door. My dad walked in and as soon as he opened the door, I could see how mad he was. I was ready to get grounded and didn't make eye contact, but he said he just had to give my mom a ride because she forgot her purse at the restaurant. They went into the garage and by some miracle didn't see the dent. However, I knew they'd for sure see it by the time they got home. I tried thinking of an excuse, but eventually just accepted my fate. I waited for them to come home, but they didn't, which was really weird. An hour went by and our phone Rang, I answered it and it was my dad. He told me he was at the hospital and wouldn't be back until later because right after they left the house, someone ran a red light and totaled his car. My mom broke her leg and couldn't walk on it for months. But they never saw the dent. Bullet dodge.

I remember sitting in math when the bell rang, and I started walking towards the library to eat lunch. I was starving, but there was nowhere to sit except the very back. As soon as I sat down, I remember hearing a sound from the hallway that sounded like a door slamming onto the ground. Nobody really reacted, but then we heard a girl screaming outside the library. She came running down the hallway, and we heard the noise again. It was so silent in there until she yelled, somebody help! He has a gun! And everyone completely panicked. I remember freezing up because I didn't know where to go. The room was all windows, and everyone started flooding out the back door. I couldn't move, and another guy went to hide in a utility closet behind us. He told me to come inside, so I did. We sat there silently crying for about five minutes, slugging our ears. It felt like hours. And everyone screaming was gone. It was so quiet. So we opened the window on the door slightly to see out. As soon as I did, I saw they were inside the library. We stayed as silent as we possibly could, and my mom wouldn't stop texting me. We couldn't move, but I realized if my mom calls me, my phone would go off. If she called me, we probably wouldn't survive. We sat there With our hands over our mouths, trying to breathe as quietly as we could. And I was praying they wouldn't look inside. We could hear them right outside the closet we were in. But they started running out, and we heard the police in the school. We sat there for another hour until the police found us, and we made it out safe. When I asked my mom why she didn't call me, she said she didn't want it to ring in case I might be hiding

My son was 14 talking to a girl he really liked after class one day. Then another obnoxious kid who thought he was funny saw them and walks up to them. He just wraps his arms around her and hugs her. She shoved him away and told him to stop. And I think he was embarrassed, not knowing what to do. I think he tried to play it off as a joke and went back in for another hug. She again shoved him harder this time and said, seriously, don't do that. She wasn't smiling anymore and my son was really uncomfortable, unsure if he should do something about it. He didn't want to say anything since this kid was like twice the size of him and was known for fighting, he thought the girl could handle him anyways. He went back in for another hug, but this time my son stopped him. He stepped in the way, not letting him touch her and said, do, dude, she doesn't want you to touch her. Just stop. This kid really didn't like this at all and started to get mad. He shoved him and said, what are you gonna do about it? He had never been in a fight before, but he said, if you touch either of us again, I'm gonna lay you out. I guess he thought my son was just lying because he went in for another shove. This kid ended Up on the gym floor 10 seconds later, out cold. He had a concussion and broken nose. And of course, I had to go meet with his parents. When they got there, they were furious. But when they found out what really happened, his mom told him that it served him right.

While she was filling up our car, a man I'd never seen before came up to her and I opened the window a bit to hear what they were saying. He told her, I hate to see a single mother traveling alone. Do you want me to follow you just to make sure you're safe? My mom just smiled and told him it was okay. And he honestly seemed annoyed. He asked again, but she told him it was fine. A few hours later, we pulled over again and the same guy came walking up to her. He told her he was just checking on us. But while he was standing there, the wind was blowing his jacket. I could see the gun he was hiding on his waist. And when my mom got back in the car, I told her what I saw. She told me she saw it, too. And I could tell something was wrong. I think she was just trying to stay calm so my sister and I wouldn't start to worry, but told me to hold the steering wheel. She started writing something on a piece of paper and we pulled over again at the next gas station. She literally ran inside and then came back out to Keep driving. Turns out she wrote down what hotel we were staying at, gave the cashier some money and asked him to call them and have the police waiting there for us. The man was still following us. And when we got to the hotel, she rushed us inside. The manager was waiting and told us to go to our room. The same man apparently showed up right after us and asked if his wife and kids had checked in yet. He asked for a key. And when he gave it to him, he was ready to walk into our room. However, the key he had was actually to a different room. And when he walked in, the police were waiting inside. This guy was actually a convicted stalker and was arrested on the spot.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class. He went to the hospital and his parents threatened to sue the school. The very next day, we watched our principal walk out for the last time and the banana guy returned wearing his costume.

When I found out what Smurf Day was when I was in college, everyone told me they were really jealous of me because of one of my teachers. But I didn't really get why. He was old and quiet and just seemed like a normal guy to me. I heard a few people call him Mr Smurf, which really confused me. But eventually one guy asked if I had seen Smurf Day yet. I had no idea what he was talking about and thought it was a joke. When I asked him what he meant, he just said, you'll see. Apparently this guy had a three year old daughter and a few years, years before she was diagnosed with a rare brain disease, she was bedridden in the hospital. And after he was done teaching, he would go sit with her every night. And since the Smurfs was her favorite show, he'd always watch it with her. Apparently it got worse and she didn't have much longer. Since he was a single dad, he had to keep teaching to pay for everything. He'd come to class completely broken. However, eventually some students found out about this and started a gofundme for him. They raised over $15,000 so he could take time off work. And because of them, he got to spend her last few days with her. And since then, every year he shows up like this on her. Birthday.

I promised my entire third grade class that if they all got A's on my test, I'd do whatever they wanted me to. Well, they all decided on me eating a live worm in front of the entire school, so I hesitantly agreed. That weekend, I was completely shocked to see that not only did my class all get A's, but almost all of them got 100%. All except one. This girl really struggled in my class, but I could see she really tried. So I changed her grade to an A and told them they won. I found the most real looking fake worm I could, and that day during an assembly, the school told everyone I had a presentation for them. I ate it in front of the entire elementary school and they all screamed and laughed. They all bought it. And that same girls to enjoy seeing me do that the most. She thought it was so funny. She burst out giggling every time she saw me. Whenever I'd walk by her, she'd say, you ate a worm! You ate a worm! And we'd laugh together. She said it one time during lunch, and shortly after, I noticed another teacher was crying. She asked me if I could take over lunch duty for the day because she couldn't stop herself from tearing up. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me it was Because of that girl had absolutely no idea. But she had been abused by many of her mom's boyfriends and was severely traumatized by it. They tried everything for years, but this was the first time she ever actually saw her smile and laugh. We both had to find someone else to supervise lunch because I didn't want them to see me crying either.

When my daughter was 5, she begged me to put up Christmas lights for an entire day. She was literally crying because I was leaving for a work trip the next day and she told me Santa wouldn't come if our house wasn't decorated. It was really icy and snowing that day, but my wife told me to just do it. So I told her fine. I got the ladder and climbed up and my daughter passed me the lights and the colors she wanted. Right before we were almost finished, the slipped out from underneath me. I fell and hit my head on the concrete hard and remember the sound of her screaming. I didn't wake up until I was in the hospital later that day and felt the worst pain in my neck and back. I tried to feel for the bandages on my head, but strangely I didn't feel anything. I was really confused but barely managed to sit up and noticed I couldn't move my legs. I looked up and saw a nurse walk in the room and she looked really surprised. Five more people came in and all started asking me questions. I was really worried because I still couldn't move my feet no matter how hard I tried. I didn't know what was going on until an hour later when my wife finally got there. I was so happy. To see and didn't think anything about her. In tears, I asked who the girl she was with was because she was also crying. And when she walked closer, I made the most shocking realization of my life. This 13 year old was my daughter. And they broke the news. I was in a coma for almost nine years. I realized I had missed her entire childhood. I was paralyzed. My wife had remarried. But what hurt the most was when I went home to our house and I looked up at our roof. I broke down because those lights were still up.

My sister Emma has always been the type to make everything about her. When I got engaged, she announced her pregnancy at the same dinner. When I picked my wedding venue, she suddenly decided she was getting married there too, just six months later. So when she showed up to my wedding wearing a floor length white lace dress that literally looked bridal, I wasn't even surprised. The dress had a train. Guy. Guys! A freaking train! She walked into the church like she was the one getting married, posing for photos and accepting congratulations from confused relatives who thought she might be the bride. My bridesmaids were whispering about it during the ceremony. My maid of honor kept shooting me these worried looks like she was waiting for me to have a meltdown. But honestly, I was weirdly calm. Maybe it was the pre wedding yoga. Or maybe I was just done being shocked by Emma's behaviour. The real kicker was during cocktail hour, Emma positioned herself right next to the gift table, greeting guests like she was co hosting the wedding. She kept saying things like, we're so happy you could celebrate with us today and this is such a special day for our family. The photographer actually asked her to step out of some shots because guests were getting confused about who the bride was. My new mother in law pulled Me aside and whispered, honey, is your sister okay? She seems to think this is her wedding, too. That's when I knew I had to do something. During dinner, I was walking around with a glass of red wine, thanking guests for coming. Emma was holding court at table 6, showing off her dress to my college friends and talking about how she inspired my wedding aesthetic. She kept standing up and twirling, making the white lace swirl around her. As I approached her table, Emma jumped up again for another dramatic pose. She spun around right into my path, and I swear time slowed down. The wine glass in my hand tilted, and suddenly her pristine white dress had a giant crimson stain spreading across the front. Oh, my god, I'm so sorry! I gasped, grabbing napkins from the table. But inside, I was doing cartwheels. The stain looked like abstract art, completely ruining the bridal illusion she'd been working so hard to maintain. Emma's face went through about five different emotions in three seconds. Anger, embarrassment, then this weird, forced smile as she realized everyone was staring. It's fine, she said through gritted teeth. Accidents happen. My cousin Jake, who's always been savage, piped up from across the table, well, at least now everyone knows who the real bride is. The whole table went quiet. Then my college roommate started snorting with laughter. Emma excused herself to go clean up, but the damage was done. The wine had Soaked through the fabric and wasn't coming out with just water and soap. She came back 20 minutes later, wearing my backup emergency cardigan over the stained dress, looking absolutely miserable. The best part? My photographer caught the whole thing. There's this perfect shot of the wine hitting her dress, with my face in the background, looking shocked, but with this tiny smile that only I can see. It's hanging in our hallway now. For the rest of the reception, Emma sat quietly at her table, no longer commanding attention or posing for photos. She left early, claiming she had a headache. My wedding suddenly felt lighter, like someone had lifted a dark cloud.

I was 13 when my classmate Olivia invited me over for dinner. Our moms worked at the same office and Olivia's mom thought it would be nice for us to hang out. I barely knew Olivia. She was one of those kids who acted friendly but always seemed to think she was better than everyone else. My mom made me go anyway, saying it would be good for me to make new friends. I showed up right on time wearing my nicest dress and carrying a small box of chocolates my mom had picked out as a thank you gift. When I knocked on the door, Olivia's mom opened it and barely glanced at me before snatching the chocolates and tossing them on the kitchen counter like they were garbage. No thank you, no smile, nothing. The house smelled weird, like old food mixed with cleaning supplies. Olivia was sprawled on the couch scrolling through her phone and didn't even look up when I walked in. Her dad was watching TV in his underwear and a stained shirt. I stood there awkwardly for 10 minutes before Olivia's mom finally told us to sit at the dinner table. That's when things got really strange. Olivia's mom came out carrying only three plates. She set one down in front of me and I looked down at what was supposed to be my dinner. There was some grayish Meat that looked like it had been reheated multiple times, mushy green peas that were practically liquid, and two rock hard biscuits that could have been used as weapons. Olivia got her plate next and immediately made a disgusted face. She looked at her mom and said, didn't we give this exact same food to Pepper yesterday? Pepper was their golden retriever who is currently sleeping under the table. Olivia's mom just shrugged and said, we had leftovers. I wasn't going to let perfectly good food go to waste. I sat there staring at my plate trying to figure out if I was really being served dog food. Meanwhile, Olivia and her mom had completely different meals, fresh chicken breast with rice and steamed vegetables that actually looked edible. I politely asked if there had been some kind of mistake with my plate. Olivia's mom rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out of her head. Oh, honey, if you're going to be picky about what we're offering you, then you can just sit there and go hungry. We don't run a restaurant here. Olivia started giggling like this was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. I felt my face turn bright red with embarrassment. I tried to take a small bite of the meat just to be polite, but it tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for a week. Texture was rubbery and it had this sour aftertaste that made me gag. I Quickly put my fork down and asked if I could use their phone to call my mom. Olivia's mom gave me this look like I was a piece of trash she'd found stuck to her shoe. What's wrong now? The food not fancy enough.

My parents never planned to have another kid after Abby. She was their perfect little girl. Smart as hell. Played piano like Mozart, made honor roll every semester. But when she got hit by that drunk driver at age 8, everything changed. Nine months later, boom, there I was. I grew up thinking I lived in a museum. A house. Abby's room stayed exactly how she left it. Her bed made perfectly, her soccer trophies lined up on the shelf. Even her stupid math homework still pinned to the bulletin board. Nobody was allowed in there, not even me. My parents acted like they were babysitting someone else's kid when I was around. They take maybe three photos of me a year. And that was being generous. My birthdays were these weird, quiet affairs where mom would make a cake and we'd all sit there eating it in silence. No friends, no parties, nothing. Every July, they'd pack their bags and disappear for a week to visit Abby's grave. They drop me off at Mrs. Henderson's house next door and act like I didn't exist. Mrs. Henderson was nice enough, but I always wondered why I couldn't come with them to see my own sister. When I turned 13, I finally asked dad about Abby during dinner. Big mistake. His fork hit the plate so hard, I thought it cracked. She was perfect. He snapped, not even looking. At me, you don't get to ask about her. Mom just stared at her food like it was the most interesting thing in the world. That's when it hit me. I wasn't their son. I was their do over. Their second chance at getting what they really wanted. High school was brutal. I'd watch other kids complain about their parents being too involved, too loud at games, too embarrassing. Meanwhile, mine forgot to show up to my graduation. They said they had to work late, but I saw Dad's car in the driveway when I got home. That's when I started writing letters to Abby. Not because I believed in ghosts or anything, but because I needed to understand what made her so damn special that my parents couldn't love anyone else. Dear Abby, I wrote one night, I know you were awesome and everything, but I'm tired of living in your shadow. They wish you never died, and they wish I was never born. But here I am anyway. I left that letter taped to the attic door where they kept all her stuff. I figured if they wanted to worship their dead daughter so much, they might as well read what their living son had to say. The next morning, I found a dusty photo album slid under my bedroom door. No note, no explanation. Just this old book filled with baby pictures. My baby pictures. Pictures I'd never seen before.

Your family canceled your invitation, but asked to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid. I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list. Just entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously, they also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding videography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me. Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling On her end, um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings, LLC, right? What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services. Also owned by longer pot. Sunset Holdings, LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos. Elite Moment Studio. Oh, my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's. That's you, too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests. All owned by Sunset Holdings, LLC. Which is my company. Renee's Voice went up an octave. Mr. Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months, I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs, so my family wouldn't know their disappointment. Son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school seven years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are

He's having a breakdown and won't talk to anyone but you. What they didn't know was that I've been waiting for this call for years. See, my brother Dylan has always been the golden child, NBA from Wharton, six figure salary at 25, the perfect corporate success story. Meanwhile, I'm 31 with a psychology degree that my family constantly mocked as expensive feelings training. Growing up, every family gathering was the Dylan Appreciation Hour. His promotions, his bonuses, his networking events. When I tried to share anything about my therapy practice, dad would literally roll his eyes. Paige is still playing therapist with crazy. People say dismissively Dylan's actually contributing to society. My psychology degree cost $120,000. They assumed it was wasted money. Instead, I've been building something they never bothered to understand. I opened my own trauma therapy practice specializing in executive burnout and addiction. I charge $300 per session and I'm booked solid for six months out. My waiting list includes CEOs and several of Dylan's former colleagues who burned out from the same toxic work culture. The day they called, I was reviewing treatment plans for three Fortune 500 executives who'd crash and burned like Dylan was about to. He's been using cocaine daily for months. Mom sobbed into the phone. Lost his job last week, won't leave his apartment. The only person he's mentioned wanting to talk to is you. I knew this was Coming my business partner, Doctor Bennett, had warned me. I saw Dylan at that corporate networking event downtown. He was visibly high, completely manic. That industry chews people up and sits them out. I tried to hint to my parents that Dylan's lifestyle wasn't sustainable, but they brushed me off. You're just jealous of his success. Mom had snapped. Three hours after their call, dad showed up at my office unannounced. He looked around my professional waiting room, took in the diplomas on my walls, the high end furnishings. Paige, Dad said quietly, we had no idea your practice was this successful. I looked up from my client notes. What can I do for you, dad? We need you to help Dylan. He's refusing treatment, won't see any therapist, but he keeps asking for you specifically. I leaned back in my chair surrounded by my psychology credentials that they'd mocked for years. Dad, I specialize in executive addiction and trauma. My rate is $300 per session for family. It's still $300 per session. That's not the point, Paige. He's your brother. You have to help him. Actually, dad, I don't have to do anything. Just like you didn't have to support my career choice. Remember, mom joined the conversation. Paige, please. He won't get better without professional help and you're the only therapist he trusts. I smiled, checking my appointment calendar that was completely full. You know what's interesting, Last Thanksgiving you told everyone I was wasting my education on Damaged people said I never have real success like Dylan because I chose feelings over finance. I was wrong. I'm sorry, but Dylan could die if he doesn't get help. Dylan cleared his throat from the doorway. He looked terrible, gaunt, shaking, probably hasn't slept in days. Paige, I know. I never respected what you do. I always thought my work was more important.

I stopped asking how her day was, not out of spite, but because I realized I didn't actually care to hear the same rehearsed complaints. I wanted to see what would happen if I let conversations die instead of always keeping them going. At first she didn't notice, but as days passed, I saw it sinking in. She throw out comments like, you've been quiet lately, or everything okay, but I just shrugged them off. Then something strange happened. She started trying, bringing me coffee when I was working late, suggesting we watch movies together. But instead of jumping at these scraps of attention, I let her efforts hang in the air, unacknowledged. I needed to see if it was real or just another way to smooth things over. One night, she asked directly, are you mad at me? Her voice was quieter than usual. I looked at her and said, the one thing I've been holding back. I'm just done trying harder than you. The words hit her like a slap. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I had the upper hand. Not because I'd won some argument, but because I'd finally stopped apologizing for wanting more than she was willing to give. The next morning brought text messages. We need to talk. I ignored them. When I got home, she was pacing, ready with a rehearsed speech. What do you want? I asked, dropping my keys on the counter. You're acting like a stranger in our own house, she said. I'm just following your lead, sweetheart. You made it pretty clear what this marriage is and what it isn't. She turn defensive. I'm allowed to set boundaries. If you can't handle that, maybe that's your problem. You're right, I said calmly. You don't owe me intimacy. But let me ask you this. Do I owe you commitment? Do I owe you loyalty? Do I owe you anything beyond basic civility? Her eyes widen. I saw fear crack through her expression. Because if we're playing by those rules, maybe I don't owe you date nights, emotional support, or even coming home at the end of the

She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability.

What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully.

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice, and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under six. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts passive aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of her. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava and a tutu with one sock, and baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. They'd literally just dumped them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason, straight to voicemail, texted Amber. Nothing. They turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel my Life for their convenience. This was their master plan. Force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childfree. Most people would stay home and complain. Not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing anyway. Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said, you're absolutely insane, then helped me strap Liam into a life vest. Like this. Think she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen songs at every passing kayaker like she was performing at Carnegie Hall. Liam tried catching fish with his bare hands and nearly looked out of his tube twice. Jackson actually calmed down once we got moving. The motion and fresh air put him right to sleep. Other river goers stared at our bizarre parade. A guy in a canoe asked if they were all mine. No, I said cheerfully. Just the world's most reluctant babysitter taking revenge on manipulative relatives. After tubing, we hit this dog friendly taco truck lot near Clara's Ice. She brought her rescue Mutt, Peaches, who immediately became the fourth child. Kids went absolutely wild over the picnic tables and dogs running around. We got them quesadillas with mild cheese and churros, which ended up mostly decorating Ava's face and hair. Jackson passed out in his stroller. Clutching half a churro like a trophy. I documented everything on Instagram. Photos of the kids laughing in tubes covered in churros, playing with dog dogs looking absolutely delighted. I captioned it in prompt to adventure babysitting. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected moments. Thanks for the practice run. By the time we got home, all three were exhausted but genuinely happy. They fell asleep within minutes. Ava on my couch with glitter still sparkling on her forehead. Liam snoring with one shoe mysteriously missing. Jackson sleeping like

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text at 7:00am, could you Drop off my work laptop. Sure, I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday, can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else. Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't Admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie, Marissa, had been extra friendly all night, kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted, what was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend and I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week 3, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd.

When my son was in the third grade, he was a bully. We tried everything, but he kept constantly getting in trouble and sent to the office. He was known throughout the school for tying balloons to the class rabbit and almost letting it float away. I was leaving work to go get him and as my phone rang, I already knew who it was. I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. Entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything and she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in real time. Then as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

She came running down the hallway, and we heard the noise again. It was so silent in there until she yelled, somebody help! He has a gun! And everyone completely panicked. I remember freezing up because I didn't know where to go. The room was all windows, and everyone started flooding out the back door.

And finally, after all of this time, all three of them have been indicted on these charges. So like I said, he applied for bereavement leave before she ever passed away. But after she passed away, he Tried to play the role of the grieving partner, things like this. He posted this 15 days after he allegedly took her life. Baby, I'm hurting bad off this one. I love you all. Just this year, he posted this, my Valentine forever. And he made many other posts about her like he had nothing to do with it. She was supposed to meet her baby that day. So not only was that robbed from her, but everything from that child was taken, too. For what? I will keep you guys updated on what ends up happening to them. I just don't understand how you can even get two more people to be willing to help you do this. The fact that kayvon would even consider doing it is crazy. But to find two other people who are willing to do this with you is unbelievable. I'm so sorry for her family.

My brother Bruce literally brought an inflatable unicorn pool float to our family beach reunion for me to use because he thought I was still terrified of water. After nearly dying in a neighbour's pool at age five, I was constantly terrified of drowning. And since then, every family vacation involved my parents bribing me to put my toes in the water while my three older brothers surfed. Even now, Bruce brings up how I wore a life jacket in the hotel hot tub until I was 16. The teasing got to be too much for me and so I've kept my distance from my family for all but holidays and birthdays for the past few years. Last summer, at my grandmother's 85th birthday, changed everything. She'd rented this beach house for the entire extended family. During breakfast, my aunt presented me with children's arm floaties she bought as a joke. Just in case a big wave comes, she said. While everyone took photos, Bruce grabbed them and tried shoving them on my arms. Safety first for our little scaredy cat, he announced to relatives filming on their at the beach. My mom held my hand walking across the sand. Dad steered me toward the umbrellas while everyone else grabbed paddleboards. You can be the official photographer, he said, putting a plastic dolphin whistle around my neck. If anyone needs help, you blow this. Really? I sat next To my 87 year old great aunt. While relatives treated me like the beaches. Make a wish, kid. My cousin's wife asked if I had a medical condition. She's terrified of anything deeper than a puddle, my mom explained, while my aunt added, we used to blow dry her tears after bath time, because even those had too much water. An hour later, Bruce decided to show off some girl he'd met. He stood on his board, shouting, watch this! Unlike my sister, I'm not scared of water. Before paddling out further than everyone else, I watched him drift left with the current. Red flags were stiff in the wind, but nobody noticed. Then he threw his arm.

I'm 32 and my girlfriend's parents still think I'm pouring cheap beer at some dive bar. Last week her mother cornered me in their kitchen while my girlfriend was upstairs. She pressed $300 in my hand and whispered for gas money. I know those tips can't be much. My girlfriend comes from old money and I started working at 14. Her parents never miss a chance to remind me where I belong. We've been together two years, but every family dinner felt like a job interview. I was failing. Last night was her father's retirement party. 300 guests at the country club. At the entrance, her mother looked at my watch and frowned. The coat check had a lost and found if you need something more appropriate. It was a ten thousand dollar Rolex. She assumed it was fake. During cocktail hour, her mother dragged me around. This is Doctor Morrison and Judge Williams. Then me. This is my daughter's boyfriend. He works in the service industry. Her Aunt Patricia asked what exactly I did. Before I could speak, her mother said, he pours drinks beer, mostly downtown somewhere. Patricia touched my arm sympathetically and asked about my career goals. Her father intercepted me by the bar. You parked in the member lot. Staff and vendors use the back entrance. The guard mentioned your car doesn't have a member sticker. I drove a hundred thousand dollar Mercedes. He assumed I'd stolen the spot. Then he pulled up his phone. There's a management training program at this restaurant chain. Six week course. I know the regional director. He showed me the application. Thirty five thousand to start, but it's steady. At dinner, they put us at table 23, near the service station. Her parents sat at the head table under a chandelier. Her father gave his retirement speech. He thanked his colleagues, praised his children's accomplishments. When he mentioned my girlfriend, he said, still waiting for her to find someone worthy of the family name. He stared at me while the room chuckled. After dessert, her parents ambushed us by the restrooms. Her mother had printed emails from her friend's husband. He owns several franchises. Fast food. But management track. 40,000 to start. My phone exploded with notifications.

Like, bro, it's second period, you're gonna smell like wet donkey balls all day. And the gym teachers don't help. They're like, give me your best effort, sir. This is not the Olympics. It's Wednesday, 9:30 a. M. And we're playing kickball. Nobody should be breathing that hard before lunch. Then you see kids acting like dodgeball decides their whole future, sliding on the floor, dripping sweat, shirts sticking to them like duct tape. All of this just to go sit in science class leaking onto the desk. And now the whole row smells cooked. You're stuck breathing in wet donkey balls in class because someone thought he was LeBron James at 9:00am. Hard to focus on the math problems in front of me when there's a stench like that behind me. The air is actually unlivable. Every class after feels like punishment. Follow for more rants.

My wife Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked, because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is. Is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I know Miss Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put On this red dress I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner, she pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. All's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How is Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. I kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car Broke down out of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. Forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing. Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach. What about them? I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party, made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind She was. Paul forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop! I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff. But then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. Next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. She started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know exist. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secretaries, bookmark folders labeled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own, reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic, how to look expensive, feminine energy. She that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. She started using therapy be to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops, emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd learn these words somewhere and weaponize them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward 8th graders and high schoolers who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. She was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids at Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history. Created fake contact names. Emma Mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult, hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she'd insert herself into adult conversations about work, drama and relationships, bringing advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences she didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16. Not 11. With a whole fabric in a backstory about being held back. Started lying about everything. Library visits that were really mall, trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist, sleepovers at houses I never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music blasting to cover phone conversations. He stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare. One word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow, taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an 11 year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched Father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, PTA volunteer, my neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth five more minutes like I was embarrassing her that night. I waited until she was.

I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done, and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said these would be perfect for my birthday, I just said cool and kept folding laundry. When he asked what restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner, I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day, and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, clearly expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second, then snapped my fingers. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, babe. Have a good day at work. His face went through about five different emotions. Confusion, hurt, anger, then this weird panic. That's it? You're not taking the day off? We don't have dinner plans? I shrugged, grabbing my keys. I've been super busy with work stuff lately. Haven't really had time to plan anything. When I got home that night, he was sitting at the kitchen table looking defeated. You really forgot my birthday, he said quietly. I didn't forget, I replied. I just figured if birthdays aren't important enough to remember without reminders, then maybe we shouldn't make such a big deal about them. The realization hit him like a truck. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally said, this is about your birthday, isn't it? What about my birthday? I asked innocently. He put his head in his hands. I've been a complete idiot. Yeah, I said, you have been. The next morning I woke up to rose petals leading from our bedroom to the kitchen, where he'd made my favourite breakfast and had a jewellery box sitting next to my coffee. Inside was a necklace that looked exactly like my mom's missing one. I know I can't undo the past three years, he said, but I swear I will never forget again.

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch, her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious. That night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she would texting, you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her. And when we went to dinner that night, She asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. Made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot! I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven PM, Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down, her face, shaking
