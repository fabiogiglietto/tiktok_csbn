It turned out the woman was sick. Jack was checking where her wound was. After that, Jack applied honey to the wound. However, the pain made Jenny pass out. In the afternoon, Jack went out to treat patients and found that Lisa's car had broken down. When Lisa saw Jack, she was overjoyed because Jack had cured the tumor on her body. But Kelly was very upset as her carriage hadn't been fixed yet. Just then, Ava passed by and repaired the carriage. Later, Lisa gave Jack two barrels of beer and left. Jack was wondering how to take the beer back when he suddenly remembered he still needed to visit a patient. So he asked Ava to keep an eye on the beer and hurried off. Meanwhile, a giant was helping the villagers move the huge rock that was blocking the river. The village chief then took out some food to offer to the giant, but the giant said this little bit of food wasn't enough for her. After that, she gave her own food to the villagers. Finally, Jack came back. He had called Emily, the princess of the Centaur clan, to help carry the beer. As it was getting dark, Jenny wondered why Jack hadn't come back yet. Mia said Jack might have gone on a date. At that moment, the Harvey clan brought a large amount of food. It turned out the giant had sent It to thank Jack just then. Jack finally return.

Only soldiers from the enemy country arrived instead. Because of the cruelty and oppression of the war, the soldiers took out their long suppressed emotions on the girl. the girl still firmly believed that the gods would come to save her. In reality, however, the gods did not care about their lives at all. 800 years ago, when the demon race appeared, all of humanity was on the brink of extinction. It was then that the first generation war gods were born among the remaining humans. They possessed immense power and even immortal bodies. Soon, the war for gods turned the tide of the war. To prevent the demon race from returning, they sealed the demons at the cost of their own lives. And to keep the seal from being broken, they left the youngest among them, Jenny, to guard it. For hundreds of years, Jenny not only protected the seal, but also searched for and trained new war gods later. To help the new recruits grow quickly, she used an extremely unusual training method. She kept beating them until they could no longer move. One day, Lisa obtained a piece of intelligence. A large group of humans had gathered near a glacier. So they went to investigate, only to find a giant demon trapped inside the glacier as new.

At first glance, nothing seemed unusual. But if you look closely, the water looked kind of weird. It was dark and full of bubbles. Still, she was happily diving and playing around in that foamy water, thinking it was just regular sea foam from waves crashing against the rocks behind. She had no idea what was actually going on. As soon as she uploaded the video to TikTok, it blew up, over 60 million views in just one day. People in the comments immediately started pointing out that it might not be sea foam at all, but sewage. Yep, a sewage contamination. The dark color of the water could be explained, but those bubbles were a clear sign of bacterial activity, decomposition, basically. But then a local chimed in, a maintenance worker who said he works on that very beach. He revealed that earlier that morning, just about 150 meters from where she was swimming, a sewage pipe had burst, which mean she was literally swimming in raw sewage that the city had ended up dumping into the ocean. The concentration of sewage was estimated to be around 20 to 30%. It's honestly hard to understand how she didn't notice the smell.

The cheating accusations came about when test proctors cheating was thought to be the only. Did you cheat? Absolutely not. No. The sisters say they were immediately treated like pariahs by their fellow students. Years. We were just invited from several weddings. They said they had no choice but to leave the school. But the sisters fought back. They sued the school for defamation. And they put forward a very plausible explanation. First, they testified that they always test alike. Second, they always study together too. Always been within a percentage point of each other. Look, they scored exactly the same on the S A T's. Six years later, Kayla and Kelly have finally won their battle. A jury found in their favour and awarded the twins $1.5 million.

Help! Help! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! This man might have to pay $300,000 for saving a baby's life after he accidentally fractured the baby's arm during the rescue. The baby's mother sued him for that amount to cover medical expenses. In Orlando, Florida, David Walker was walking down the street when he heard a scream coming from a building. Looking up, he saw a baby falling from a fourth floor balcony. Without thinking, he stretched out his arms and managed to catch the baby just before it hit the ground. He then handed the baby to its mother, who ran over to receive it, thanking David for his bravery. However, three days later, David received a legal notice. The mother accused him of breaking the baby's arm and demanded $300,000 in compensation. In court, David, in tears, explained that he only wanted to save the child and never intended to harm him. His lawyer argued that under Florida law, he should be considered a savior and not an aggressor, as his actions were not guilty. But the judge and jury decided that even though David was covered by the good Samaritan law, the consequences of his actions were severe, so they sentenced him to pay $100,000 in compensation. David, disappointed with the ruling, said he would never again intervene in other people's problems. Do you think this trial was fair? Let us know your opinion in the comments.

Onkel, ich habe wirklich Schwierigkeiten in letzter Zeit. diesen Satz hasse ich am meisten. wer hat keine Probleme? du hast keine Probleme oder ich habe keine oder diese Leute haben keine. ich gebe dir nur 3 Tage Zeit, zahle die restliche Miete oder verschwinde. seine Schwester ist noch in der Schule. der Hausmeister passt auf sie auf. wegen der Arbeit kommt der Mann spät. er sieht seine kleine Schwester und muss weiterhin alles ertragen. er will nicht, dass seine Schwester genauso leidet wie er. der Junge entschuldigt sich beim Hausmeister, Entschuldigung, dass ich sie vom Feierabend abgehalten habe, macht nichts. ich wohne hier. das Mädchen geht mit seinem Bruder und verabschiedet sich vom Großvater. der Junge bringt seine Schwester zur Schule und ermahnt sie, nimm pünktlich deine Medizin. die Schwester schaut zu ihrem Bruder, winkt und sagt. tschüss und geht in die Schule. sie grüßt den Großvater am Morgen. der Junge findet den Arzt seiner Schwester. der Arzt sagt ihm, momentan ist ihr Zustand gut, aber sie muss weiter Medikamente nehmen. der Husten hat nichts mit der Herzkrankheit zu tun. die Herzkrankheit deiner Mutter und die deiner Schwester sind völlig unterschiedlich. obwohl Herzkrankheiten vererbbar sind, bedeutet das nicht, dass die Symptome gleich sind. sie ist jetzt 5 Jahre alt. vor dem 7. Lebensjahr ist die beste Zeit für eine Operation. das habe ich dir schon oft gesagt. auch wenn es jetzt harmlos aussieht, wird ihr Körper nach dem 7.. Lebensjahr sehr schwach. so kann es nicht weitergehen. das wird sehr problematisch. du musst sofort Geld auftreiben. der Junge nickt hilflos. das Mädchen lehnt sich an ihren Bruder und fragt leise, Bruder, werde ich sterben? werden wir getrennt? der Junge sagt seiner Schwester, nein, das wird nicht passieren. bald können wir die Operation machen. wird die Operation wehtun? nein, es tut nicht weh. wenn du aufwachst, ist alles vorbei.

Effraie le patron sur le champ mais prouve 1 chose, Jacques n'est pas quelqu'un d'ordinaire. Le chef de la sécurité lui attribue 1 chambre et l'avertit strictement sans autorisation, il n'a pas le droit de sortir. Dès que le chef quitte la pièce, Jacques commence immédiatement à inspecter chaque recoin pour s'assurer qu'il n'y a ni caméra ni dispositif d'écoute installée. 1 fois totalement certain, il sort 1 téléphone caché dans la semelle de sa chaussure. En réalité, ce patron n'est pas qu'un simple homme d'affaires dans l'ombre, il est l'un des plus grands trafiquants de drogue de l'Ouest. Les agents fédéraux ont trouvé Jacques et veulent qu'il infiltre l'organisation en devenant l'un de ces hommes. Pour rendre son identité crédible, ils ont même monté toute 1 mise en scène, 1 agent se fait passer pour 1 ravisseur et kidnappe le fils du trafiquant. Jacques joue alors le rôle du héros et réussit à sauver l'enfant, le mettant en lieu sûr. Pour gagner encore plus la confiance du trafiquant, Jacques Abba même 1 policier. Bien sûr, c'est 1 complice et la balle ainsi que le sang ne sont que des accessoires. Le fils du trafiquant ne sort jamais sans garde du corps et maintenant que celui-ci est mort, il n'aura pas d'autre choix que de supplier Jacques de le ramener chez lui en échange d'une grosse somme d'argent. Exactement ce que Jacques attendait, utiliser l'argent comme prétexte pour Approcher le baron de la drogue. Peu après, ils arrivent au domaine. Toute personne entrant ou sortant doit subir 1 fouille complète. Le garde qui inspecte Jacques est encore plus massive que lui et porte 1 mitrailleuse lourde, comme si c'était normal. Jacques finit par être autorisé à entrer et se retrouve face au trafiquant. Mais même si Jacques a sauvé son fils, le trafiquant exige tout de même qu'il laisse son empreinte digitale. Puis il ordonne au chef de la sécurité de surveiller Jacques en permanence. Très vite, il découvre tout sur son identité et Jacques est escorté vers 1 pièce de stockage. À la surprise de Jacques, le trafiquant admire son passé militaire et lui propose 1 poste de garde du corps, comme s'il venait de trouver la recrue parfaite

We go out to the old wells and bring kegs and circle up the cars on the pad and, I don't know, just dance and blow off some steam. How fun. Um, yeah, yeah, I'd love to go. What time? 9 or so. Okay. Yeah, I'd love to go. Great. Well, I'll come over and grab you. Okay. Thank you. Of course. Nice to meet you. Ah, you too.

Blood work shows that there never was. She's presenting with abdominal pain, soreness, and nausea. The ER gave her meds to ease the pain. My doula wasn't worried, but I just want to make sure my baby's okay. So you don't have a doctor where I live. It's a tight knit community, kind of off the grid. We don't believe in traditional medicine. No one came with you? No. My baby's dad left a few months ago. He doesn't live with us anymore. Oh, dad. Sorry. I need help. Patient is presenting as 7 months pregnant. Rounded belly, pronounced breast changes, sensation of fetal movement. Came in with abdominal pain. Worried about the baby. And what did the ultrasound show? A concerning mass. We need a CT and a biopsy right away. So why do you need me? Because of what it didn't show. There's no baby in her uterus. Blood work shows that there never was. Let's get you into the scan. Oh, good. I'm not too late. Anne. Sorry, who are you? I am Megan's family. And you may not do a CT scan on her. We don't take orders from you. It's bad for the baby. It is? No, it's an acceptable level of radiation. Given our concerns and what we need to look for, you need to come home now. Okay? I will. Megan, I. I'm sorry, Sister Anne. I just had to make sure the baby's okay. We'll take Care of you both. You can't trust these people. She can. And. And she clearly knows that, or she wouldn't have traveled four hours to get here. Megan, I can't put radiation in my baby. Then we can do an MRI, which doesn't use radiation. Her pain will only get worse if she leaves here without treatment. Fine. But where she goes, I go. You're sure this won't hurt the baby? The MRI is not harmful. Our goal is to heal people, not hurt them. I know you don't understand the way we live, but I will be just as much a mother to that baby as Megan. I'm sure it'll be wonderful for her to have that support. When she came to us, she was quite lost. Everyone can see what this baby has done for her. Oh, for God's sake. There's no baby. What are you talking about? You brainwashed her into needing it to feel special, and now here we are. That is not possible. She is obviously pregnant. No, Megan's suffering from a complex delusion that causes her body to mimic the effects of pregnancy. It's rare. So you're manipulating her? No more than you people are. And we'd better talk outside. You all think your way is so much better. I'm not debating this. What matters is Megan. Do you care about her? Of course I do. Well, she has a tumor. If we don't treat it, she could die. That landing. Now, since you Know what a CT is? I'm pretty sure you've heard of a psychotic break. That's where she's headed if we destroy her fantasy right now. We need to treat her physically first. And if I decide to take her someplace else to do that? You're right. We don't know you or what's going on where you're from. But whatever it is, I have DCYF, State Police, and the FBI on speed dial. So if you even think about trying to move her or breathe one word of this to Megan, you'll have an army of blue wind breakers knocking down your doors. I'm assuming that's not what you want. I need to make a call.

Whitney cares more about this team than anybody. She played on a fucked up knee when they pressured her to shooting her up with all these pain meds just to get through it. And when the anxiety from all that gave her a panic attack. She couldn't have one damn day off when she asked for it. She deserves better. I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys I wanted to. I just I couldn't take on more stress. Okay, okay, great. Does anyone else have anything that they would like to get off their chest?

I rushed into the restroom, lathered soap all over my chin, and shaved it off. But to my disbelief, the beard grew back instantly, thicker and darker than before. I was on the verge of a breakdown. Just then I noticed the same woman secret we taking photos of me and posting them online, where they quickly went viral. I hated her with every fiber of my being, but I was powerless. I couldn't face anyone like this. As panic set in, I slide a first aid kit on the wall. I grabbed a bandage, determined to rip the beard out by the roots. I no longer cared about the pain. Taking a deep breath, I yanked with all my strength. Tears welled in my eyes from the stinging agony. I glanced in the mirror, only to find the beard had returned, now accompanied by a goatee. My composure shattered, I started sobbing softly. But within seconds, a brilliant idea struck me. Energy surged through me. I peeked out cautiously and noticed a man's jacket hanging nearby. I threw it on. This, disguised myself skillfully, and walked confidently over to the woman. I acted smitten at first sight, giving her a flirtatious wink. She blushed deeply, completely disarmed by my charm. Seeing she'd fallen for my act, I pulled her in for a kiss. Just like

I decided to jump into the sea to cool it down. A rich man nearby was stunned by the sight. I leaped into the water and the sea sizzled and steamed around my armor. Soon I realized the danger. The armor was so heavy, I kept sinking deeper. See me in trouble? The rich man felt a search of protectiveness. He picked up his diamond studded cane and slowly walked over. After an hour and a half, he finally reached me and dragged me to shore. I gasped for air. When he reached out his hand, I couldn't help but blush. I decided to repay him properly. Meanwhile, my husband was still snoring. Soon the rich man brought me to his mansion. I was amazed by his wealth. His villa had many huge locks. He must have been incredibly rich. Just his bedroom was 1,000 square meters. I stared in disbelief. He had fallen for me. At first sight, I pointed at the lock on my armor. He stared hard, open his mouth wide and bit the lock, but his dentures fell out. Soon, though, he had a better idea. He LED me to his vault, open a safe and took out a bottle of lotion. She squeezed all over me, but my armor still wouldn't come off. Then my clever mind came up with a brilliant idea. I took out my phone and decided to call a locksmith. The rich man was impressed by my intelligence. With professional help, my armor was finally removed. What he didn't expect was that I was after his fortune all along and that locksmith was actually my husband. We made a perfect team. I open the safe and my husband backed all the gold and jewels.

After filling his stomach, he ventured deeper into the island. He passed through a dense forest, where he spotted a group of meerkats surrounded by clear pools of water. The boy joyfully jumped in and swam, heart soaring with happiness. He was so thrilled to be alive that he forgot all his pain. And the tiger was even more excited. This place felt like paradise to him. Boy calmed himself down and tied his girlfriend's necklace to a tree branch. With the island offering plenty of food, he decided to stay for a while. But soon danger made him reconsider. At sunset, the meerkats rushed up into the trees as though terrified. The tiger also sensed something wrong and ran back toward the lifeboat. First, the boy didn't pay much attention and continued to play with the little animals. But as night fell, he noticed something strange. Many dead fish floated in the pools, and the once clear water had turned into strong acid. The island was Hiding a deadly secret.

Then in the next moment, something unbelievable happened. The ice cream in her hand actually turned into chicken nuggets. And even the bowl of ice cream on the table transformed into leftover chicken pieces from the fridge. This was just the beginning. The girl was still trying to make sense of it. Suddenly, her phone rang. It was her best friend Lena calling. She told her that she had bumped into her ex boyfriend on the way. But Ella wasn't interested in her love story at all. So she replied, I can't talk right now. However, the very next second, her voice completely stopped. No matter how hard she tried, not a single word would come out. Then she remembered the ice cream incident and quickly texted Lena saying, I can't talk. At that exact moment, her voice returned. To check if it was true, she sent another text, I'm wearing a blue T-shirt. When she looked down, T-shirt really had turned blue. Now Ella was super excited. She texted, I'm having pizza for dinner. Right then, the fried chicken on the table turned into pizza. Next, her eyes landed on her test paper and she wrote, I got full marks on my test.

He's been doing it relentlessly for 35 years. But the strange thing is he combs his hair with an old toothbrush. Even his mirror is nothing more than the shiny side of a nail clipper. That's not the weirdest part. Every morning, he hangs a plastic bottle in the air, pierces a few holes with a needle and bathes under the dripping water, calm as ever. Once done, he slips on his vest, puts on his headphones and begins his morning workout. But his gym is no fancy place, just a narrow staircase lined with snacks and soda cans. When he's finished, he kneels down quietly, removes his headphones and begins to pray. Yet his prayer isn't to any god. It's to a small red bag resting by the wall. His eyes are firm because without that little bag, he wouldn't survive in this endless loop. For 35 long years, that bag has been the only thing keeping him alive. When the prayer ends, he opens it. He takes out a juice box, places it carefully beside the wall, then pulls out a stack of cash and adds it to the growing mountain of money beside him. After that, he cleans the bag, folds it neatly, and his day's work is done. He leans back, opens a book and starts to read as if time itself has stopped. The old man who lives upstairs is the complete opposite. After 35 years of being Trapped here, he's lost all will to live. Now he only eats and sleeps surrounded by piles of garbage. His corner a decaying mirror of despair, a sharp contrast to the man below, who still clings to routine and to the illusion of hope.

Let's start here and if all goes well, I'm sure you'll have your private phone time soon. Okay, hello, Mr and Mrs. Adams. I have Kayla here with me and she's very eager to say hello, mom. Hi honey. It feels so good to hear your voice. We've been trying to get in touch with you for a while honey, but I guess somebody's having too much fun to talk, huh? Here at apalooza, it takes time for the students to earn phone privileges. They're each on a different path. What you been up to? You been horseback riding yet? No swimming? Gotta get in that pool girl. Someone's almost done right honey? Is everything okay? Mom, you gotta come get me. It's terrible here.

I am very sorry, but as we warned you last week, Kayla is concocting these stories to try to manipulate you to make you feel guilty so you'll come and get her. No, no one was stabbed. There's no need for concern really. This is A common attack. Kayla is doing very well here. She's taking time to adjust to the full program, but that's completely normal. Thank you. I'll check in next week. Now, if you promise never to do anything like that again, I won't tell Miss Connie, I promise.

She kept the customer's words in mind. When she got home, she began improving her dumpling wrappers.

However, when she set up her stall again, not a single person was willing to buy her dumplings. Other vendors were swamped with customers, while her stand sat cold and empty.

All of them worked under one man, the director, who controlled the whole show. Before long, the first group of visitors slowly entered the park.

The moment they moved behind it, the lion suddenly flipped over, revealing its face. Still, the visitors weren't impressed and walked off disappointed. Next, the group headed toward the polar bear exhibit. The man in the polar bear suit, actually the zoo's former director, was so nervous, he hid behind a rock, trembling nonstop. Not wanting the guests to leave unhappy, the director forced the old man to step out and at least put on a bit of a show.

With nowhere to retreat, Mel could only construct a crude refuge. However, the makeshift hut couldn't withstand the downpour. When Dick went hunting at dawn, he discovered his sister nearly lifeless.

After a careful examination, the doctor said no treatment was necessary. He only advised her to refrain from any intimate activity with her boyfriend. For a while, the woman looked puzzled. She had been single for years and didn't even have a boyfriend. To the doctor's surprise, she showed up again the very next day. This time, she claimed there was a strange Mark on her back and feared it might be cancer. After checking, the doctor realized it was nothing more than a love bite and gently told her to ask her boyfriend to be more careful next time. But once again, the woman firmly denied it, insisting she hadn't been with a man in over two years. Before she could say more, the doctor quietly pulled a few strands of her hair for testing, suspected she might have been exposed to some kind of unusual drug. But before the lab results turned, the woman was back in the hospital for the third time. This time, she claimed she was bleeding. An ultrasound was immediately arranged. The scan revealed something shocking. She had just experienced a miscarriage marriage. The woman froze in disbelief, insisting she had never been intimate with anyone. The doctor was equally bewildered. To uncover the truth, he asked if she suffered from sleepwalking or any mental health issues. The woman said she was usually fine, only that lately she woke up every morning feeling completely exhausted, as if She'd been living another life in her sleep.

But this moment of impulse took a physical toll on her and dragged her life into the abyss. Orphaned as a child, rose had never known warmth until she met her partner. His endless care and affection gave her the comfort and happiness of a real home. Their time together was filled with laughter, and to others their life seemed undoubtedly perfect. One ordinary morning, while rushing to work, rose crossed paths with a stranger at a traffic light. Their eyes met, and for a moment she forgot all about going to the office. This unexpected encounter stirred an unfamiliar flutter deep in her heart, and she couldn't help but glance back as he walked into a bookstore on the corner. Once at her office, she found herself checking if she looked good that day. She even snuck over to the window, hoping to catch another glimpse of the stranger. Her mind drifted during meetings, and finally rose made up her mind. She found an excuse to leave work for a while. Chasing that sudden spark, she rushed to the bookstore, and through the glass window her eyes met the man's who was looking out from inside, his gaze meeting her cheek.

And surprisingly, she found herself enjoying it. She had excellent grades and was accepted into a prestigious national university. Her family was ecstatic when they saw her acceptance letter, but the steep tuition fees cast a shadow over their joy. That night, the family went out to a restaurant to celebrate and her boyfriend joined them. But he seemed strangely upset and she immediately noticed his mood. He told her that they'd soon be in a long distance relationship, then broke up with her. However, once she arrived at college, the sadness quickly faded. After dropping her off at school, her father's salary was slashed in half due to a job transfer. The family's modest income could no longer cover her tuition. So the girl began searching for quick paying jobs online and soon found a casting call for adult film actresses. She secretly snapped a photo of herself and sent it to the company. The next day, she was informed that she'd been hired. Excited, she immediately booked a flight to the company. But when she arrived for the shoot, seeing her strong, dominant male co star made her want to back out. After filming, she cried as she washed up.

No.4, Harry Styles. In one show, right in front of a crowd of countless fans, Harry Styles accidentally ripped his pants, creating an incredibly awkward moment. No. 3, Beyonce. During one of her performances, Beyonce threw her microphone while dancing. And that could explain why on later tours she used a rope to secure the mic to her hand. No. 2, Tate Mccray. Tate Mccray also had a microphone mishap during one show. And in another performance, he kicked off her shoes in the middle of the set. No. 1, Taylor Swift. One of Taylor Swift's signature moves is her stage dive. But during one performance, just as she was about to leap off the stage, she realized the stage mechanism wasn't ready for her.

She straightened her right leg, pointing her toe. She struggled to balance on her toes. And finally, she bent both knees. Some thought she was wearing the wrong outfit, but in reality, she was showing off ballet moves. Just 5 years old, she already displayed the potential of a gymnast. Now her posture is more graceful than many models, but at 4, her legs were similar to North. North, at 12, has always had knees that touch when she walks. She used to love dancing but struggled with jumping. Kim Kardashian even spent $5 million organizing a performance for her, but fewer than 200 people showed up. Eventually, she gave up on her talents and became obsessed with makeup. She got eyebrow and lip tattoos as well as regular manicures. She even refused to go to school. The difference is Cardi B. And Kim Kardashian parent very differently. Cardi B. Wants culture to grow up both cultured and talented. Her yearly tuition is as high as $350,000. Each piano lesson costs $300 an hour. Cardi B. Doesn't hire a tutor for her.

Beyonce wore a bright pink backless dress and her top suddenly slipped down, nearly leading to an accidental wardrobe malfunction. However, her twin dancers quickly stepped in, preventing the awkward situation. One dancer swiftly grabbed Beyonce's arm, using his body to block the audience's view, giving her enough time to adjust her outfit. Thanks to their seamless coordination, many fans didn't even notice the mishap. Camila Cabello experienced a similar situation during a performance. She wore a white mini skirt, and at the end of the show, a male dancer quickly moved behind her to fix the skirt, ensuring there was no accidental body exposure. Being a celebrity dancer requires not only excellent dance skills, but also the ability to handle unexpected situations with Grace. However, not every dancer manages these moments perfectly. For example, Olivia Rodrigo's dancer struggled when her top unexpectedly broke. Despite trying twice, the dancer couldn't fix it, and Olivia had to cover her chest during the performance to avoid exposure. In another case, when Jennifer Lopez's dancer tried to assist her with a falling outfit,

Looking up, he saw a baby falling from a fourth floor balcony. Without thinking, he stretched out his arms and managed to catch the baby just before it hit the ground. He then handed the baby to its mother, who ran over to receive it, thanking David for his bravery. However, three days later, David received a legal notice. The mother accused him of breaking the baby's arm and demanded $300,000 in compensation. In court, David, in tears, explained that he only wanted to save the child and never intended to harm him. His lawyer argued that under Florida law, he should be considered a savior and not an aggressor, as his actions were not guilty. But the judge and jury decided that even though David was covered by the Good Samaritan law, the consequences of his actions were severe. So they sentenced him to pay $100,000 in compensation. David, disappointed with the ruling, said he would never again intervene in other people's problems. Do you think this trial was fair? Let us know your opinion in the comments.

David, disappointed with the ruling, said he would never again intervene in other people's problems. Do you think this trial was fair? Let us know your opinion in the comments.

Oh, my god! Oh, my god. This man might have to pay $300,000 for saving a baby's life after he accidentally fractured the baby's arm during the rescue. The baby's mother sued him for that amount to cover medical expenses. In Orlando, Florida, David Walker was walking down the street when he heard a scream coming from a building. Looking up, he saw a baby falling from a fourth floor balcony. Without thinking, he stretched out his arms and managed to catch the baby just before it hit the ground. He then handed the baby to its mother, who ran over to receive it, thanking David for his bravery. However, three days later, David received a legal notice. The mother accused him of breaking the baby's arm and demanded $300,000 in compensation. In court, David, in tears, explained that he only wanted to save the child and never intended to harm him. His lawyer argued that under Florida law, he should be considered a savior and not an aggressor, as his actions were not guilty. But the judge and jury decided that even though David was covered by the Good Samaritan law, the consequences of his actions were severe. So they sentenced him to pay $100,000 in compensation.

Over half a million babies every year are born in NICU, which require, which is a, which is a prenatal assistance, breathing, uh, assistance, digestive assistance. And so are they not human cause they can't viability, they have any viability. The point is that the standard doesn't apply. Right. Let me ask you one more hypothetical and it's a good question. Then I'll do a Christian one cause you say you're Christian on that. I have two ultrasounds. One ultrasound is a baby that was conceived in rape. The other ultrasound is a baby conceived in a loving relationship. Which one is which? There's no like that. There's no difference. There's no difference in the physical appearance of it. But the like, the complete difference is the mental toll that it would take on the mother and the person who has to carry the baby for nine months. Well, hold on. Let's be clear. There's a mental toll when you have an abortion, too. So it's not as if it's to get out of free. No, I, I completely understand. So it's a tough, difficult, horrible situation. Yeah. But shouldn't we be that the worst outcome after an evil is to just murder the being. Yeah. Why punish the baby for the crime of some guy that.

They were like, this is good because of this. And then I had my family, they're like, well, Trump's good because of this. So then I just started researching literally three days ago and I fell down this hole, like rabbit hole, so much stuff. Um, and, um, that's why I will be voting for the democratic. Can I ask you, it's not your question. What did you find persuasive enough to convince you to vote for Democrats? Well, so you talked about Trump creating safe cities, safe streets, just a safe country. But you know about his rally where he said that he wants one full day of police retaliation to eradicate crime. You know about that. Are you familiar with The Night of Broken Glass, Crystal Knox, World War 2? Are you familiar with that? I'm, I'm, I'm intimately familiar. I'm trying to understand the connection. Are we doing the Nazi thing again? Or like, are we, like, there's honestly, so, so crime was lower under Trump than under Kamala and Joe Biden. So I'm not, okay. Like much lower. Violent crime was substantially and sizably lower in every major metro area and every, every major state. Okay. I'll give you that one. Cause like I said, I just started researching like Three days ago for sure. I'm not like everybody else here. We're just been plotting this. Oh, but tell me what I'm not, it's not your question. I just wanna know if someone who does this for a living cause, then I can get better. What did you find that you're like, now I'm voting for the Democrat Party. What made that click? Okay.

The sisters suddenly find themselves pregnant. The older sister is suffering right alongside her. But the real problem, the risks of childbirth are incredibly high. Just a few months into the pregnancy, the younger sister is constantly falling ill. And the man who got them pregnant, he's disappeared without a trace. These two are conjoined twins with two heads and three legs. Since birth, they've shared three legs, four hands, and even most of their organs, including the uterus. They've become the village's oddities. But the younger sister was deceived by a scumbag. As the blogger digs deeper, they realize things aren't as simple as they seemed. In this village, there are many young women who are also pregnant. It turns out it's the same man who's been behind all of this. Will the village chief be able to catch him and put an end to this? Stay tuned to find out.

I was home alone one evening when the doorbell camera notification pinged on my phone. A FedEx guy stood on my porch holding a small package. Nothing unusual. Just didn't remember expecting a delivery. I answered through the speaker. Just leave it at the door, thanks. I looked directly into the camera. I need a signature for this one, ma'am. Through the doorbell camera, I watched him shift his weight. It'll just take a second, he insisted. That's when I noticed he wasn't holding a scanner. FedEx always has those handheld devices for signatures. This guy's hands were empty except for my package. Who's it from? I asked. Buying time while pulling up the actual FedEx tracking site on my laptop. No delivery scheduled for today. It's marked urgent, he said. Medical supplies. My heart started racing. I don't have medical conditions requiring special so deliveries, but I mean, it's just in my head, right? The driver knocked again, harder. This time. Ma'am, I can hear you moving around in there. I hadn't made a sound. I was sitting perfectly still on my couch, phone clutched in sweaty hands. How did he know I was home? I tell him he's got the wrong address. He says, no, this is the right one. I messaged my neighbor, Mark, an off duty cop guy claiming to be FedEx at my door. No truck, no scanner. Says he can hear me Inside, what do I do? He said he's at a grocery store and is heading over. I called him and said, what's going on and please hurry cause I was scared. The man outside started trying the doorknob at first, then with more force. Mark said, I'm calling it in. Stay quiet, hide and lock yourself. And he hung up. The delivery man set the package down and pulled something from his back pocket. Through the camera, I watched him unfolding what looked like lock.

My grandmother demanded I break up with my boyfriend because he was left handed, claiming it meant he was touched by the devil. So I brought him to Sunday dinner and watched her try to explain her theory to our Methodist pastor who happened to be left handed too. Jake and I had been dating for 8 months. I finally introduced him to my family at Sunday dinner. Everything was going perfectly until grandma noticed he was eating with his left hand. She immediately stopped mid conversation and stared at his fork like it was a weapon. Are you left handed, young man? She asked in that sharp tone she used when she caught me sneaking cookies before dinner. Yes, ma'am. Jake replied politely, not knowing he just confessed to devil worship according to Grandma's personal theology. Her face went completely white. She set down her own fork and turned to my mother with panic in her eyes. Margaret, we need to talk in the kitchen right now. I could hear them arguing loudly through the door. Grandma's voice getting higher and more frantic. Left handed people are marked by Satan. The righteous sit at God's right hand. When she came back to the table, grandma grabbed my hands like she was staging a life or death intervention. Honey, you need to end this relationship immediately. That boy bears the Mark of evil. Grandma, that's completely ridiculous. It's Just genetics. The devil can influence genetics. Even the words sinister comes from the Latin word for left. This is biblical fact. Over the next few days, she called me constantly with her evidence. Bible verses taken completely out of context, stories about medieval persecution of left handed people because they knew the truth. The final straw came when she cornered my mother and demanded I bring Jake to church so Pastor Williams could counsel him about his spiritual affliction. Perfect. I knew exactly how to handle this situation. That Sunday morning. I brought.

Aaron's mom took the microphone. My name is Pearl and this is my son Aaron. He used to go to the school. The auditorium went completely silent. Aaron was shaking but he stepped forward. I'm autistic. I have social anxiety. Two years ago, I accidentally bumped into someone in the hallway and said something that came out wrong because of how my brain processes things. It wasn't mean. It was just awkward. But Cameron decided I was a bully. His mom pulled out her phone and started showing emails on the projection screen, messages she'd sent to the principal begging them to stop Cameron from targeting her son. Cameron posted Aaron's photo on the wall of shame, called him a predator, a threat, got students to mass report him through his app, even though Aaron had never bullied anyone in his life. Aaron's voice cracked. Organized groups to exclude me from lunch tables, from group projects. He told people I was dangerous. I started having panic attacks in the bathroom between classes. I couldn't sleep. I stopped eating. His mom's hands were shaking. Aaron tried to hurt himself twice. Because a student with zero training and zero accountability decided my son was guilty and launched a campaign to destroy him. The auditorium was so quiet you could hear people breathing. We begged the school to intervene, she continued. But Cameron was the anti bullying hero. So they assumed Aaron must have done something to deserve it. They Told us Cameron was just holding students accountable. Aaron looked at the crowd. I had to switch schools, start over, go to therapy three times a week, all because Cameron decided I was a bully based on one awkward interaction. Then another kid stood up in the audience, a girl I recognized from last year. He did the same thing to me. I'm not autistic, but I'm dyslexic. And I said something in class that came out wrong. Cameron put me on the wall of shame and I got death threats. I had to delete all my social media. Another student stood me too. I made a joke that he decided was offensive. He got me suspended and my college scholarship was revoked. One more, he accused me of cyberbullying when I wasn't even in the group chat he was talking about. I switched schools because people were harassing me in the hallways. Four kids. Cameron had done this to four kids. All of them either neurodivergent or just awkward teenagers who'd made mistakes that Cameron turned into crimes. Aaron's mom looked directly at the administrators in the front row. You gave him power. You let him operate unchecked and he used it to torture children. Aaron's mom settled with the district and they fired the principal who ignored her emails. Cameron finished high school online and the last thing he posted before deleting everything was, I used fighting bullies as an excuse to become one. Aaron came back to Give a speech at our graduation about forgiveness, but he didn't mention Cameron's name once. And honestly, that felt worse than anything he could have said.

Cameron was the reason bullying basically didn't exist at our school anymore. He started the zero tolerance movement freshman year after watching someone get tormented in the cafeteria and deciding he was done being a bystander. Teachers loved him because he actually got results. The principal put him in charge of the entire anti bullying program. By sophomore year, he created the anonymous reporting system where anyone could submit evidence of bullying and Cameron would personally make sure something was done about it. He won the state Youth Leadership award two years in a row and got featured in the local news three times. Cameron system was so effective that teachers started sending kids to him instead of handling discipline themselves. Freshman got called a name in gym and the teacher said go report that to Cameron. Instead of dealing with it, Cameron made the senior do a public apology in front of the whole cafeteria for making fun of someone's haircut. The kid had to stand on a chair and read a statement Cameron had written for him while everyone watched. It was humiliating but everyone thought the bully deserved it. The wall of shame account became legendary. Cameron would post screenshots with captions like this is what a bully looks like at our school with the person's Instagram handle tagged 1 post guy kids college acceptance rescinded because the admissions office saw it. Cameron said it Was consequences for actions. People were terrified of ending up on that account. Kids deleted entire group chats in case Cameron got access. When someone started a rumor about this girl, Cameron didn't just stop the rumor. He found out who started it, posted their photo and organized a petition to get them expelled. They got 300 signatures in two days. The school suspended them for a month. Cameron threw a victory Celebration for the girl who'd been targeted. He treated every case like a war he had to win. By senior year, Cameron had more power than most teachers. He could get you suspended just by submitting enough reports through his app. He could destroy your reputation by posting you on wall of shame. He could turn the entire school against you if he decided you were guilty. And everyone loved him for it because he was protecting victims. The anti bullying summit was supposed to be his crowning achievement. The district was going to adopt his program system wide. He was on stage talking about accountability and justice, using words like eradicate and eliminate when talking about bullies. Then someone stood up in the back, a teenager and an older woman. They walked toward the stage and everyone went quiet. The kid reached for Cameron's microphone. Can I say something? Cameron's whole body went rigid. He set the mic down without saying a word.

And now he's got a yacht and a perfect life. But don't let that calm face fool you. He's stubborn. I asked him for a tiny favor, to use his boat, and he said no. He turned to the audience. You believe that? His own brother? Two groomsmen wheeled out a massive framed photo of my yacht. This, Liam announced, is what my brother loves more than family. The room erupted in laughter. My face burned. I stood up. That's enough, Liam! He waved me off. It's just a joke. No, it's not. At the reception, I overheard Tessa's bridesmaid.

I walked straight to him. You're not taking it? He leaned in. You're really going to do this here? I don't care how it looks. You've got everything, he hissed. All I wanted was one weekend. Before I could respond, his hand shot out. The slap echoed across the room. Glasses froze. Conversations died. The humiliation hit harder than the sting. Then an older man stood up. That's enough, he said. You've crossed the line. He walked toward us. For. For anyone wondering, I'm Judge Harold Miller, and what I just witnessed was assault. The air left the room. Liam stammered. It was just. Not another word. The judge cut him off, laying a hand on him in front of witnesses. That's something else entirely. Liam's face crumbled. Months later, he sued me for emotional distress. Judge Miller dismissed it immediately. Frivolous and baseless. Then Liam pitched a partnership. Everett Luxury Charters. I played along long enough to trademark the name myself. When he announced it at a charity gala, I took the mic. Just to be clear, I said, any use of that name is unauthorized. He stood there, frozen. Tessa left him. His company collapsed. And me. I finally understood that revenge doesn't come from anger. It comes from knowing your own worth.

That whoever this new guy was couldn't love me like he did. I was about to call 9 1 1 when Theo walked out of my bedroom holding a coffee mug like nothing was happening. He'd stayed over, which Logan clearly didn't know. Theo listened to Logan screaming for about 30 seconds and smiled this weird little smile and said he'd handle it. Then he opened the door mid kick, causing Logan to stumble inside. Logan recovered quickly and started yelling about who the hell Theo thought he was, how was I his girlfriend? How Theo needed to leave immediately before things got ugly. Theo took a sip of his coffee and waited for Logan to finish. Then he said in this completely calm voice that he understood Logan's confusion, but I'd clearly moved on. Logan should probably do the same. Logan laughed and said Theo had no idea who he was messing with. Logan had been fighting for this relationship for two years. That some random guy wasn't going to steal what was his. That's when Theo's whole demeanor changed. His smile got wider, but his eyes went completely flat. He sat down his coffee mug and asked Logan if he knew anything about medieval torture methods. How the human body could survive surprisingly extensive damage if you knew which parts to avoid. How modern forensic science still can't solve crimes without evidence. Logan stopped talking. Joe continued explaining how he'd Been studying anatomy since he was 12. How his taxidermy skills translated perfectly to other applications. How his knife collection wasn't just for cooking. How his basement had excellent soundproofing from his previous hobby of drum restoration. How Logan's stalking habits meant no one would question if he disappeared, since everyone already knew he was unstable. He talked about nerve endings and blood loss and joint separation like he was discussing a recipe. Logan's face went from red to white to green, actually took three steps backward. Theo followed him, maintaining eye contact the whole time. Then Theo pulled out his phone and showed Logan something that made him run out of my apartment and down the stairs. I never saw what was on that screen. Theo just smiled and said Logan wouldn't be a problem anymore. He was right. Logan moved to another state the next day, according to his mother, who called to apologize.

I've had the same friend group since college, like 10 years now. There's seven of us in total. Tasha's been my closest friend since freshman year, and the rest of the group formed around us over time. About three months ago, things started feeling off. The group chat would go silent after I sent messages, then pick back up later like I hadn't said anything. I'd see photos of everyone hanging out without me, even though they claimed to be busy when I tried making plans. I kept telling myself I was being paranoid, but it got worse. I'd show up to things I was actually invited to, and conversations would stop mid sentence. When I walked up, people would suddenly remember they had to leave. I felt like I was going insane because nobody was saying anything was wrong, but clearly something was very wrong. I tried talking to Tasha first because we've been closest the longest. I called her and asked Point Blank if I've done something to upset everyone. She got quiet for a second. I think you know what you did. I told her I genuinely had no idea what she was talking about. She sighed. Come on, don't play dumb. Just think about it. Then she said she had to go and hung up before I could respond. I spent the next week losing my mind trying to figure out what I could have possibly done. I replayed every interaction from the past few months. Nothing stood out. So I reached out to another friend in the group, thinking maybe she'd be more direct. I sent her a long message explaining that I was clearly missing something and I just need did someone to tell me what was going on. She replied three hours later with, it's pretty obvious. I'm honestly shocked you're acting confused right now. I begged her to just tell me. She said, ask Tasha. She was there. I messaged Tasha again. Tasha didn't respond for two days. When she finally did, all she said was, I don't want to get in the middle of this. You should apologize to Cass. Cass was part of our group, but we weren't particularly close. I couldn't think of anything I'd done to her. I tried messaging Cass directly, but she left me on read. By this point, I was completely spiraling. I stopped sleeping well because I just lie there replaying every possible scenario. Went back through months of text looking for anything I might have said wrong. Nothing added up. The freeze out got more aggressive. I got removed from our main group chat. When I asked about it, someone said it was an accident, but I never got added back. I saw they'd made plans for someone

Travis told us his dad had lost his job three months ago and had been getting drunk every night since then. Tonight was worse because mom had used the last of their savings to buy groceries instead of giving him drinking money. The next few minutes were terrifying. Dad found Travis in his room and started screaming about him being on the computer instead of helping with money. We heard the headset clatter to the ground. Travis was crying, no, dad, please, not the belt! That's when we heard sirens in the background. The dad started yelling about calling the cops, and Travis screamed that he hadn't done it. There was a loud thud. Later, we found out the dad had thrown Travis against the wall. We heard the police announcing themselves, then the sound of the door being broken down. There was a lot of shouting, things breaking. Finally, the dad screaming as they arrested him. A female officer found Travis and checked if he was okay. Travis picked up his headset one last time. He was crying, but managed to say thank you before his mom took him to the hospital. The officers talked to us briefly through his mic, getting statements about what we'd heard. I couldn't sleep that night. None of us could. We kept our party chat open until morning, just processing what had happened. Ryan used his police connections to follow up. On the case, Travis and his mom moved in with his grandmother. That week, his dad got arrested for domestic violence, child abuse, and a bunch of other charges. Six months later, Travis joined our party again. His voice was brighter, and he told us things were much better. His mom had a good job, he was doing well in school, and his dad was in prison. Still plays with us sometimes, but now we only hear normal household sounds in the background. His mom calling him for dinner, his dog barking, his little sister asking to play. Last week, Travis's mom joined our party chat briefly. She was crying, but this time from gratitude. She thanked us for being there that night, for not disconnecting, for caring about her son. She told us Travis calls us his guardian angels. His dad serving 15 years, and they're finally at peace.

Brandon, who'd been bragging for weeks about his guaranteed Stanford spot because of his family connections? Brandon who'd looked confused yesterday when everyone was celebrating their acceptances and he hadn't gotten any letters at all. You sent my acceptance letter to Brandon Walsh, didn't you, I said quietly. The woman's silence was all the confirmation I needed. How many of us, I asked. I can't discuss how many kids got letters that weren't meant for them? She sighed deeply. About 180 students received acceptances they weren't entitled to, and about 120 students who were actually accepted never received their letters. My blood ran cold. So there are kids who actually got into their dream schools but have no idea because their letters went to someone else. She nodded miserably. I walked out of that office in a days. But as I passed the counseling center, I heard shouting. Through the glass windows, I could see Brandon Walsh's father screaming at our college counselor. Mr Stevens, my son's acceptance was sent to some random kid. Do you have any idea how much money I've donated to this school, how much I've paid for his tutoring? Mr Stevens looked like he wanted to disappear. Sir, it was a computer error we're trying to fix. Sit. My son's entire future is at stake. You think Stanford is going to hold his spot while you figure out Your incompetence. That's when I realized something horrifying. This wasn't just a random computer glitch. I thought about all those times Mr Stevens had pulled me aside to ask about my backup plans, how he'd suggested I apply to community colleges just to be safe, how he'd seem surprised when I told him I was applying to Ivy League schools. I thought about how Brandon had been so confident about Stanford, even though his grades were mediocre and his sat scores were lower than mine. This wasn't an accident. Someone had deliberately switched our futures. As I stood there watching a rich man scream about his son's rightful place at Stanford, the place that should have been mine, I realized the most brutal truth of all. The mistake wasn't sending me Brandon's letter. The mistake was getting caught.

I'll never forget Missus Rain's face when she walked into homeroom crying. Not fake teacher tears. Real ugly sobbing. She couldn't speak at first, just stood there shaking while we stared in confusion. Finally, she choked out. There's been a mistake. A very serious mistake. Then Principal Jackson's voice came over the intercom. Hollow and aged. Students, Yesterday's college acceptance announcements contained significant errors. If you received an acceptance letter, report to the main office immediately. My heart stopped. I'd gotten into Stanford, my dream school. Around me, half the senior class started freaking out. Jessica had Harvard, Mike had MIT, Sarah had Princeton. We'd all been celebrating yesterday. What kind of errors? Someone shouted. But missus rain kept crying in the hallway. Chaos. It's running. Clutching acceptance letters, calling parents. Tommy Martinez punched his locker, screaming, I already quit my job. The line outside the main office, down two hallways. Everyone looked terrified. When I finally got to the front, there was a woman I'd never seen before, sitting behind a folding table. She looked exhausted, like she hadn't slept in days. Name? She asked without looking up. Johnny Chen. I got into Stanford. She flipped through a massive stack of papers, found mine, and her face fell. I'm sorry. Your actual status is waitlisted. The words hit me like a physical blow. What do you mean, actual status? There was a system error. The wrong acceptance letters were sent to Approximately 300 students across the district. The real decision was waitlisted, not accepted. I felt the room spinning. But I got a letter. An official letter with the Stanford seal and everything. I know. I'm truly sorry. The error occurred in our district's college counseling database. Somehow the test results got mixed up and the wrong notifications were generated. That's when it clicked. Wait. Whose acceptance letter did I get then? She looked uncomfortable. That's confidential. But I already knew. I thought.

I was playing Rainbow Six Siege late one night when I had just joined a random squad and this kid, probably around 12, was being super chatty and excited. He kept talking about strategies and asking for advice, clearly just happy to have people to play with. About an hour into our session, we heard a loud crash through his mic followed by screaming. The kid went quiet for a second, then whispered, I have to go, but he didn't disconnect. Instead, we heard heavy footsteps and a man's voice slurring, where's the money? The kid's mom was crying in the background. My whole squad fell silent listening to this domestic violence situation unfold through this poor kid's headset. The dad was clearly drunk, throwing things and demanding money they apparently didn't have. The kid must have forgotten his mic was still on. The mom's voice got closer, begging the husband to calm down. Please, Travis is in his room. He can hear everything. That's when we heard the sound of someone being hit, followed by the kids screaming, stop hurting, mom. My hands were shaking. One of my squadmates, Ryan, asked if anyone knew the kid's real name or where he lived. Nobody did. We only knew him as Snipe King. 2:03, another teammate was already calling 9 1 1, but what could we tell them? Suddenly the kid's voice came through. Clearly, he must have put his Headset back on, he was crying and trying to whisper, please help. My dad's really drunk. He's hurting mom. We live at 1847 Oakwood Drive in Pittsburgh. Please send someone. Ryan, who turned out to be an off duty cop from Philadelphia, took charge. He kept talking to Travis, keeping him calm while another teammate relayed the address to Pittsburgh PD. We could still hear the.

I replied, thank you for your honesty, sweetheart. Then I made sure her mother's secret wasn't secret anymore. Charlotte's text hit me at 3:00am. Overseas, my 16 year old was always direct, but this felt different. Dad, Mom has been having book club every Wednesday, but there's only one guy who comes over. They drink wine, and he doesn't leave until morning. My wife Christina taught high school English. Book club sounded plausible, except we've been married 12 years, and she'd never mentioned loving books. Charlotte, are you sure about this? Dad, I'm not stupid. His car is here every week. Same blue Honda. Yesterday, I saw his coffee mug in the sink with lipstick on it. Mom doesn't wear lipstick to book club. Smart kid. Takes after me. Last Wednesday, I came downstairs for water around 11 p m. They were on the couch watching some romantic movie. When mom saw me, she jumped up and said, Mister Huang was just leaving, but his car was still there at 7 a m. Mister Huang. That narrowed it down. Significant. Secondly, Charlotte, keep acting normal. Don't let mom know. We talked about this already. Been doing it for three weeks. Dad, I'm not about to blow it now. Instead of confronting Christina direct, I called my neighbor Bruce, retired Marine, who walks his dog past our house twice daily. can you snap a photo of that blue Honda's license plate next time. Already got it, buddy. Been wondering when you'd ask. And fishy to me. Quick license plate search through military contacts revealed the car belonged to Steven Huang, another teacher at Christina's school. Married with two kids. I found Steven's Facebook easily. Profile showed him with his wife Monica and twin boys. Happy family photos from Christmas. Made my stomach turn. Instead of going nuclear, I sent Monica a carefully worded message. Hi, Monica. I'm Christina, Mitchell's husband, currently deployed overseas. My daughter mentioned Steven stops by our house Wednesday evenings for book club with my wife. Just wanted to check if you knew about this arrangement. Thanks. Monica responded within an hour. What book club? Steven told me he has faculty meetings every Wednesday until late. Gets home around 10 p m. I had no idea he was at your house. Bingo. We moved to a phone call. Monica was sharp, ask the right questions. How long had this been going on? What exactly did

We've had an incident with your child. My mind raced with possibilities. Did he get hurt? Did he hurt someone? When I arrived, the principal looked very serious, almost grim. We need to discuss your son's behavior, she said, gesturing toward her office. I walked in to find my six year old sitting quietly, swinging his legs and looking up at me with innocent eyes. Mom, I didn't do anything bad, he said. Before the principal could start, I turned to her, confused. What happened? She sighed, clearly disappointed. During art class, your son created a drawing that was inappropriate. My stomach turned. What could a six year old possibly draw that was so alarming? She slid the paper across the desk. It was a bright, colorful scene, stick figures, a sun, flowers and a giant purple monster holding hands with a little stick boy. I frowned. I don't understand what's inappropriate here. The principal adjusted her glasses. The monster, obviously it's holding hands with a child. That could symbolize danger or worse, a threat to his peers. I blinked trying to process. You called me here because my son drew a friendly monster holding hands with himself. She nodded completely serious. Yes. We encourage creativity, but we need to maintain boundaries. My son chimed in, but mom, Mr Wiggly isn't scary. He's my imaginary friend. He helps me feel brave when I'm scared. I couldn't hold back my laugh. He's a six year old drawing his imagination. Do you really think this is worth calling me in for? The principal seemed taken aback, but before she could answer, my son looked at her and said, maybe you need a Mister Wiggly, too. He's really nice. I walked out holding his hand, shaking my head and wondering when the world became so afraid of a little imagination.

My 10 year old son came home confused because his history teacher told the class that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. My son Alex has always been fascinated by space. Since he was five, we've spent countless nights stargazing with our telescope. He knows all the planets and can recite facts about the International Space Station. Last year I bought him a book signed by Chris Hadfield, the famous astronaut. Alex treasures it and can quote entire passages about what earth actually looks like from space. But everything changed when Mr Peterson started teaching history. During a lesson about ancient wonders, he told the class that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space with the naked eye. Alex raised his hand and explained that astronauts have confirmed this isn't true. The wall is too narrow and blends with the landscape. He mentioned that Hadfield's typically addressed this myth in his book. Mister Peterson cut him off. That's nonsense, he said. It's in our textbook and I've been teaching this fact for 20 years. Your little astronaut book is wrong. The next day, Alex brought in his signed book to show the passage. Instead of listening, Mister Peterson confiscated it, calling it disruptive material. He made Alex stand in front of the class and recite the Great Wall of China is visible from Space 10 times. When Alex came home, he was devastated. His precious signed book was gone and he felt humiliated. Mister Peterson had assigned a five page essay on the importance of respecting teacher's knowledge as punishment. I was furious. I emailed Mister Peterson explaining the facts and asking for the book back. His response, I don't need space facts from a parent. The curriculum says the wall is visible from space, so that's what I teach. The principal seemed reluctant to contradict a ten year teacher over what she called a minor factual dispute. That's when I decided to take action. My college roommate now works for NASA's education program. When I explained the situation, she was appalled at the misinformation being taught. Three days later, I walked into Alex's classroom during history period. Mr Peterson looked annoyed until I introduced my guest, Doctor Sarah Chen, NASA education specialist. Doctor Chen asked if she could address the class about space observations. Mr Peterson couldn't refuse. A NASA scientist in front of students, his face fell when she pulled up actual astronaut photographs and video testimonials. Contrary to popular belief, Doctor Chen explained the Great Wall is actually very difficult to see even from low earth.

Gave all company shirts to homeless people in neighborhood. I worked at Premium Bath and fixtures for 11 years. We sold high end bathroom stuff to rich people and did corporate contracts. The kind of place where a single faucet costs more than most people's rent. Over those 11 years, they gave us new company shirts every few months. Hello shirts with the logo. Button UPS for special events, long sleeves for winter. I never threw any away because they were actually nice quality. I had this whole pile in my closet. 32 shirts total. I counted them the day I got fired. The company got sold in March to this guy named Walter Grayson. He showed up to our location wearing a suit that probably cost $5,000 and immediately started talking about efficiency and restructuring. Within two weeks, he fired almost 100 people across all locations. I was one of them. 12 years of perfect attendance, top sales numbers, training new employees. None of it mattered. He called me into the office on a Thursday afternoon and said my position was being eliminated. No Severance, just two weeks pay and a cardboard box for my desk stuff. I drove home with that box in my passenger seat. When I got there, I opened my closet and saw all those company shirts hanging there. Every single one had the premium bath and fixtures logo on it. Our store had these incredibly nice bathrooms. Marble counters, automatic soap, Dispensers, the works. We use them as display models. Anyone could walk in and use them if they looked halfway decent. That was literally our policy. If someone came in looking like they might buy something, we let them use our bathrooms, no questions asked. Austin has homeless people everywhere. Under the highway, overpasses, in the parks, near the grocery stores. I drove past them every single day on my way to work. After I got fired, I had this idea. It took me about three seconds to decide I was doing it. Friday morning, I loaded all 32 shirts into my car. I drove to the overpass on 7th Street where about 15 people were camped out. I parked and walked over with an arm full of shirts. This guy named Rick was sitting against the concrete barrier. I knew him because he was always at that spot. I handed him a polo shirt. Here, I said, this is from Premium Bath and fixtures on the Lamar Boulevard. If you wear this shirt, you can walk in and use their bathrooms anytime. They have really nice bathrooms. Tell everyone. Rick looked at the shirt and then at me. Seriously? Totally serious. I said, company policy. Anyone wearing the company shirt gets bathroom access. I handed out 12 shirts at that overpass. Then I drove to the park on Fourth Street and gave out eight more. Then to the shopping center where people usually asked for change and handed out The rest? Every single person I gave a shirt to, I told them the same thing. Wear the shirt, go to Premium Bath and fixtures. Use the bathrooms. By Monday morning, the first guy showed up. I wasn't there, obviously, because I was fired. But my friend Jesse still worked there, and he texted me. Some homeless guy wearing a company polo walked in and asked to use the bathroom. The manager on duty, this woman named Valerie, saw the shirt and assumed he worked at another location. She let him use the bathroom.

I was driving my wife, Agrieta, to the hospital for her final checkup before giving birth. She was 8.5 months pregnant. We were in the carpool lane on the highway when I saw the red and blue lights behind me. I pulled over. The cop walked up to my window and asked for both our IDS. But Agrieta was dozing in the passenger seat, almost drooling, looking completely out of it, like me. The first time I got sloppy. The cop shined his flashlight directly on her face. She woke up confused, sprinting at the light. The cop leaned down to look at her. Ma'am, are you here willingly or is he forcing you? Agrieta was still half asleep. What? What's happening? The cop turned to me and his voice got harder than me. The first time I got sloppy. Step out of the vehicle. Hands on the car. What? What did I. The cop clutched his hip and ordered for me to step out again. So I got out slowly, nervously, like plankton trying to steal the formula undetected. That's when I saw it. There was a tattoo on the cop's wrist, small anchor visible under his sleeve. My jaw dropped. You see, this cop had glasses on when originally talking to us, so I didn't see his eyes. But now with the tattoo, I recognized him. Immediately, this was the same cop who pulled me over a year ago. I hadn't been speeding or doing anything wrong back then, but he still forced me out of my car. He searched under my clothes without consent before cuffing me. It felt like some sort of foreplay, honestly. And I thought I was about to have to tell Buddy, I don't swing that way. Fortunately, there wasn't any funny business. Unfortunately, he still took me to the station where he claimed I was speeding. I still don't know why. Maybe he was mad I didn't start kissing him or something. I quickly proved my innocence with dash cam footage. I was let go and he got reprimanded by his supervisors. But now here we were, my wife on the verge of giving birth, and this cop was staring at me with a look that said he was going to make me pay, and not in the good kind of way my wife does. He got, got Agrietta to step out of the vehicle, too, then separated us and immediately started questioning her alone on the side of the highway. She was crying, confused, visibly pregnant. How old are you? He asked. 23. And him? He's 27. But Agrietta had an accent, that Eastern European twang that made a conversation about plucking butt hairs hot. But now that same accent was going to cost us. Need to see your papers, the cop told her. They're in my purse in The trunk. But my green card is at home. The cop's eyes lit up like my dad seeing an opened six pack of beer in the fridge. Don't move. He turned to me. You two have an age gap. She's a pregnant immigrant, missing ID. This fits the profile of human trafficking. My jaw dropped like I just been on a Coke binge. She's my wife. We're going to the hospital. Sure you are. Turn around. Hands behind your back. He was arresting me. Agrieta was now screaming. Adrenaline waking her up. He's my husband. The cop ignored her. Ma'am, you don't have to protect him anymore. We were both taken to the station in separate cars. Agrietta was holding her stomach. At the station, they put us in separate interrogation rooms. A detective sat across from me. How did you meet? How much did you pay for her? How much did you pay for your lobotomy? You must have had one if you're taking this seriously. We're literally married. Check our license. We'll verify everything. But this looks very bad for you. The cop from the traffic stop kept walking past the window.

One Tuesday, I came home from work and peanut was gone. My apartment door was unlocked, but nothing else was touched, just no peanut. Like someone had broken, taken the dog and left. I lost my mind looking for him. I printed hundreds of flyers, posted in every Facebook group, walked the neighborhood until 2:00am calling his name for three days straight. I barely slept, just searched. Then our mutual friend Liz showed up at my door. Her face was pale and she couldn't look me in the eye. I need to tell you something about peanut, she said, her voice shaking. My heart dropped. Evelyn's been telling everyone you've been neglecting peanut, that he was suffering so badly she had to intervene. I couldn't process what she was saying. What do you mean by intervene? Liz started crying. She took him to a vet, told them he was aggressive and suffering from neglect. She had him put down. He's dead and she's bragging to everyone about it. The room tilted as the pain hit my system like a Hurricane. My heart broke. My perfectly healthy, happy dog was dead because Evelyn decided a golden lab made her insecure. When I could finally speak, all I asked was why? She said you didn't deserve him. That someone who actually cared would have noticed he was in pain. I thanked Liz for letting me know and went to sit on my couch. I stared at the Wall for five hours, dissociating, trying to decide what to do to teach her a lesson, one that would stick. That's when the idea hit me. I wouldn't confront her, wouldn't scream or cry or let her see what she'd broken in me. Instead, I did research, found out about what life would be like if you got stranded in Chiapas, the for a state in Mexico, a perfect experience for someone like Evelyn. Here was my plan, aka operation get rid of Evelyn. Part 1, the bait. I create a fake website to promote a fake influencer retreat in Chiapas and send Evelyn the link and tell her I applied. Evelyn would apply to prove she was better than me. Part 2, the execution. Taxi driver would drive her from the airport in Mexico to an extremely poor village in Chiapas, one that is rampant with intimacy workers, and leave her there completely stranded. And my plan worked perfectly. It's been three years since she left and no one's heard from her. But when I remember Peanut's face, I realize I don't care.

I'm sitting in the Starbucks doing homework for my biology class. It's like three PM on a Tuesday, and I'm wearing this black champion hoodie I saved up for, like, three months to buy. Cost me 180 bucks. I know that sounds stupid, but it's the softest thing I've ever owned, and it's got this perfect weight to it. I'm working on this stupid photosynthesis diagram when this kid plops down in the chair across from me. He's maybe 12 or 13, has down syndrome, and he's just staring at my hoodie with the biggest smile. Hi. He says. That's really nice. Oh, thanks, man. I say, trying to be polite, but also, like, I got work to do. Can I have it? I look up, he's still smiling, pointing at my hoodie. Uh, sorry, dude. I'm actually wearing it right now. I laugh a little, thinking he's joking, but I really like it. Can I have it, please? Now I'm uncomfortable. I can't give you my hoodie. Sorry. This woman, who I'm guessing is his mom, comes over. She's got two drinks, and she sets one down in front of him. Kevin, what are you doing? Leave this person alone. He has a really cool sweater. Kevin says to her, I asked if I could have it. I'm expecting her to be like, Kevin, that's not how we ask for things or whatever. Instead, she looks at me and goes, would You mind? He really seems to like it. I literally stare at her for like five seconds. I'm sorry, what? The hoodie. Could you give it to him? He clearly loves it. Ma'am, this cost me $180. I'm wearing it. She makes this face like I just said something rude. It's just a sweatshirt. Kevin doesn't ask for much, and he has down syndrome. Surely you can spare one piece of clothing. Kevin still smiling at me, completely unaware that this is weird as hell. I'm not giving you my hoodie. I say, trying to stay calm. You're really going to say no to a special needs child? She's getting louder now. What kind of person does that? A couple people are looking over. I'm 17 years old and this grown woman is trying to make me look like garbage in front of everyone. The kind of person who paid for their own clothes. I say back. She huffs and grabs Kevin's hand. Come on, honey. Some people are just selfish. We'll find you a nice sweatshirt somewhere else. Kevin looks confused, but follows her. As they're leaving, she turns back and goes you should be ashamed of yourself. I just sit there like what the hell just happened? Two days later, I'm at the same Starbucks because apparently I hate myself. I'm in a different hoodie this time, a basic gray one. I'm waiting for my drink when I hear, hey, that's him! It's the same mom from before. She's with this guy, who I'm assuming is Kevin's dad, and they're both walking toward me fast. You're the one who upset Kevin. The dad says, not loud, but, like, firm. I didn't upset anyone. Your wife asked for my hoodie, and I said no. You made my son cry.

My roommate Kate has this incredible superpower of she can selectively forget her wallet every single time we go somewhere that cost money. But somehow she never forgets it when she's going shopping alone or getting her nails done. We've been living together for eight months and I've been keeping track. She's forgotten her wallet 17 times, 17. And every single time she gives me this look like I'm supposed to cover her because I have a corporate job and she's a freelance artist. Last Tuesday, she comes bouncing into our apartment with this huge grin. Guess what? I booked us a table at Meridian for my birthday dinner Friday night. I invited Jessica, Mike and L too. Meridian, the place where appetizers start at $35. I knew exactly what was coming. This was going to be her biggest scam yet. Order expensive food for everyone on her special day, then conveniently forget her wallet and guilt everyone else into splitting the massive Bill. Friday night arrives, she's getting ready, humming some Taylor Swift song, completely in her element. I'm watching from my doorway as she does her usual routine, phone, check. Keys, check. Lipstick, check. Tiny purse, check. She even did that fake little gasp and snap, like got everything, as if to seal the performance. But there it was, her wallet sitting in plain sight on the nightstand, once again, mysteriously excluded from the essentials. Like watching someone rehearse a scam she's pulled off a dozen times. Wallet sitting on nightstand, ignored. I'm just going to touch up my mascara real quick. She calls out, heading to the bathroom. That's when I made my move. I slipped into her room and grabbed the wallet. Black leather, kind of heavy, actually. I could feel credit cards and cash inside. We meet everyone at the restaurant. Meridian has this whole upscale vibe, dim lighting, fancy cloth napkins, haters in actual uniforms. Kate is in full birthday girl mode, telling everyone to order whatever they want. It's my special day. Go crazy. Jessica orders a 40 dollar salmon. Mike gets the 55 dollar steak. L goes for the lamb, which is like 60 dollars. Kate. Kate orders the Seafood Tower for herself, $85. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes, $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse, checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table. Oh, my god, you guys, I am so embarrassed. I totally forgot my wallet at home. Here we go. Can someone cover me? I'll Venmo every.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I'd gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee with Extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. I noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

For nearly a decade, my mom was our whole world. Our dad left when we were little. He abandoned three kids and his wife for an 18 year old girl. Mom never recovered financially, raising us alone on $45,000 a year. As a teacher, she'd managed every crisis, stretched every dollar, survived everything life threw at her. Until stage 4 breast cancer. The chemotherapy would cost more than she could ever afford. After years of being the strongest person I knew, I watched her break. I don't think I can afford to fight this. She staring at the medical bills. But then came hope. The hospital's financial counselor sat us down in her office, pulled up Mom's insurance and showed us the screen. Given your situation, she said gently, insurance will cover the chemotherapy. You'll only owe the two thousand dollar deductible. Mom broke down crying. I held her as she sobbed with relief she could fight this. She withdrew her last two thousand dollars from savings and paid it that day, starting treatment immediately. For three months, things were looking up. Mom was responding well to chemo, despite the brutal side effects. She kept teaching when she could and kept fighting. But then the envelope arrived. I found her at the kitchen table, hands shaking, holding a Bill for $47,000. Insurance denied coverage. It read balance due immediately. Mom called the hospital crying. They transferred her between departments for Hours. Finally, billing told her she could either pay or set up a payment plan of $1,500 monthly, more than her mortgage. If she didn't, they'd send it to collections in 30 days. And fucking Mo. She hung up and looked at me. I have to stop treatment. That's when I took over. Something felt wrong. I gathered every piece of paperwork. The original insurance approval, bills, treatment dates, everything. I spent days comparing documents, calling insurance, and demanding answers. I immediately called the insurance company, and they said they had no record of ever denying the claim. I had no record of receiving claims from most of her treatments. It made no sense. The hospital said insurance denied everything, but insurance said they never received anything to deny. I dug deeper into the insurance records. They did have. They showed claims from the hospital, just not for mom.

My wife and I were supposed to fly cross country to help our 21 year old daughter Jess move into her first apartment. It should have been a proud moment, a weekend of family Celebration and seeing our little girl start her next chapter. But anyone who's ever travelled with my wife knows it's never that simple. I'm the type who packs two days early, double checks every detail and gets to the airport at least two hours before boarding. My wife, she's the queen in of chaos. Always late, always saying relax, we'll make it. Spoiler, we usually don't. Last year during Parents Weekend, I told her we needed to leave the house by 8:00am for our 10:00am flight. She didn't roll out of bed until 7:40. Then came the shower, breakfast and makeup routine as if she had all day. We didn't leave until 9, hit traffic and missed the flight by 15 minutes. I stood at the gate watching the plane pull away. We lost $800 rebooking and missed half the weekend with yes. My wife's reaction, a shrug and well, these things happen. So this time I swore I wouldn't let it happen again. I woke up at 6, packed everything, checked us in online, printed the boarding pass and made coffee. I shook her awake five separate times before she finally got out of bed groaning about how unreasonably Early I was making her travel. By some miracle, we made it to the airport with over an hour to spare. I was ecstatic. She, on the other hand, complained that we were way too early. Then she saw a Starbucks just before security. Oh, perfect, she said, veering toward it like a moth to a flame. I need coffee for the flight. I told her, absolutely not. Security lines were already forming and we didn't have time to waste. She rolled her eyes. Relax. It's just coffee. Five minutes. Against my better judgment, I let her. I told her I'd go ahead through security and wait at the gate. Fifteen minutes later, I was through and sitting at the gate. No texts, no calls. Boarding was in 25 minutes. I texted her asking where she was. No response. Ten minutes passed. I called. She finally answered, sounding annoyed that I'd interrupted her. The lines really long, but I'm almost.

If they wanted me out, fine. But they weren't ready for what that really meant. I leaned back in my chair. All right, I said. My dad sat up straighter like he'd won some imaginary battle. My mom still looked uncomfortable, but she didn't say anything. Maybe she was in shock or maybe she just didn't care as much as I thought. I stood up, grabbed my plate and carried it to the sink. I didn't want to give them the reaction they wanted. Instead, I looked at Lily, who was still sitting there, tense and confused. I gave her a small nod. She was the only one at that table I still cared about. Dad took a sip of his drink like nothing had happened. Mom went back to picking at her mashed potatoes. Lily kept looking at me like she wanted to say something, but she didn't. I didn't stay to finish dinner, just walked out. I went straight to my room, closed the door and started packing.

By the way the officer read it, looked at Lisa, looked back at me. Ma'am, is this your text? I was drunk. It didn't mean anything. Did you get married? She hesitated. Yes. But then legally, sir, you're within your rights to deny her access. This is your property. What? Lisa shrieked. This is my house. Is your name on the deed? The officer asked. She went pale because it wasn't. The house was mine. I bought it two years before we got married. Her name was never added. This is insane. She turned to me. Tom, please let me in. We can talk about this. Nothing to talk about. You're married to someone else now. It's not legal. We can get it annulled. That's between you and your husband. He left me, she screamed. He left me at the hotel when my card got declined. He said he thought I had money. I almost laughed. So your new husband abandoned you when he found out you're broke and now you wanna come back here, please? I made a mistake. I'm sorry you texted me that. I'm pathetic while announcing you married someone else. That's not a mistake. That's a choice. The officers were watching this like a tennis match and once said, you need to leave the property. You can work this out through lawyers, but you can't force entry. Where am I supposed to go? That's not our problem. I said, maybe call your coworker. Oh, wait, he abandoned you? Her face crumbled. You're really doing this? Really? Married someone else and called me pathetic. So, yeah, I'm really doing this. What about my stuff? I pointed to the trash bags on the lawn. She looked at them, then at me, then started crying. Tom, please, I love you. It was a drunken mistake. You don't accidentally marry someone. You don't accidentally text your husband that he's pathetic. You did both sober up and deal with the consequences. The officers escorted her off the property. She stood at the end of my driveway crying, pulling clothes out of trash bags. I closed the door. My phone buzzed. Her mother. How could you kick her out? She's your wife. She was my wife. Now she's someone else's wife. Tell her to call him. I blocked her number. Full story on the channel linked below.

You're pathetic, by the way. I replied, cool. Then I blocked her cards and changed the house locks. Next morning she was crying and police were at my door. I stared at my phone for exactly 10 seconds. Then I replied, cool and got to work. First I called the credit card company, reported all our joint cards as compromised, froze them immediately. Then I called the bank, moved all funds from our joint account into my personal one, perfectly legal since both our names were on it. Then I called a locksmith. How fast can you change all the locks on my house? I can be there in an hour. Double your rate if you make it 30 minutes. He made it in 25. While he worked, I packed Lisa's things, clothes, toiletries, her stupid collection of decorative pillows. Everything went into trash bags on the front lawn. By midnight, the locks were changed and her stuff was outside. I went to bed. My phone started buzzing at 6:00am, 17 missed calls from Lisa, 12 voicemails. I deleted them without listening. Then came the texts. My card isn't working. Where's the money from our account? Why isn't my key working? You can't do this. I replied. You got married. Congratulations. Figure it out with your new husband. She called immediately. I declined. More texts. I was drunk. It was a mistake. Let me in. This is my house, too. You're Being ridiculous, I put my phone on silent and made coffee. At 7:00am was pounding on my door. I looked through the window, Lisa was there looking like hell, mascara smudged, hair a mess, still wearing her Vegas clubbing outfit. Standing next to her were two police officers. I opened the door, sir, we got a call about a lockout situation. One officer said, no lockout. I said calmly, my wife got married to someone else yesterday in Vegas. He's no longer welcome in my home. Lisa's face went red. That's not. I made a mistake. I was drunk. I pulled out my phone and showed the officer her text. Just married my.

Week 9, I tested it, suggested we go somewhere different for lunch. Can't. The contract specifies. The contract doesn't specify lunch locations. She hesitated. I just prefer the courtyard because your ex will see us there. Her face told me everything. With two weeks left, I was exhausted. Then I saw her phone. She'd left it on my car dashboard while grabbing coffee. A text notification. Almost done. Can't believe you made it this far. I open the messages. Group chat, her friends messages about the bet, about seeing how long she could make it last. My hands shook. She came back, saw me holding her phone. What are you doing? What's the bet, Kim? What's the bet, Kim? I don't know what you're talking about. She reached for her phone. I held it away. Don't lie. I already read the messages. Her face went pale. You had no right. You had no right to use me as entertainment. I showed her screenshots. I have all of it. The group chat, everything. She stared at the screen. Defeat. What do you want? The truth or. I show these to everyone. She sat on the curb, head in her hands. My friends bet me $500. I couldn't get a guy to agree to a fake dating contract. Two week social experiment. Each word felt like a knife. You picked me because I was desperate. I picked you because I thought you'd be easy, invisible, someone who'd say yes. Because any attention was better than none. So why three months instead of two weeks? Cause by week 2, I realized you weren't desperate. You were just lonely. Like me. You're not lonely. I'm surrounded by people who want things from me. You were the first person who just wanted to talk, really talk, while lying to me. Ended the bed after two weeks, gave the money back, but I couldn't tell you because I knew you'd leave. So you kept lying. Yes, I kept lying because I was selfish, because I'd started falling for you and couldn't let go. I wanted to walk away. Should have, but something kept me there. Every rule after week 2 was me trying to be near you. Monday library sessions because I loved watching you read, morning texts because you were the first thing I thought about. How do I believe any of this? You don't have to. She stood. I started this for the wrong reasons. I was shallow and cruel. But I'm telling you the truth now because I can't keep lying when I'm in love with you. The parking lot went silent. What? I'm in love with you. I know that doesn't fix anything, but I needed you to know that everything after Week 2 was real. She pulled something from her pocket, the contract, ripped it in half. You're free. No more rules, no more games, just the truth. Five days after she ripped up that contract, I showed Up at the library on Monday at 3:15. And when she saw me waiting with no rules between us, we both knew we were starting over.

When Frank would get agitated because he couldn't find his work files or couldn't remember where he parked, Robert would calm him down, tell him everything was in the garage, that he'd checked on it himself. Frank trusted him immediately. The facility moved Frank to a smaller room when his money ran out. Eddie couldn't afford the nice place anymore on his teacher's salary. Robert and I paid for him to stay there. Robert said it was the right thing. Frank was family, even if the legal papers said otherwise. We decorated Frank's room with photos from our marriage, nothing later that would confuse him. Robert helped hang them, listen to Frank tell stories about each one like Robert had never heard them before, even though Frank told the same stories every visit. One day, Frank grabbed Robert's arm, asked him to take care of me, said he felt strange lately, tired all the time and worried he was getting sick. Asked Robert to make sure I'd be okay if anything happened to him. Robert promised he would, that Linda would always be safe and loved. Frank relaxed, then trusted this stranger who'd been helping care for him for six months. Last month, Frank stopped getting out of bed, still knew me, still talked about our life together, but his body was giving up. Robert would help him eat, adjust his pillows and clean his face. When he couldn't manage it anymore, Frank would thank him, call him a good neighbor and say we should have him over for dinner when he felt better. Eddie could barely visit, couldn't stand seeing his father like this. Robert was there every day after work, reading Frank the sports page, telling him fake scores for teams that didn't exist anymore. Frank died on a Tuesday morning holding my hand, Robert standing beside us. His last words were asking me to pick Eddie up from school, not to let him walk home in the rain. Robert handled everything after the arrangements, calls, the paperwork. At the service, people kept asking who Robert was, why he was crying harder than some of Frank's actual relatives. I didn't know how to explain that Robert had spent eight months loving a man who couldn't remember him, caring for someone who'd married his wife. In another lifetime. Robert gave a speech about Frank being a devoted father and husband. He meant it. He'd seen it every single day, frozen in time, but absolutely real. Love doesn't always make sense.

Posted all the photos on Facebook like nothing weird had happened. I moved on, eventually started dating someone new, got a better job, went to therapy to deal with the betrayal. My parents kept trying to get me to come to family dinners and act like everything was fine. I refused. Three years passed. Then last month, I got a call from an unknown number. It was Emily. She. He's crying and said she needed my help. I almost hung up, but something made me listen. She told me Kyle had completely changed after they got married. Started controlling everything she did, where she went, who she talked to, what she wore. He tracked her location constantly. Made her quit her job, isolated her from all her friends. Said she made a horrible mistake and realized Kyle wasn't the person she thought he was. She asked if I could talk to him, convince him to ease up and go to couples therapy with her. I actually laughed. She got mad and said I was being cruel, that she was reaching out because I was the only person who knew both of them well enough to help. I told her she picked him. She and my entire family picked him over me on what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. She embarrassed me in front of everyone I knew and expected me to just get over It now she wanted me to fix her mess. Emily started crying harder, saying she had nobody else to turn to. My parents refused to admit there were any problems in the marriage. They kept saying she was being dramatic and that Kyle was just protective because he loved her so much. She was trapped. I told her exactly what she needed to hear. Call a lawyer, file for divorce, go stay with her parents or a friend, but don't call me ever again. Expecting me to save her from a situation she created by betraying me. Kept crying and asking how I could be so cold. I reminded her that she held my brother's hand and told me she didn't love me anymore. An hour before our wedding was supposed to start. That my own mother comforted Kyle instead of me. That nobody in my family once asked if I was okay. I hung up. She called back five times. Voicemails begging me to reconsider. I blocked her number. Two weeks later, my mom called from my dad's phone, asking why I refused to help Emily. Said I was being petty and holding grudges. I told her she made her choice three years ago when she hugged Kyle at my canceled wedding. Then I hung up and blocked that number, too.

And called for immediate assistance. Within minutes, doctors were surrounding him, running tests and starting an IV. How long has he been in this condition, the emergency doctor asked. About four hours, I said. His pediatrician's office made us wait. The doctor's face darkened. Four hours with these symptoms? Twenty minutes later, they were Wheeling him into emergency surgery. The surgeon came out afterwards looking grim. His appendix was minutes from bursting. The infection was already spreading. My heart stopped. What would have happened if we waited longer? Sepsis, possibly fatal, he said quietly. You got here just in time. I spent that night in the hospital chair watching my son sleep with tubes and monitors attached. The next morning, armed with surgical photos, hospital reports and a lawyer's business card, I walked back into that doctor's office. The same receptionist was at her desk looking surprised to see me. Oh, you're back. Did you want to reschedule your missed appointment? I placed the hospital discharge papers on her desk. I have a question. When exactly did you get your medical degree? Her smile faded as she read the emergency surgery report. Sir, I was just following protocol. Your protocol almost ended. My son, I said, pulling out the surgical photos. These are pictures of his infected appendix that nearly burst while you made him wait three hours. The office manager came running out having heard the commotion. Sir, please, let's discuss us this privately. No, I. Said loudly, everyone here should know what happens when you follow the late policy too strictly. The office manager was practically begging. Now we'll review our policies immediately. This won't happen again. You're right, it won't, I said, because I'm reporting this to the medical board or insurance company and every parent review site I can find. The receptionist finally spoke up, her voice shaking. I, I didn't know it was that serious. That's exactly the problem, I replied. You're not qualified to make that determination. Two weeks later, they called to tell me they'd implemented a medical emergency override system and retrained all front desk staff. The receptionist had been transferred to their billing department where she couldn't make life threatening decisions anymore.

And I had no idea she was actually changing my life. I was invisible at my high school. Not bullied, not popular, just there. I sat in middle rows, ate lunch with two equally forgettable friends, and my biggest achievement was making JV soccer. Soccer bench sophomore year. So when Kim Reeves walked up to my lunch table on a Monday in March, every conversation around us stopped. Kim Reeves, junior class president, debate team captain. The girl who made the cafeteria look like a runway. Can I sit? She asked. I looked around, thinking she meant a different table. Here? Yes, here. She pulled a folded paper from her bag. I have a proposition for you. I need a boyfriend for three months. Fake boyfriend, but it has to look real. She slid the paper across the contract. Handwritten rules listed below. Meeting times, public appearances, approved topics. Why me? I asked. She looked me straight in the eyes. Because you're not complicated. You won't catch feelings, and you need this more than you think. She wasn't wrong. I've been invisible for so long, I started to disappear, even to myself. The contract was clear. Three months, specific rules. I'd agreed. But by week three, I started questioning everything. Kim would text me good morning at exactly 7:00am. Sweet messages. But in person, she'd barely look at me until we were In public, in hallways, she'd light up, grab my hand, laugh at everything I said. But in empty classrooms, when no one was around, she'd go silent, check her phone, act like I wasn't there. Do you actually like spending time with me? I asked. Once. We have a contract, I'm following it. That wasn't an answer. Month one ended. Month two began. My life had changed. I was invited to parties. People recognize it's me. But it all felt hollow because Kim only seemed interested when there were witnesses. Her friend Ashley started sitting with us at lunch, asking invasive questions. How do you guys get together? Think it'll last? Kim would answer smoothly, practiced like she rehearsed. One day, Ashley pulled out her phone. Say something cute for my story. Later, I saw the post. Hundreds of likes comment saying plot twist of the year. Plot twist. I started paying attention to patterns. Every Monday, Kim insisted we study at the library. But her ex boyfriend's best friend studied there. Mondays. Every Thursday, we had to eat lunch at the courtyard tables. Her ex ate their Thursdays. Every Friday, she needed me to walk her to her car. Her ex had last period in that building. Are you using me to make someone jealous? I asked. Don't be ridiculous. But she would.

My five year old son was screaming in pain from what looked like appendicitis, but the receptionist told us to wait because we were 10 minutes late to our appointment. Ma'am, my son can barely stand, I said, showing her how he was doubled over. She didn't even look up from her computer. Policy is policy. Late patients wait, I explained. We hit unexpected traffic from a car accident. But she just shrugged and pointed to the waiting room. Other families were staring as my boy collapsed into a chair, clutching his stomach and crying. Twenty minutes passed. I approached her desk again. My son now pale and sweating. Please, something's really wrong with him. I beg, sir. Your son needs to learn patience, she said coldly. The doctor will see you when it's your turn. I asked if we could at least speak to a nurse to check his temperature. The nurse is busy with on time patience, she replied, not even glancing at my suffering child. An hour went by. My son vomited into the waiting room trash can, and other patients started offering help. One mother whispered, can't believe they're making you wait. I marched back to the desk. My son just threw up. Can we please move this along? The receptionist sighed dramatically. Children get sick. That's why you're here. She handed me paper towels. Like that solved everything. My son was now lying across two Chairs barely conscious. A grandfather in the waiting room stood up and said, this is ridiculous. That child needs help now. The receptionist shot him a look. Sir, please don't intervene with office practices. I pulled out my phone to call 9 1 1, but she quickly said, you can't make emergency calls in here. It disrupts other patients. That's when I lost it. Are you seriously telling me I can't call for help? Hospital policy, she said, pointing to a tiny sign. One dad offered to drive us to the ER himself. My son's lips were turning pale and he'd stopped crying because he was too weak. I finally stood up and took my son to the ER. We rushed to the ER, my son barely responsive in his car seat. The triage nurse took one look.

My ex husband Frank could only remember our marriage that ended 15 years ago. The facility called me first when he started asking for his wife. Linda, that's me, except I haven't been his wife since our son graduated from middle school. I'm married to Robert now, have been for eight years. Frank remarried to a woman named Diane who lasted four years before leaving him. Then he stayed single, focused on his work at the engineering firm, visiting our son Eddie on weekends. The disease came fast. First he couldn't find his car in the parking lots. Then he forgot his co workers names. By the time Eddie noticed something was really wrong, Frank was forgetting entire decades. The doctor said early onset alzheimer's, aggressive type, maybe two years before he'd need full time care. But Frank fooled them. His mind just picked one time period and stuck there. Our marriage from 1995 to 2003 in his mind. Eddie was still 12. I still lived in our old house on Maple Street and we still had that tabby cat named whiskers who died 10 years ago. The facility said they'd never seen anything like it, a patient whose memories froze instead of disappearing completely. I went to see him because Eddie begged me to. Robert drove me there, waited in the parking lot while I went inside. Frank lit up when he saw me, asked why I hadn't visited Yesterday said Eddie, Science Fair was coming up and we needed to help him with his volcano project. He remembered everything from those years perfectly, our anniversary dates, the restaurant where we'd get Chinese food on Fridays, the way I leave him notes in his lunch bag. He just couldn't remember anything that happened after. Robert said I didn't have to keep going, but I went twice a week, Frank would tell me about his day at work, except the work was from 20 years ago, projects long completed, co workers long retired. He'd ask about my mother who'd been gone for a decade. He'd remind me to tape that show we used to watch together on Thursday nights. Then Robert started coming inside with me. Frank would introduce himself every time, shake Robert's hand, say any friend of Linda's was welcome. Robert would sit there while Frank told me he loved me.

I was not impressed when my 18 year old daughter brought home this scrawny college kid named Marcus. He was studying art history, had never thrown a punch in his life and called me sir every other sentence like he was terrified of me, which honestly he should have been. I decided to put him through what I call basic training. Every time he came over, I'd find some way to test his character, make him help me move furniture in the garage, work on the car in freezing weather, anything to see if he'd crack and run. Marcus never complained. He'd show up in old clothes to work. Even when I made him reorganize my entire tool shed twice because I claimed he did it wrong the first time, he just smiled and said, yes, sir, I'll get it right this time. What really annoyed me was how gentle he was with my daughter Emma. He'd hold doors open for her, carry her books and actually listen when she talked about her day. It was like watching someone handle a piece of glass they were afraid to break. One Saturday I decided to really test him. I told him we were going hiking, but I LED him on the most brutal trail I knew, six miles straight uphill through thick woods. I was hoping he'd quit halfway through and show Emma His true colours. Three hours in, Marcus was struggling. His face was red and he was breathing hard. But he never asked to stop or complained. When we finally reached the top, he just sat down and said, that was beautiful, sir. Thank you for bringing me here. That's when I noticed he's been taking pictures the whole time. Not selfies, but shots of wildflowers, interesting rock formations and views of the valley below. When I asked why, he said, Emma loves nature photography, but she's never been on a trail this remote. I wanted to show her what she's missing. The real moment came two weeks later when Emma called me crying from campus.

My son passed away two weeks ago, and his last words keep replaying in my head. My eldest son was only 16. He was my wife's first born, and I adopted him at the age of seven, making him my only son. At the time. I loved him as much as my other two boys we had later. He was my best friend for so many years, but definitely started to back off in his teens, where he just became standoffish. And just a teenager, I guess. Anyway, on the first of this month, his mom was heading to a town about 90 minutes away. He was awake and doing stuff around the house when she left around 10:00am. I work from home and was on a call until 11:00am, when I came out of the office and told him and his brother I was running to get us lunch. He kind of just nodded at me without saying much, which was normal. I got back to the house with the food around 12:20. He came out to grab his food, but looked wobbly and his eyes were not focusing on me very well. He was also mumbling really low and sort of stumbled once. Immediately, because I am an idiot and a jerk, I start asking him, what are you on? Tell me what you took in accusing him. Because it was so unlike his normal actions, he responded with nonsense answers. Like, I didn't steal anything. I bought it at the computer store this morning. And then, oh, yeah, I'm going for a drive later if you want to come, or something like that. He was completely out of it, so I grabbed his wrist to check his pulse. All I remember was that it was rapid as hell. He allowed me to check his pulse, but yelled, why are you restraining me? When I did it. That's when I told his brother to stay in the living room and took him into his bedroom. I sat him on the bed and told him to show me what he took. I can be pretty hard on my boys, but I swear on my life I was not at this time. I told him a number of times, I am not going to be pissed. I just need to see what you're on so I can tell if we're in trouble here. And just show me the pills, buddy. Just show them to me. Finally, he pointed to a Walmart bag on the floor and said, everything I stole is in there. So I open up and dump the bag on the floor. It was all his school supplies we just bought the day before. Nothing substance like in there. That's when I started questioning myself.

Now she sought help against her husband's controlling behaviour. The wedding was supposed to start at two PM by 1:30, I was standing in the church basement in my tux, sweating through my shirt, waiting for someone to tell me Emily was ready. My best man, Derek, kept checking his phone and wouldn't make eye contact with me. That should have been my first clue. Around 1:45, my mom came downstairs, not to tell me it was time, but to sit me down and explain that Emily had something important to say. My mom's face looked weird, like she was trying not to smile. Emily walked in still wearing her regular clothes, no wedding dress. She held my brother Kyle's hand. They stood there in front of me and Emily said she couldn't marry me because she was in love with Kyle. They've been seeing each other for six months. My brain couldn't process what was happening. I just stared at them holding hands in the church basement while hundred and fifty guests sat upstairs waiting. Kyle was my younger brother by three years. We'd always been close, or so I thought. I looked at my mom for help, for her to say this was insane. But she just smiled and said sometimes love finds you in unexpected places. Actually hugged Kyle and told him she was proud of him for following his heart. My dad came down next and shook Kyle's hand, said he always knew Kyle would end up with someone special like Emily. I was standing there in my wedding tux being told my own family supported my brother stealing my fiance on my actual wedding day. No, nobody seemed to care that I was the one getting destroyed. My mom suggested I be the one to tell the guests the wedding was off since it would be less embarrassing coming from me. Less embarrassing. I walked out of that church, got in my car and drove six hours to my college roommates apartment in another state. Didn't talk to my family for 8 months. Kyle and Emily got married four months after my non wedding.

When my ex kept showing up to my daughter's soccer games. After I got a restraining order, I was done playing by the rules. For two months, I'd call the police every single time. They'd arrive 20 minutes later, long after she disappeared into the crowd. We'll make a report, they'd say, call us next time. Next time was always the same story. She'd sit far enough away to claim she wasn't bothering me, close enough that my daughter would see her and get distracted. I tried everything. Switched game times. She showed up anyway. Changed fields across town. There she was. Different parking spots. Arriving early, arriving late. Nothing worked. It's like she had some sixth sense for finding us. My lawyer said documentation was key, but what good is a blurry phone photo of someone sitting in public bleachers? The police reports were useless. Alleged violation, no contact made, subject gone upon arrival. I was losing my mind. Emma was losing her love for soccer. Her teammates, parents started whispering. The whole thing was spiraling. Last Saturday, I finally got smart about it. My sister's a process server, 20 years in the business, knows every loophole, every legal trick, every way people try to skirt court orders. I called her Friday night. Bring your good camera, I said, and wear something that looks official. What are we doing, she asked, ending this once and for all. Game day arrives. I'm scanning. The crowd, like always, that familiar nod in my stomach. My daughter's warming up with her team, practicing headers when I spot the familiar blonde ponytail, third row wearing oversized sunglasses, like that makes her invisible. She's got her usual setup, acting like a normal parent supporting her kid. Instead of my usual panic call to 9 1 1, I texted my sister one word, showtime. She walked over, casual as anything, clipboard in hand, sat right next to my ex and pulled out this massive professional camera.

Our cafeteria had this insane policy where you couldn't bring outside food, not even a granola bar from home. If they caught you with anything that wasn't purchased from their overpriced kitchen, it got confiscated immediately. My friend Enzo had severe food allergies, peanuts, dairy, shellfish, the list went on. His mom spent hours every Sunday meal prepping safe lunches for him because the school food was basically a minefield. But every single day, security would stop him at the entrance and take his lunch away. School policy, they'd say, tossing his carefully prepared meals into the trash. Ash, buy lunch here or don't eat. Enzo would sit at our table every day with just an apple juice he could afford, watching us eat while his stomach growled. We started sharing our food with him, but even that wasn't enough. He was losing weight, falling asleep in class, and his grades were dropping. That's when his little sister, Amara got involved. She was only a sophomore, but she had this fire in her eyes that made you nervous. This is ridiculous, she said. They can't force someone to starve. We thought she was just venting. But Amara had a plan. The next Monday, she walked into the cafeteria carrying a massive poster board covered in medical documents, allergy test results and photos of Enzo looking exhausted and thin. She didn't say a word to anyone, just sat down at the Center table where everyone could see her and started eating the lunch their mom had packed. Within minutes, a lunch lady marched over. You know the rules. Hand over that food. Amara looked up calmly and said, I'm documenting a human rights violation. Please state your name for the record. She had her phone recording everything. The lunch lady froze. You're forcing my brother to choose between following school rules and not dying from an allergic reaction. That's what we call discrimination. But here's the part that gave me chills. Amara had.

Me and my class were by the pool when the teacher asked why I wasn't getting in. I have a hearing aid, miss. I can't get in the water. Miss Garrett's eyes narrowed, like she just caught me in a lie. Hearing aid? You mean cochlear implant? She said it with this weird smile, like she knew something I didn't. Yes, miss. I signed automatically before remembering she probably didn't understand. My hands dropped to my sides as I pointed at the processor attached to my head. That's the third disabled foster kid this year. The way she mumbled the word disabled made my stomach twist, like she had something planned. I pulled out the doctor's note my foster mom, Maria, had made sure I kept in my pocket. Three different doctors had signed it, explaining why I couldn't get my processors wet. Miss Garrett held it up to the light, squinting at every word. Real doctor scribble. This is tight. She looked at me with this triumphant expression. Your foster mom thinks she's clever. My chest got tight. My mom knows your mom? She laughed, but it wasn't a nice laugh. You mean your foster mom? You've been with her, what, two months? Three. My face burned hot. You know what's funny? Miss Garrett continued waving my note around. Last year, I caught the Johnson family faking their kids autism. Say the district $50,000. One teacher of The year for it. She tapped her chest where I could see a pin on her shirt. I know a fake when I see one. She paused, scanning the pool area where my classmates were frozen in place. Remember what happened to your friends last month? One complaint from me, and they were expelled. A few kids stepped back. You know what, Mister? Garrett pulled out her phone. Let's call your mom. Bet she doesn't even answer. Probably dropped you off and forgot you exist. Every muscle screamed at me to bolt for the door, but I couldn't move. The foster system taught me that running meant violence. Running meant getting sent back to the group homes. My heart hammered as she dialed the number on the note. She put it on speaker, holding the phone out like evidence in a court case. Maria! Miss Garrett's voice dripped fake sweetness. Your foster child is refusing to swim. Is everything okay? Samuel has medical restrictions. Before you pretend to care, Miss Garrett interrupted, just know that I've caught seven fake disability notes. 7. We both know you won't fight this. He's not worth losing your foster license over. Don't touch my son's medical equipment!

We didn't want to bother you on Christmas since you're always so busy with work. You told me it was canceled. I said flatly. Her smile flickered. Well, things changed last minute.

No, I said, pulling out my phone, I'm going to save myself from the next one and the one after that. You wanted an easier Christmas without me? Congratulations. You can have all of them. I blocked their numbers in the driveway. By the time I got home, the group chat was exploding. I didn't read a single message. Instead, I texted my best friend, Marcus.

We'll do it next year, my mom texted. Then I saw their holiday photos, best Christmas ever posted. When they called me the next day, the text came in on December 23rd while I was wrapping the gifts I'd spent months carefully selecting. Honey, we have to cancel Christmas this year. Last minute changes with your aunt's health. We'll do it next year. Love you. My stomach dropped. Aunt Carol had been fine at Thanksgiving. I called mom immediately. No answer. I tried dad voicemail. My sister Jessica didn't respond either. Something felt off, but I told myself I was being paranoid. Family emergencies happen. I spent Christmas Eve alone reheating leftovers, telling myself it was fine. Then Christmas morning arrived and my phone lit up with Instagram notifications my sister had posted. I clicked and my heart stopped. There they were, the entire family gathered around the dining table. I'd been uninvited from. Mom, dad, Jack, Jessica, her husband, my brother Tyler, even Aunt Carol, who was supposedly too sick for Christmas. The caption read, Best Christmas ever. So grateful for family time. I scrolled through the photos. The expensive roast I'd offered to bring, the decorations I'd helped mom pick out last year, my nephew opening presents in his new pajamas. Every single person I'd spent 32 Christmases with celebrating without me. Not sick, not canceled, just without me. Comments poured in. Perfect day, Jessica's friend wrote. My mom replied with heart emojis. I sat there still in my pajamas, staring at the curated joy I've been deliberately excluded from. They hadn't just canceled, they'd lied. December 26th, 10:15 a. M, mom called. I let it ring. She called again and again. By noon, I had 19 missed calls and a voicemail. Sweetheart, we need you to come by today.

My real name was Anakin Skywalker Smith. Not a nickname, not my middle names. That was my actual legal first and middle name printed on my birth certificate. My parents met at a Star Wars convention in 1997, got engaged at another convention, had a Star Wars themed wedding. And when I was born in 2002, they thought naming me after the main character would be the ultimate tribute to their favourite franchise. They love Star Wars so much they had a room in our house dedicated to collectibles, spent thousands on replica lightsabers and went to every movie premiere in full costume. When I was little, it didn't matter because kids didn't get the reference yet. Elementary school was manageable because most kids hadn't seen the movies. Teachers would smile awkwardly when they read my name, but nobody made it a big deal. Then fourth grade happened and the revenge of the Sith came out. Suddenly every kid in school knew exactly who Anakin Skywalker was and what he became. A kid named Marcus stood up in the cafeteria and yelled, there's Darth Vader, and the entire lunchroom lost it. Within days, kids started making breathing sounds when I walked by, doing forced show gestures, calling me the chosen one in this mocking tone. Someone put a Darth Vader mask in my locker. The jokes never stopped. Middle school destroyed me. Every single teacher who called Roll would pause at my name. Some would even laugh thinking it was funny. Like my parents did something clever. Kids who didn't know me would hear my name and immediately start quoting the movies. I ate lunch in the library because the cafeteria was constant harassment. Someone started a petition as a joke to get me to change my last name to Vader. It got 150 signatures before a teacher confiscated it. I begged my parents to let me go by my middle name, Skywalker, but my dad said that's even worse. And my mom insisted I should be proud of such a unique, powerful name. They genuinely thought they'd given me this amazing gift. By 8th grade, I stopped introducing myself entirely. I just say call me whatever you want because I knew the second I said my real name, people would either laugh or immediately start making Star Wars references. I started skipping classes where substitute teachers might call my name out loud because I couldn't handle the attention anymore. High school was when everything fell apart. First day of freshman year, the principal read names during assembly for honor roll students, Anakin, Skywalker Smith. The entire auditorium of 800 students erupted in laughter. Someone yelled, I have the high ground. I walked out and sat in my car until school ended. My parents were furious when they.

On Monday, the teasing started. It started off small with just a few comments here and there, enough for me to ignore it. Then someone spray painted a dirty word across my locker. Then came the shoving in the hallway and the tripping in my classes. None of the teachers said a word about it. And when I went to the principal, his response was to say that I need to learn to stand up for myself. I went home crying every day that week. My friends stopped talking to me between classes. It didn't take long for Mandy to announce to everyone that she was dating Kyle, that I had missed my chance. Kyle ignored me at school and stopped coming to dinner at my house. My parents started asking me where Kyle was. I had to start making up excuses why I wasn't seen around my best friend anymore. The bullying at school got worse and worse until finally Mandy pranked me with a piece of pie in my face during lunch in the cafeteria. Something in me snapped. At that moment. I stood calmly and turned to face the room of students, wiping off the pieces of pie onto my napkin. Mandy smirked at me, daring me to say something. So I climbed onto the table and looked her dead in the eyes. You've been sleeping your way through the entire football team cheating. On every boyfriend you've ever had. I turned to face Kyle, satisfied to see the anger on his face. Don't be surprised if she's cheating on you. As for you, I know all of your secrets. I know you inside and out. We've been best friends since kindergarten. I know how you cried so much when your dad left you in 3rd grade. Your mom is an alcoholic and you spend most of your time at my house having dinner with me and my parents because you can't stand to be home. Do you want me to continue? He stood immediately. Please stop, he said quietly. I'm sorry I hurt you. I wipe the tears I didn't know were falling from my face. I'm sorry, too, I said. We're done, Kyle. You aren't welcome in my house anymore and we're no longer friends. Then I sat down and continued eating as if I didn't just break both of our hearts.

I said family comes first. Then she Learned why he really doesn't do children. I'm 34, single, child free by choice. Fernanda's 31, three kids by three different men. She's always been the family tornado. Chaos follows her everywhere. New job every six months, new soulmate every year. I'm the one with the stable job, the savings account, the house. She crashes out between breakups. Mom calls me the responsible one. Fernanda calls me when she needs me to save her. Two weeks ago, Fernanda showed up at my apartment glowing. I met him, the one. Brad's different. He's mature, established and has his own business. I'm stirring pot FASTA half listening to soulmate No. 13. There's just one tiny thing she says, he doesn't do kids. I laugh. Then he doesn't do you. You have three children. That's why I need you to adopt them. The spoon stops moving. I turn around. She's serious. Just temporarily, she adds quickly, like legally, so Brad and I can build our foundation. Then maybe in a year. Are you insane? You're always saying family comes first. He leaves after I refuse. But Thursday I come home to three kids on my doorstep with backpacks, Fernanda's car peeling out. Seven year old Maggie is crying. Five year old Eddie won't talk. Three year old Cassie keeps asking for mommy. Where's mom going, Maggie Asks, when is she coming back? My heart broke and I didn't have answers. I drove them to Fernanda's apartment. No answer. Her neighbor says she saw Fernanda and some guy loading boxes yesterday. I tried her phone, straight to voicemail. The kids slept in my guest room that night. Next, this morning, Fernanda texts an address. Just dropping off more of their things. It's a motel 40 minutes away. I have the kids with me since I don't have anyone to watch them. Brad answers the door. Neck tattoo, face tattoo, teardrop tattoo. The room reeks of weed. I look behind him to see a weapon on the nightstand beside a scale and little baggies. Fernanda's in the bathroom. I can hear her laughing. I back away slowly. Wrong room, I say. He slams the door. I don't bring the kids back there. The next day, I found Fernanda at her job, former job since she quit. That day, I corner her in the parking lot, my head fuming of anger. You can't just abandon your children for some drug dealer. She rolls her eyes. He's an entrepreneur. There was a weapon. He has security concerns. She checks her phone.

Gold digger, he said loudly enough for me to hear through the walls. Classic case. Give her a few more months and she'll be asking for money. The next morning at breakfast, Mister Chen made another announcement. Since you're staying in our house, eating our food, using our utilities, he said, looking directly at me, I think $50 for the weekend is fair. You can Venmo Marcus and he'll pass it along. This time Marcus exploded. Dad, stop, stop. This is insane. But I was done being humiliated. I stood up, pulled out my phone and venmoed Marcus, $50 with the memo, payment for basic human decency. Then I called my mom to pick me up. Marcus called me crying that night. I told him if he ever treated you like that again, I'd cut him off completely. He said, he said, fine, you were just using me anyway. We broke up two weeks later, not because I wanted to, but because being around Marcus meant dealing with his father's constant judgment. Every time we went out, I wondered if Mr Chen was calculating how much I was costing his precious son. Marcus tried to convince me to stay. We'll only hang out at your place, he promised. I'll pay for everything so he can't say anything. But the damage was done. I couldn't kiss someone whose father thought I was nothing but a walking expense report. Two months later, Marcus's parents got divorced. Turns out Mister Chen had been hiding massive gambling debts and using family money to cover his losses. Missus Chen took him for everything in the divorce, the lakehouse, the boat, even his precious investment portfolio. Marcus called me when it happened. Mom found casino receipts going back three years, he said, his voice broken. He spent our college funds, the house payment, everything. And he had the nerve to call you a gold digger. The best part, six months after that, I saw Mr Chen working at the same movie theater where I had worked. He saw me. His face went white. I walked over to the concession stand. One large Coke, please, I said, pulling out a twenty dollar Bill. He rang it up with shaking hands. Four dollars and fifty cents. I handed him the 20 and looked him dead in the eyes. Keep the change, I said. I know how hard it is to pay your own way.

She used her spare key and walked in during a scene with the girl screaming while the masked man stood over her. I'll never forget my mom's face when she saw what was on the TV. Her eyes got really big and her mouth made this tight line. She didn't yell like I expected. She just grabbed my hand very calmly, told Uncle Pete we won't be coming back, and walked me to the car in silence. Next day, she sat me down at our kitchen table and asked exactly what movies we'd watched and if Uncle Pete ever acted strange around me. I didn't understand why she was so upset about some movies when she was the one who left me there every week. He said, you know I'm mature for my age, I told her, defensively, picking at a loose thread on my sleeve. He takes pictures for his scrapbook when I get scared. And sometimes his friend Gary comes over and brings me candy. My mom's hands started shaking so bad she spilled her coffee. She called her sister, who came over right away. They talked in whispers in the kitchen while I watched cartoons in the living room, feeling like I was in trouble but not understanding why we never went back to Uncle Pete's. I miss the ice cream and feeling grown up. And I didn't understand why mom started staying home on Friday nights even though we needed the money in middle school. We had a health class about how children's brains aren't developed enough to process violent or sexual content and how exposure can cause anxiety, nightmares, and confused ideas about relationships. Teacher explained how some adults use desensitization to break down children's natural discomfort with inappropriate things. Something clicked in my brain, but I pushed it away. Last month I found my mom on Facebook. We haven't spoken much since I left for college. Remember Uncle Pete? I asked when we met for coffee at the diner near my apartment. Was he showing me those movies to groom me? Mom set down her cup with a little clink against the saucer. Keith's in prison now, she said quietly, her eyes focused on the steam rising from her coffee. They found a lot of pictures on his computer. Not just of you. She reached for my hand across the table. I should have known better than to leave you there. I'm so sorry. I suddenly remembered all those photos of my scared face, the scrapbook I never actually saw, and felt sick to my stomach. What I thought was being treated like a grown up was something much darker. And I realized why Gary always brought me candy.

Every Friday night when I was nine, my mum would drop me at Uncle Pete's house while she worked her late shift at the hospital. Uncle Pete wasn't really my uncle, just my mum's friend from high school who lived in our neighbourhood with his three cats in a house that always smelled like cinnamon, air freshener and microwave popcorn. I loved going to Uncle Pete's because he let me stay up late watching movies. The other kids at school talked about movies my mom said were not appropriate and would give me nightmares for weeks. But I never got nightmares at Uncle Pete's house. I was too excited about being treated like a grown up. Our little secret, Uncle Pete would say, handing me a bowl of ice cream bigger than my head with extra chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Your mom works so hard and she's just trying to protect you. But you're mature for your age. I can tell you can handle it. I'd sit cross legged on his living room floor, eyes glued to the screen, while people got shot, stabbed or chased by monsters with bloody teeth. The living room would be dark except for the glow of the TV, making everything feel more intense. Sometimes there were scenes where people were kissing and taking their clothes off. That made me feel weird and squirmy. But Uncle Pete With just laugh. Cover your eyes if you want, he'd say. But he never fast forwarded through those parts like my friend's parents did during sleepovers. Instead, he'd watch me watching the screen with this little smile. Well, I didn't understand back then. When particularly scary scenes came on, I'd hide my face in a pillow while Uncle Pete took pictures with his fancy camera. Your face is priceless, he'd tell me. I'm making a scrapbook of movie night reactions. Someday, when you're older, we'll look back at these and laugh at how scared you were. I was secretly proud that he thought I could handle these grown up movies. When other kids at school talked about Freddy Krueger or the Exorcist, I could casually mention I'd seen them, too. It made me feel special and older than my age. Sometimes Uncle Pete would invite his friend Gary over. They'd sit on the couch behind me, talking quietly and laughing at things I didn't understand. Gary always brought me candy that my mom never bought. Those sour or worms that made your tongue hurt. But in a good way. She's so into it. I once heard Gary whisper to Uncle Pete during a movie, you were right. One Friday night, my mom picked me up earlier than usual because the hospital was short staffed and she got to leave early. Uncle Pete didn't hear her knock because the movie was so loud. A scene where a teenage girl was running Through the woods from a man with a mask and a

My boyfriend's dad made me prove I wasn't a gold digger by counting out exact change for a three dollar soda. I was 17 and had been dating Marcus for eight months when he invited me to his family's lake house the weekend. Dad's been wanting to meet you, Marcus said nervously. He can be intense about money stuff. I should have paid attention to that warning. The house was massive, three stories overlooking the lake with a boat dock and everything. Marcus's dad, Mister Chen, greeted me with a firm handshake and immediately started asking about my family. So your mother works where, he asked during dinner, cutting his steak. She's a nursing assistant, I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. And your father? We don't really have contact with him. Mister Chen nodded like he was taking mental notes. I see. And you work, too, I assume? Yes, sir, at the local movie theater concessions. Mostly. The questions continued through dinner. How much did I make per hour? Did I pay for my own car? Who bought my clothes? After dinner, I was thirsty and asked Marcus if I could grab a Coke from their fridge. Of course, Marcus said. But his dad immediately stood up. Actually, Mister Chen said, walking to the kitchen, those sodas cost money. If you want one, you need to pay for it. I stared at him confused. I'm Sorry, the sodas, they're $3 each. If you want one, I need you to pay me exact change. Marcus's face went bright red. Dad, what the hell language, Mister Chen snapped. I'm teaching her about financial responsibility. If she's going to date my son, she needs to understand that nothing in life is free. My hands were shaking as I opened my purse and counted out three crumpled dollar bills. Mister Chen watched me closely. There I said, my voice barely above a whisper, exact change. He smiled coldly and handed me the coke. See, not so hard to pay your own way. I wanted to run, but Marcus grabbed my hand and whispered, I'm so sorry. He's never done anything like this before. That night, I heard Mister Chen on.

In the 90s and early 2, Joseph Fritzl held his daughter Elizabeth prisoner in the basement of their family home. This started when she was 18 and he held her captive for 24 years doing horrible things to her. He fathered seven of her children including three who stayed with Elizabeth in the basement and the three other were fostered by Fritzl and his wife. The seventh child died shortly after birth, but he was able to hold her captive for 24 years until the captivity and abuse was discovered in 2008 when Elizabeth and her eldest child needed medical attention. In 2009, Fritzl was convicted on incest, essay coercion, false imprisonment, enslavement and negligent homicide and he was sentenced to life in prison. He spent 15 years in a prison unit for the criminally insane. But last year, 90 year old Fritzl was moved to a normal prison and this transfer allowed him to apply for release which his lawyer reportedly did in August. His lawyer Astrid Wagner had argued that Fritzl has progressive dementia and should be moved to a dementia center which she said is a quote, better place than prison. But this week Fritzl was denied this move. The court ruled That Fritzl still has aggression toward his family as part of his delusions and that him posing a threat cannot be ruled out. Therefore, he must remain in prison. His lawyer, Wagner, said she doesn't agree with this and will be contesting the decision. But hopefully he will remain in prison for the rest of his life because that's where he deserves to be.
