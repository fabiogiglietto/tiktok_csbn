Although I didn't know what the old witch was doing, my friend handed her a towel to stop the bleeding. But suddenly, when he wasn't paying attention, the old witch snipped off a lock of his hair. I immediately grabbed my phone to call the police when suddenly a crisp ringing of a bell sounded. I felt as if my body was instantly controlled. I dropped the phone. Then my whole body began trembling and I lost all reason. At this moment, the old witch wrapped the freshly cut hair around the tree branch. When she snapped the branch in two, I seem to receive some kind of command. My gaze locked onto my friend and I rushed over, tackling him to the ground. I gripped his throat tightly with a large amounts of black. Then I began headbutting him directly, one blow after another, until his face was completely caked in. Seeing that he had stopped breathing, the old witch pulled out a lock of golden hair from her bag, wrapped it around the branch, again, repeated the same motions. I seem to receive a new command and shot out at lightning speed. I was like a missile weaving through the streets. Pedestrians on the roadside stopped one after another to watch the spectacle, thinking I Was doing some kind of impromptu performance. The witchcraft guided me toward my destination. As my steps grew faster and faster, I arrived at the gas station where my target was located. It was my female co worker, but I had absolutely no control over myself. When my co worker saw me in this state, she had no idea what was happening to me. She stood there frozen in place, a complete mess. I had no intention of stopping whatsoever. I rushed over and tackled her to the ground.

I can't let you leave in this condition. What condition? There's no condition. You're intoxicated. I'm not. I'm not. Okay, Earl, hold on. Earl. I got it. Earl, come up here, please. No, thank you. No, I can't. Okay. Hold on, sweetie. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. Okay. I'm sorry, Dr Halstead, Miss Goodwin, I have a patient, an air traffic controller who has a drinking problem. Both She and her husband refused to admit it. So I am going to inform the FAA. I wanted to make you aware. And you're certain about this? Yes. I didn't want to believe it at first. She's very convincing, but it has been going on for some time. And clearly, both she and her husband are in denial. I see. Well, she's your patient. It's your call. I would encourage you to make sure there are no extinguishing circumstances that you're not aware of, because once you make the call to FAA, this woman's career is very likely over.

My mom muttered, please don't make a scene. Then came Liam's speech. Before we wrap up, I want to say a few words about my brother, Noah. The crowd clapped politely. Noah's the responsible one. And now he's got a yacht and a perfect life. But don't let that calm face fool you. He's stubborn. I asked him for a tiny favor, to use his boat, and he said no. He turned to the audience. You believe that? His own brother? Two groomsmen wheeled out a massive framed photo of my yacht. This, Liam announced, is what my brother loves more than family. The room erupted in laughter. My face burned. I stood up. That's enough, Liam! He waved me off. It's just a joke. No, it's not. At the reception, I overheard Tessa's bridesmaid. Liam told the planner they're taking the yacht tomorrow for an after party cruise. He already gave them the Marina code. My blood went cold. He'd somehow gotten my security code. I walked straight to him. You're not taking it? He leaned in. You're really going to do this here? I don't care how it looks. You've got everything, he hissed. All I wanted was one weekend. Before I could respond, his hand shot out. The slap echoed across the room. Glasses froze. Conversations died. The humiliation hit harder than the sting. Then an older man stood up. That's enough, he said. You've crossed the line. He walked toward us. For. For anyone wondering, I'm Judge Harold Miller, and what I just witnessed was assault. The air left the room. Liam stammered. It was just. Not another word. The judge cut him off, laying a hand on him in front of witnesses. That's something else entirely. Liam's face crumbled. Months later, he sued me for emotional distress. Judge Miller dismissed it immediately. Frivolous and baseless. Then Liam pitched a partnership. Everett Luxury Charters. I played along long enough to trademark the name myself. When he announced it at a charity gala, I took the mic. Just to be clear, I said, any use of that name is unauthorized. He stood there, frozen. Tessa left him. His company collapsed. And me. I finally understood that revenge doesn't come from anger. It comes from knowing your own worth.

Travis told us his dad had lost his job three months ago and had been getting drunk every night since then. Tonight was worse because mom had used the last of their savings to buy groceries instead of giving him drinking money. The next few minutes were terrifying. Dad found Travis in his room and started screaming about him being on the computer instead of helping with money. We heard the headset clatter to the ground. Travis was crying, no, dad, please, not the belt! That's when we heard sirens in the background. The dad started yelling about calling the cops, and Travis screamed that he hadn't done it. There was a loud thud. Later, we found out the dad had thrown Travis against the wall. We heard the police announcing themselves, then the sound of the door being broken down. There was a lot of shouting, things breaking. Finally, the dad screaming as they arrested him. A female officer found Travis and checked if he was okay. Travis picked up his headset one last time. He was crying, but managed to say thank you before his mom took him to the hospital. The officers talked to us briefly through his mic, getting statements about what we'd heard. I couldn't sleep that night. None of us could. We kept our party chat open until morning, just processing what had happened. Ryan used his police connections to follow up. On the case, Travis and his mom moved in with his grandmother. That week, his dad got arrested for domestic violence, child abuse, and a bunch of other charges. Six months later, Travis joined our party again. His voice was brighter, and he told us things were much better. His mom had a good job, he was doing well in school, and his dad was in prison. Still plays with us sometimes, but now we only hear normal household sounds in the background. His mom calling him for dinner, his dog barking, his little sister asking to play. Last week, Travis's mom joined our party chat briefly. She was crying, but this time from gratitude. She thanked us for being there that night, for not disconnecting, for caring about her son. She told us Travis calls us his guardian angels. His dad serving 15 years, and they're finally at peace.

Brandon, who'd been bragging for weeks about his guaranteed Stanford spot because of his family connections? Brandon who'd looked confused yesterday when everyone was celebrating their acceptances and he hadn't gotten any letters at all. You sent my acceptance letter to Brandon Walsh, didn't you, I said quietly. The woman's silence was all the confirmation I needed. How many of us, I asked. I can't discuss how many kids got letters that weren't meant for them? She sighed deeply. About 180 students received acceptances they weren't entitled to, and about 120 students who were actually accepted never received their letters. My blood ran cold. So there are kids who actually got into their dream schools but have no idea because their letters went to someone else. She nodded miserably. I walked out of that office in a days. But as I passed the counseling center, I heard shouting. Through the glass windows, I could see Brandon Walsh's father screaming at our college counselor. Mr Stevens, my son's acceptance was sent to some random kid. Do you have any idea how much money I've donated to this school, how much I've paid for his tutoring? Mr Stevens looked like he wanted to disappear. Sir, it was a computer error we're trying to fix. Sit. My son's entire future is at stake. You think Stanford is going to hold his spot while you figure out Your incompetence. That's when I realized something horrifying. This wasn't just a random computer glitch. I thought about all those times Mr Stevens had pulled me aside to ask about my backup plans, how he'd suggested I apply to community colleges just to be safe, how he'd seem surprised when I told him I was applying to Ivy League schools. I thought about how Brandon had been so confident about Stanford, even though his grades were mediocre and his sat scores were lower than mine. This wasn't an accident. Someone had deliberately switched our futures. As I stood there watching a rich man scream about his son's rightful place at Stanford, the place that should have been mine, I realized the most brutal truth of all. The mistake wasn't sending me Brandon's letter. The mistake was getting caught.

I'll never forget Missus Rain's face when she walked into homeroom crying. Not fake teacher tears. Real ugly sobbing. She couldn't speak at first, just stood there shaking while we stared in confusion. Finally, she choked out. There's been a mistake. A very serious mistake. Then Principal Jackson's voice came over the intercom. Hollow and aged. Students, Yesterday's college acceptance announcements contained significant errors. If you received an acceptance letter, report to the main office immediately. My heart stopped. I'd gotten into Stanford, my dream school. Around me, half the senior class started freaking out. Jessica had Harvard, Mike had MIT, Sarah had Princeton. We'd all been celebrating yesterday. What kind of errors? Someone shouted. But missus rain kept crying in the hallway. Chaos. It's running. Clutching acceptance letters, calling parents. Tommy Martinez punched his locker, screaming, I already quit my job. The line outside the main office, down two hallways. Everyone looked terrified. When I finally got to the front, there was a woman I'd never seen before, sitting behind a folding table. She looked exhausted, like she hadn't slept in days. Name? She asked without looking up. Johnny Chen. I got into Stanford. She flipped through a massive stack of papers, found mine, and her face fell. I'm sorry. Your actual status is waitlisted. The words hit me like a physical blow. What do you mean, actual status? There was a system error. The wrong acceptance letters were sent to Approximately 300 students across the district. The real decision was waitlisted, not accepted. I felt the room spinning. But I got a letter. An official letter with the Stanford seal and everything. I know. I'm truly sorry. The error occurred in our district's college counseling database. Somehow the test results got mixed up and the wrong notifications were generated. That's when it clicked. Wait. Whose acceptance letter did I get then? She looked uncomfortable. That's confidential. But I already knew. I thought.

I was playing Rainbow Six Siege late one night when I had just joined a random squad and this kid, probably around 12, was being super chatty and excited. He kept talking about strategies and asking for advice, clearly just happy to have people to play with. About an hour into our session, we heard a loud crash through his mic followed by screaming. The kid went quiet for a second, then whispered, I have to go, but he didn't disconnect. Instead, we heard heavy footsteps and a man's voice slurring, where's the money? The kid's mom was crying in the background. My whole squad fell silent listening to this domestic violence situation unfold through this poor kid's headset. The dad was clearly drunk, throwing things and demanding money they apparently didn't have. The kid must have forgotten his mic was still on. The mom's voice got closer, begging the husband to calm down. Please, Travis is in his room. He can hear everything. That's when we heard the sound of someone being hit, followed by the kids screaming, stop hurting, mom. My hands were shaking. One of my squadmates, Ryan, asked if anyone knew the kid's real name or where he lived. Nobody did. We only knew him as Snipe King. 2:03, another teammate was already calling 9 1 1, but what could we tell them? Suddenly the kid's voice came through. Clearly, he must have put his Headset back on, he was crying and trying to whisper, please help. My dad's really drunk. He's hurting mom. We live at 1847 Oakwood Drive in Pittsburgh. Please send someone. Ryan, who turned out to be an off duty cop from Philadelphia, took charge. He kept talking to Travis, keeping him calm while another teammate relayed the address to Pittsburgh PD. We could still hear the.

One Tuesday, I came home from work and peanut was gone. My apartment door was unlocked, but nothing else was touched, just no peanut. Like someone had broken, taken the dog and left. I lost my mind looking for him. I printed hundreds of flyers, posted in every Facebook group, walked the neighborhood until 2:00am calling his name for three days straight. I barely slept, just searched. Then our mutual friend Liz showed up at my door. Her face was pale and she couldn't look me in the eye. I need to tell you something about peanut, she said, her voice shaking. My heart dropped. Evelyn's been telling everyone you've been neglecting peanut, that he was suffering so badly she had to intervene. I couldn't process what she was saying. What do you mean by intervene? Liz started crying. She took him to a vet, told them he was aggressive and suffering from neglect. She had him put down. He's dead and she's bragging to everyone about it. The room tilted as the pain hit my system like a Hurricane. My heart broke. My perfectly healthy, happy dog was dead because Evelyn decided a golden lab made her insecure. When I could finally speak, all I asked was why? She said you didn't deserve him. That someone who actually cared would have noticed he was in pain. I thanked Liz for letting me know and went to sit on my couch. I stared at the Wall for five hours, dissociating, trying to decide what to do to teach her a lesson, one that would stick. That's when the idea hit me. I wouldn't confront her, wouldn't scream or cry or let her see what she'd broken in me. Instead, I did research, found out about what life would be like if you got stranded in Chiapas, the for a state in Mexico, a perfect experience for someone like Evelyn. Here was my plan, aka operation get rid of Evelyn. Part 1, the bait. I create a fake website to promote a fake influencer retreat in Chiapas and send Evelyn the link and tell her I applied. Evelyn would apply to prove she was better than me. Part 2, the execution. Taxi driver would drive her from the airport in Mexico to an extremely poor village in Chiapas, one that is rampant with intimacy workers, and leave her there completely stranded. And my plan worked perfectly. It's been three years since she left and no one's heard from her. But when I remember Peanut's face, I realize I don't care.

Occasionally, before rising from bed, nuns already form queues outside his door, awaiting his assistance. One by one, they approach with countless trivialities, unaware this man is actually a fraudulent infiltrator. Merely four weeks prior, elders spoke of a Hillside cloister inhabited by youthful nuns. An old man claimed former employment there, expecting effortless duties, but discovered the sisters heavily relied on outsiders. Nearly all chores fell upon him. The man immediately conceived a scheme. That night, he formulated a plan. Feigning muteness, he infiltrated the abbey. The Mother Superior showed compassion, granted him shelter, appointing him monastery gardener. On his inaugural fruit harvest, two passing nuns observed his sturdy physique. They appeared unacquainted with such masculinity, were instantly captivated. One Sister, Margaret, pretended to need conversation, raised a stick to gain his notice as the man descended.

The tumbler doll on the lectern slowly pivoted. Class barely relaxed, yet none comprehended the preceding events just five minutes prior. All was normal. The teacher's skull suddenly detonated, shattering into countless blood droplets. A red tumbler leaped onto the podium. Thus the deadly game commenced. Detecting any movement, it instantly crushed that boy's cranium. The adjacent girl perished immediately. All who stirred were slaughtered. The entire classroom plunged into Terror's grip. No one knew when the game would conclude, nor who would be the next target. Each psyche approached its breaking point. But when the doll turned around, Survival Instinct locked them in place. Only upon its reversal could they briefly exhale. They attempted to find escape routes, but consistently failed. Then a voice emerged from the room's center. He urged everyone to remain calm, asserting every game possesses a winning method. The classmates marginally relaxed following his indication. They spotted a button on the doll's back labeled press to terminate game. As the toy commenced countdown, the dyed hair youth's eyes ignited with hope.

We got a white couch, which may have been a poor choice, but I love that they even had colors to kind of coordinate with our couch color. And I feel like they look so much nicer than blankets. And when this does get dirty, I can just pull this off and throw it in my washer and dryer. It's honestly been such a lifesaver. I'm going to go ahead and put it down in that orange card if you want to check it out.

Dad was from Grandpa's first wife, who died young. Dad was adopted by Grandpa's second wife, who raised him as her own. So technically, I showed no connection to my legal grandmother. But I'm still blood to Grandpa. Tyler never bothered to test himself. Why would he? He was so sure of his place in the family. The morning of the family reunion, Tyler showed up at my door with Esther and a folder of papers. Sign the house over to me, or I tell everyone you're not real family. His girlfriend Esther stood behind him, smirking. Just sign it, Amy. You know you don't deserve that house anyway. Tyler's the real heir. We'll even let you visit sometimes, Tyler added generously. Maybe at Christmas, if you're good. No, I said simply. Tyler's face turned red. Then you're finished. Everyone's going to know what you really are. A fake. A fraud. Someone who stole from the real family. Esther pulled out her phone. We already made copies of everything. One click and it goes to everyone. Do what you need to do, I said, closing the door. The reunion was at Aunt Lisa's place. About 40 relatives all gathered for our annual summer gathering. Tyler waited until everyone was eating to make his announcement. He actually brought a wireless microphone he bought just for this moment. He tapped it twice to get everyone's attention. Everyone, I have something Important to share about Amy and the inheritance situation. He pulled out a folder dramatically. Amy is not biologically related to this family. I have the DNA results right here. She's been pretending to be one of us and she stole my rightful inheritance. He held up the papers like evidence in a courtroom. See? No biological match to mom or dad. She's been lying to all of us. The silence was thick. Everyone turned to look at me. Some relatives were already whispering. Cousin Janet covered her mouth in shock. Uncle Ray shook his head. Esther was recording everything on her phone, probably for their social media later. This is why Grandpa's house should come to me, Tyler continued, gaining confidence. I'm the actual blood relative, the real grandson. I stayed calm and pulled out my own folder. Tyler's right. I'm not biologically related to mom. But before you all turn on me, maybe Tyler should share his own DNA results. What are you talking about? He laughed nervously. I don't need a test. I look exactly like dad. Do you, though? I opened my folder because I have here adoption records from 1998. Tyler James, adopted at 3 months old by Lorna and Daniel Quinn. That's you, Tyler. You're the adopted one. His face went white. Full story on channel link below.

But here's the catch. There's no internet, no entertainment of any kind, and only a single double bed for both of them to sleep on. Their only food is a nutritional liquid distributed by the organizers, and the challenge must be completed together. If even one person quits halfway, the other can finish the entire ordeal and still only walk away with 1 million. The moment the man pressed the red start button, the countdown officially began. Thinking about the fortune waiting at the end of 50 days, the two cheered excitedly inside the room, already planning how they'd spend the money and dreaming of a bright future. First, the new environment, fresh, almost fun. But as the days dragged on, one after another, they realized the challenge wasn't nearly as easy as they had imagined. Every night the lights would shut off on sketch jewel, forcing them to sleep. And at sunrise, they would be awakened automatically. Their meals were always the same, a bland, unappetizing nutritional drink. But for the prize money, they had no choice to. Lisa tried to pass the time through meditation, while Matt motivated himself, exercise. Whenever the boredom became overwhelming, they played tiny improvised game just to keep their minds busy. Even so, time crawled painfully slow. They finally made it. To day 20, but by then.

Two identical moles perfectly mirrored. He remembered them clearly, his beloved live stream anchor. She had the exact same Mark, even the shade of her nail polish mat. At that moment, he drew a shocking conclusion. The plain forgettable office worker standing before him was actually the mysterious masked host he adored for months. From then on, he couldn't help watching Lisa more closely, uneasy, yet fascinated, as if he finally knew who live behind that digital map. His name was Jack, a man terrified of human contact. Years of mockery for being short, heavy and ordinary left him avoiding every gaze, flinching the moment someone looked his way. So when he saw those moles while taking her papers, it was the first time he truly looked at her. When Jack later Learned that Lisa struggled with her own appearance, he often comforted her during their broadcast, reminding her that charm came from within, not from a flawless face. Those words quietly warmed her heart. In the office, under daylight, Jack still couldn't bring himself to speak to her directly. One evening after a company dinner, he spotted Lisa climbing into the same car as the department chief returning home. He opened her live stream. Hearing her heartfelt monologue, he realized the truth. Lisa had fallen for her boss. The discovery shattered him. He could only vent silently at the glowing screen. Unable to confess or compete, from that day forward, he secretly kept watch over Lisa and the man she admired even began reading.

She wants us to repair our marriage by going to the counselor. She wants us to sleep in the same room and to go outside and have fun together. Our outside of marriage relationships are to be strictly for smashing only and nothing else. And we are to talk about who we're sleeping with. I told her that I am content with the situation as it is, and I don't mind if she finds a partner to go out with. I encouraged her to and that I don't want to talk about our partners, but she is holding her ground. At this point, I'm split between trying to fix our marriage and handing her the divorce papers. I would appreciate some advice. Edit I'm not blindsiding her by having two simultaneous relationships. It's not that kind of situation. Since Sarah decided to open our marriage, the two of us didn't have any intimate moments. We didn't sleep together. We didn't go outside together. After I switched to working 30 hours, she didn't initiate any changes. Our relationship was essentially co parenting under the same roof. Once I started dating other women, she started snooping around. Once she found out I was dating Jane, she wanted to change the rules. Even then, she said nothing about closing the relationship, just changing it to only smashing outside of marriage. This boils down to me not being able to have a single intimate Relationship update one Sarah and I had two sessions with a couples counselor. The counselor was very dedicated and professional. However, Sarah kept making demands that felt very unreasonable and unfair. She wants to keep an open relationship that is only about smashing with no strings attached. And she doesn't want to find a job and keep working. She wants us, aka me, to buy a new house. In every variation, she stubbornly wants to have two thirds of these things. Today during the counseling, she threatened divorce. After counseling, she said the counselor was taking my side and wanted to change to another counselor, but I think the counselor was just trying to be fair and find a compromise. I had a talk with a lawyer and started divorce proceedings and she will get the papers in a couple of days. I will give her two months to start earning on her own. After that, I'm not giving any money whatsoever to her anymore. Edit I just wanted to add that I only started working 74 hours a week after she decided to open our marriage. Before that, I was working around 50 hours a week. I wasn't spending my time at bars and clubs either, helped with chores as much as I could, and I was home and available every weekend.

After thinking it through, I said yes, primarily because we have two children and I was working long hours and divorce sounded horrible. So I set up some ground rules. No bringing dates into our house, no dating, mutual friends, acquaintances, family members, colleagues, and we keep things private. For the next two years, I focused on my job and my kids. I worked extremely long hours and the little free time I did have, I devoted to my kids. I didn't have the time for dating, so I wasn't even trying. I moved to another room because the thought of Sarah smashing with another man and then sleeping in my bed felt horrible and I didn't want to know anything about who she was sleeping with. Our relationship became purely transactional as we became partners in raising kids. This summer, I managed to fulfill my financial goals. I do not have any debt whatsoever and both of my kids have enough money in their college fund. All I have to do now is keep adding some savings every month into the fund I made for their first home deposits. So I did some math and decided to cut my work hours from 74 to just 30 per week. Sarah wanted to get in debt again to buy another house and a new car, but I Said no. I used my free time to finally have a vacation I really needed and took my older son with me to tour the US together. I did some renovation work on our house, turned the basement into my man cave, started working out, playing sports and leading a healthier life overall. Then I actually started trying to land a date. For me, just having a smash and dash with somebody is not my thing. I want to at least be a friend to somebody, to go out together, watch movies, have fun, and then smashing would be a great addition. So I dated a couple women and I did find someone, let's call her Jane, whom I clicked with. With Jane, I was going out to concerts, art galleries, comic cons, movies, and we were compatible in bed, too. Sarah wanted to talk about my dates, but I said no. Then I caught Sarah snooping through my phone and we had a very strongly worded argument. Now.
