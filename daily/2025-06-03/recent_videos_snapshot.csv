Yes, A reporter asked him about it yesterday. Don't ever say what you said. That's a nasty question. I don't think Trump likes taco. No, he does not.

On Friday morning, President Donald Trump threatened to impose a significant new tariff on iPhones, seemingly in hopes of forcing the company to produce its most lucrative product line domestically. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your [sic] for your attention to this matter!” Caption from a story by: Chris Velazco",NA,"The president is threatening a 25% tariff on all iPhones not made in the United States, which right now is all of them. Like they don't make iPhones in the US. But this post on truth social didn't come out of nowhere. See, the Trump Administration has had a Trade War with China ever since Trump 1.0 in 2016. And this time around, tariffs got up to 145% on China. If you're sitting in Apple Park and your Apple CEO Tim Cook, and you read all this news, you might think, I have to do something about this. apple has been building most of its devices in China for decades. And Tim Cook himself is the one who set up those supply chains when he was working under then CEO Steve Jobs. So in an effort to pivot away from China, Tim Cook said most of the iPhones sold in the March to June time period would be made in India. Side note tariffs generally apply to broad categories of products and not a single product from a specific company. Which makes trying to implement such a tier of hard on both a legal and practical level. And apple makes more than one product. Like what about this twenty dollar cloth that apple for some reason needs to say what it's compatible with? It's a cloth. So let's say apple did wanna make the iPhones in the US. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars just to Make the plants that would make the iPhone. And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the vision for these plants would be, remember the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little little screws to make iPhones. That kind of thing is gonna come to America. Of the speculation that the price of a US made iPhone will cost anywhere from $2,000 to $3,500. And Tim Cook himself said, the main reason they produce iPhones in China is the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is. You know, in. In the US, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields.

Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that he may bar government scientists from publishing in the world’s leading medical journals, instead proposing the creation of “in-house” publications by his agency — the latest in the Trump administration’s attacks on scientific institutions. “We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies. Kennedy also accused several of the agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services — including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — of being “sock puppets” for the pharmaceutical industry. Adam Gaffney, a public health researcher and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, wrote in an email that “banning NIH-funded researchers from publishing in leading medical journals and requiring them to publish only in journals that carry the RFK Jr. seal of approval would delegitimize taxpayer-funded research.” The podcast episode was released soon after Kennedy bypassed the CDC and declared that his department would stop recommending the coronavirus vaccine for healthy pregnant women and children. Caption from article by Niha Masih and Amy B Wang.",NA,"What are you guys doing writing in our science journals? They were all established in the 1800s and they're all peer reviewed. Well, stop it. What? Why? I'm proposing the creation of in house publications within my agency. I don't understand. Your publications are under control of the pharmaceutical companies. You know, we probably should take steps to make sure that commercial interests don't impact reporting of science. Exactly. But banning NIH funded researchers from publishing and leading medical journals and requiring them to publish in journals that have your seal of approval. Uh huh. Would delegitimize taxpayer funded research. Oh yeah? Guess what? I also think these four agencies are sock puppets for the pharmaceutical industry. This is crazy. I'm writing about this in my personal journal. Also, we're gonna stop recommending the coronavirus vaccine for healthy pregnant women and children. We do not recommend not recommending that.

I spent a lot of time on college campuses. I love young men. I, I, I love frat guys. And in that, I realized, like, even the ones that identify as conservative are almost always pro choice.

She not only lost her spot as a judge for the next season, but was also required to pay $3 million in damages. However, no one seems to defend her because her actions were simply unacceptable. Firstly, Carrie repeatedly and harshly criticized the contestant Jamal on the show, deliberately magnifying his flaws. But the audience could see clearly that Jamal was not only talented, but also a strong and deserving contender. Despite this, Carrie frequently interfered with the other judges scoring and only managed to force a fake smile in front of the camera. Secondly, the competition between Jamal and John Foster was originally fair and friendly. Jamal's victory was well deserved, and John remained gracious and calm. Although John was also talented, Carrie's excessive favoritism towards him LED to questions about the fairness of his entry into the finals. Lastly, Carrie performed at a public event for Trump, but deliberately ignored the presence of the vice president, which once again sparked public outrage. Do you feel sympathy for Carrie?

In 1991, Sarah met Matthew Broderick and they came together because of their shared love for theater. After dating for six years, they officially got married. After marriage, the couple was very loving and welcome three children. They often attended events together and performed on Broadway. However, their marriage was not without challenges, as their relationship faced difficulties shortly after they got married. The gradually dull life after marriage made Matthew feel bored, so he secretly found several lovers. Reporters frequently caught Matthew on dates with his lover, even kissing them in bars. What's worse, he even brought his lover home for the night while Sarah was away. However, even after seeing these photos with her own eyes, Sarah refused to believe her husband had cheated. She said that unless her husband kissed another woman in front of her, she wouldn't believe the media's attempts to stir trouble. Matthew always maintained the image of a good man in front of her and the kids, which made it even harder for Sarah to leave him. Even if the whole world opposed their love, Sarah still loved Matthew. Now they have been married for almost 30 years. No matter what, we all hope Matthew will never betray Sarah again.

Seventy year old Kris Jenner recently appeared at the courthouse with Kim Kardashian and stunned everyone. She looked more like 29 year old supermodel Kendall Jenner than the grandmother of 12 grandchildren. This not only amazed people, but also raised a question how did she do it? The answer goes far beyond skincare. Kris Jenner undergoes facial procedures twice a year to ensure her appearance is always in top condition. However, relying solely on these external methods is not enough to explain the youthful glow she now radiates from within. What truly makes her reverse age is the emotional nourishment she receives from her boyfriend, Corey Gamble, who is 25 years younger than her. For over 10 years, Corey Gamble has been quietly standing by her side. He doesn't see her as a celebrity or the head of the Kardashian empire, but as a woman who deserves to be loved and listened to. When you're 70, would you want to be as youthful as Kris Jenner?

After reported being missing, the Annabelle doll was spotted and after where she was seen. I will never be going to Texas ever again. Not only was the reports about Annabelle the doll mysteriously missing, Annabelle had an entire summer. There is a store in front of her. After she was traveling from New Orleans to Texas, and then Texas to Chicago. Annabelle was reported to gone missing in Texas, where she was gonna go to the cities of Pennsylvania, Florida, and Louisville. But this is where it get that's even more worser. The real life lady from The Conjuring, Lorraine Warren, literally told us to never touch Annabelle the doll, as Lorraine said that Annabelle was the most evilest thing that she had ever been in possession of. But this is where it gets even more scarier. After reportedly going missing, they have allegedly found Annabelle. However, the guy that found Annabelle, people are saying and that he is allegedly using a fake Annabelle doll. Because people are saying that the true real Annabelle doll is actually still missing. That the real Annabelle doll is missing in one of these red states. Because the guy who says he knows where Annabelle is posted that she is back in the Warren Museum in Connecticut. And people are noticing that something is off and this could be a fake doll. Did you ever touch Annabelle?

And come back home with a two carat diamond. But I don't think it's glass. I don't think it's glass either. That's Marshall and his dad, Wills, holding the camera. In Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park. A unique place where anyone can go and dig for diamonds. And I scrape my bucket off the top. And Marshall's digging for China, Man. He's going as deep as he can. So we carry both of our buckets up to the wash center. The Arizonans love sifting dirt for treasure. But this dirt seemed different. So they took the shiny rock up to the Diamond Identification Center. Seeing if it's a diamond. Seeing if it's a diamond. Nothing tops a diamond. Will grew up out there. His uncle was an Arkansas State Park employee. So the road trip made sense. And the park superintendent let us know that it was a 2.03 karat Arkansas diamond. Second largest found in the park that year. Will showed it to us. And the proof. It's real. We're talking like point zero zero zero two % chance of finding one that big. Father and son bonding experience. As rare as the diamond they found.

When firefighters have seconds to act, they will do whatever it takes, including breaking the back windows of a car parked illegally in the way. But when Sergeant Darren Wyatt posted the picture, he got some unexpected backlash. Some people, I think, thought that we were, uh. We posted the pictures to humiliate somebody. We did not. We wanted to illustrate and educate. One guy tweeted, this is outrageous. The low life firefighters could have easily run the hose over a car. Instead, they wanted to exert the very little authority they may have. But we had a few people that. That really questioned why we didn't put the hose underneath the car, around the car, or over the car. And we wanted to demonstrate to those people that it just isn't feasible to do that. It reduces the flow of the water because of the kink in the hose, and it's just not possible. In a video just released by the Anaheim Fire Department, firefighters demonstrated slowing the flow of water by going around the car could have had disastrous effects. Most people think that they can park in front of a fire hydrant, nothing's gonna happen. And a lot of times, that's true.

Grund Nummer 1, Angst. die Angst dich wirklich zu verlieren. solange dein Ex weiß, dass du sofort zur Stelle wärst, wenn er oder sie sich meldet, warum sollte er oder sie etwas ändern? gerade jetzt genießen sie ihre Freiheit. sie Daten andere, Leben ihr Leben und wissen gleichzeitig, dass du noch da bist. es gibt für sie keinen Grund etwas aufzugeben. aber wenn der Kontakt abbricht und du plötzlich nicht mehr verfügbar bist, beginnt in ihnen etwas zu arbeiten. dann kommt die Angst hoch. die Angst, dass sie dich vielleicht wirklich verlieren könnten. und je länger du auf Abstand bleibst, desto realer wird dieses Gefühl. aber erst wenn diese Angst größer wird als der Wunsch nach Freiheit, erst dann besteht eine echte Chance, dass sie zurückkommt. Grund Nummer 2 Schmerz. Liebe tut weh, besonders dann, wenn es vorbei ist. auch wenn dein Ex genauso leidet wie du, müssen sie den Schmerz wirklich spüren, um zu begreifen, was sie verlieren. denk mal kurz nach, wie sehr hat dich dein Schmerz dazu gebracht, um die Beziehung zu kämpfen? wie viel hast du über dich selbst nachgedacht? dich verändert, weil du diesen Schmerz nicht mehr fühlen wolltest? genauso muss es deinem Ex. auch gehen nur durch diesen Schmerz erkennen sie den Wert von dem, was sie hatten und was sie verlieren könnten. und wenn dieser Schmerz nicht kommt, wenn deine Abwesenheit nichts auslöst, dann ist es hart, aber ehrlich, dann empfindet diese Person nicht dasselbe wie du und du darfst lernen, das zu akzeptieren. wenn du gerade mitten in so einer Situation steckst, dann bist du nicht allein. ich weiß, wie verzweifelt und kraftlos sich das anfühlen kann. deshalb biete ich dir meine persönliche Unterstützung an, auf meiner Website pdp dot com oder über den Link in meiner Bio. gemeinsam finden wir heraus, was für dich jetzt wirklich wichtig ist.

Do you wanna know how I know that? Because she is so rooted in her integrity and her value. She did exactly what she said she would do if she was in a situation like this. Whereas the rest of us are all like, oh, my God. The lesson is that, like, you never be too careful on a man. He's still gonna screw you over if he wants to. But no, it's not. That's not the lesson. If you're focused on that particular issue as the lesson, then you didn't actually learn from the wizard Liz. She's been teaching you how to create your dream life, not necessarily how to find a suitable partner. That man was right for her. Until he cheated. And then what did he do? Then she knew immediately. She was like, you're not the one for me. Get out of the way. And now she's just gonna, like, saying no is gonna open up to the yeses, which are fully in alignment with those. With those values that she has, that she knows that she has. Because when you are so aligned to your values, you're rooted in your self worth. the difference between men and women under patriarchal conditioning is women focus on self worth. Men focus on self confidence. Self confidence is all about the external acquisitions, right? The degrees, the money, the. The fancy job, the right woman. Whatever the case is all This external stuff. But the thing is, you keep filling your life up with all these external things. When you have no self worth. It all becomes an empty void. So it doesn't matter how much you're acquiring. You will never feel whole. But her, she's so rude in her self worth. That's literally what she's been teaching us the whole time. Like, if you actually pay attention, it's not about the guy is ruining everything. A man cannot ruin your life when you are rooted in your values. So please, stick to who you know you are. And, like, that's the lesson she's set up for life. Watch, she's gonna be with an even better person, more aligned person. She trusts her intuition. It's just a little. It's a little hiccup on the path, like, in the bigger picture of things.

Mach dir keine Vorwürfe, denn es ist niemals deine Schuld. niemals! 4tens, hör auf den Satz, so bin ich eben zu akzeptieren. es ist der mangelnde Wille an sich zu arbeiten damit. 1 Zeugnis von 0 Respekt dir gegenüber. 5tens, 1 Mann behandelt dich genauso, wie er für dich empfindet. 6tens, wenn er dir zeigt, wie er wirklich für dich fühlt, glaub ihm, auch wenn es dir nicht gefällt. 7tens, 1 Mann wird buchstäblich alles für die Frau tun, die er wirklich liebt. alles. 8tens, wenn er dich wirklich liebt, so wie er mit den Worten behauptet, werden das seine Taten bestätigen. er wird dir zeigen, dass er es Ernst meint. 9tens, für diesen Punkt werde ich viel Kritik bekommen und werd's trotzdem sagen, gibt keinen Mann einen 2. Chance. reife Männer sind sich ihrer Handlung voll bewusst, wenn sie etwas tun. alles andere für kleine Jungs. und zu guter Letzt, du verlangst nicht zu viel. du fragst nur den falschen Menschen. das ist wie 1 Paket, das an der falschen Adresse abgeliefert wird. und diese Punkte sollen sich daran erinnern, dass du es verdienst. respektiert! und natürlich auch geliebt zu werden von jemanden, der dich wirklich schätzt. willst du darüber sprechen? der Link ist in der Bio.

Respekt mehr als Egoismus. und er weiß, dass Liebe nicht davon abhängt, wie viele Menschen man an sich bindet, sondern wie gut man diese eine Person behandelt, die zählt. denn am Ende des Tages definiert dich nicht die Anzahl der Menschen oder Frauen um dich herum, sondern der Charakter, den du zeigst, wenn niemand hinsieht. also frag dich mal selbst, bist du 1 Mann, der aufbaut oder eher einer, der Sachen zerstört?

Fakt ist aber, Messi gewann die Wahl und ferrere ist seit 2.023 Pressesprecher von PSG.

This is serious. It's about Lily. Adam, Lily now is really not the right slime for jokes. I know this is your number. Why didn't you answer my calls all weekend? Are you okay, my love? Miss Smith, this isn't a joke. I'm Adam, a friend of Lily's. Our phones got switched by accident. She went camping with her friend Zoe for the weekend, but ever since the storm hit, I haven't been able to reach her. I've tried calling multiple times, but there's just no signal. Oh, my god. This better not be one of your stupid pranks, Miss Smith. It's not. I know it sounds strange, but I'm serious. I even offered to pick her up before the storm hit, but she insisted on staying. Wait, she was camping with a friend named Zoe? Yeah. Do you have her number? I checked Lily's phone, but I couldn't find anyone named Zoe in her contacts. That's because I know all her friends, and there's no one named Zoe. Wait, what? She made it sound like they were really close. No, Lily would have told me if she had a friend named Zoe. Miss Smith, I swear that's what she told me. They went on a road trip together. Adam, this isn't making sense. Are you sure she said Zoe? Yeah, she mentioned Zoe several times. They were camping together. I'm really starting to worry now. Do you know exactly where they went? She didn't give A specific location? Just that it was remote, out in the woods. I've been trying to figure it out from her messages, but there's nothing clear. You have her phone? Check her browsing history. Gallery chats or notes. There must be something that tells us where she is. I can't. I promised her I wouldn't go through her phone. This is an emergency, Adam. We need to do this. But I gave your daughter my word. Then we have to call the police. Something doesn't feel right. Let me keep trying to reach her. I'll look for more clues on her phone, but I won't invade her privacy just yet. Please do whatever you can, and if you hear anything, let me know immediately. I will. I promise. Wait. Lily just messaged me. Hey, Adam, it's Zoe. I'm okay, but Lily? Zoe? Finally, I get an answer. Are you both okay? What's going on with Lily? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? She isn't with me. Adam, I. I don't know what happened to Lily. How can you not know, Zoe? You were with her the whole time. Now tell me where she is. I'm worried about her. Rizz app. I need something rizzzy to calm Adam down. Sure thing, Zoe. Just say. Adam, chill. You're way too fine to be burning up like this. Adam, chill. You're way too fine to be burning up like this. Wow, that was smooth. Sorry, Zoe. You're right. I Think I was overreacting. It's okay, Adam. But seriously, where is Lily now? We got separated during the storm. She just disappeared out of nowhere. I'm sorry, Adam. I don't know what happened. I'm worried about her, too. I searched for her this morning when the storm calmed down, but I couldn't find her anywhere nearby. She left her phone in the shelter, so I can't even contact her. You mean my phone? Yeah, right. What should we do now, Adam? We should call the cops. This is serious. Oh, god. I don't wanna think about what happened to her. I really hope she's doing good. Her mom messaged me. She's worried as well. No, no, don't call the cops. What? What could they even do? We're in the middle of a huge nature reserve. It's just trees everywhere. They wouldn't be able to help. But why? The forest can be dangerous, Zoe. You should know that. She can't be far away. You should come to help me search for her. I'm worried about her too, Adam. She is my friend. But calling the police would just be unnecessary drama. Yeah, maybe you're right. Send me your GPS location. I'll come help you search. Okay, hang on. I'll send my coordinates. X, why the. I'm on my way with the car. By the way, Zoe. Who are you, really? How do you know Lily? We're in the same class. I'm her close friend. Really? You go to our school? I Don't think I've seen you around. Well, we only got close recently. I just moved here this summer, so maybe that's why you haven't heard of me. That makes sense, I guess. But something about this still feels off. If you're so close, why isn't your number saved in her phone? Oh, maybe she never got around to it. We mostly talk in person anyway. We've had a lot of group projects together in class. You know how it is. Group projects. Look, I don't know what to tell you. We just clicked. Maybe she didn't have time to mention it. There's nothing weird about it, Adam. I don't know, Zoe. It feels like there's something you're not saying. Anyway, what do I even tell her mom? That her daughter got lost in a rainstorm somewhere in the middle of a forest? Just tell her Lily's fine. We don't need to get her mom all worked up for no reason. I'm sure we'll find her. But what if we don't? I can't lie to her mom. She's already on edge. I can feel it. Something's really wrong. Relax. I think I have an idea where she could be. There's this spot Lily mentioned before. A place she likes to go when she needs some space. Space in the middle of nowhere? What do you mean? Trust me. I'll take you there. Wait, hold on. Why didn't you say that earlier? I wasn't sure at first, but now that I've thought, About it. I'm almost positive that's where she is. I hope you're right. Zoe, we need to find her because I think I've fallen for her. And this whole thing is crazy. And it's crazy because it all started just from our phones getting switched at school. The more we talked, the more I realized how much I actually care about her. I can't stop thinking about her notes. But none of that will matter if I don't find her first. It feels like there's a part of her she's hiding. Something important. I'll read them when I find her. Have to hang on. Her mom is messaging me. What did she say? Is my daughter okay? Adam, please answer me. I'm worried about Lily. Miss Smith, your daughter is okay. She just lost signal because of the storm. Oh, my god. Thank you. Don't worry. I have her location. I'm on my way to bring her back home. Thank you, Adam. You've been such a good friend to her. Please keep her safe. I will. I'm already heading there. By the way, who is her friend? Zoe? Did you manage to find out anything about her? Yeah. Wait, Zoe is texting me again. Adam, turn back. You don't know what I found. I'm already driving. What did you find, Zoe? Hello?

Elizabeth, your brother needs a chaperone to his soccer game tonight, so I'm heading out with him in a few minutes. Make sure your homework is done before I get home. Your brother and I got some pizza earlier. There's a leftover slice or two on the counter. Okay, mom. Elizabeth, take your brother to his soccer practice. I just got home from work and I'm tired. It's Aaron's birthday party today. Mom, I just got here. I missed her last party. Can dad please take Ben? Your father is working now. Don't talk back to me. Take Ben to practice now. Fine. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. I'm taking him to his practice. When you get home, hand me your phone. I'll be holding on to it for a few days until you can learn how to speak to me, okay? Elizabeth, Ben needs to borrow your iPad for an hour. His died, and I promised him an hour of screen time. Mom, I'm taking notes on it right now. Can I give it to him once I'm done? You still have that notebook Grammy gave You. For your birthday last year, right? Yes, why? Well, that means you can take paper notes then. It's one hour. Don't be selfish. Mom, Prom is this weekend. Could we maybe go dress shopping this Friday? I've got to take Ben to all of his games this week. Ask your father. Okay. Did you push your brother? He took my phone, wouldn't give it back, and when I tried to take it, he bit me. So, yes, I pushed him and he dropped it. Not hard, just hard enough to lose grip on the phone. Apologize to your brother. I got called into work early today. Can you pick up Ben's cake? His party is at 5:30. That cake can't be late. Okay, mom. Also, I paid for it 50% up front. I'm going to need you to pay for the other 50% when you get there. How much was his cake? $400. Please pay the $200. Mom, I don't have that money right now. Elizabeth, this is Ben's 12th birthday. This is important to him. Maybe you've been spoiled with too many indulged birthdays of your own. Buy the cake. I'll see about paying you back this week. Mom, I don't mean to push, but it has been two weeks since I bought Ben's cake. And I'm in charge of bringing in a food from a country. I'm studying for my history class this week. Could you please pay me back? Elizabeth, I cannot right now. Ben needed New cleats and shin guards for practice. Mom, this class is really important to me. Please. And soccer is really important to your brother. His coaches say he has real promise. And history is important to me. Mom, I think I might really want to pursue this. I don't have time for this right now, Elizabeth. Mom, can I talk to you about something? I'm busy right now. Elizabeth, call your father. He's at home right now. That's okay. Mom, I wanted to tell you that I got an art history internship. It's a virtual paid internship. I'll be working three days a week for three hours each day. The high school knows of the internship, and I'm doing it in place of one of my electives, so my schedule will be fine. I'm really excited for this, mom. I've been wanting to do this for so long. Will you still be able to take Ben to his weekend practices? Elizabeth, I looked into your room today, and it's filthy. Your clothes are all over the floor. It's absolutely disgusting. Clean it as soon as you come home. We're going to have ants if you keep this up. Sorry, mom. Just clean it. Why are you not up? You have class in 20 minutes. Mom, my stomach is killing me. I think I might have the flu. Are you sure that this doesn't have anything to do with your science test today? I know it's not your strongest subject, but You still have to put in the effort. I'll make up that test. Mom, I was throwing up all night. I just need the day to rest. Fine. But you're taking your brother to practice this evening. What the hell? Elizabeth, today was your brother's tryouts, and he missed them because of you. He texted me completely upset by the situation. I specifically told you that you had to take him this evening. Elizabeth, answer me right now. Do not ignore me! Elizabeth, I know you're reading this. I just got home from work. You're not here. Where are you? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, where are you? Answer me!

And then I said, if we are both single at 30, we should marry each other. I can't believe you remember all that. How could I forget? Things were so much simpler back then. My life is really complicated now after my divorce. Well, maybe we were meant for each other after all. Alyssa, I really like you a lot. But I need some time. Let's make a deal, my love. We will meet each other six months from now. October 25th at six PM. At the same beach we sat at 15 years ago. At the same bench. If our love is true, I will see you there. If not, I respect your decision. I won't see any of your text messages until then. But please still keep sending me updates about your life. I love you, Lucia. What do you mean? Alyssa, wait. Alyssa, it's been a month. I can't stop thinking about our deal. I will keep updating you about my life until we meet. I miss you. Hey, I got a promotion today. I wish you could celebrate with me. I hope that you're doing okay, too, my love. I can't wait to meet you. I saw your favourite movie today. It reminded me of you. I laughed a lot. Then I cried. I still miss you. Alyssa. It's exactly October 25th. The six months have passed. I waited five hours on the bench at the beach, but you never showed up. Please give me a sign. Just tell me if you've moved on. Don't keep me waiting. Hey, is this Lucia? Yes. Who's this? I'm Dimitri, Alyssa's friend. Oh, my god. Is she okay? How do you even know her? Alyssa saved me from homelessness and saved hundreds of people from the streets, addiction and prison. We owe her our entire life. What are you talking about? What happened to Alyssa? She didn't wanna tell you this, she's been involved in dangerous business for the past couple years. With very dangerous people. On the twenty fifth of October, Alyssa's place got caught on fire. She didn't make it. No, no, this can't be true. Don't worry, Lucia. We took care of it. Sorry you had to know this way. Alyssa. I wish I could meet you again. I truly did love you. And I wish you could know that. But it's too late now. Maybe we were meant for each other. But in the afterlife. Lucia, I didn't die.

Or take Tiana, for example. Her man was a perfect match. Bertha, of all people found him on Tinder. Since when is she on dating apps? Now I'm the last man standing, and once again she sees me going to my ex's house. I don't know what you want me to say.

Maybe because my ex died in a car accident last week.

Oh, okay. Uh, so let's start with your boyfriend's name. His name is Tim. Okay. And how long have you guys been together? Three years. We just had our three year anniversary. Oh, wow. Congrats. But. Well, but maybe not, I guess. Um, so tell me about the condoms. Okay. Alright, so Kim works for CO, which is a company that does data management, which it sounds kind of boring, I know, but he gets to go on like a ton of trips for conferences and stuff. And sometimes he brings me with him, but this time I couldn't go. Okay, so he. Alright, so he's on a trip right now then? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Um, so he's currently at a conference in Las Vegas. And just because his birthday and I. I felt really bad that I couldn't spend it with him. So I got a card and I put a 50 dollar Bill inside and said, here's some money for you to have after you lose everything on the craps table. Like, you know, like a cute little joke, but also a birthday card at the same time and like a little present. Yeah, yeah. I mean, and who doesn't need an extra 50 bucks in Vegas, right? Right. Like, like, couldn't go wrong, right? So the night before he left, he stayed at My place. Cause I was dropping him off at the airport early, we could spend time together. And I see his packed suitcase and I wanted to slip the card in there, I didn't want it to be the first thing that he saw when he opened it. I wanted him to like, be surprised when he found it. And I. I was also worried that if his bag got inspected at the airport, like, it might fall out, there might be issues. Sure, it's something like that. Yeah. Okay. So I'm digging through a suitcase, trying to find somewhere to hide this card, and I noticed this inside pocket. It's like, perfect. So I unzip it and that's when I find a whole bunch of condoms. Right, and. And why would he need them if you aren't going with him this time on the trip? Yeah, but even if I were going, like, we don't use them anyway, so it's like, you know, why do you need them, period, in the first place? Why do you even own them? Okay, alright, Devil's advocate here. Is there a chance that maybe they're really old? Like, maybe he put them in there years ago and just forgot about them? Maybe he never even uses, like, the inside pocket you chose and he just forgot they were in there. I wish, but, um, no, because I found his razor in there, his deodorant, his toothbrush, there was a ton of other Stuff in the same pocket. And the condoms were on top of all of that stuff, so he literally, like, stuffed them in last after all his bathroom stuff. Okay. All right. God, with it being in Vegas, too, I hope he wasn't planning on, like, hiring some skanky call girl or, like, visiting a brothel or something. Like, I honestly, I don't think that's it. I really think that there's someone else, and I've kind of suspected for a while. I, I think it's somebody that he works with. Oh, really? Okay. Do you. Do you know her name? I don't know anything specific. It's just like, you know, when you have one of those gut feelings. Okay, now, um, so do you know if he traveled alone? Like, did he say, I gotta take my assistant, Sasha Mcboots, with me this time or anything like that? No, he. He said he was just gonna go alone. Okay. You'd like to know who those condoms were meant for. Is he staying, I guess, at a hotel, then, I take it, right? Yeah, he's staying at the palms. Oh, wow. Right there on the strip? Yep. Yeah. That's nice. Um, okay, so what we can do is we can call his room, and then usually when we do this, we say something like, this is the front desk. A woman from this room called and asked for a new hair dryer. And at that point, he's either gonna say, well, There's no woman in this room. Or he's gonna turn to the woman next to him bed and go, hey, did you ask for a hair dryer? And if he does that, then you've got him. So either way, this will probably get you the answer you're looking for. Okay. Okay, now the other thing we might have to consider here is like, it's probably. Well, it's like not even 5:30 in the morning in Vegas, so there's a possibility if we call him, he may not answer. Well, are you gonna. Are you calling his cell phone or you actually calling the hotel room like blind? No, we're. We're calling the hotel room cause we're gonna pretend we're from the front desk. Have you ever heard the. His phone rings in the room are. They are super loud. That's true. I forgot about. Yeah. Okay, so he probably won't answer. we're gonna call him when we come back next. Thank you for calling Palms Casino Resort and spa. This call may be monitored or recorded. Please remain on the line for the first available hotel operator. Thank you for calling Palms Casino Resort. My name is Janet. How may I assist you? Yeah, I'm trying to reach my coworker. He's actually staying at your hotel. His name is Tim. Last name is H I A. Can you just, um. Can you connect me to his room? Yes, absolutely. Before I connected, would there be anything else that I could assist you with. No, that's it. Thank you. Have a good day.

When my dad married Cassandra, I was 11. Mom had been gone for 13 months. Melanoma that spread faster than anyone expected. One day, she was complaining about a headache, and 82 days later, I was standing at her grave in a black dress that still had the tags on. Dad waited exactly one year before bringing Cassandra home. She worked at his investment firm, client relations. Perfect teeth, blonde hair that never move. The kind of woman who wore heels to other people's barbecues. She makes me happy again, dad explained, his voice gentle but firm. I need you to try, Emily. So I tried. I helped Cassandra move in, carrying boxes of designer shoes to the closet where Mom's gardening clothes used to hang. I nodded politely when she rearranged our furniture, replacing family photos with abstract art that opened up the space. I even smiled when she transformed Mom's vegetable garden into a meditation patio, because growing our own food is so provincial. For three years, I performed the role of grateful stepdaughter. I attended her corporate events wearing the dresses she bought me. I tolerated her friends who cooed about how mature I was. For 14, I kept my grief hidden behind perfect grades and false smiles. Dad didn't notice when I stopped laughing, too busy with Cassandra's social calendar and the new clients she brought in. Too distracted by their couples retreats and wine club memberships. Meanwhile, I slept with Mom's sweater under my pillow until it stopped smelling like her. Cassandra tried. In her way. She bought me expensive birthday gifts, always things she would want. She hosted elaborate dinner parties and introduced me as our daughter to important people who never remembered my name. She even started a college fund for me, making sure everyone knew about her generosity. But when I got my period for the first time, it was Google that taught me what to do. When I had nightmares about mom dying, it was the family dog who comforted me. Breaking point came during sophomore year. I was cast as the lead in the school play, the first thing I'd felt passionate about since mom died. Opening night fell on the same evening as Cassandra's charity gala. Obviously, you'll need to skip the performance, she said, not looking up from her phone. The Richardson's are bringing their son. He's at Princeton. Connections. Emily. Dad started to object, then stopped when Cassandra placed her hand on his arm. It's just a high school play, he finally said. There will be others. I went to my room and pulled out the antique jewelry box mom had left me. Inside was her wedding ring, a lock of my baby hair, and a journal I'd never opened. Too afraid of confronting her final thoughts. That night, through tears, I read it, covered a cover most Of it was what you'd expect. Her hopes for my future memories she cherished. Advice she wouldn't be able to give in person. But the last entry, dated two weeks before she died, was different. If you're reading this, Emily, I need you to know about the safe deposit box. The key is taped inside this cover. What you find there will change everything. I'm so sorry. The key was small and silver, with the bank's name etched into it. The next day, I skipped school and went to First National. The manager recognized me. Mom's family had banked there for generations. Your mother said you'd come eventually, he said, leading me to the vault. Inside the box was a USB drive, several folders of documents, and a letter addressed to me in Mom's handwriting. My dearest Emily. It began. By now, Cassandra has probably worked her way into your lives completely. I've known about her for years. I couldn't fit what happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

Just think about that. Babe, I know you're attached to the beard, but I really, really think it's going to look good. I wouldn't tell you that if I didn't honestly think so. I'm not just trying to do it for myself. I know, but you just, you don't understand. You don't need to be so self conscious about it. Just give it a try. And I, I, I already know that you're gonna look good with it. Okay? Just trust me. Babe, I just can't do it. Can I just see it just once? Just one time. See, without the beard, baby, people respect me. I have good relationships. I have a professional life. And you think that's because of your beard? I don't think so. I think people respect you despite your beard. Look, there's something else that I haven't told you, and I don't know how to say it, but listen. You know I love you. You know I respect you. I would do anything to make you happy. And you know this. Oh my god, babe, why are you making this into such a big deal? It's not even that serious. No, I'm telling you that I can't cause there's something underneath it. Something underneath?

I wanna know who she is. Wow. Okay. Alright, so now, what is your husband's name? Tony. Okay. And how long have you guys been married? We've been married four years. I will be married five in September. Okay, and so some woman named Holly has been calling him? Like, calling him a lot? Yeah, like a lot. Like, the other day I saw that he had three missed calls from her. Her phone actually said three missed calls from Holly. you should have grabbed his phone and said, uh, you have three missed calls from Holly. You know, wanna explain who she is? Well, I actually did do that. Okay, and what did he say? He says that she's a marketing person for an account that they're trying to get at work. Okay, and do you believe him? Of course I did. But then I started thinking about, like, she calls at really weird times. So, for example, she'll call on the weekend or at night and. Yeah, what marketing person does that? Yeah. You know, here's another thing. I was gonna see if. If she represents a client that your husband is trying to get, I would feel like he would be the one doing all the calling, not the other way around. Have you seen any text conversations between the two of them? No, but he locked his phone. Yeah, but I Mean you're married? You don't have your husband's password? No, actually, I don't. Alright, does he have any Facebook friends named Holly? Like maybe a new Facebook friend just recently? Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't check. Okay, so what you want us to do is find out if he's telling the truth and find out who this Holly girl is. Is she really a potential client, or is there something else going on? Yeah, that's what I want to know. Okay. Now, I don't suppose you have her number? No, um, but when it calls, it doesn't, like, show her number or anything. It just says, you know, Holly's calling or missed call. Right. Okay, so we can't call her. We can definitely call him, though, right? Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's devise a quick plan here during the commercial break, and then when we come back, let's see what we can find out about this, okay? Okay, so we're gonna call Tony. Call Tony and. And Ashley, tell him that you are this Holly girl's sister. Oh, no, not sister. It's like, say cousin. Say I'm Holly's cousin. And we're throwing her a birthday party. So we stole her phone and we called all of her contacts. Okay? So we can invite people, but we don't want her to know about it. Oh, like a surprise? Like a surprise. But yeah, we saw that you were in her phone. Okay, and then when he says, yeah, I'm in Her phone say, like, well, we just assumed you were her new man because of all the times she's calling you. Yeah, okay, stinky. And then? Yeah, and then.

oprea care 1 să fie imediat alături de noi este alături de noi domnul octavian oprea a cerut interpretarea și a venit răspunsul de la ministerul muncii vedeți aici documentul și ne spune așa că în toate județele sunt angajați care lucrează peste 12h la stat unii 20 de ore unii 20:04 de ore pe zi altul 49 de ore pe zi atât lucrează la stat în toate aceste contracte în București vedeți sunt peste 13.000 de angajați la stat funcționar care lucrează peste 12h pe zi ne uităm pentru că vă arătam este documentul semnat de ministrul muncii simona bucura Oprescu am blurat aici ștampila vedem aici clar cum se lucrează 49 de ore pe zi și atunci domnule oprea după ce ați cerut aceste date dumneavoastră ce le explicați românilor că unii așa înțeleg domnule uite cum se fură că nu lucrează nimeni atât de multe ore cum să aflăm cine sunt bugetarii care chiar lucrează pentru că unii dintre ei duc în spate tot sistemul acesta și cei care doar încasează bani așa prin astfel de metode bună ziua și mulțumesc mult pentru pentru invitație la emisiunea dumneavoastră acest aspect se petrece din cauza faptului că în codul muncii nu e nu există 1 prevedere clară care să sancționeze angajații care depășesc Norma de 12h pe zi din cauza acestui fapt au ajuns acești 81.000 de angajați în sistemul public care după cum vedeți nu sunt doar în instituțiile publice sunt și companii de stat regii autonome și cumulează norme de lucru peste 12h pe zi sincer nu cred că cineva poate fi performant dacă lucrează inclusiv 12h a la long da putem lucra într-o zi 8h în altă zi 10h 11h Dar niciun caz nu putem lucra tot timpul 12h sau așa cum este cazul menționat în documentul pe care dumneavoastră îl aveți 49 de ore acest ă cumul de ore de pe 1 simplu calcul ă la 1 salariu minim pe economie ă creează 1 prejudiciu 1 1 presiune pe bugetul de stat undeva între 400 și 600.000.000 de euro doar ă partea netă a salariului fără a adăuga și contribuțiile la stat care cumva să spunem că acelea intră totuși în bugetul de stat e nevoie de 1 reformă a modului în care funcționează inspecția muncii pentru că inspecția muncii nu AR trebui să permită 1 astfel de aspect totodată angajatorul în momentul de față se află în imposibilitatea de a afla dacă angajatul tău lucrează exact la mai mulți angajatori în același timp pentru că revizalul îți permite să vezi doar Norma pe care 1 angajatul 1 are la tine CA și instituție companie și așa mai departe avem nevoie de 1 proiect de lege care în acest moment se află în lucru ă în partidul național liberal pentru a pune 1 sancțiune asupra celor care încalcă cu bună voie cu bună știre această prevedere a codului muncii și această limitare de 12h pe zi care în momentul de față nu este sancționată în niciun fel aici este problema pentru că sfidarea aceasta continuă de prea mulți ani și acum ajungem să mărim taxe și impozite sfidarea aceasta domnule Negrescu că în timp ce pe noi strângem cureaua și facem simulări și calcule șefii aeroporturi București și-au majorat de peste 5 Ori îndemnizațiile sărăcuții aveau 70.000 de lei brută pe lună și au trecut cu 70.000 de lei brună pe lună de la 13.000 la 20.000 de lei singuri așa pix pentru că pot domnu grindanu zice că n-o să-i lase deja și-au majorat salariile cei de la aeroporturi București am mai văzut cum laro Silva și-au dat primă de pensionare de 100.000 de euro s-au reangajat și sfidarea și nesimțirea aceasta 1 vedem în companiile de stat și alea pe pierde 1 să vă rog să-mi dați voie să prezint și EU 1 exemplu aici dacă se poate domnule oprea ă în acest moment se află 1 proiect de lege pe cursul de avizare în parlament și e trecut pe ordinea de zi a camerei deputațiilor de săptămâna viitoare în care 1 grup de senator psd au introdus 1 amendament prin care autoritatea pentru digitalizarea româniei poate plăti salarii de până la 6 Ori media salarii lui ă mediu pe de până la 6 Ori salariu mediu pe economie asta AR însemna că economiile pe care domnul bolojan le-a făcut la senat AR fi anipilate dacă acest proiect de lege VA trece săptămâna viitoare la camera deputaților deci spuneți că și mai gândiți-vă la 1 lucru important avem foarte mulți șefi din companiile de stat ale căror salarii sunt secretizate vorbind de asf vorbind de transgas vorbind de tot fel de companii unde nu știm cât plătim din bani publici acești oameni care conduc aceste companii păi n-ar trebui normal să știm acest lucru apropo de cât plătim pentru bugetarii din România gândiți-vă că salariile bugetarilor cât plătim noi pentru salarii n-a scăzut această sumă dimpotrivă după primele 4 luni crește cu doișpe virgulă 4% la 56 de miliarde 3% din pip noi dăm pe salariile bugetarilor după primele 4 luni ale anului adică nu putem avem oameni care-s plătiți cu exact 50.000 de euro la stat adică să nu se înțeleagă greșit Statele Unite nicăieri în lumea asta civilizată nu există astfel de salarii exact să nu se înțeleagă greșit performanța trebuie premiată și munca trebuie plătită onest da nu zice nimeni Dar când AI astfel de sfidări și de nesimțiri și de sinecuri și de oameni care nu fac nimic atunci trebuie făcut ceva pe ne spunea domnu oprea de aceste proiecte care sunt în parlament

All of my bags are packed. I'm ready. Do you wanna come over to my house or meet at the airport? Um, babe? Yeah? Don't tell me you forgot. Um, not really, but I thought Ava already told you. Told me what? Are you okay? Is anyone hurt? Um, this is kind of awkward, but since the house can have six people in, Ava and I thought maybe this trip should be, you know, just for us. Me and all our friends. Huh. And since it's my birthday, I think I should have fun. What are you even saying? I'm at the airport right now. Where are both of you at? Well, we're already on the airplane with all our friends. We're going to the cabin beach house. What? How many of you are there? And who are your friends? It's just me and Ava, then four of her friends. Eric, Jamal, Tyrone, Leslie. What? Well, Ava was supposed to tell you. She's literally such a silly girl. Babe, she definitely just forgot to tell you. Forgot to tell me what? That you won't go with us? And you're telling me this after I took a week Off work, told my friends I'm going to a trip with my girl, then prepared for a surprise. I won't tell you on a trip that I fully paid for. Look, I'm so sorry, babe. All of my friends really appreciate you. We will love you. And they all said you're a great guy for this. They wanna hang out with you after this trip. I organized everything for both of us. Me and you. I paid for everything. I only accepted Ava because you wanted her. Tell me you're joking, please. And that is so, so generous of you. I didn't think it would bother you that much, to be honest, because I know you're not an insecure boyfriend. This has nothing to do with insecure. I wanted to spend time with you. I was going to propose on your birthday. Mia, how can you do this? I'm really sorry, babe, but you're always so serious. This was my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink, and we will just go to fun places, eat and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you. Right, but sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood for Me, only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry babe. But I will make it up for you. When I come back. You can propose to me. We should go to another trip. Just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places. Eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam? Hello? Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey babe, we're at the receptionist. They can't seem to find your name though. What name did you use? Hello? Baby, please respond. Hey. Yes. Alright, she's checking her system again. She can't find it. Try using your name. Still nothing. Oh yeah, I forgot. I cancelled the reservation. What? Why did you do that? I wanted to tell you but I'm so silly I forgot. No, no, no. Please don't do this babe. We are all exhausted from the flight. You said you wanted to make stupid decisions. Yeah, sleep on the floor. You're only 22 years old once, right? Please don't do this Adam. All my friends are so hungry and tired. Go home. Stupid decisions, eh? And by the way, on your way back home, Swift the Atlantic. Cause I canceled your flight ticket too. What? I'm stuck here. Adam, please. This is so messed up. How could you? It was easy. I just called them and asked to cancel everything. I'm sorry babe. Please. Please just help me. Come back home and I'll fix it. I'll do anything, babe. Anything. Adam. Hello? Please respond. Don't leave me here. Hello?

Is there a problem with that? Yes, obviously. You made it sound like you needed me. I do need you to make me supper. Duh. Stop yapping and get to work. I can't believe this. I just walked across the city on a school night to make you supper. I have homework to do. Oh, you're so annoying. Stop complaining and get in here. I hate you, but fine.

That's like an hour long walk up with all of my school books. And get this. It was just so that I could make my mom Dinner? Seriously? Okay, you're off the hook. Good luck with that. It sounds like a headache. Thanks. I'll need it. Where is my craft dinner? It's coming, mom. Don't worry. Make sure you put ketchup in it. I hate you so much. I hope you know that.

Yeah, I was doing some repairs. Well, actually, that's perfect timing. I've been meaning to talk to you. Okay. Some of us are forming an HOA, and we noticed your vehicle situation. My vehicle situation? Commercial vehicles will need to be garage under the new rules. Can't have the neighborhood looking like a parking lot. It's my personal truck that I sometimes use for work. Still counts as commercial if it has your business logo. Hold up. What HOA? We're getting everything set up next month. Already have three streets on board. Nobody asked me about this. Well, I'm asking now. The majority rules. You know how democracy works. That's not how this works. Actually, it is. Once we get 51% approval, everyone has to comply. Or what? Or face daily fines until compliance is achieved. You're really enjoying this power trip, aren't you? It's not about power. It's about property values. You wouldn't understand since you run a business from home. I'm a contractor, Karen. I fix people's houses. Exactly my point. This neighborhood isn't zoned for that. I've lived here for 15 years. Well, times change. The vote is next Tuesday. Good luck with that. Just remember, find start at $100 per day. Remind me, how's your roof looking after that storm? What does that have to do with anything? Oh, nothing. Just wondering who you'll call when it starts leaking. Since, you know, commercial vehicles won't be allowed in the Neighborhood anymore. Are you threatening to not help me? Not at all. Just explaining how your new rules might work against you. This isn't over. You're right about that. The neighbors would love to hear about your plans for their vehicles, too. Might make Tuesday's vote pretty interesting. Follow for part two.

He came in for a job interview. Okay. Did you go out for drinks with him later on? Absolutely not. No, I. I was interviewing him for a position at our company. Wait, you were the one doing the interview? Yes. I'm so confused. He said that he just met you at that office and struck up a conversation. You guys went to drinks, had fun, even kissed at the end of the night, and now you're not calling him back? He said we kissed? Yeah. Yeah, he said that you guys kissed and everything seemed to be going great, he was surprised that you didn't want to go on another date with him. Oh, my god. He even went into, like, graphic detail about the kiss. About how it was wet and you licked your lips. Jesus Christ, I. Okay, look, so wait, you didn't kiss him? No, there is no way. No, absolutely not. Let me just tell you what actually happened, cause this is. This is bizarre, okay? I'm. I'm tired of hearing all this stuff. Okay, look, this young man, Luke, came in for a job interview. Brought him into my office, sat down, interviewed. We went over his resume. He was kind of fidgety, he was kind of acting a little strange, and I sent Him on his way. And in the last couple days, I've been getting flooded with emails, phone calls, messages asking about the job. Oh, my god. So. So you didn't even hire him? No, he has not been hired. He told us differently. What was he like in the job interview? He was just kind of all over the place. You know, he. He just wasn't an ideal candidate. I don't know. He was acting strange. Maybe he was stoned. I don't know. Stoned? Come on. What is happening? That is Luke. He was actually on the other night listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you.

Um, I went home to Tennessee for Thanksgiving. Spent the weekend with my family. I was supposed to come back Sunday night, but I rebooked at the last minute and got a flight Sunday morning instead. So I get back into town and I wanna surprise my girlfriend, so drove to her apartment. And when I get there, I noticed that there was this Jeep parked in her spot right in front of her door. That's kind of weird. So I go up, knock on the door, she doesn't answer. And then I think, well, maybe she's at church or something. Then I noticed her car is in the parking lot too. So I call her. No answer. Text her. No answer. So I basically just went home. And then about an hour later, she calls me and it's like, hey, I'm sorry, I just saw your text. I was in the shower and I'm like, yeah. I was like, yeah, I was gonna surprise you. And she goes, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't have my phone on me. Okay, let me stop you right there. First of all, I couldn't understand. Like 20 minutes at later, she calls like she's in the shower. But you said an hour. Yeah, actually, it might have been a little longer than that. Okay, alright, so she. Okay, so she was in the shower, I guess. I don't know. Anyway, I. You know, so I was Saying like, I was like, yeah, I was gonna surprise you. And she goes, oh, well, come over and surprise me now, so I'll go over there. The Jeep is gone. And so I asked her, I was like, well, you know, why aren't you parked in your, in your normal spot? I saw some guy in a Jeep, stole it earlier, you know. And she's like, oh yeah, that was my cousin Michelle. Remember I told you she was coming to stay with me for the weekend? And I was like, oh yeah, that's right. So at that point, I sort of just let it go, cause she did tell me her cousin was coming over. But then, like, the more I kept thinking about it, the more I felt like it just didn't. It didn't look like something a girl would drive. And I'm not, I'm, I'm not trying to stereotype or anything, it's just. It just didn't seem like something a girl would drive. Yeah, well, I mean, I used to drive a pickup truck. In fact, I've owned multiple pickup trucks. But, yeah, lift kits and. Yeah. And Ashley is a woman, sort of. And then she, she drives big ass trucks. I, I know, I know. And it's not just because it was a Jeep. It was just, I don't know, like the whole thing with it being a Jeep and a lift kit, and then her being home but not answering the door, I Don't know. So you just wanna make sure that the vehicle was really her cousin's vehicle like she said it was? Yeah. Okay, so you said she lives in an apartment complex? Yeah. What's the name of the apartment complex? Apartments over by First Colonial. Okay. And you said, um, she also has her own parking spot, correct? Yeah, everybody gets one spot, and most like visitor spots. But when I went through, the Jeep was in her spot and she parked in visitors parking. Okay, so she could have extended that courtesy to her cousin then, so. let's call her up here real quick. I have an idea that is definitely gonna get you your answer. Okay. Okay, cool. Thanks. Uh, what is her name? You never told us your girlfriend's name. Oh, yeah, it's Heather. Heather. Okay, hang on a second. We're gonna get her number from you. Okay. Okay, so we are going to call, uh, the girlfriend. That would be Heather. And you wanna do this one, right? Yeah. This is gonna sound better if you do it. Okay, then if I. Then if a guy does it. Oh, let's be honest. So we're gonna go. So we're gonna go with the. We're gonna go with the fake car accident? Not accident, like I. You. You nicked the car. The Jeep. You nicked the Jeep. That's what we decided. What we are gonna go with. We're gonna try that. I nicked it? Yes. Yes. Yes. You nicked this? Exactly. Um, so hopefully then. And then she'll say, oh, it's my cousin's Jeep. And then you'll be like, oh, okay, great. Then we know.

Lol. Why are you meeting me there? Who are you talking to downstairs? My boyfriend is here. You have a boyfriend? He's supposed to be in Paris. His flight was canceled. Why are you on Bumble? I'm sorry. Just stay hidden. He'll you if he finds you. Obviously. I just hooked up in his bed. Holy crap! Is he yelling? Did he see my clothes? What clothes? The ones all over your room. You're naked? Yes. Why? It happened so fast. You didn't think to grab them? Sorry, I didn't finish my reading for today. Steps to consider if your date's boyfriend returns home. Okay, this is bad. He found another flight. That means he's leaving. Sort of. It departs at 6:00am. What? I am butt naked. You expect me to stay hidden in the bathtub for the next 14 hours? Are you absolutely out of your mind? No. I'll see you before that. I'm just going to tell him. No way! I can't fight a man in the nude. I'm so sorry. He's headed for the bedroom. I'm saying something! Scream! Scream as loud as you can! Three, two, one. Good work. It didn't stop him. Wait, where did you go? Your clothes are gone! I needed a loud distraction. I grabbed all my clothes. Now I'm hiding under the bed. OMG, did Mandy swipe right on a ninja? Are you still flirting? Are you still naked? Jesus! Send me your boyfriend's number. What are You telling him over text? It's cramped here. Just give it to me. Hello passenger. We apologize for today's cancellation. As a courtesy, we have rebooked you on flight LX40 departing at six forty PM this evening from Terminal B. Please make your way to the ticket counter for check in. This is in two hours. Flight LX40 departs in 1 hour and 42 minutes. The airline will move to the standby list 30 minutes before departure. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I'm coming now. The airline changed his flight. He's grabbing all his things and leaving ASAP. He should. His flight departs in 2 hours. OMG, did my ninja strike again? How far is the airport? Seventeen minutes away. So there and back. We have roughly 34 minutes. That's a lot of time. I wonder what we could do. Maybe even twice. If only he would leave already. Wait, Mandy, 1 sec. He's looking for something. Is your boyfriend French? Yes. Is he a little older than you? Six years. Is his name Bastion Arno? Yeah. Do you know him? I will in a second. Uh oh, he's headed back for the bedroom.

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favourite astrology app, Astro App, for advice, and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She. And was born on Valentine's Day, too. Ha ha ha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's Pregnant. Can you believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name's going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realise we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Ellio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four. Today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow. Ello. Oh. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already Planning my funeral. Chill.

Why are you texting me, bro? Really unblocked me. Ha, ha. Are you happy with him? With Antonio? Yeah, he makes me happy. Why are you asking me? Does he treat you right? Uh, yeah. Why are you texting me asking these questions? Lol. Does he know your McDonald's order or your mom's name, bro? What? Lol, no. I haven't even told him about my mom. Wait, why are you being weird? You literally haven't texted me in two years. Why are you now? Because I love you, Val. I never did not. That's beautiful, bro. You can't call me bro. You broke up with me a whole year ago. I know, and I'm sorry. But please give me a chance to explain. Now you wanna text back? What is there to explain? How you treated me like I wasn't even a thought in your head after our five years together. And now you wanna come back because I'm with someone new? He doesn't know you like I do. What does that even matter, bro? You left me. Why do you wanna come back? I don't wanna come back. I just need to know if he's good for you. He's good to me. He doesn't know you the way I do. You like good morning texts, so I made sure to call you beautiful every morning. You claim you don't like romance movies, but once you watch one, you always tear up at the sad parts. And then End up smiling at the cute ones. You claim you love horror movies and act tough, but you just doesn't want anyone to know how scared you are. So I made sure to hug on to you tightly. You hate eggs but love the ones from IHOP for some reason. You say you hate the winter because of the icy roads and how cold it is, but won't hesitate to play outside in the snow. You have a total of 13 freckles on your face, but hate the ones on your nose so it made you feel better when someone compliments them. On January 21st, 2020, on my birthday, we went to a cute coffee shop. You bought me a drink, and I bought our breakfast. I got a breakfast sandwich, and you got bacon and jelly toast. While we were eating, your toast slid from out your head and onto your lap. We thought it was so funny because it fell in slow motion, which it didn't, but it made it funnier. And from then on I called you jelly even though you hated it. But deep down it was an US thing, so it made you happy. And I know it did, so don't even deny it. Your Starbucks order is always the same a pink drink with a scoop of matcha and vanilla cold foam on top. During fall season, you always switch it to pumpkin spice latte, which you hate, but drink to fill in season. You collect Trinkets. But only shiny ones because it's what interests you. Your favourite day is Thursday, but only because it's the day before Friday, which means that the weekend comes sooner. On August 15th, 2021. You gave me a matching glass butterfly bracelet you wore everyday. But I never had mine on my wrist. That made you sad because I wasn't wearing it. But a few weeks later, when you asked me to buy a movie tickets online to see a film, I asked you to grab my wallet. And when you opened it, the bracelet fell out and snapped, and the glass shattered. Made you sad. Even though I didn't care for it, you brought it to me and apologized for breaking it. I was a little upset, but I couldn't stay mad at you. We made up, watched our movie in the cinema. We both went to our homes. I spent weeks putting together the last beads. But instead of making it into a bracelet again, I used it for our anniversary gift to make you that necklace. And then we switched jewelry. You gave me your bracelet, and I gave you the necklace, remember? You never took it off. And that's something I love about you. You never get tired of the same thing. That's why I knew you'd never get tired of me. Your loyalty is truly beautiful, jelly. So if he can recognize all of that, then he's the one for you. I don't even know what to Say, if you still love me, why don't you wanna come back? Because we never seem to stay together. Do you think we could ever retry? Make it work this time? She's busy, little bro.

Do what you want. Do not stress. It is a group hang. Think I will go. It is chill. Tom is just a friend, nothing more. Whatever. Just rolled up to this awesome rooftop bar. Like four or five of us here. Some other people too. Why are you not replying? Where are you, babe? Where is this work trip at? You used to always keep me in the loop. What happened to all the updates at the office? Working hard. I am good. You have fun. Oh, cool. Back to the party then. Babe, I am super drunk. I feel terrible. Everyone left. I am alone. Can you come get me? Still working. Just Uber home. My head is killing me. Take some pills when you get in. Ugh, fine. Took some meds, but threw them up. Feel awful.

Where are you even going? I'm sorry. I didn't even think I would be accepted into the program. I'm going to England. That's like an eight hour time gap. I know. I promise you, my love.

Let me tell my mom I'm coming over. I had so much fun With you, my love. I was sobbing when you left. Don't think I'll be able to walk tomorrow. Ha ha. I had fun, too, baby. I'm about to board my flight. I'll text you when I get seated. Okay. Have a safe flight. I'm seated. We're about to take off. Are you sitting with anyone? Yes. This girl. She seems stressed.

Text me when you're done, then. Of course, my love. Just finished. I'm about to head to bed now. What about dinner? Me and Millie got pizza. Pepperoni pizza? Yeah. Why? I thought that was our thing. Don't overreact, Jane. It's fine. Okay. Whatever you say, my love. I believe you. I'm gonna head to sleep. Good night, baby. Sleep well. I love you. Good night, my love. I hope you sleep good.

That means we're on a moon date. That's cute. What's it like on the other side? Loud. Seattle is always busy. Traffic is so noisy. Can barely sleep. Oh, I hope you get sleep soon. It's so quiet in London. It's snowing. You're so lucky. I wish I came with you. Having a gap year isn't fun. Weren't you planning on going to Hawaii? Yeah, but I still don't have enough money. But I want to save enough so that we can both go together. Yes, that would be fun. The moon and the stars are really beautiful there. Can watch the sky together. I would love that. I really need to go sleep. Good night, my love. Okay, baby. Good night. Morning, my love. Me and Millie gonna go get coffee on the way to school. Oh, okay. I'm going shopping with my mom, so I'll be busy. Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Bye. I'm done. It was so fun. Apparently there's a blood moon tonight. Oh, yeah. Millie told me she loves the moon too. Oh. Me and her are going to watch it at the park. So I'll talk to you later. Bye. Okay, bye. Hello? It's been hours. Where are you? Hi, this is Millie. We stayed up so late, he let me sleep over. Can I talk to my boyfriend? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Why are you so rude to Millie? Why does she have your phone? Bro, can you not be so dramatic? It's fine. No, I will. It's always Millie. Are you in love with her or something? You know what? I'm tired of this. Maybe I am. So what? Let's break up. You don't mean that, right? I mean it. Millie is always so much more supportive and less controlling than you are. What the hell? Can you not text me anymore? I want you out of my life now. I can't believe you right now. What happened to you? You've changed. Whatever. If that's what you want, then fine.

What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how We were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while. What is it? Let's get a divorce. I'm exhausted. I can't work on this relationship anymore. Lost that spark. Better to split up now. It's best for both of us. Babe, I don't agree. Please don't leave me. I won't go out anymore. Won't stay out all night. Babe, give me one more chance. I know I messed up. That's it. I gotta go. I've already contacted a lawyer.

What criminal actually impressed you with their criminal skills? This kid Marcus at my old high school was the ghost dealer. Everyone knew he sold weed, but nobody could prove it. Not the cops, not the principal, nobody. They searched his car weekly, tore apart his locker, even brought drug dogs to school three different times. Nothing. Marcus would just smile and wave like he was running for student council. Kids would get caught with weed and straight up say, I bought it from Marcus. He'd actually encourage them to tell the truth. Yeah, tell them I sold it to you. See what happens. Still couldn't catch him. The administration went nuclear. They installed motion sensors in his locker, had tea just follow him between classes. Principal Johnson even called Marcus's mom, thinking maybe she'd cooperate. She laughed and said, good luck catching him. Kids smarter than all of us. Marcus was this weird combination of obvious and invisible. He'd wear tie dye shirts and listen to reggae music in the hallways. Everyone knew what he was about. But he was also in honors classes, tutored kids after school, and helped organize charity drives. Security caught Marcus talking to Tommy Rodriguez in the bathroom. Tommy walks out with weed five minutes later. They search Marcus immediately. Nothing. Marcus explains he was just borrowing a pencil, shows them the pencil in his pocket. Tommy backs up his story perfectly. They saw Marcus hand something to Sarah Chen by the Vending machines looked exactly like a drug deal. They searched both kids, found nothing on Marcus. Sarah had a granola bar. The principal was convinced the granola bar was somehow involved and had it tested at the police lab. Cost the school $800. It was just a regular granola bar. Marcus started leaving notes in his locker for investigators. Thanks for keeping my stuff organized. And did you find my secret yet? Keep looking. The janitor found them hilarious. Principal Johnson did not. They brought in a police dog named Rex. This dog had found drugs in cars, houses, everywhere. Rex sniffed Marcus's backpack, locker, car, even his shoes. Rex found nothing. The dog handler was embarrassed. Marcus threw a party when Rex visited. Made a sign that said, Welcome Rex and brought dog treats. Rex loved Marcus and wouldn't even search properly because he wanted to play fetch. The school tried everything. They made Marcus empty his pockets before entering. Searched his car in the parking lot during class. Even had a teacher accidentally bump into him to see if anything fell out. Marcus would cooperate with everything.

I thought he was joking until I saw him practice smiling in the mirror before parties. What's weird is that he remembers everything I've ever told him. When my mom got sick, he showed up with groceries and said, you won't remember to eat properly. I've researched nutritious meals that are easy to make. Not a hint of emotion, just logic. He once asked why people cry at funerals if the person is already dead, but then he drove six hours to attend my grandpa's funeral because social support improves grief outcomes. His girlfriend dumped him because he forgot Valentine's Day. He genuinely didn't understand why one random day matters more than others. The next day he made a spreadsheet of all holidays with reminders set weeks ahead. Last week he called me at 3:00am asking is it normal to feel something warm in your chest when your son smiles at you? His wife just had a baby and I think he might actually be experiencing love for the first time. He's reading parenting books every night. People think sociopaths are all dangerous, but my friend just sees the world differently. He Chooses to be good because it's logical. And sometimes that's more reliable than emotional goodness that comes and goes.

He started hanging out with the wrong crowd after dropping out of school. Mom was worried sick because he'd come home at 3 a m. Carrying expensive stuff he couldn't afford on his part time job. Designer clothes, new phones, gold chains. We knew something wasn't right, but he'd get angry whenever we asked. One night while he was out, I found a huge duffel bag hidden under his bed. Inside were dozens of phones still in their boxes with price tags from different stores. I knew right away they were stolen. My hands were shaking as I loaded them into my car and drove to the police. When my brother found out, he completely lost it. His face turned ghostly white. He screamed that those weren't his. He was just holding them for someone. He had to pay $25,000 to replace them. Or else. You don't understand what you've done, he kept saying, pacing like a caged animal. Three days later, mom called me, crying so hard I could barely understand her. My brother was in the hospital. They found him beaten half to death behind an abandoned warehouse, zip tied to a chair. His left leg was shattered in three places. Through tears, he told me the guys he was working for did this as a warning. They said next time would be worse. They wanted me to know exactly what would happen if I ever Lost their stuff again, he whispered. That night changed everything. My brother moved across the country to start fresh. Now he works as a youth counselor, helping kids avoid the same mistakes that almost cost him his life. He says turning in those phones saved him from an even darker path.

This happened a couple years ago when ChatGPT wasn't a thing yet. So my students were taking a test when I noticed one kid staring at his lap. Now, maybe he was deep in thought. Maybe he was contemplating life choices. Or maybe, and this was the more likely option, he was pulling off the world's worst cheating attempt. I slowly walked over and stood right next to him. He had no idea I was there. I watched as his thumbs moved at record speed, typing something into his phone like he was disarming a bomb. Then I tapped him on the shoulder. He flinched so hard he almost launched his phone across the room. I looked down. Google was wide open. He just stared at me frozen, like I had just caught him plotting a heist. Then the excuses started. I needed my phone to talk to my dad about a family emergency. Oh for sure dude. That's why I literally just watched you type answers to chapter 5 test. Took his test, and started walking to my desk. This should have been the end of it, but no. He decided to turn this into his Oscar moment. He followed me to the front of the room, pleading forgiveness like he was on trial. Please. Please, I need this grade. This test is my entire future. I ignored him. That's when the villain arc start. You're a Terrible teacher. Alright, now we're getting dramatic. You're ruining my high school experience. Okay, dude, it's a math test. You're not the star of a movie. And then he pulled out an insane threat. My dad works at the school board. You're going to get fired! Oh no, not the imaginary school board dad! I stared at him, I laughed, I handed him a detention slip, and he snatched it out of my hand like I had just destroyed his entire life. And guess what? I never got fired.

I am a 37 year old woman and I know what you're thinking when you hear that my 14 year old son showers with me. Right. Well, I have a good reason for it. We both share the same bathroom and bedroom. First, I hesitated to admit this online because of the looks and judgmental comments I would receive from strangers. But here it goes. It all started three years ago when my husband suddenly left us without any explanation. It was a complete shock. We had been married for over 15 years and he seemed happy. Until one day he packed his bags and disappeared. All he said to us was, I'm going to buy milk at the gas station. Be right back. He never came back. The kids were devastated, especially my youngest, Max. He clung to me more than ever, seeking comfort wherever he could find it. At night, Max would come into my room, shivering from the cold, begging for a warm blanket. As much as I wanted to send him back to his own room, I couldn't bear to see him so vulnerable. So gradually, Max moved closer to my side, eventually ending up sleeping beside me, sometimes even cuddled up to me. Over time, I began to notice that Max wouldn't leave my side during the day either, whether it was taking a shower or brushing his teeth. Max was always there, watching closely. I tried to ignore it, hoping he would outgrow it like most teenage behaviours. However, as days turned into weeks and then into months, I realised that this wasn't going away anytime soon. One night, while I was taking a shower, Max asked if he could join me. I asked why, and he said that all the kids at school say I have a level 9 gas. I don't know what that means, but I was shocked. At first I hesitated, unsure if it was appropriate or healthy. But looking at him, so small and fragile, I knew deep down that I couldn't say no. And so began our new ritual. Everything was going fine, just normal showers with mother and son. Until I dropped my soap and it fell. You can now check if there's a part two by pressing share and more!

When my dad married Cassandra, I was 11. Mom had been gone for 13 months. Melanoma that spread faster than anyone expected. One day, she was complaining about a headache, and 82 days later, I was standing at her grave in a black dress that still had the tags on. Dad waited exactly one year before bringing Cassandra home. She worked at his investment firm, client relations. Perfect teeth, blonde hair that never move. The kind of woman who wore heels to other people's barbecues. She makes me happy again, dad explained, his voice gentle but firm. I need you to try, Emily. So I tried. I helped Cassandra move in, carrying boxes of designer shoes to the closet where Mom's gardening clothes used to hang. I nodded politely when she rearranged our furniture, replacing family photos with abstract art that opened up the space. I even smiled when she transformed Mom's vegetable garden into a meditation patio, because growing our own food is so provincial. For three years, I performed the role of grateful stepdaughter. I attended her corporate events wearing the dresses she bought me. I tolerated her friends who cooed about how mature I was. For 14, I kept my grief hidden behind perfect grades and false smiles. Dad didn't notice when I stopped laughing, too busy with Cassandra's social calendar and the new clients she brought in. Too distracted by their couples retreats and wine club memberships. Meanwhile, I slept with Mom's sweater under my pillow until it stopped smelling like her. Cassandra tried. In her way. She bought me expensive birthday gifts, always things she would want. She hosted elaborate dinner parties and introduced me as our daughter to important people who never remembered my name. She even started a college fund for me, making sure everyone knew about her generosity. But when I got my period for the first time, it was Google that taught me what to do. When I had nightmares about mom dying, it was the family dog who comforted me. Breaking point came during sophomore year. I was cast as the lead in the school play, the first thing I'd felt passionate about since mom died. Opening night fell on the same evening as Cassandra's charity gala. Obviously, you'll need to skip the performance, she said, not looking up from her phone. The Richardson's are bringing their son. He's at Princeton. Connections. Emily. Dad started to object, then stopped when Cassandra placed her hand on his arm. It's just a high school play, he finally said. There will be others. I went to my room and pulled out the antique jewelry box mom had left me. Inside was her wedding ring, a lock of my baby hair, and a journal I'd never opened. Too afraid of confronting her final thoughts. That night, through tears, I read it, covered a cover most Of it was what you'd expect. Her hopes for my future memories she cherished. Advice she wouldn't be able to give in person. But the last entry, dated two weeks before she died, was different. If you're reading this, Emily, I need you to know about the safe deposit box. The key is taped inside this cover. What you find there will change everything. I'm so sorry. Key was small and silver, with the bank's name etched into it. The next day, I skipped school and went to First National. The manager recognized me. Mom's family had banked there for generations. Your mother said you'd come eventually, he said, leading me to the vault. Inside the box was a USB drive, several folders of documents, and a letter addressed to me in Mom's handwriting. My dearest Emily. It began. By now, Cassandra has probably worked her way into your lives completely. I've known about her for years. I couldn't fit what happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

Or tried to get married seven months ago to the man that I thought was the love of my life. Wait, hold up. You said tried to get married to a guy. I tried to get married. So got engaged, plan this amazing wedding. I mean, like, we invited all of our friends and family, had the most beautiful weather the morning of our. Our wedding. We finally got together. We did. First look was very emotional. So you tried to get married, took pictures and everything, but you didn't get married? Well, the wedding sounds like it was happening. Like you were in the middle of the wedding. Correct. So, before the ceremony, I'm in the room with the bridesmaids, and, um. Oh, sorry. My wedding coordinator comes in the room, and she's like, I can't find Justin. What, like, you're. You're soon to be husband, you're moments away from being husband? Disappeared. Correct. So I. I said to her, just like, you're kidding me. I know. Justin loves to, like, mess around with me. He's a jokester. Seriously, where is he? And she's like, look me in the eyes. I'm telling you the truth. I don't know where he is. Oh, no. Look, panic, right? Like, instant panic. You know what? I took a deep breath, and I just tried not to lose myself. So I thought, let me call his best man. And he's like, Claire, I don't want to freak You out. But we don't know where he is either. Oh, no. So nobody could find him? No one can find them. At the end of this point, I freaked out because now when they're kind of upset, I'm getting upset now, literally. You have to remember, 20 minutes before this, we did our first look, and everything was emotional and beautiful. Okay, so, wait, how far away from the ceremony are we at this point? We're a few minutes away. Whoa. So I went through an entire venue, every bathroom stall, like, everything. Everybody went on a search party. Could not find him. Oh, So every wedding guest at your wedding is now looking for the groom? Correct. Is that something the coordinator planned, or this wasn't, like, a fun pre wedding game? I don't, I don't think. It doesn't sound like it. No, I took over real fast. Trust me, I, I, I even sent some of the groomsmen to our place. I send people to his parents place. I mean, I called them nearby hospitals, like, I mean, I got crazy. So where. Wait, was his car there or did he leave? So the car was still there. But it's our car. It's our shared car. So finally, no one ever hears from him with, like, I gave up the search. Everybody gives up. And I finally get a text a few hours later that just says, I'm sorry, I can't do this. What? Wow. So you got ditched at the altar, basically. Sorry if that sounds insensitive, but we didn't even make it to the altar. That was the sad part. We didn't even make it to the altar. So, wait, you're just, like, sitting around a big room that was supposed to be your reception, all that's filled with flowers and, like, the foods there, and he just texted you? He didn't even tell you this in person? No. And that was. That was the text? That's it. He just said, I'm sorry. I can't do this. It was like. I was too shocked to cry. I think I just stood there and almost fainted. Oh, my god. And so, um, I have not heard from him since. Oh, my god. That's crazy. Yeah. I hate this dude. I am sorry. Yeah. Um, what did you do? So after I got the text, I responded right back, and he never wrote back to me ever again. And so I contacted family, friends, anybody I can think of that would have an answer. No one's heard from him or seen him. So he just took off. Like, on everybody? On everybody. His parents, I mean, they keep in touch with him, but he never tells them where he is or where he's living. It's weird. Oh, my gosh. Oh, Jesus. But fast forward. Today. I hired a private investigator. Really? Yeah. I just. I can't let it go. I don't Think any woman could? Well, yeah. I mean, I don't want to find the person, like if they just took off and skipped out on their family and friends. And you at the. At your wedding, I want to know what happened. I'd want to do. I don't know. I'd want to do something bad. You'd hire a hitman, bro. Oh my gosh. What did you find? So I found out that he moved out of state. Whoa. He obviously has a brand new phone number. The investigator found his new number and he gave me that number. Oh, whoa. So basically, I really need your help because I wanna confront him and I. I don't know how, and I kind of need moral support to do so because I'm. I'm scared. I'm scared of what I'll find. I'm scared of how he's gonna react, though. Jubal, you're right. This is juicy. Oh, yeah. Told you it was gonna be juicy. Oh my god! Juicier than my booty. I told you. No, not hahaha

You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time? No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay, but you aren't that. Ah, so many assumptions here. One, that she would even take your name when you got married. Like, a lot of women keep their last name. And that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry to take your last Name? Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. Hahaha. But you're Daniel Pants. And you don't think Summer Pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay, well. And that's it? That's the only reason? That is the biggest reason, yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Okay, well, yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of a silly thing and years of great jokes. Yeah, yeah, that's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge. No, I'm allowed to. Okay, you're allowed to. Well, Daniel, I do have to let you know that summer is on the phone listening right now and she wants to talk to you. What? Yeah.

I am a 37 year old woman and I know what you're thinking when you hear that my 14 year old son showers with me. Right. Well, I have a good reason for it. We both share the same bathroom and bedroom. First, I hesitated to admit this online because of the looks and judgmental comments I would receive from strangers. But here it goes. It all started three years ago when my husband suddenly left us without any explanation. It was a complete shock. We had been married for over 15 years and he seemed happy. Until one day he packed his bags and disappeared. All he said to us was, I'm going to buy milk at the gas station. Be right back. He never came back. The kids were devastated, especially my youngest, Max. He clung to me more than ever, seeking comfort wherever he could find it. At night, Max would come into my room, shivering from the cold, begging for a warm blanket. As much as I wanted to send him back to his own room, I couldn't bear to see him so vulnerable. So gradually, Max moved closer to my side, eventually ending up sleeping beside me, sometimes even cuddled up to me. Over time, I began to notice that Max wouldn't leave my side during the day either, whether it was taking a shower or brushing his teeth. Max was always there, watching closely. I tried to ignore it, hoping he would outgrow it like most teenage behaviours. However, as days turned into weeks and then into months, I realised that this wasn't going away anytime soon. One night, while I was taking a shower, Max asked if he could join me. I asked why, and he said that all the kids at school say I have a level 9 gas. I don't know what that means, but I was shocked. At first I hesitated, unsure if it was appropriate or healthy. But looking at him, so small and fragile, I knew deep down that I couldn't say no. And so began our new ritual. Everything was going fine, just normal showers with mother and son. Until I dropped my soap and it fell. You can now check if there's a part two by pressing share and more!

That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about, you know? Hello? Hi, is this Taryn? Yeah, who's this? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. How are you? I'm sorry, say that again. This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Uh, oh, okay. We have a radio show and one of our listeners actually asked us if we could call you. Really? Yeah. His name is Tim. Tim? Tim. Oh, Tim. Whoa. Why did he call you guys? Well, that really helped because he said he really liked you. And now you're kind of blowing him off. Like you're telling him you're busy all the time and you won't meet up for a second date. Oh my gosh. Are you serious? Yeah. Wait, are you laughing cause you're flattered and excited or are you laughing because Tim's lame? Umm. A little both, I guess. Okay. Of everything. Huh. So you're kind of excited, but also he's kind of lame. I wouldn't say lame. He's kind of corny. And he looks like he might be an okay guy, but I don't know really how to take it. I mean, I barely talk to him. I text him like a couple times, but I mean. Yeah, we talked to him about your date. Date? What do you mean date? How about this? The night you met, then if it wasn't a date. Really? Yeah, he told us about that. He told us how he kind of saved you from some other dudes who were trying to dance with you, and then you guys ended up hanging out for a while. No way. Save me from some other dudes? Yeah, he said guy, you know, like the guys on the club that, like, try to hump your leg for too long? He said he rescued you from them? Hahaha. If he was one of the guys that was humping my legs and he saved me from himself, but, like, I was. I was doing perfectly fine. Hahaha. Okay, so really? Oh, so. So he didn't save you necessarily, but did you enjoy hanging out with him? I mean, he was just coming off like, kind of like machismo, like he talks to a lot of women or talks to women all the time. So I was just like, that was my first time going to that place. And I mean, it seems like he was kind of popular too, cause, you know, like, all the waitresses coming all over him and, you know, they were like, high fiving him and he was like the party guy, I guess, you know. So you think he's a player and that's why you don't want to go out with him? Uh, yeah, cause I don't really date a lot of people. I'm pretty selective just because nowadays you just never can be too sure. So I just rather not spread my energy too Thin. So that is actually really smart. Yeah, he just came across almost like a little bit cheesy too. Oh. So if he would have been more sincere and kind of like, I don't know, more vulnerable about who he was, would you have given him a shot then? I don't know. I don't know who his real self is, but he came across like, you know, he has a monster truck or something. I don't know. It's weird. Okay. It's funny that you say people have ulterior motives, cause I need to let you know that he's actually on the other line listening right now and wants to talk to you. What the fuck? Are you serious? Yes, I am. Best response ever. Tim, are you there? Hey, yeah, I'm here. What's going on? Karen? How you doing? Oh, hi, Sam. It's nice to hear your voice. Uh, yeah, nice to hear yours too. Question Mark. That's convincing. That's the Taron I know and love. Oh my gosh, this is crazy. So you kind of surprised by all of this or what? Yes. Like, what is going on? Like, wait, what? I mean, I just haven't heard from you, so I. By any means necessary, I needed to hear your voice and wanted to get in contact with you again, hang out some more. And you've definitely made an imprint on my life and in my heart. So I like to talk to you some more.

Yes, yes, yes. It's a good thing, Tanya. It's all good. It's fine. Oh, my god. Yes, Tanya, I'm. I'm here. Please don't hang up. Can I talk to you for a minute? Are you kidding? Is this really happening? Yeah. Listen, I'm really sorry. It was clearly was the mistake to do this to you and put you on blast like this. I'm sorry about that. She doesn't have words. But second, I just want to say that I think it couldn't be any less of a big deal that you pass gas a little in the restaurant. Okay. All right, there he goes. Um. I just don't. I just wanna, like, erase this, you know, erase it entirely. I can't believe. I just don't think it was as bad as you think it is. Maybe, Russell, maybe talk about other things besides that moment right now. Like how much you like her. Well, I like you a lot. We had, you know, we had great conversation. And mostly it was in the store, and then. And we talked for a few minutes in the lobby before we sat down. You're so nice. You have such a lovely voice. You're so pretty. And even though people looked, I don't think anyone cared or. Oh, my god, people looked. Are you serious? Well, yeah, it was pretty loud, but. Oh, my god, everybody does it, you know, Russell, I just don't know. Like, I. I don't know. If after you've, like, seen me in. In this moment like that, you know, like that embarrassing moment where I have to run and leave a restaurant. Okay, look, it's clear that you have misgivings about it, and I respect that. And I don't want to pressure you into anything. The last thing that I would say for myself is that I believe that if you gave me a chance and just open yourself up to disappointment, I would surprise you. And I could be good to, like, just to go on a date and, like, can see from there. Oh my god! Oh, I just don't think you should feel bad. I have farted on plenty of dates before, and, you know, usually I. I find a corner or something. Sometimes I do it just to make people laugh. What? Hahaha! Really? Well, yeah, okay, but like, that would have been intentional. You haven't ever done that in front of a restaurant full of people or everybody apparently saw and heard and, like, we're laughing. Honestly, Tanya, I might have. I mean, I never tried to fart at a restaurant, but if I have accidentally, excuse me and move on. I really didn't try. I'm sure you didn't. I know it's clear that you didn't, but if you did, I'm saying I wouldn't have cared. Listen to him, Tanya. And the thing is, like, you've already gotten one big relationship hump. You've been through that already. You've had your Embarrassing moment. Like, that's a good way to start, because you know you can make it through those things. And, Tanya, if it helps, like, I will fart right now. That's actually. If you can fart on Q, Russell, that's impressive. Is that possible? You want me to? Will you with that? Will you? I will if you want me to. She's laughing. So now you're laughing? Yes. Yes, Tanya, is that a yes? You want him to do it, or is that like, I'm serious. I'll do it right now, like, on the phone, but I need consent. Consent, consent. Yes. You have everybody's consent. I think Tanya's laugh is consent for you to fart if you think you can right now, Russell. Okay, here it goes. Wish me luck. We're doing this. What the. What? Oh, my god. Was that. Did you hear that? Weird. Was that a. A farter? You got some balloons lying around your place that you just let some air out of? Oh, my god. I'm pretty sure that was stinky. No, it would. I had to push really hard, but I got it. Interesting sound to it. There you go, Tanya. Now Russell has farted for everybody who's listening to the show right now to hear. Yeah, so now we're even. It's totally cool now. I cannot believe you actually did that. Tanya, have you ever had a man fart in your honor before like that? No. See, that's pretty gentlemanly, I think. I'm gonna tell you, that's chivalry at its best. I fully agree. What do you think? Will you go on a second date with Russell? We will pay for it. Haha, yeah! Yay! Yes! Oh, my god! She can barely get the yes out, she's laughing so hard. Congratulations, Russell. You got your second date! Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Tanya, for giving me a second chance. Oh, my god. I didn't know farts could be so romantic. I'm, like, really wrapped up in this. This is, like the weirdest call I think I've ever had in my entire life. I hope so. I hope you two enjoy your next date. Thank you. I'm sure I will. Yeah, well, I'm sure you will. And, Tanya, now you have somebody to go out with you, and you can blame farts on whenever, so it's all good.

The entire story is so far from that. But I have no way of proving that she's lying. Oh, boy. Okay, um, I'm not sure if we should really touch this one here. Have you thought of, like, retaining the services of a lawyer or something? Uh, well, no, man, that might be. Well, let me. Here. Let me just tell you what happened and that you guys can do whatever you want with it. All right, so tell us what happened, um, from your perspective. I was in a wedding, actually, about three weeks ago. I was a groomsman in my buddy Rich's wedding. You know, pretty normal stuff. Church groomsmen, bridesmaids, reception, all that stuff. Okay. You know, and, you know, I'm a single guy, I was asking around to see if there's any bridesmaids who are single. You know, just kind of scout in the field, right? So rich tells me that the Hillary that's the bride has a cousin who's single, and she's crazy hot. So did this girl show up at the wedding then? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's, uh, comes up to me right before we're going to take the pictures. So I'll tell her I see you at the reception, cause we. We gotta go take the pictures. Let's like, we, like. I have to go to this park by the Time we get to the reception, this girl comes up to me, and she is obviously a few drinks ahead of me. And this is the. This is the crazy hot cousin. Yeah, the. Yeah, the crazy hot cousin, Megan. I know his name. Anyway, she comes up to me and she's like, you. You want to do some shots? And I'm like, hey, hey, you know, actually, I just got here. You know, I haven't eaten anything since, like, breakfast. And she's like, well, okay. Well, come find me when you want to dance. In the meantime, I can tell this one of the bridesmaids, you know, and we're kind of really hitting off, and she's. She's really good looking, too. Okay, so. So now you have a couple options here. Yeah, I guess so. But there's stuff that goes on, and Megan keeps trying to get my attention. And we were eating and stuff, and we go through all the first dance and probably dance stuff and all that stuff, and then just the regular dancing starts. And she comes up to me, like, immediately, and she pulls me on the dance floor with her, and we're dancing to something. I forget. I don't know. Yeah, I think it was that Bruno Mars funk you up song, whatever it is. Uh, Uptown Funk. Yeah. Well, yeah, that one, I guess. Anyway, she starts grinding up against me. I mean. I mean, you know, really grinding up against me. I'm like, I'm not ready for this, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, you're definitely in a distinct disadvantage when you're in the. In the wedding party, and then, like, when you get to the reception, everybody's, like, three drinks ahead of you when you walk in. Yeah. So anyway, I'm dancing with her, and then I tell her I need to get a drink show. So I. I get back to talking to the other bridesmaids, and I'm really. I'm really kind of digging her at this point, you know? So anyway, excuse myself to go to the bathroom. And I noticed when I'm walking out the main reception hall that Megan is kind of following me, the crazy girl. So I. I kind of. Kind of lose her. Anyway, I'm in the bathroom, I mean, all alone, you know, I'm sitting on one of the stalls because, well, I gotta poop, you know? So here's someone come in, and it's women's shoes, you know, clip, clop it on the floor. Okay. It's freaking Megan. And she just goes, Ryan, Ryan! Hey! I'm like, yeah, yeah. And she kind of kicks in the fucking door, man. While you're sitting on the toilet? Yeah. I mean, I'm taking a shit. Anyway, it gets even worse. She comes into the stall, lifts up the bottom of her skirt, she straddles me on the toilet. I'm taking a shit, and she's trying to make out with me. Oh, my god, are You serious? I'm telling. This chick is crazy. And she literally did not care that you were pooping. I guess not. Anyway, look, I'm like, I'm trying to push you off. You can't be here. It's fluffy. It's Charlie. Goes like, could really help you. Oh, whatever. Did you tell anybody? Like, when you were. When you were done, did you go out there like, hey, that crazy chick just came in the bathroom while I was dropping a deuce or anything like that? Yeah, I mean, I didn't want to get him back to the. Anyone in the family, you know, I don't want to make a scene about it. Yeah, so hold on. I got a question. You said she kicked in the door when you were on the toilet? Yeah. Why didn't you lock the door on the stall? Well, you know, I know it's one of those, like, a little magnet thing. I mean, didn't have one of those little latch. Those little latchy turn things. So she tries all this, you tell her to leave, and then what? A few days later, I hear from people that she told her cousin, the bride, and I try to get physical with her in the bathroom, and then I was a real jerk. Okay, so she changed the story, then she sees you. Or to change the narrative here, first of all, it puts me in a really weird place with my. My buddy and his wife, You know, I don't. They don't know who to believe. And that the girl, the actual girl I actually like, the other bridesmaid, she won't even text me back now. Probably cause she thinks I'm all that stuff that Megan's been spreading. And I, I, I definitely did not 100% do anything. It was, it's the way I told you. I swear to god. Okay, so. So what you need here is some vindication. You need the truth to come out. Yeah. Okay. So why don't you try texting Cuckoo McGee cousin and be like, hey, you need to stop telling lies about me. Yeah, well, I tried that already. No, she's probably sticking with that story. Normal liars will eventually drop it, but crazy liars, they have a story and they are sticking with it. Trust me, we, we've met some crazy liars that worked here that pulled stuff like that, so. Alright, so you say you texted this girl and you have her number then? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Okay, why don't we, uh, call her and then we'll, when we call her, we'll put you on there. Why don't you actually tell her that, like, you are into her like that? Tell her that you have had time to forget everything and you really wanna go out with her, feed her ego a little bit, and then tell her. But look, you gotta stop lying about the whole bathroom thing and then see what she says. Well, I know. Even if she misses, it's still her word against mine with everybody else. Well, hold on. Not really, because we're gonna do the entire thing on the air, like, for the world to hear. And here's the good news. We're gonna have the recording of it, so she. There's, like, no chance in hell she can lie about it. I'll tell you what. Hang on one second. Let's call her up when we come back. Now, let's find out who's lying here for once.

I wanna know who she is. Wow. Okay. Alright, so now, what is your husband's name? Tony. Okay. And how long have you guys been married? We've been married four years. I will be married five in September. Okay, and so some woman named Holly has been calling him? Like, calling him a lot? Yeah, like a lot. Like, the other day I saw that he had three missed calls from her. Her phone actually said three missed calls from Holly. you should have grabbed his phone and said, uh, you have three missed calls from Holly. You know, wanna explain who she is? Well, I actually did do that. Okay, and what did he say? He says that she's a marketing person for an account that they're trying to get at work. Okay, and do you believe him? Of course I did. But then I started thinking about, like, she calls at really weird times. So, for example, she'll call on the weekend or at night and. Yeah, what marketing person does that? Yeah. You know, here's another thing. I was gonna see if. If she represents a client that your husband is trying to get, I would feel like he would be the one doing all the calling, not the other way around. Have you seen any text conversations between the two of them? No, but he locked his phone. Yeah, but I Mean you're married? You don't have your husband's password? No, actually, I don't. Alright, does he have any Facebook friends named Holly? Like maybe a new Facebook friend just recently? Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't check. Okay, so what you want us to do is find out if he's telling the truth and find out who this Holly girl is. Is she really a potential client, or is there something else going on? Yeah, that's what I want to know. Okay. Now, I don't suppose you have her number? No, um, but when it calls, it doesn't, like, show her number or anything. It just says, you know, Holly's calling or missed call. Right. Okay, so we can't call her. We can definitely call him, though, right? Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's devise a quick plan here during the commercial break, and then when we come back, let's see what we can find out about this, okay? Okay, so we're gonna call Tony. Call Tony and. And Ashley, tell him that you are this Holly girl's sister. Oh, no, not sister. It's like, say cousin. Say I'm Holly's cousin. And we're throwing her a birthday party. So we stole her phone and we called all of her contacts. Okay? So we can invite people, but we don't want her to know about it. Oh, like a surprise? Like a surprise. But yeah, we saw that you were in her phone. Okay, and then when he says, yeah, I'm in Her phone say, like, well, we just assumed you were her new man because of all the times she's calling you. Yeah, okay, stinky. And then. Yeah, and then we'll see.

Um, yes, I do. You do, don't you? That's right. Well, the reason I'm calling you is we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. Johnny emailed us about you.

He called a radio station and told them about what happened? He did?

Wait, wait, wait. He told you that he Spent the night at my house. He told you that? Yeah, he did. He didn't go into any more detail than that. Everything else I've made up in my head, and it was fantastic. But he didn't tell us anything more. He just said he stayed the night over there. And when you guys woke up in the morning, he had asked if you wanted to go get brunch or something. You said no, and then you kind of asked him to leave. I cannot believe that he called a radio station and told you guys that he spent the night at my house. I mean, what an asshole. Like, I hope that my friends aren't listening to this, or they don't know. I mean, some of them do, but it's not like I want this information broadcast literally over the radio. He didn't give us any information about what happened at your place. Okay, if that's what you're worried about. But he is wondering why you won't talk to him now. I mean, is it just too weird? It is weird, but, I mean, I don't know if I. It's kind of embarrassing, you know? If it's embarrassing for him, then why not tell us, since he's the one that wants to hear it anyway? Yeah, okay, I guess. I mean, he's gonna. I mean, I think he's gonna flip out if he hears this. What? Yeah, but he already put your business out on the radio. Why not Put his out there, then sort of revenge. Friendly revenge. Yeah. I mean, we're not friends anymore, so. What? What? Was that bad? Yeah, it was bad. It was that bad? What was so bad? Just what you guys did. Like, the quality of it. I thought you said he didn't tell you anything about it. He didn't. I'm just making that up. I just really wanna know exactly what happened. But, no, he didn't give us any details. You just said it was bad, so I assumed you were talking about, you know, the quality of what happened. No, I'm talking about what happened afterwards. Okay. Same night. What happened? So after we were together, we're just lying there, you know, talking or whatever, and. Okay, he said something. It's bad. I don't wanna say. I don't wanna say. Oh, my god, I'm dying. I know. I really wanna know. You have to tell us now. You can't just sell it like that and then end it. Okay. Okay. So he. He leaned over to me.

You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay? No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do, could I stop you? Anyway, it's your call. You've changed so much. Feel like I barely know you lately. The old you would have made me come home no matter how late. Can I ask you something, too? Did the old me annoy you? If we're both gonna be miserable, might as well let you have your fun. Babe, I love you. Don't worry. I won't nag you to come home anymore. No more overthinking, either. If you drink too much, crash at your buddies. I get it now. No more micromanaging you or fighting over little things. Babe, I'm touched you feel this way. I love you more and more. Hmm. Have a good time with your friends. Hey, we'll do. Babe. Just got off work. You didn't forget what day it is, right? It's my birthday. Going out with Co workers. Wanna join? I'll pass. Don't know your work friends would be awkward. Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Love you. You sure you won't come? I'm sure. Alright. Did you get me a birthday gift? Nope. You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? Never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how we Were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while. What is it? Let's get a divorce. I'm exhausted. I can't work on this relationship anymore. Lost that spark. Better to split up now. It's best for both of us. Babe, I don't agree. Please don't leave me. I won't go out anymore. Won't stay out all night. Babe, give me one more chance. I know I messed up. That's it. I gotta go. I've already contacted a lawyer. And I think you should too. Let's end this on good terms.

Texting me babe isn't selling anything. It's called immersion. Is that so? Yeah. And maybe you should call me babe back. Or mommy, if you like that better. Stop it. Okay, fine. What about just sweetheart? Emma, I don't actually want you, cantina. I need Miss Astrology's help. What can I say to make Amelia blush and want more of me? Say this. Then why are you still here enjoying every moment of this? Why are you still here enjoying every moment of this? I mean, I'd be lying if I didn't say I do adore that charm of yours. If that's the case, then let me come over. I have some other things that you might also adore. Like what? My Gucci. Oh, my gosh. Why are you so desperate? Desperate? No. Devoted? Yes. Do I need to remind you again that this whole relationship we have is fake? Fake? Maybe not everything is fake. What is that supposed to mean? We should rehearse. You know, just make sure our story is solid. There's nothing to rehearse. We just say that we're dating, and that's it. Trust me, we need more details, like how we met and our first kiss. Maybe even the first time our vertical lips tangled. There will be no Kissing or tangling of any sort? Why not? It'd be convincing. No, it would be weird. Or hot. Depends on your perspective. I'm not playing your games. Too late. You already are. Okay, fine. We can have a little tango one time. That's it. And I'm only doing this to make this whole thing look believable. Chat. The plan worked.

What do you mean? Did I do something weird? Did you not do it on purpose? I guess not. What happened? OMG, why do you wear a black leather jacket? I'm really confused. What's significant about a black leather jacket? Do you not know about Mark? Who's Mark? Right, you're a freshman. I keep forgetting it's been a year since it happened. Since what happened? You're being so weird. Mark was on the football team. Very cool guy. Good looking, genetically blessed, 6 4, dated a lot of girls. You know the type. What about him? Basically, he always used to wear a black leather jacket, and it kind of became his thing. Like, almost every day. Okay. During one of his after parties, something went super wrong. He was driving when he should not have been, and he got into a car accident. Omg. Was he okay? That's the whole point. He wasn't. He was badly injured and then died in the hospital. Jesus Christ, that's terrible. I'm surprised I've never heard of them. There was a paper on the school board. The one with the RIP signs and flowers, right? Yeah. So basically, no one wears leather jackets to school in his name. It's a way of showing respect. You're a freshie, so no one will care. So that's why you were confused when he saw me? Yep. That's going to be the dumbest thing I've ever Heard one person can't own style. I'll see you in school tomorrow with my black leather jacket. Dumbass.

I'd do anything for my babies and teach them to love and appreciate their father. Oh, babe, that's so sweet. Can I ask you a question, though? Sure. What's up?

It says I've been accepted into the military, and I'll be serving in the United States. Oh, my god, that's great news. I know it's been your dream to join the military like your father. Yeah, but the downside is the distance. Remember when we talked about it? Yeah. We knew this day would come. I'm worried this relationship will end because of me. Don't say that, Zach. You'll always be my love, no matter what. Distance is tough, but we're tougher. I hope you land safely, babe. Focus on serving the country and accomplishing your mission. Make me and your country proud. And don't forget to tell me when you come back home. Hey, Maria. I'm not sure if you remember me. It's been 17 years since I left for the United States. I just finished my service and recently got back. Can we meet up? Uh, hello, sir. I think you made A mistake. And you're texting the wrong number. Isn't this Maria? No, my name is Zach, but my mom's name is Maria. Is she the one you meant to text? Oh, I didn't know she had a son. Give her a kiss for me and tell her I said hi. She'll understand. Okay, I will.

But then I kept getting shipments to the house, not having any clue what they are, but they all kept going to that one room.

Apparently things with loads of fiber is good for weight loss. So I went and bought two boxes of fiber heavy breakfast bars. The first day, I have fiber bars for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don't shit that day. Next day, I fiber myself up even more. I don't shit that day either. Fiber Jesus is surely working his magic in my colon. Can feel the pounds dropping off because I'm not very hungry anymore. I don't shit the third day. I don't shit the fourth day. The final day dawns. I have my morning coffee and feel my insides rumble in that familiar way. The second I hit the toilet, the weirdest fart in the world exits me. It's whistling. Just a thin, continuous airstream of fart that smells like Grandpapa's coffin. No sound other than the whistling. Hiss suddenly stops. The hole is plugged. SOS, this shit is so solid it feels like I'm giving buttocks birth to Dwayne The Rock Johnson. Hang on to the shower curtain and pray the rock is shot out of my rear end at max speed. My entire bum is covered in toilet water. Now the fun begins. A fart that could do more damage to the ozone layer than aerosol ever did is Shooting shit bullets out of me. Solid and perfectly round nuggets. The smell is destroying me, blacking out the thuds of nuggets shooting around the bowl, propelled by my insane fiber. The flatulence is giving me war flashbacks. I wasn't even in Nam. My guts are yelling in German. Sounds like a moose in heat. Lives in my belly. Most of the shit isn't even digested at this point, just forced out by all the gas that had been building up to my throat. After an hour, it finally seems to be over. I'm shivering and crying. Both legs collapse as I try to stand up. My stomach hitting the bathroom tiles forces one last trumpet. Gondor calls for aid shakily wipe my bum completely clean what the actual.

Oh, okay. Uh, so let's start with your boyfriend's name. His name is Tim. Okay. And how long have you guys been together? Three years. We just had our three year anniversary. Oh, wow. Congrats. But. Well, but maybe not, I guess. Um, so tell me about the condoms. Okay. Alright, so Kim works for CO, which is a company that does data management, which it sounds kind of boring, I know, but he gets to go on like a ton of trips for conferences and stuff. And sometimes he brings me with him, but this time I couldn't go. Okay, so he. Alright, so he's on a trip right now then? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Um, so he's currently at a conference in Las Vegas. And just because his birthday and I. I felt really bad that I couldn't spend it with him. So I got a card and I put a 50 dollar Bill inside and said, here's some money for you to have after you lose everything on the craps table. Like, you know, like a cute little joke, but also a birthday card at the same time and like a little present. Yeah, yeah. I mean, and who doesn't need an extra 50 bucks in Vegas, right? Right. Like, like, couldn't go wrong, right? So the night before he left, he stayed at My place. Cause I was dropping him off at the airport early, we could spend time together. And I see his packed suitcase and I wanted to slip the card in there, I didn't want it to be the first thing that he saw when he opened it. I wanted him to like, be surprised when he found it. And I. I was also worried that if his bag got inspected at the airport, like, it might fall out, there might be issues. Sure, it's something like that. Yeah. Okay. So I'm digging through a suitcase, trying to find somewhere to hide this card, and I noticed this inside pocket. It's like, perfect. So I unzip it and that's when I find a whole bunch of condoms. Right, and. And why would he need them if you aren't going with him this time on the trip? Yeah, but even if I were going, like, we don't use them anyway, so it's like, you know, why do you need them, period, in the first place? Why do you even own them? Okay, alright, Devil's advocate here. Is there a chance that maybe they're really old? Like, maybe he put them in there years ago and just forgot about them? Maybe he never even uses, like, the inside pocket you chose and he just forgot they were in there. I wish, but, um, no, because I found his razor in there, his deodorant, his toothbrush, there was a ton of other Stuff in the same pocket. And the condoms were on top of all of that stuff, so he literally, like, stuffed them in last after all his bathroom stuff. Okay. All right. God, with it being in Vegas, too, I hope he wasn't planning on, like, hiring some skanky call girl or, like, visiting a brothel or something. Like, I honestly, I don't think that's it. I really think that there's someone else, and I've kind of suspected for a while. I, I think it's somebody that he works with. Oh, really? Okay. Do you. Do you know her name? I don't know anything specific. It's just like, you know, when you have one of those gut feelings. Okay, now, um, so do you know if he traveled alone? Like, did he say, I gotta take my assistant, Sasha Mcboots, with me this time or anything like that? No, he. He said he was just gonna go alone. Okay. You'd like to know who those condoms were meant for. Is he staying, I guess, at a hotel, then, I take it, right? Yeah, he's staying at the palms. Oh, wow. Right there on the strip? Yep. Yeah. That's nice. Um, okay, so what we can do is we can call his room, and then usually when we do this, we say something like, this is the front desk. A woman from this room called and asked for a new hair dryer. And at that point, he's either gonna say, well, There's no woman in this room. Or he's gonna turn to the woman next to him bed and go, hey, did you ask for a hair dryer? And if he does that, then you've got him. So either way, this will probably get you the answer you're looking for. Okay. Okay, now the other thing we might have to consider here is like, it's probably. Well, it's like not even 5:30 in the morning in Vegas, so there's a possibility if we call him, he may not answer. Well, are you gonna. Are you calling his cell phone or you actually calling the hotel room like blind? No, we're. We're calling the hotel room cause we're gonna pretend we're from the front desk. Have you ever heard the. His phone rings in the room are. They are super loud. That's true. I forgot about. Yeah. Okay, so he probably won't answer. we're gonna call him when we come back next. Thank you for calling Palms Casino Resort and spa. This call may be monitored or recorded. Please remain on the line for the first available hotel operator. Thank you for calling Palms Casino Resort. My name is Janet. How may I assist you? Yeah, I'm trying to reach my coworker. He's actually staying at your hotel. His name is Tim. Last name is H I A. Can you just, um. Can you connect me to his room? Yes, absolutely. Before I connected, would there be anything else that I could assist you with. No, that's it. Thank you. Have a good day.

You actually went out on a date recently with one of our listeners and they emailed us to call you. Huh. Okay. Her name is Anna. Hmm. Do you remember going out with Anna? Yeah, I went out with that crazy chick, man. You. You went out with that crazy chick? Yeah. Yeah, she crazy shit. Bad crazy. Really? What? Oh, that's. Yeah. Wow, just out the gate like that, you're gonna call her crazy? I haven't even really had a chance to talk to you about the date at all. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you think she's crazy? I mean, she's back crazy. I don't know what else you need to know. Yeah, pretty much says it all right there. But yeah, can you tell us why at least? Cause. Look, she enjoyed your date, obviously, man. You took her out to dinner, helicopter rides, all that. Oh, she told you about that? Yeah. I mean, the date was the. So of course she liked it. Haha. Yeah, it sounds like you. It sounds like you know how to plan a pretty nice date, Chris. I mean, you know, when we hit somebody, you know, you go all out. I guess. I mean, I Do it. So why would you spend an entire weekend at that much money with a girl if you thought the shoe was crazy? I mean, that's how I treat women that I'm interested in. Maybe somebody doesn't treat you like that, but they should. Okay, I actually agree with you, but. So. So. So you were interested in her, but now you think she's crazy? Oh, bad. Again. Crazy. Why is that? Was it. Did something happen after your date, or was it during your date that you decided that? And your date lasted a whole weekend? So I'm guessing it was after. You know, she would text me, and I would tell her I'm busy, okay? And then she one day showed up in front of my fucking doorstep. What? Whoa. She showed up? She's not from here. She's. She's not from here. All right, so she just one day shows up on my property at my front door, talking about, hey, I'm moving here? What the are you talking about? Whoa, slow down. So she's not you. When you say she's not from here, she's from where? From far away, where they make crazy. Is that. Does that have a specific state? Yeah, she's from, like, four states away. That's how we met online. She's from out of state. Whoa. Yeah, so she shows up, you know, it's not like she went down the street, she jumped on a plane, and then came to my front door. And stood there. I was like, hey, I like you so much, I wanna move here now. What? What the fuck are you talking about, Chris? I need to get some clarification, cause I'm kind of confused now. When we talked to her, she didn't say she was from somewhere else. How did you guys go out on a date? Was. Did you fly her out here for the date or something? Yeah, I flew her out. So we. We talked and I was like, all right, I'm like a. I'mma fly her out here and we'll have a great weekend. That's why we had a whole weekend plan, because, you know, I knew that I only had limited time with this and she lives so far away. That makes sense. And so when we talked to her about it, she left all that out.

I think he couldn't find a restaurant, but he could find my freaking underwear drawer. Hello? Hi. Can I speak to Olivia? Uh, yeah, this is sir. Hey, Olivia. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Hello. How's it going? Good. I'm sorry, who are you? From Jubal, from Brooke and Jubal in the morning, the Radio show. Am I disturbing you at work or something? You sound, uh. Yeah, sorry, I'm. I don't mean to be rude. Why? I'm. No, that. Is this like a promotion to buy something? It is not a promotion to buy something. I'm actually calling you because a listener of ours sent us an email about you, and he wanted us to call you. Okay, I'll explain. His name is Kevin. You and him recently went out on a date. You probably remember Kevin, because he couldn't find the restaurant you were supposed to go to, and you ended up going back to your place and just having a few beers. Right. Okay, well, Kevin really liked you and is wondering why you're not calling him back. Is there something that Kevin did on your date to make you not want to see him again? You know, I just don't really feel like it's something to talk about, and. Yeah, okay, but is It more than him not being able to find the restaurant. No, that was super irritating. And, like, what grown man can't find a freaking restaurant? But, yeah. No, that's not the issue. That's not the issue? No. Is he. Is this some. Did he just, like, write an email and you guys are calling me and, like, wasting my day, or. Yep, that's pretty much exactly what happened. And I know. I know that you're at work and you sound busy. Yeah, and I don't want you to. He's just. What's that? I just want to know, like, what. The premise of this, so that way I know if I need to change my phone number. Whoa. No, we won't be calling you ever again after this. I'd appreciate you, though, hanging on, because it's a segment we do on our show called The Second Date Update. Basically, we want to tell Kevin what he did wrong on your date so he can learn not to do it again on other dates. It sounds like you don't want to see him again. Can you tell us what the main issue is? What did he do? He. I went to the kitchen to make us a drink, and when I came out, he wasn't in the living room where I left him, and where he was coming out from did not seem like the bathroom. And he seemed really weird about it. Like, he just seemed weird, and then I Went. I went back. It just got really awkward. It's not that big of an apartment, so it's not that hard to find the bathroom. And my door to my bedroom was a jar. You think you went in your room? I think he stole a pair of my freaking panties. What? What? For real? I do not want him anywhere near me. Hold up. Okay, I was just gonna say that he went into your room, and that's weird, but you think that he stole a pair of your underwear? I think he couldn't find a restaurant, but he could find my freaking underwear drawer. Okay, Olivia, that's a. Like, that's it. That's a big claim. Are you sure you're not just imagining something? Why would you think that he would do that? He was just so weird, and it just. It was, like, awkward from the beginning, and I felt like I'd made a bad decision, even when I was letting him into my apartment, and it just got worse. And then when he wasn't in the living room, like, why didn't he just say, hey, can I please use your bathroom? Like, have some common courtesy if you're a stranger. Right? And then are you just assuming that he stole your underwear? Like, how do you. Are you missing underwear? The jar was a jar. Yeah. You could have possibly left that there, right? Yeah, but if you have a gut feeling about something, and I don't, Remember hearing the toilet run? Like, you know how after you pee and you flush, it kind of, like, runs for a little bit to fill up? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I don't remember hearing that. Are you missing underwear? I have, like, 100. Okay, so you don't know. I know. I know every single one of my underwear. They're all catalog and charted. Yeah, I know. And I'm missing a pair. I wouldn't know either. So you don't. You don't really know. You don't have any proof that he took your underwear, but that's just what you're thinking. Yeah, I think he's really weird, and he creeped me out, and the freak flag went off, and I. Yeah, asked him to leave my apartment. You don't wanna ask him if he did take your underwear? Uh, sorry. My boss is giving me a weird look. I'll be right back. Okay. What was your question? You don't want to ask him if he did take your underwear? No, I don't ever want to talk to this guy again. Are you sure? Oh, that's a shame, because, Olivia, he's actually on the other line, and I would love to find out. Kevin, seriously, did you steal Olivia's underwear?

Um, I went home to Tennessee for Thanksgiving. Spent the weekend with my family. I was supposed to come back Sunday night, but I rebooked at the last minute and got a flight Sunday morning instead. So I get back into town and I wanna surprise my girlfriend, so drove to her apartment. And when I get there, I noticed that there was this Jeep parked in her spot right in front of her door. That's kind of weird. So I go up, knock on the door, she doesn't answer. And then I think, well, maybe she's at church or something. Then I noticed her car is in the parking lot too. So I call her. No answer. Text her. No answer. So I basically just went home. And then about an hour later, she calls me and is like, hey, I'm sorry, I just saw your text. I was in the shower and I'm like, yeah. I was like, yeah, I was gonna surprise you. And she goes, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't have my phone on me. Okay, let me stop you right there. First of all, I couldn't understand. Like 20 minutes at later she calls like she's in the shower. But you said an hour. Yeah, actually, it might have been a little longer than that. Okay, alright, so she. Okay, so she was in the shower, I guess. I don't know. Anyway, I. You know, so I was Saying like, I was like, yeah, I was gonna surprise you. And she goes, oh, we'll come over and surprise me now, so I'll go over there. The Jeep is gone. And so I asked her, I was like, well, you know, why aren't you parked in your, in your normal spot? I saw some guy in a Jeep, stole it earlier, you know. And she's like, oh yeah, that was my cousin Michelle. Remember I told you she was coming to stay with me for the weekend? And I was like, oh yeah, that's right. So at that point, I sort of just let it go, cause she did tell me her cousin was coming over. But then, like, the more I kept thinking about it, the more I felt like it just didn't. It didn't look like something a girl would drive. And I'm not, I'm, I'm not trying to stereotype or anything, it's just. It just didn't seem like something a girl would drive. Yeah, well, I mean, I used to drive a pickup truck. In fact, I've owned multiple pickup trucks with. Yeah, lift kits and. Yeah. And Ashley is a woman, sort of. And. And she, she drives big ass trucks. I, I know, I know. And it's not just because it was a Jeep, it was just. I don't know, the whole thing was it being a Jeep and a lift kit and then her being home but not answering the door. I don't Know, so you just want to make sure that the vehicle was really her cousin's vehicle like she said it was. Yeah. Okay, so you said she lives in an apartment complex? Yeah. What's the name of the apartment complex? Apartments over by First Colonial. Okay. And you said, um, she also has her own parking spot, correct? Yeah, everybody gets one spot and then there's like, visitor spots. But when I went through, the Jeep was in her spot and she parked in visitors parking. Okay, so she could have extended that courtesy to her cousin then, so. let's call her up here real quick. I have an idea that is definitely gonna get you your answer. Okay. Okay, cool. Thanks. Uh, what is her name? You never told us your girlfriend's name. Oh, yeah, it's Heather. Heather. Okay, hang on a sec. We're gonna get her number from you. Okay? Okay, so we are going to call, uh, the girlfriend. That would be Heather. And you wanna do this one, right? Yes. This is gonna sound better if you do it. Okay, then if I. Then if a guy does it. Oh, let's be honest. So we're gonna go. So we're gonna go with the. We're gonna go with the fake car accident? Not accident, like I. You. You nicked the car. The Jeep. You nicked the Jeep. That's what we decided. What we're gonna go with. We're gonna try that. I nicked it? Yes. Yes. You nicked it. Exactly. Um, so hopefully then. And then she says, oh, it's my cousin's Jeep. And then you'll be like, oh, okay, great. Then we know.

I actually don't want you to get a second date. What? Why? Because this guy took you out for, like, a fabulous fancy dinner, helicopter ride around the city, spent the whole weekend spoiling you. I don't want you to get a second date so I can date him, that's why. Sounds like a fabulous date to me. If you're just tuning in for the second date update, Anna did exactly that. She went out with a guy who just spoiled her for the whole weekend, and they texted a little bit after he said he was really busy, and then she finally was like, when are we gonna hang out? And then he said, it's not gonna work out, and she wants to find out why, so we're about to call him right now. Any last thoughts before we dial the phone number, Anna? No, I'm just really curious. And how did you guys leave the weekend again? In each other's arms. I mean, we were. I thought we had a really good time. I'm gonna dial the phone right now, see if we can get him on the phone and get your second date update. Okay, awesome. Here we go. Hello, can I speak to Chris, please? Uh, yes, he. Chris, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. What? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. How's it going? Uh, it's going. It's going good. Well, I just want to talk to you about something if you got a minute. Uh, this is one of your prank phone calls and. Nah, stop it right at the beginning. Yeah, it is not a prank phone call. You actually went out on a date recently with one of our listeners and they emailed us to call you. Huh. Okay. Her name is Anna. Hmm. Do you remember going out with Anna? Yeah, I went out with that crazy chick, man. You. You went out with that crazy chick? Yeah, yeah, she crazy shit. Bad crazy. Really? What? Oh, that's. Yeah. Wow, just out the gate like that, you're gonna call her crazy? I haven't even really had a chance to talk to you about the date at all. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you think she's crazy? I mean, she's back crazy. I don't know what else you need to know. Yeah, pretty much says it all right there. But can you tell us why at least? Cause, look, she enjoyed your date, obviously, man. You took her out to dinner, helicopter rides, all that. Oh, she told you about that? Yeah. I mean, the date was the. So of course she liked it. Haha. Yeah, it sounds like you. It sounds like you know how to plan a pretty nice date, Chris. I mean, you know, when we hit somebody, you know, you go all out. I guess. I mean, I Do it. why would you spend an entire weekend and that much money with a girl if you thought the shoe was crazy? I mean, that's how I treat women that I'm interested in. Maybe somebody doesn't treat you like that, but they should. Okay, I actually agree with you, but. So. So. So you were interested in her, but now you think she's crazy? Oh, bad. Again. Crazy. Why is that? Was it. Did something happen after your date, or was it during your date that you decided that? And your date lasted a whole weekend? So I'm guessing it was after. You know, she would text me, and I would tell her I'm busy, okay? And then she one day showed up in front of my fucking doorstep. What? Whoa. She showed up? She's not from here. She's not from here. All right, so she just one day shows up on my property at my front door, talking about, hey, I'm moving here? What the are you talking about? Whoa, slow down. So she's not you. When you say she's not from here, she's from where? From far away, where they make crazy. Is that. Does that have a specific state? Yeah, she's from, like, four states away. That's how we met online. She's from out of state. Whoa. Yeah, so she shows up, you know, it's not like she went down the street, she jumped on a plane, and then came to my front door and Stood there, I was like, hey, I like you so much, I wanna move here now. What? What the fuck are you talking about, Chris? I need to get some clarification, cause I'm kind of confused now. When we talked to her, she didn't say she was from somewhere else. How did you guys go out on a date with. Did you fly her out here for the date or something? Yeah, I flew her out. So we. We talked and I was like, all right, I'm like a. I'mma fly her out here and we'll have a great weekend. That's why we had a whole weekend plan. Because, you know, I knew that I only had limited time with this and she lives so far away. That makes sense. And so when we talked to her about it, she left all that out.

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it. Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day, my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a Couple extra expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with. So I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line. So I ran up by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why Don't wait till you get home. You check the email. You call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? She was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue? No, I would. She's cute, I like her, but it's just not gonna work out. Okay, well, why? If she's cute and you had fun, that sounds awful. Is that a problem? You don't like that? No, I really like that. It's just. She lied. She lied about what? Actually, let me rephrase that. She wasn't 100% truthful with me. Okay. Okay. Who is on a first date? Let's be honest. Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay, okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder? Yeah, well, number one, I don't know why someone would do that, but I. I can think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex, or she doesn't want people to know. Or she doesn't want Her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out. Why. Why is that a big deal? Yeah, well, yeah. Our name is summer. Our name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants. And if. Yeah, if we were to, I don't know, like, long term relationship, get married at some point, her name would be Summer Pants. Come on. That. That is the dumbest. I think that's amazing. Yeah, I. I would love that. Well, I would not love that. It make me very uncomfortable knowing maybe people are making fun of her behind her back or something like that. Oh, my god. You jumped so many steps, by the way. Well, I know I'm going fast, but I'm looking for a long term relationship, so I'm not there to just mess around with people and so. So you're looking for a forever pants? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't get smarty pants. And you. Okay, you don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the. The person that you want to be around all the time? No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay, but you are so many assumptions here. One, that she would even take your name when you got married. Like, a lot of women keep their last name. And that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry to take your Last name? Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. But you're Daniel Pants. And you don't think Summer Pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Alright, well. And that's it? That's the only reason? That is the biggest reason? Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Oh yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing. And years of great jokes. Yeah, that's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge. No, I'm allowed to. Okay, you're allowed to. Well, Daniel, I do have to let you know that summer is on the phone listening right now and she wants to talk to you. What? Yeah.

I yell whisper to him what the heck are you doing? Hacking! Stop! He listens and obeys for a while until again he runs his hand up my thigh and starts feeling my junk. I stopped tolerating at that time and screamed get the heck off me, weirdo! And pushed him so hard he went flying and hit the wall and said hit me more, daddy! Everybody stopped what they were doing, including the teacher. Teacher thought it was my fault and sent both of us to the principal's office. I was furious. This gay kid assaulted me and somehow it was my fault. We were both walking to the principal's office when he came onto me and said I like a feisty boy, and he groped my ass and crotch at the same time, then pushed me against the wall and tried to kiss me in the middle of the hallway where people were watching in disgust. He was taller and stronger than me, so it was hard pushing him off, but I finally managed to land a blow to his jaw. He stumbled backwards and said, oh yeah, I'm totally gonna freak the heck out of you, baby Tilda. That punch should have knocked him out, but somehow he was still standing and barrelling towards me at this point. I booked it to the principal's office while he was screaming Brandon, come Here, I just wanna shove my thing up your tight opening throughout the hallways. When I made it to the principal's office, I barricaded the door using a door stopper while I was trying to explain the situation to the administrators. Before I could explain it, he breaks through the glass door. Glass goes flying everywhere while the staff is screaming. They call 9 1 1 thinking an intruder broke in. Kid enters and strips me. Then he starts to strip and I can see his 12 inch monster throbbing, anticipating to hit me. I let out a shriek of terror as he grabs my waist and begins to do despicable things I can't say on TikTok. The entirety of his 12 inch enters me as I feel a mixture of pleasure, anger, embarrassment, and horror. The principal could not believe her eyes. She hung up the 9 1 1 call and started recording me getting hecked. Apparently she got break from all the hecking and started touching herself. Then eventually everyone in the room started touching themselves furiously. Cum goes flying everywhere on the walls, on the floor, the ceiling, and the students walking by eventually joined the Cum session. Soon the entire school of 2000 surrounded me and a kid hacking my ass as they all furiously hacked. Then everyone stripped and started hacking each other. This day was the absolute worst.

You're not? Why aren't you ready? Well, to be completely honest, I'm kind of broke. That first date kind of tapped me out, and I'm trying to save up enough money to take her on a second date. Oh, no, dude. Levi. Oh, man. Why are you paying for all this expensive stuff if you don't have the funds to do that? Like buying her the makeup and the shoes? Oh, she told you about all that stuff, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we talked to her about your date. She said you guys went to a really nice dinner, and then afterwards you took her to the mall and you were like, throw it in the bag, girl. Whatever you want. No, look, it's not really a big deal. Guys, I got a second. Um, I gotta. I'm done driving for Uber now, and so between that and my real job, I really think that, you know, it's gonna be easy to take her on dates like that. I just wasn't planning ahead cause I didn't know I was gonna meet her, you know? Did you say you just got a. Wait, Levi, wait. A new job? You took a second job in order to take Cassie out again? Yeah. Oh, man, that is so sweet and so wrong all at the same time. Yeah, no, it's not right. I mean, look, let's be honest. What's money for if not to, like, spend it on people? You Like, sounds like money for you. Should be to save it, but yeah. You realize when you go out on a date, you don't have to break the bank, right? Well, you don't know Cassie, but she's definitely worth breaking the bank. I mean, I'd even rob a bank. Not a big bank. Not a big bank, but a medium sized bank. That's illegal, but sweet. Yeah. If you don't have the bank, don't spend it. No, no, I get that. It's just. I think today, nowadays it's just a nice concept to be able to take somebody out. And if I'm the one asking them out, I wanna be the one who can, like, you know, make it a date. Okay, I agree with you there. I do. I think that if you're the one that's asking, then you should be the one that treat. But she likes you for a lot of reasons. And there's a lot of other less expensive date options than taking them to the mall. Like, you could go, I don't know, to coffee man. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. In the dating climate nowadays, I think too many guys are content just being, you know, typical. And I wanted to wow her. And I still want to wow her on our next date. That's the point.

I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about. I, I haven't gone out with anybody named Luke. What? You haven't gone out with anybody named Luke? I've been married for, like, three years. I haven't gone out with anybody. What? You've been married for three years? Yes, I'm very happily married. Did you, by any chance, are you married to a guy named Luke?

I have zero clue what you guys are talking about. It really? Can. Can you be more clear? Yeah, sure. I bet you'd appreciate that. And probably your husband, too. Wow.

Okay, okay, so wait, that part happened? Yeah, That part did happen. I think I just realized who you're talking about. Okay, so. So you do know a Luke? I met a Luke a couple days ago. He came in for a job interview. Okay. Did you go out for drinks with him later on? Absolutely not. No, I. I was interviewing him for a position at our company. Wait, you were the one doing the interview? Yes. I'm so confused. He said that he just met you at that office and struck up a conversation. You guys went to drinks, had fun, even kissed at the end of the night, and now you're not calling him back? He said we kissed? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said that you guys kissed and everything seemed to be going great, he was surprised that you didn't want to go on another date with him. Oh, my god. He even went into, like, graphic detail about the kiss. That. How it was wet and you licked your lips. Jesus Christ, I. Okay, look, so wait, you didn't kiss him? No, there is no way. No, absolutely not. Let me just tell you what actually happened, cause this is. This is bizarre, okay? I'm. I'm tired of hearing all this stuff. Okay, look, this young man, Luke, came in for a job interview. Brought him into my office, sat down, interviewed. We went over his resume. He was kind of fidgety, he was kind of acting a little strange, and I Sent him on his way. And in the last couple days, I've been getting flooded with emails, phone calls, messages asking about the job. Oh, my god. So. So you didn't even hire him? No, he has not been hired. He told us differently. What was he like in the job interview? He was just kind of all over the place. You know, he. He just wasn't an ideal candidate. I don't know. He was acting strange. Maybe he was stoned. I don't know. Stoned? Come on. What is happening? That is Luke. He was actually on the other night listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you.

I really need to talk to you about something. And I'm just kind of really nervous about telling you. Okay. I just wanna. What's wrong? Uh, okay. I need you to say that I'm sorry before I say anything else. I just need you to know that I'm. I'm sorry. Um. Why? Why. Why are you sorry? Ah, okay. So. Babe, you're really making me scared. What's. What's wrong? I know. Um. Basically the other day I went on the computer and, uh. You had an email open to your mom. And I read it. And so I read the. What? Yeah. Um. So I know. I know how you're gonna propose to me. Oh, god, I read all the details and it's. It's really beautiful and. Kathleen, are you kidding? I'm so sorry that I read it. I know I shouldn't have. Oh my god, you. Yeah. And why were you going. Why were you going through my emails in the first place? I mean, I wasn't going through them. I just. You know, it was on the computer and I. And I was just gonna X out of it, but then I saw the word proposal and then. So I just started reading it and I know I shouldn't have, but. I'm sorry. You read Every. You. Did you read everything? Yeah, I couldn't stop. Oh man, Kathleen, I knew you wanted to be surprised. Yeah, I mean, I still do want to be surprised. And so that's why I'm calling you and hoping that maybe you can change the proposal. But I am still surprised. And I'm so sorry that I ruined it. And everything you planned was wonderful. And I really wish I hadn't read it cause it would have been great. Yeah, it's not even. I'm so sorry. I don't. Why did you. I don't. Just don't understand why you read it. Like, how do you not trust me? No, it's not that. I think it was gonna be. I was. I was just gonna X out of it. But it was just a word proposal. I saw it. You know, I wasn't reading it. I was just. Look, you know, I scanned it real quick and then that's what made me read it. Because of the word proposal. I know that it's totally 110% my fault and I shouldn't have read it and it. But I can't. I can't take it back, I can't unread it. And so now the surprise is ruined and it's my fault and I know that. Yeah, I mean, I just. I don't. I mean, how am I gonna surprise you now? I don't know. I have to think of a whole new thing. It took. I mean, we've been together three years. We could wait. Like another year. Figure something out. Surprise. You. You wanted a surprise? I just. Do you want to? I just. Do you want to? What? Wait, what? Awkward. What? Wait, right. Jubal, you there? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what you do, Justin. I have no idea. Yeah, what is going on?

It was a lot more than that. So I deserve to know what the promise is. Who the hell you promise? What? Because you not get on an altar and promise me anything. So you better give me some answers.

They already had Brooke, who was 6 at the time, but they wanted another child. After seeing me at the agency, they said it felt like I was meant to be part of our family. But Brooke never accepted me. She'd hide my homework, blame me for things she broke, and tell other kids at school I was second hand goods. Despite her constant bullying, I worked hard in school while Brooke partied and barely maintained a C average. I was taking advanced classes and studying late into the night. Our parents noticed the difference, but didn't want to compare us, praise both of us equally, even when Brooke clearly didn't deserve it. Everything changed during our senior year. Brooke was failing three classes and risk not graduating. Instead of studying, she spent her time making TikToks about how adopted kids were damaged goods and posting Instagram stories mocking my generic brand DNA. One day, I overheard her on the phone with her friend My parents only adopted her because they felt sorry for her. But watch. When college applications come around, they'll realize blood is thicker than water. All their money is going to their real daughter's education. That was the last straw. I had already been accepted to Princeton with a partial scholarship, but I hadn't told anyone yet. I decided to let Brooke dig her own grave. Every time she skipped class to hang out with her boyfriend, I quiet. When she forged our mom's signature on her failed math test, I looked the other way. I watched as she dug herself deeper and deeper. The day college decisions were released, our parents gathered

I don't want you to buy anything. Can I talk to you for a second, please? Um, I'll make it quick. I'll get to the point. Okay. You recently went out on a date to the zoo and puked. What? That was quick into the point. How did you know that? I know that because the guy you went out with, Brad, he wanted us to call you because you haven't been answering any of his phone calls or text messages. So he thought maybe we could find out what happened and why you don't want to go out with him again. Why do you think I wouldn't call him back? That was probably the worst date. No, that was definitely the worst date I've ever had. Oh, my god. Ever had? It sounds horrific. Like, not only just, like, the allergic reaction or whatever happened to you and the puking, but the monkeys freaking out and children crying. Wow. He told you everything? Awesome. Yeah, that's, um. That's okay. Great. He also told Us that he really liked you and isn't like, weirded out by the fact that you threw up all over the monkeys. Not all the monkeys. No, I'm, I. That's. He's just being nice. I mean, I projectile vomited everywhere. It was disgusting. Like, kids were crying. It was. It was the worst. And like, I even had like, an issue downstairs too. Just. Just to round it all out. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, girl. But here's the thing. If this guy still wants to get a hold of you, he obviously really likes you. Like, if you can do all of that on a first date and he still thinks you're awesome. Honestly, I think he's probably just being nice because I can't imagine anyone, anyone wanting to go back out with me. Well, I mean, he went to a radio show to call you because he wanted to go out with you again. And I don't think he knows about your downstairs issue, whatever that was, cause he didn't bring that up. Poor thing. Well, I think I blamed it on the monkeys. Oh, my god. Oh, man. What did you feel like when your mom finally came? Oh, my god. I kind of. I mean, I. Who wants to like, cry in front of a guy to their mom? But I kind of did cause I was mortified. It's just embarrassing. You're okay now though, right? Yeah, I mean, I'm fine. It's just my ego. But, you know, I've had a lot of allergies my whole life, and it's just weird allergies like strawberries, orchids, shark. I'm just embarrassed by the whole thing. I don't even know what to say to him, so I'd rather just stay away. So that is why you're not calling him back? You're not calling him back because you're embarrassed about vomiting and all the other bodily functions that happened? Yes. I mean, how could we ever come back from an experience like that? Well, I think that just means that you guys have moved to the next stage in your relationship. You know, a lot of people put pride in that. They're like, we're so close, we go to the bathroom with the door open. You're like, I don't even wait for a bathroom. I do in the zoo. You know, you guys are close now. I don't know. Well, I'd be interested to see how he feels, and we can ask him, because he's actually on the other line listening right now. Wants to talk to you. Hey, Denise.

Got this one from a friend who's a judge. If you get called for jury duty and wanna get out of it, the foolproof way for both sides to throw you out is to say you have a strong respect for law enforcement and if they brought a charge against someone, they must have done something wrong. Even if there's no evidence, you believe they don't arrest innocent people. You'll be home before lunch. Two. Tell your co workers you have terrible hearing. Which, personally, is partially true, but it's not nearly as bad as I play it up to be. And everyone feels comfortable whispering around you. I know everything. Three, really good looking blind people won't care if you're ugly. Four. I had a conference at a hotel during a break, I went out into the hall and dished up a full breakfast. Turns out the meal was for a completely different conference and our conference only had coffee and muffins. So it was accidental and I never did it again. But it would be very easy to do if you needed a meal. Five. Hotels often have fees if you cancel too close to your intended stay. In a lot of cases. You can, however, call them, reschedule into the future, then wait a bit and call again to cancel, but this time without the fees. Six. For any type of web delivered service where your physical location doesn't matter. Digital downloads, event tickets, online credits. Choose a zip code in a place with no sales tax for this purpose. I've memorized 59,901, which is Calispell, Montana. 7 once talked with a homeless man that mentioned he would often empty and clean out a dog food can and refill it with beef stew. He ate it outside of the grocery store while he was asking for money or food and would get hooked up. 8 in my area the building codes are super strict and a lot of the time you won't get permission to tear down a house completely to build a new house. However, if you don't demo the entire house and instead remodel the house, then you'll get permission. So what we have done in the past is literally demo everything except for the fireplace and chimney and literally build a brand new house around it? 9. Get the app for fast food places that have reward points. Anytime you go there or just walk by it. Look for receipts laying on the ground. Scan in the receipts for reward points. Free food. I have already got over $1,600 worth of free food from one app when Menards does their 11% off. Look for rebate receipts laying around the parking lot. Last year I got several hundred dollars of rebates that way. 10. Work as little as possible for the maximum amount of money. Avoid letting your boss know when you've completed tasks ahead of time as Finishing quickly often leads to being assigned even more work. Focus on keeping your boss satisfied without overextending yourself.

One. I didn't cheat on my ex. I just let her believe it so she would get out of my life quicker and take her scummy circle of friends with her. Two. Once upon a time, the company I worked for gave me a like $500 gift credit card. It kept allowing me to purchase items with it even once it was over its $500 limit. I ended up spending $8,000 on it before I cut it up. Nothing else ever came of it. 3. I was the one who wrote the dirty word on the mirror in high school. They had a whole witch hunt trying to figure out who did it. The teachers threatened people, they questioned us, they went through our bags to find the offending lipstick. It was me the whole time. 4. My little brother is the only reason I don't fully disappear and never speak to anyone again. 5. When I was a kid, my parents had to work late and couldn't pick me up from school. I would have to walk about an hour and a half to get home. I didn't like taking the bus because it was so far. I would try to hang out at any of my friends houses that would let me while I waited for my parents. Anyways, one day I was passing by a friend's house while Walking home and I thought I'd call them to see if I could come hang out. No answer. I knew where they hid their spare key and for some reason I still can't explain, I let myself in. I walked around shouting their name and no one was home. After about 30 seconds, I realised I just broke into my friend's house. I quickly left and put the key back. I haven't told anyone. Six. It was I who hoisted the mannequin on the high school flag pole. Seven. I was the one who clogged the toilet at the sleepover back in high school. No one knew who it was and the other five girls were blaming each other for it while I sat watching TV. Eight. So I used to have a really close friend and we have a whole friend group together. We ended up at the same workplace as well. We dated for around four weeks and he broke up with me. We hadn't told any of our friends, so now I have to sit next to him every day at work and on the weekends during hangouts, pretending nothing happened. It's excruciating.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes. When I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before. I drove to my old elementary school playground and sat on the Same swing where dad used to push me before work completely consumed his life. Before he became just a distant voice sometimes heard. Coming home at 2:00am, something inside me finally broke that night. All the anger I'd bottled up for years spilled over at once. I pulled out my phone and texted him. Congratulations on showing me exactly where I rank in your priorities. Message delivered. Read immediately. When I got home after midnight, Dad's car was sitting in our driveway. I found him hunched over our kitchen table. Head.

Her ex's. When I confronted her, she laughed. Yeah, he's not even yours. What are you going to do? Divorce me? This is a no fault state. I'm taking half. Loser. I didn't say a word. I just got a DNA test, hired a lawyer and started packing. Three months later she was outside my building, sobbing, homeless and begging me to. I thirty four m am still processing how one piece of paper changed everything. It's been just five days since my son was born. My wife, Vanessa, 31F, was discharged yesterday and I was sorting through the paperwork from the hospital. Birth certificate, insurance forms, the usual. That's when I saw it. The name on the birth certificate. Not James Taylor, like we'd agreed. Instead, Alexander Reynolds Taylor. Alexander. The name hit me like a truck. That was her ex's name. Vanessa, what's this? I asked, walking into the bedroom where she was resting with a baby. The birth certificate says Alexander, not James. She glanced up, then looked back at her phone. Oh yeah, last minute change of heart. Alexander sounds better. Alexander, like your ex? Something shifted in her face. A cold calculation replaced the exhaustion of new motherhood. Surprised you caught that so quickly, she said with a small, ugly laugh. Why would you name our son after your ex? Because he's not our son, Mark. He's Alex's son. The room seemed to Tilt what? You heard me. The baby isn't yours. Alex and I have been seeing each other for about a year. I stared at her, blood rushing in my ears. What are you going to do about it? Divorce me. She laughed coldly. This is a no fault state. I get half of everything either way. The house, your savings, plus child support. She turned back to her phone. Stay and play daddy, or leave and pay. Either way, I win. I didn't say a word, didn't scream, didn't throw things. Just turned around and walked out of the room. My first call was to a DNA testing facility. They could see me tomorrow. Second call was to a law firm specializing in divorce cases. The receptionist heard the urgency in my voice and squeezed me in for a consultation the same afternoon. Jessica Winters was exactly what I needed. Experienced, direct, and strategically minded. No fault. Divorce doesn't mean what your wife thinks it means, she explained after hearing my situation. It just means you don't need to prove wrongdoing to get divorced. It doesn't guarantee her half your assets, especially with evidence of fraud. Fraud? Paternity fraud. Putting you on the birth certificate of another man's child knowingly. That's fraud. Her admission about taking half your assets shows intent. We can work with that. Jessica outlined a strategy. Get the D N A. Test. Gather financial records, especially proof of assets I had before marriage. Secure valuables and Irreplaceable items. Find new housing. Most importantly, don't tip your hand. Let her think she's winning, Jessica advised. The more complacent she is, the better. Three days later, the DNA test confirmed what I already knew. The baby wasn't mine. I spent the next week securing my most important documents and possessions in a storage unit, researching apartments, and meticulously documenting our finances. Our home was mostly purchased with money from my software business that had sold before we married. Premarital asset. Jessica confirmed. This would be critical, she advised, urging me to gather all documentation showing the source of the down payment and mortgage payments. One week later, while Vanessa was at her postnatal checkup with her mother, I executed the plan. The movers arrived at 9:00am sharp, efficiently packing my pre marriage furniture and personal belongings. By 11:00, they were gone. I had my name removed from all utilities, left the divorce papers on the dining table with a note, all communication through my attorney, and drove to my new apartment. The sense of calm was surreal. Not the reaction she expected, I'm sure. Update 1 72 hours later. Well, it's been a ride. Thanks for the comments and DMs. Good to know I'm not completely off my rocker for reacting the way I did. 72 hours refers to when I'm writing this. The main confrontation happened Wednesday afternoon, same day as the birth certificate discovery. Vanessa returned home from her appointment around two PM. According to our Neighbour Ted, who texted me. There was a lot of screaming about 15 minutes later. Then the barrage began. 21 missed calls, 31 texts, all blocked. I read a few before blocking her. What the hell did you do? You can't just leave like this. This isn't how we're supposed to handle this. You were supposed to stay and support us or pay from afar, not fight. You'll regret this.

Like, I have no idea what's going on. That I met somebody? That's ridiculous. Well, at this point, after a week and you're not talking to me and you literally won't respond to me, my mind is going kind of crazy right now. Like, I want us to be okay. Like, I wanna fix it.

You say you care, but actions speak louder than words. Well, what. What are you talk? Like, what did I do? Like, can. Can we at least start there? Like, what. What I did wrong? Like, can we talk about that? Because right now I have nothing to go on. Is it because I called your friend hot? I didn't mean she was hot. I just. We were talking about how she's single, and I just meant that she's like. I was surprised at that. I was, like, trying to give her a compliment. I Didn't mean. I didn't even mean it like that. It was just the price. Like, I didn't mean for, like, me or anything. Like, I want to know. No, that's not the reason why. Well, you're just so clueless. Well, then clue me in. Maybe you need to open up your ears and pay attention to me more. Well, I would work on that. I will work on that. Like I said, I'm not. I'm not perfect. You know, I. I know sometimes I like space out, but I'll. I'll work on that. You still have no idea what I'm talking about. No, I don't. I have no idea. Okay, fine, I'll tell you. But are you actually gonna listen? Of course. Are you sure you're not playing Candy Crush right now on your phone? Yes, I'm sure. Is that the problem? That I play Candy Crush too much? Do you remember when we were at your house? Yeah. And we were sitting on the couch. Yes. And I was talking to you. Yes, I remember that. Do you remember what we were talking about? I know that we were talking about what we're gonna do for dinner. No, after that.

When I turned 12, my mom handed me a credit card with my name on it. Not for emergencies, for groceries. She sat me down at our kitchen table with this massive stack of manufacturer coupon she'd been collecting and said, you're smart enough to handle the shopping now. I trust you more than myself with money. At first, I felt so incredibly grown up, walking through Walmart alone every Tuesday and Friday, pushing a full sized cart while other kids my age were begging their parents for candy. They'd stare at me like I was some kind of alien. The cashiers all knew me by name within a month. Back again, honey, Linda would say, automatically helping me reach the heavy detergent bottles on the top shelf. She started setting aside the markdown meat for me when it was about to expire. I Learned which cereals had the best protein to cost ratio, how to spot when the rotisserie chickens were about to be discount wanted. I could stretch $80 into two full weeks of meals for our family of four, and I was genuinely proud of it. I had this whole elaborate system. Mondays, I'd plan the weekly menu based on store flyers and whatever coupons we had. Tuesdays, I'd hit Walmart for the bulk items and household essentials. Fridays, I'd go to the smaller grocery store for fresh produce and whatever we'd run out of during the Week, their parents would see me in the cereal aisle comparing unit prices with a calculator, and they do these obvious double takes. One woman actually followed me around the store for 20 minutes, then approached me by the checkout. Sweetie, are you shopping for your family? She asked really gently. When I nodded and showed her my organized list with meal plans written in the margins, she looked absolutely horrified. She asked if my parents were okay, if there was an adult she could call for me. I just told her what mom always said, that I was mature for my age, and this was a good life experience that would serve me well as an adult. During parent teacher conferences in October, my teacher mentioned how I always ate the free breakfast at school, even though we technically weren't on the reduced lunch program. She's incredibly responsible for her age.

To collect your child. My eight year old son, Jake, discovered the school's dress code loophole and exploited it like a tiny lawyer. Our elementary school had this super strict uniform policy. Navy pants, white polo shirts, black shoes only. No exceptions. The principal, missus Rodriguez, was notorious for sending kids home over the tiniest violations. Last month, Jake got in trouble for wearing sneakers with white stripes instead of solid black. I had to leave work to bring him new shoes. The week before that, his polo had a microscopic logo with which apparently violated the no brand markings rule. Another trip to school. I was getting fed up with these constant calls. Especially since I work hourly and can't afford to keep leaving. That's when Jake, being the smart kid he is, actually read the student handbook they gave us at the beginning of the year. Tuesday morning I got the call. Hi, this is the school office. You need to come pick up Jake immediately. There's been a dress code situation. I sighed, grabbed my keys, and drove over, expecting another tiny violation. But when I walked into the principal's office, I couldn't believe what I saw. My son was sitting there in the most ridiculous outfit I'd ever seen. He had on navy blue swim trunks, a white polo shirt that was clearly meant for a grown man, and black cowboy boots that came up to his Knees. He looked like a tiny businessman who'd gotten dressed in the dark. Missus Rodriguez looked absolutely defeated. Your son claims this outfit follows all dress code requirements. Jake grinned and pulled out a crumpled copy of the handbook. Mom, look what I found! It says Navy pants or navy bottoms. I'm trunks are navy bottoms. It says white polo shirt but doesn't specify the size. And it says black shoes with no height restrictions. I tried so hard not to laugh. Where did you even get these clothes? Dad's closet and grandpa's garage, he said proudly. I measured everything this morning to make sure it was the right colors. Missus Rodriguez cleared her throat. While technically correct, this clearly violates the spirit of the dress code policy. That's when Jake hit her with the real kicker. He flipped to another page and

What's the most embarrassing situation where you've been mistaken for your twin? When my sister Tracy and I were born, our parents dressed us differently so they could tell us apart. As we grew older, we embraced being identical by pulling harmless pranks like switching seats in class or pretending to be each other at the mall. But everything changed senior year when Tracy started dating our high school star football player, Noah. I never liked Noah. He had this arrogant smirk and treated everyone like they were beneath him. He'd shove freshmen into lockers and mock the band kids during lunch. Tracy insisted he was different when they were alone, but I saw how he'd grab her arm too roughly when she talked to other guys. One night, Tracy came home with tears streaming down her face. Her sleeve was pulled up, revealing finger shaped bruises. Noah had gotten jealous when she was assigned a male lab partner. She begged me not to tell her parents, saying it was a one time thing. He'd apologized, bought her flowers, promised it would never happen again. But it did happen again and again. Each time, Tracy had a new excuse. I fell during cheerleading. I bumped into a door. I watched my confident, bubbly sister become a shell of herself. She stopped wearing her favorite crop tops, started flinching at loud noises, and came homecoming night. Tracy was supposed to go with Noah, but she had a 102 degree Fever. Our parents insisted she stay home. That's when I had an idea. I put on her dress, styled my hair exactly like hers, and went to the dance instead. Noah was waiting by the punch bowl.

My dog, Luna, trained me to wake up at exactly 2:47 a m. Every night to let her out. And that's how I discovered my husband was poisoning me. It started when Luna was a puppy. She had the tiniest bladder and would wine at my side of the bed at the same time every night for three years. My internal clock became so precise that I'd wake up seconds before her whining started. My husband and Jake always slept through it. Heavy sleeper. He'd mumble in the morning. Lucky me. Luna would do her business quickly. Then we'd both go back to bed. It became our routine. One night, I woke up at 2:47 as usual, but Luna wasn't there. I found her in the kitchen, standing perfectly still, staring at Jake. He was at the counter with his back to me, stirring something into a glass of water. Honey, I whispered. You okay? He spun around, nearly dropping the glass. Oh, you scared me. Just getting some water. Go back to bed. But Luna wouldn't move. She kept staring at him with this intense focus I'd never seen before. Her tail was low, ears back. Not scared. Alert. What's in the glass? I asked. Just water and some antacid. My stomach's been bothering me. He drank it quickly and headed back to bed. Luna followed me upstairs, but she kept looking back at the kitchen. The next night, same Routine. I woke up at 2:47, but again, Luna wasn't by the bed. I found them in the same positions. Jake at the counter, Luna watching. This time, I stayed hidden in the doorway. Jake was crushing something with the back of a spoon. Grape powder, into a glass. He filled it with water from the tap and stirred. Then he opened the fridge and pulled out the pitcher of filtered water I drank from every morning. The pitcher I always refilled before bed. He poured the powder mixture into my water pitcher. My blood went cold. I crept back upstairs, mind racing. Luna followed silently. I've been feeling sick for months. Dizzy spells, nausea, constant fatigue. My doctor ran tests but found nothing wrong. Probably stress, she'd said. Maybe depression. Jake had been so caring, bringing me breakfast in bed when I felt too weak to get up, making sure I stayed hydrated. Drink your water, babe. You need fluids. The next morning, I pretended to drink from the pitcher, but poured it down the sink when he wasn't looking. By afternoon, I felt better than I had in weeks. That night, I set my phone to record and hit it on the kitchen counter. At 2:47, Luna and I crept downstairs. Same scene. Jake crushing pills, mixing powder, contaminating my water. This time, I could see the pill bottle. Ambien. My prescription sleep aids that I'd stopped taking months ago because they made me too groggy. But the Bottle was still full. I checked last week. He'd been refilling it, getting extra pills somehow. Crushing them into my water. Every night while I slept. I watched him pour the mixture into my pitcher, then add something else. A small. A vial of clear liquid. My hands shook as I filmed Luna pressed against my leg, solid and warm. Jake sealed the vial and tucked it behind the coffee maker. Then he rinsed the glass and spoon, wiping everything clean. After, he went upstairs. Retrieve the vial. No label. I photographed everything and took the vial to hide in my car. The next day, I called my doctor. I need a blood test. Test for everything. She found traces of zolpidem and ethylene glycol in my system. Sleeping pills and antifreeze. This is attempted murder, she said quietly. We need to call the police. I'd been slowly dying for months. Symptoms? Dizziness, nausea, confusion, or textbook antifreeze poisoning. Jake had been increasing the dose gradually, making it look like a mysterious illness. The life insurance policy he'd convinced me to increase six months ago suddenly made sense. Police arrested Jake that evening. They found more vials hidden in his toolbox in the garage. Enough antifreeze to kill me three times over. In his phone, they discovered internet searches. How long does antifreeze poisoning take? Undetectable poisons, life insurance waiting periods. He'd been planning this for over a year. Luna had known something was wrong long before I did. Dogs, Can smell chemical changes in their owners. She'd been trying to protect me the only way she knew how. By making sure I was awake when he was poisoning me.

My six year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances. Perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table last Thanksgiving, Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine. Comments about how mom's stuffing has too much salt this year. Mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls. Makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. Jake, still taking those little classes? When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about Dad's old truck in the driveway, saying it was embarrassing. The whole time, my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey and Watching Tyler's Jake's six year old son. Super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on a roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown. Really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy, okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes, and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

She did tell us about your date. I would love to hear from your words though. What did you think of Louise? I kind of felt bad for her. Oh, really? Why? You know, like, maybe she needed more then I could give her. What do you mean? Right now? In my life? Yeah. What do you. What do you mean by that? Like, I. I don't know what her situation is, which is why I'm trying to be careful with what I say, cause I don't want to misrepresent her. What do you. What do you mean what her situation is? Okay, so I show up to brunch, and I like a brunch date because it's a lot less pressure and it's during the day. Uh huh. You get to sort of see people when they're just being normal. And so she shows up and she looks like she has not gone to sleep. Then, you know, she like, basically didn't go to sleep all night. Yeah, right. Um, she smelled very strongly of alcohol and, uh, she was pretty disheveled, like. And I don't think people need to dress up for a brunch date, but I can't really explain it, but it was like the farthest away from being dressed up you could possibly be. The farthest away. Like, she barely put on clothes. Yeah, I mean, no, she had clothes on, but it looked Like, they had. Maybe she had had them on for a couple of days. Got it. Okay. All right. Your first impression was not a good one, is what you're saying. It was not a good one. So we. We. We're having brunch, and she's just in a bad mood. It seems like she's arguing with me about stuff and kind of put me on the defense. And so it was just kind of awkward. And then when the food came, she just carved it down in silence. Um. Oh, man. So then we sort of just decided that was it, and. And walked out, and we went our separate ways. And I saw her walk around the side of the restaurant and throw up in a trash can. Oh. Oh, god. Not a good look. Usually, yeah, that's the lasting impression. And. Well, that's not it. And then she got into the back seat of a car with no one else in it, and. And I think just, like, laid down in the backseat of a car. What? And so that's why I was like, does she live in her car? Um, maybe that was her house. Yeah, her house was just parked in the parking lot of the restaurant. Oh, no. Yeah. And so that's why I'm trying to be sensitive about it, because I don't know if she. Oh. Is homeless. You actually think she's homeless? I thought you were just, like, making an analogy or something. I mean, the evidence just kept piling up. I mean, I think she might actually be homeless. Yeah, pretty much. What you described sounds like a homeless person. Right? You know, if she was arguing with an imaginary friend, then you could be sure she was homeless. But what you describe does sound like a homeless person. Down. Yeah. Oh, man. Just a bad attitude. Angry, smelly, dirty. And then sleeping in her car. Yeah, it's like. I don't judge her. We've all. We've all got our. Our problems in our lives. I just. I feel like I can't help somebody through a situation like that. Uh huh. Before even knowing them, you know, romantically, at all. So I feel like it's. It's like it was a little too much for me. And how do you explain that to someone? Like, do you say like, hey, I don't wanna date you cause you're homeless? Exactly. Because. And I. I should have said something, but I didn't because I just didn't really know what to say. I think it's good you didn't. Well, I don't know if she's got a home or not, but she does have a cell phone. And I know that because she's actually on the other line and wants to talk to you. Oh, god, really? Yep. Louise, are you still there? Oh my god.

Hi, is Jay there? Yeah, this is Jay. Who's this? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. How are you? Wait, from the radio show? Yeah. What's up, man? How are you? I'm doing okay. What's up with you? Not much, I'm just chilling. I wanted to give you a call because we actually received an email about you. About me? Yeah. It's from a girl that you went out on a date with. Are you serious right now? I am. Her name is Melissa. Do you remember going on a date with Melissa? Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I do. Alright. I figured she'd probably be easy to remember because she licked a shoe, a bowling shoe, while you guys are out. She told you that? Yes, she did. We actually talked to her about your date and she's confused because she's been trying to get a hold of you for a second date, but you're not calling her back. Oh, man. Yo, I can't believe she told you about the shoe. Yeah, you can't either. She did. I. Hey, I can't believe she admitted to doing that either, man. That was crazy. I would. I would have told nobody that ever. You're the one that dared her to lick the shoe. You've got to take some responsibility. Yeah, but I didn't tell her to go tell anybody about it. Yeah, that's like something you, you know, take to your grave, right? I almost accidentally lit Inside the hole of a bowling ball. But I was scared she might actually do it. Yeah, dude, I think. Yeah, I think you stopped at the appropriate time. Or maybe actually I think it went too far, but yeah, up in the auntie. But we stopped right there. Wow. Um, so what's the reason you're not calling her back? Do you not want to see her again? Let's just put it like this. I date my fair share of ladies and certain things are red flags. And I can tell pretty easily when I can and can't trust somebody. Okay, wait, so you're saying you don't think you can trust her? No, I couldn't trust any fart I could throw up. Why do you say that? Because what happened at the bowling alley. You can't trust her cause she licked a shoe? I would think, hey, if I dare somebody to lick a shoe and they did it, they would have all my trust. You know what? She got points for that. She was doing good up until this other moment that happened and maybe changed my entire perspective on her. What? What happened? Alright, so we would close it out. We're about to get out of it. Uh huh. And she ran to the bathroom real quick. Okay. You know. And I said, okay, cool. I'm gonna go take your shoes and check them back in with the front desk. So as I'm dropping the shoes off the Cashier guy leans into it and say, hey, you know, that's your girlfriend or whatever. I'm like, no, like, not. I know, like, not yet. You know, I was kind of joking with him, and he was like, well, she might be dodging a bullet, man, so. What are you talking about? Whoa. So he then tells me he was watching us bowl the whole time, and while. And while I was setting up my shot, he saw her pick up my phone. It actually started going through my phone. What? What? No. And exactly how could he tell that that was your phone from all the way back at the bowling desk? No, he said he saw her do it five or six times, but only did it while my back was turned. Oh, what? Really? Dang, that is sketchy. And you didn't, like, think to ask her about it or anything? It was the first date. If it was a girlfriend, cool. We can have it out right then there. But the first date is you already going through my phone? Yeah. Uh, uh, uh. So you believe this dude that you don't know who said she was going through your phone? Yeah. Hell, yeah. If. If anything, he was looking out for me. Yeah, it's the unwritten rule. Guys look out for guys, and he helped me dodge this bullet. Wow. Okay. She just seemed so. I mean, she seemed really cool when we talked. To her. You don't think that there could be another explanation? Like she accidentally picked up your phone instead of hers five or six times, and only when my back is turned? No, what she did is some straight shady, and I don't need that in my life. I'm curious if she was actually going through your phone, though. I want to know the answer to that and why. I don't need to know that. I mean, she did it on the first date. What do you think will happen on the second or the third or the fourth? Well, I just say that because I want to ask her. And I forgot to let you know that she's actually on the other line listening to this conversation. Yo. No way. Melissa? Melissa, you still there? Hey, there she is. Hi, Jay. Oh, my gosh.

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day, my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello? Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce, I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple extra Expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with, so I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line. So I ran up by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why don't wait? Till you get home, you check the email, you call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria. Because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

Oh my god, no! So freaking out for you right now. Oh my god. How the did you get this number? I have a different number. I changed my number. Yeah, he told us that. Actually, he got your number now because apparently he hit up one of your friends on Facebook and they gave him your new number. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, I don't know which friend it is. We need to find that out. You need to block them. I cannot believe someone would give my number out without even asking me. So I'm gonna take a shot in the dark here and just guess that you don't like Craig very much. That's a good guess. Yes. Is there a reason why? I don't know what you know already, but I met him at an antique store and he was there cause he, I guess, also likes antiques. Uh huh. But the entire conversation, I wish that I can remember word for word what exactly he said, but it was so, so strange. He would ask me about like, previous relationships were like. And I'd be like, well, this is kind of what has happened in my life. And he's like, well, when I'm your boyfriend, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Not like if I was your boyfriend, but when I'm your boyfriend. And I was like, okay, that's a little. It's too intense for me. Especially within the first half hour of meeting someone Jennifer, that's the power of positive thinking. No, you say you're already doing it, and you'll do it. It'll happen. Why did. Yeah, why didn't you run just then? I mean, just. Even those words alone are enough to be a trigger point for me. It was a trigger for me. And he reached out to me over 70 times through text and Facebook. And then I disconnected my number so that he couldn't get to me through my phone number anymore. Over 70 times? Oh my god. Over 70 times. How long? What time spent are we talking about? Just like a couple days. This was. This was over the entire year. It doesn't matter. That's 70 messages? Yeah. Over the course of a year, all ignored. That you never replied to? Nope. Not a single reply. What did you do when you saw him in the bar? I would have pissed myself. Well, I heard his voice first and I instantly knew who it was. He was behind me and he said, hey, Jennifer. And I was like literally hit of my stomach dropped out cause I knew it was him. And I turned around and I didn't know what to do. I'm sure my face was pure shock. Oh my god. And terror. Oh my god. Cause I didn't know what to do, so I just said hi. And then he sat down next to me and he sat there for almost an hour talking to me. Yeah, right. And then luckily, I was meeting someone and they showed up and we left and went to a different place. Yeah, cause it's not like you can just leave the bar. He's gonna follow you. And then that's even creepier cause you're in a back alley somewhere with him. Exactly. Here's my question, though, Jennifer. Why did you give him your number again? That's a good one. Oh, yeah, Jennifer. Well, I didn't know what to do because I felt like those sorts of situations, I'm very uncomfortable because I hate to say no to people. So I was like, I'm gonna see him again. Is it gonna be more awkward if I don't give him my number and, like, in I turn him down at this bar in front of everyone? Or should I just, like, give him my number and then avoid him like I did last time and disregard the situation? Which is probably not the healthiest approach, but I wasn't sure what to do. Hey, I don't blame you. Whatever you needed to do to get out of it, I am fully supportive of you. So basically, he's a weirdo who loves himself some Jennifer, and Jennifer does not love herself some Craig. No, I do not love myself from Craig. Jennifer, I need to let you know he is on the other line listening to this conversation. Sorry, what? And he wants to talk to you, but. Oh, my god.

What's going on? Does that story about meeting a guy named Philip a year ago at a karaoke night sound familiar to you? How do you know about Phil? Oh, Phil and I go way back. Yeah, I've known him for longer than you have. Phil is. Is back in town. I. You don't know this, but Phil didn't call you after you met because he was leaving to go overseas in the armed services. Oh, my gosh. He was overseas? Mm hmm. But he has emailed us and asked us to get a hold of you. Why? Because he says that he really connected with you that night a year ago. And now you don't know this, but in his words, he said he's thought about you the entire time, and now he's back and he wanted to get a hold of you. Did you like Philip? I, um. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. This is so cute. This sounds awesome. She's excited. What did you think when Philip Didn't call you back the next day after you met him? Wow. Um. I mean, this is, like, cheesy to say, but it kind of broke my heart. Really? Really. You know, have you ever to have those moments in life where you, like, this is big. This is super important. This is like magic right now? Yeah, and it was. And then I never heard from him again, and it was like it had been a dream or something. Okay, so let's see. Where are you at now? So, Philip has been gone a year, he's back in town, and he wants to get a hold of you. Wow. I wish I had done. I spent, like, four months pining over this one evening. But then a couple months ago, I. A friend set me up with a friend, and I've been seeing him for a couple of months. Yeah, but how serious is it? I mean, we're only a couple months in, and you're obviously, like. Pining over a guy for four months is crazy. After one night. Yeah. A guy that you met on one night you have no idea about. But you've been seeing somebody for a little while? Yeah, I have. I've got a boyfriend. Okay. But there's something so powerful that's happening here. So you have a boyfriend? Yeah. Okay. Now, do you want to talk to Philip at all? Um, I don't know. I asked the question because Philip is actually on the Other line. Right now. What? Oh, yeah.

She'd slipped on some water and couldn't move her leg. Before I could even process what was happening, Pete had already called 9 1 1. He rattled off our address, my wife's symptoms, and even mentioned her previous back surgery. Then he grabbed our first aid kit and started checking her vitals, talking to her calmly the whole time. When I asked how he knew what to do, he shrugged and said, been taking EMT classes at night. Figured with you being a cop, sir, you'd want your daughter dating someone who could handle emergencies. The ambulance came, and as they loaded my wife in, Pete handed me a folded piece of paper. It was a list of my wife's medications and allergies that my daughter had mentioned once, months ago. He'd remember them all at the hospital. While we waited for the surgery results, I finally asked him, why didn't you ever tell me about the EMT classes? He looked me straight in the eye and said, because I'm not doing it to impress you, sir. I'm doing it for her. That's when it clicked. All those weekends of brutal chores, my intimidation tactics, constant tests. This kid wasn't trying to prove himself to me. He was proving himself to himself. Making sure he was worthy of my daughter. Two years later, when he asked for my blessing to propose, I didn't hesitate. But I did make Him help me build a wedding arch from scratch. Old habits die hard.

I wanna know who sent it. I see. Okay. What did the text say? Can you. Can you say it on the air? Yeah, I mean, it said something, you know? So my wife just straight up asked me if that was a hickey on my neck. We need to be more careful. Oh, wow. So. Okay, so not really open to much interpretation there. That sounds pretty bad then. Yeah, I mean, it kind of sounds like something I already suspected a little bit, which, you know, I. I think she might be messing around. Okay. What is your wife's name? Alicia. Alright. And how long have you guys been married? Seven years. Seven years? Just seven year itch, right? Isn't that what they call it? Yeah, I guess. I thought that was the thing husbands got, not wives. But you know, I. I mean, I guess it goes both ways. Okay, so what do you want us to do? Well, basically I just want you find out who that text was from. Because personally, I think I have a pretty good idea, but I don't have any proof. Okay, who do you. But I want that proof. Alright. Who do you think it's from? Well, I was a part of this neighborhood play group with parents and toddlers, and there's. There's like four moms in it, but there's also one dad. And the big joke is that the dad is like you, Know, the stud of the neighborhood? Cause he's young and good looking and, you know, the rest of the dads are all at their job. So this guy spends half of his time with our watch. So this guy doesn't have a job of his own? No, he doesn't. But he's. He's a lawyer, so, you know, I guess he only works a few days a week. Okay, I gotcha. So you think maybe this playgroup daddy is making moves with your wife then? Maybe. You think maybe she's having a few playdates of their own? I mean, that's my best guess. Yeah, but you want proof? Yeah, if you think you can get it, I want proof. Oh, we can get it. But now. But I have to ask, if we get this proof, are you thinking of doing anything like bad to this guy? Or even, I'll say illegal? You know, if you're gonna show up at this guy's house with a baseball bat or something, we can't be a part of it. Cause we're. We're still sort of part of a situation from a couple years ago where our lawyers had to bail us out. So. No, I'm not that kind of person. I just wanted to know, you know, that I. Proof of it, everything. So if she tries to lie to me about it, I can go, well, you know, stop lying, cause here's the proof. Okay, I got you. So have all your bases, Covered before you go making an accusation, then. Exact. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. You're the type of person who plays the game clue and waits to the very end to make your little guess who the murderer is, aren't you? Yeah, pretty much. Okay, so here's something we've done before that works pretty well. What we'll do is we'll text Alicia something random, and it'll say something like, hey, it's me. I got a new phone. My wife doesn't know about it, so we could talk more. And. But then we'll put in the Hickey thing. Made me nervous. Can you call me at my office real quick? I have a question. You know, I promise it'll be quick. What we'll do, though, was we'll put down our hotline number as the office number. So if and when the hotline rings, and, Natalia, this is kind of. I'm gonna cue you, okay? And what you need to do is I'll cue you and just say something like, good morning, thanks for calling. How may I direct your call? Because at that point, she's gonna say who she was calling for. At that point, Chuck, we're gonna know exactly who this is. And if it says lawyer guy, then you'll have all the evidence you need. And if you feel like you, you know, you wanna do it, you can cut in to the phone call, be like, aha! But that's up to you. Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's a great idea. But like, when are you gonna tell me when I'm on or. No, you're gonna be on the whole time, so just don't say anything until she gives us a name, okay? That part is crucial. Okay. Okay. Got it. Alright, so I'm gonna send the text now, and then as soon as the hotline rings, we're basically gonna cut the song off and pick it up live. We? How many times have we done this before? And it's usually. We used to. The joke was used to always cut off Mariah Carey songs. Used to be our joke. But anyway, so we're gonna cut the song off, we'll pick it up live. Now, do you, Natalia, do you know your line? I do. Good morning. Um, thanks. How may I direct your call? That's pretty much it. Yeah. Okay, exactly. And then we listen for the name. So. Okay, uh, everybody ready? Hands in the middle. Ready? Hands in the middle. Ready? Yes. Alright, so we're gonna do this song. I'll start texting.

What criminal actually impressed you with their criminal skills? This kid Marcus at my old high school was the ghost dealer. Everyone knew he sold weed, but nobody could prove it. Not the cops, not the principal, nobody. They searched his car weekly, tore apart his locker, even brought drug dogs to school three different times. Nothing. Marcus would just smile and wave like he was running for student council. Kids would get caught with weed and straight up say, I bought it from Marcus. He'd actually encourage them to tell the truth. Yeah, tell them I sold it to you. See what happens. Still couldn't catch him. The administration went nuclear. They installed motion sensors in his locker, had teachers follow him between classes. Principal Johnson even called Marcus's mom, thinking maybe she'd cooperate. She laughed and said, good luck catching him. Kids smarter than all of us. Marcus was this weird combination of obvious and invisible. He'd wear tie dye shirts and listen to reggae music in the hallways. Everyone knew what he was about. But he was also in honors classes, tutored kids after school, and helped organize charity drives. Security caught Marcus talking to Tommy Rodriguez in the bathroom. Tommy walks out with weed five minutes later. They search Marcus immediately. Really? Nothing? Marcus explains he was just borrowing a pencil, shows them the pencil in his pocket. Tommy backs up his story perfectly. They saw Marcus hand something to Sarah Chen by the vending Machines looked exactly like a drug deal. They searched both kids, found nothing on Marcus. Sarah had a granola bar. The principal was convinced the granola bar was somehow involved and had it tested at the police lab. Cost the school $800. It was just a regular granola bar. Marcus started leaving notes in his locker for investigators. Thanks for keeping my stuff organized. And did you find my secret yet? Keep looking. The janitor found them hilarious. Principal Johnson did not. They brought in a police dog named Rex. This dog had found drugs in cars, houses, everywhere. Rex sniffed Marcus's backpack, locker, car, even his shoes. Rex found nothing. The dog handler was embarrassed. Marcus threw a party when Rex visited. Made a sign that said Welcome Rex and brought dog treats. Ex loved Marcus and wouldn't even search properly because he wanted to play fetch. The school tried everything. They made Marcus empty his pockets before entering, searched his car in the parking lot during class. Even had a teacher accidentally bump into him to see if anything fell out. Marcus would cooperate with everything. He'd spread his arms wide during searches and say, check every

I'm sitting in chemistry, totally spacing out about the test next period, when Mrs. Rodriguez suddenly stops mid sentence about atomic bonds or whatever. She's staring at her phone with this look I've never seen before. Pure horror. Then the intercom crackles. Principal Martinez's voice sounds weird, like he's been crying. All students report to homeroom immediately. Teachers, please check your emergency email protocol now. Everyone's looking around, confused. Used it's Wednesday, second period. Nothing ever happens on Wednesday. My friend Jake whispers bomb threat, but Mrs. Rodriguez is already ushering us out. I get to homeroom, and Mr. Davis looks like he's about to throw up. His hands are shaking as he reads something on his computer screen. He won't make eye contact with any of us. Everyone pack your belongings. School is dismissed for the remainder of the day and tomorrow. What? Why? Melissa asks. I can't just go home. Your parents are being contacted. Walking outside, I count eight police cars in the parking lot. There's also this big white van that says county health department and people in hazmat suits walking toward the building. I immediately text my mom. School closed early, sending everyone home. And before I can even put my phone away, she's calling. Sweetie, where are you right now? Walking home from school. What's going on? Come straight here. Don't stop anywhere. Don't talk to anyone. My mom never sounds scared like this. Ever. I Practically run the rest of the way home. She's pacing in our kitchen, still in her work clothes, which is weird because she never comes home before 5. Sit down. I need to tell you something before you see it on the news or social media.

I didn't tell anyone I was returning. I wanted to surprise Miguel. When I arrived on our street, I saw several cars parked in front of our house. The garden was decorated with blue and pink balloons. A banner read welcome our little miracle. I parked my car a street away and walked over. The door was slightly open. Music and laughter spilled from inside. When I stepped in, I froze in the middle of the living room. Carmen, my best friend, was visibly six months pregnant. My mother in law, Rosa, was gently stroking her belly while my mother served drinks. Gifts were stacked on a decorated table. So is the nursery ready? My aunt Elena asked. Almost, Carmen replied. Miguel insisted on painting it himself. He's been working on it every weekend. At that moment, my husband walked in, carrying more drinks. He approached Carmen and hugged her from behind, placing his hands on her belly. We just need to set up the crib. We picked it out together last week. I watched as my mother stiffened upon seeing me. She quickly walked over. Anna, we weren't expecting you today, she whispered, grabbing my arm. Let's go outside. We need to talk. I pulled away from her grasp. Talk about what? About how my husband got my best friend pregnant while I was working in another country. The I I chatter in the room died down. Carmen was the first To notice me. Her face turned pale. Miguel stood frozen, his hands still on her belly. Anna, he began, don't you dare. I cut him off. How long have you been cheating on me? No one answered. My father, standing in a corner, couldn't even look me in the eye. I can explain, Carmen said, taking a step forward. We didn't want you to find out like this. Oh? And how are you planning to tell me? After the baby was born or when they turned 18? My mother in law stepped in. Anna, please think about the baby. Carmen doesn't need this stress in her condition. Her condition? I let out a humorless laugh. The same condition I was in two years ago when I lost my baby. Where was your concern then, Rosa? The silence that followed was deafening. My mother tried again. Honey, I know this is difficult. Difficult for whom? For me, who worked non stop for nine months while my husband was sleeping with my best friend? Or for all of you who had to keep up the charade? Miguel finally stepped away from Carmen. Anna, can we talk privately? Don't make a scene. A scene? No, Miguel. A scene would be telling everyone how you convinced me to take that overseas job. How you said we needed the money to start our family. I turned to Carmen. Did he tell you that? Or did he say he was lonely and abandoned while his cruel Wife chased her career. Carmen started crying. It wasn't like that. We didn't plan this. Of course not. I suppose you just tripped and fell pregnant by my husband. These things happen, right? The guests began shifting uncomfortably. Some grabbed their bags ready to leave. My father finally spoke up. Anna, calm down. You're upset that. No, dad, I'm perfectly calm. In fact, I'm grateful. My mother frowned, confused. Grateful? Yes. Because now I see everyone for who they really are. My husband, the liar. My best friend, the traitor. And my family, the cowards who chose to protect this lie instead of me. I walked over to the gift table and grabbed one at random. This one's yours, mom. You bought a nice gift for your son in law's mistress's baby. Anna, please! My mother pleaded. I tore the wrapping paper open. It was a white baby outfit with blue details. How thoughtful. I hope you kept the receipt. Miguel stepped forward, trying to take the gift from my hands. Enough, Anna! You're making a fool of yourself. Making a fool of myself? No, Miguel. You did that all on your own. Getting my best friend pregnant while I was paying all the bills. My mother in law stood up, outraged. This is too much! Miguel was just looking for the happiness you couldn't give him. Always busy, always working. You're right, Rosa. I was too busy working. Working to pay the mortgage on the house where your son Was sleeping with my friend. I looked around the room. Every familiar face now look like that of a stranger. You know what? You can keep the house, the furniture, the gifts. But, Miguel, I suggest you get a good job, because you won't have access to my money anymore. What are you talking about? He asked, turning pale. I'm talking about how while I was overseas, I wasn't just working. I was also consulting a lawyer. I have proof of every penny I spent on this house, on you, on our marriage.

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin, just darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the 3 p m. Shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained. When we Draw blood with these. It never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes. See? Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I nodded and started packing up when a girl raised her hand. So our textbook is wrong? The class erupted in whispers. Mrs. Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, up the state science standards on my phone. The current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? You question things and learn critical thinking? I've been Teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what colour is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards, and Lily's quiz. Principal Davis, listen carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it. Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the Truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote, excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad is This actually true or is it just a Missus Wilson truth?

Growing up, my parents only rewarded me and my siblings for one thing, telling on each other. I grew up as the middle child of four siblings, the type to be forgotten. It was like I could always see what everyone else was blind to. Cause even though my parents thought they had us in control, I was the one they were wrong about. You see, my older brother Nate would do anything for daddy's love. One time, when me and him were alone in my room together, I accidentally spilled a drop of cranberry juice on the beige carpet. I felt like a deer in headlights. Immediately, I took off my T-shirt, spit on it, and vigorously rubbed it into the material. Nate was already walking down the stairs by the time he realized what was going on. Neil just spilled his juice all over the floor upstairs. He's so clumsy. I didn't hear anything else being said, just the unmistakable sound of my dad's footsteps walking over to the nearest drawer and grabbing what sounded like the black leather whip. I didn't do anything. Just lay on my front side of my bed with a pillow in my mouth to stop myself from screaming too loudly. One, two, three. I didn't get dinner that night, and while I spent the next few hours crying into my bed sheets, I could hear Nate downstairs being treated like a king. For telling on me. You are so mature, my handsome boy, my mom said, her voice practically beaming through the house. I'm so proud of you. Our dad bellowed time. I was just four years old, while Nate was 6. That same year, our younger twin sisters were born. And that's how I ended up being raised by five surveillance cameras. My parents gave them the same treatment they gave me and Nate. They acted like the world's greatest parents until their third birthday. There, they would withhold all affection from them. No nice words, no hugs, nothing. Unless they did one thing. Start telling on each other. By the time I was 10, I have been wailed on more times than I can count. Cleaning my room properly, leaving leftover crumbs on my plate, crying too loudly, wearing clothes that showed any indication of my injuries. Meanwhile, my siblings only got it once or twice a year. Because from all the punishment, I Learned one thing. It was the last thing I wanted to inflict on my siblings. So even when I caught them doing things, I'd never tell on them. Heck, sometimes I'd even take the blame for it. And in some ways, it paid off. Like Nate and the twins always felt safest around me. But none of them returned the favour. Not once. Because there was something they loved more than me. And that was our parents. Over time, it was clear that I was getting The most amount of punishment. But instead of attributing that to my kindness towards them or the fact I was simply just a good person, everyone started seeing me as the troublemaker. Suddenly, nothing I did was ever enough. If I snore too loudly and annoyed one of my siblings, my mattress would get taken away for the rest of the week. I accidentally used Nate's Cologne instead of my own. No showering for the next three days. By the time I turned eighteen, my idea of family was so distorted that when I saw loving parents or siblings on TV, I would get angry about how fake it was. I had spent so much of my life simply surviving that when college season finally came, I literally had a GPA of 1.0. But there was one thing I knew with all my heart. There was no way I could spend another second in my home. So when it was time to move out, I paid one of my classmates to let me sleep on the floor of their dorm room. I remember being extremely stressed when his parents came over to visit for Thanksgiving. My heart was pounding for the entire week, and I made sure to be perfect. This is my parents always taught me. So when they came and I opened the door after they knocked twice instead of once, I closed my eyes super tight to brace myself for what was to come. But instead of Beating me senseless. They thanked me for opening so soon. His mom even gave me a hug. For the rest of the night, I was on my best behavior. Completely silent, tense, ready to

So in a second, we're about to call her and see if we can catch her. But first, Paul, why don't you refresh everybody's memory on your situation? We've been together three years. I'm worried she's getting back with or in a relationship with her ex boyfriend from high school. And I was hoping you guys could just pretend to be the credit card company and say she won a free flight and see who she picks. Okay. And she's going back home to visit her mom and. And I'm not going. And I'm worried that she's been really texting this guy and planning on seeing him when I'm not there. Okay. Are you ready for us to call her? Yeah. Alright man, here we go. Hello? Hi, this is global calling from. I was looking for our card holder, Leslie. This is she. Is everything okay? I'm actually calling you with some good news. Congratulations for being a card holder with us and racking up so many points and miles in travel. You've won a voucher for $600 in free travel for yourself and a companion. Oh my god! Wow, this is so cool! Thank you. So what do I do? Well, it's simple. Your voucher will go automatically into your account online. So the only thing that I would need, um, would be the name of the companion that You would take with you. Now, I can give you some time to obviously think about that, but unfortunately, they ask that we give them that information ahead of time, you know? Oh, um, okay, that's fine. Okay, great. Um, just the first and last name would be awesome. Yeah. Um, can you make it to Joel? Yes, I can get that notated on there. Would you like us to send an email to this person so that you can also, um, give them the good news with, like, a little bit of an e card type situation? Yeah, maybe. Just say that things keep getting better, and after this trip, we can go back and have the talk. I'll just read it back to you. Okay.

Hi, can I speak to Trevor, please? Yeah, this is Trevor. Hey, Trevor, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, okay, okay. Hi back. Have you ever heard of Brooke and Jubal in the morning before? Uh, yeah, I think. Okay. What do you think it is, then? It's a vote of confidence. Um, you guys are like a radio show, right? Yes, a thing. And have you ever really listened? No, not really. I know the name, though. Okay, cool. Well, that's a start. The reason I'm calling you today is because somebody who does listen to our show wanted us to call and get a hold of you. Cool. Could be cool. Could not be cool. You don't know yet? I guess not. Her name is Amy. Okay. Yeah. And Amy made you a grilled cheese sandwich. Yes, she, uh. Yes, she did. You heard about that? Yeah, she did tell us all about that. We do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. So Amy wants to know why you're not calling her back after your date. Um, it's not that I'm not call. You know this is not real. I don't Wanna. Like, it's not that I'm not calling her back, but. I'm not calling her back. Yeah, I'm not calling. No, it's just, you know, I don't wanna talk about that kind of thing. On. It was. We had a nice time. You know, it's just one of those things. Amy's the one that wants to know. I mean, we're asking on her behalf. She said she'd be willing to hear whatever it is. I don't really know how much you guys already know. Like, how much do you guys know? Well, we know that you bonded over grilled cheese sandwiches, and you went to her house and she made you grilled cheese, but at one point, she kind of burned it and then yelled at you and stormed off to her room, and somehow, somehow, somehow, you stuck around. That was fun. No, the burning wasn't the thing. Like, she freaked out, but it was, like, cute. It was funny. Wait, she. Wait. She slammed the pan down, called you an a hole, and you thought that was hysterical? No, I wasn't. I wasn't, like, dying laughing, but, like, that's not why I'm not calling back. That wasn't an issue at all. Okay, so the anger issues not a big deal with you? No, but I slept on her couch. I didn't. We didn't share a bed, so. I'm not saying that at all. Um, but before, like, she went to her room, and I was on the couch. She had some pictures on the wall, like photographs, like professionally done ones that people get. And they were of her and a guy embracing and like kissing. And these were like big pictures, these weren't like the little ones. What? Oh, did they look like engagement photos or something like that style? Yeah, like that kind of thing. Like. Like, you know, they hired a photographer to take pictures of them, like holding each other and stuff. So I was just like, what are those? And what she say? She went, oh, that's my ex fiance. Whoa. And I was just like, oh, that's weird. If she's not currently with her fiance, then it's pretty strange to have engagement photos. Yeah. Of herself on the three of them, though. Hang up. And they were big photos. Can't stress that enough. Like they were. And you would think that if you're having a first date with a guy that that would be, I don't know, something on the agenda to take down before he comes to your house. Yeah. But I was willing, I guess, kind of to laugh it off cause I am gonna sleep there. I don't want it to be like super crazy weird. Yeah. And she goes, yeah, we're still really good friends. So right there I'm like, alright, cool, I guess. And then. And then she says, I told him I would keep him up until I found someone that I could replace them with. Whoa. I was just like, oh, cool. And that's awesome how? Oh, yeah, that's you. But, like, I'm sleeping on her couch. I'm not gonna have, like, the greatest night sleep, so I would, like, wake up and then just be looking at her and this, you know, ex fiance, like, kissing and holding each other. And when you were looking at it, you weren't thinking, I hope that's me one day? No. No, I wasn't. I was thinking, I need to sleep off the few drinks that I had and get out of here. Yeah, like, really fast. Well, guys, I don't like how this is going. I'm not. I'm not into this. What's going on? Oh, Trevor, that's Amy. She's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Yeah, I've been listening to the whole thing. Hey, I've been listening to the whole thing.

Yes, and Daphne told us about how you've been messaging her, and she said that you obviously had no idea who she was because you used to make fun of her in high school, so she wanted to call you and confront you about that. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So you guys, you heard all that? Yeah, we heard all of it. Yes, we did. We heard her flirting with you, heard you send her a picture, and then heard that you thought she was dead. This is really weird. I can't believe you're so proud of your junk pick. Well, I'm still having a hard time believing that this is real. Like, what's hard to believe? You're on the radio. I'm calling you out. You used to make fun of me. I'm not dead. I'm alive! And now I have a little picture of your little. Oh, my god. Daphne, you're my new hero. Oh, my god. How's that make you feel, Josh? Uh, this is fucked up. Yeah, it is. Yeah, so it's calling somebody, Daphne, and telling them they have spaghetti sauce all over their face in high school. That was high school, man. Kids do stupid stuff. I mean, things change. People change. She looks good, Daphne. You look good. Yeah, I'm. I'm well aware of how good I look. I'm so good that you couldn't get a girl like me? She looks so good that you're willing to send her a picture of your junk right away? I bet you would have done the same thing. Go ahead. Look, she emailed the show to do an awkward Tuesday phone call, and I responded with three pictures, so. That's just how I work, though. You guys are so creepy. Real quick, I want to ask Josh, do you feel bad about the things you used to say to her in high school? I feel bad about a lot of things I did in high school. But then who does it? Yeah, that's true. That's very true. But the thing is, you haven't apologized to her once. Like. Yeah, well, these aren't, like, normal circumstances, are they? I'm on a. And radio show right now. Yeah, well, this is a perfect opportunity to apologize in front of everybody. Well, Daphne, I'm. I'm. Obviously, I was a stupid kid in high school. Uh, I'm really sorry that I Hurt your feelings back then. Um, if you would like to give me a chance, we could meet up and I could make it up to you. A what? And. And apologize to you face to face and not over the air. It'd be a lot more sincere. Um. Up to you. Oh, my god. Well, that was really heartfelt and genuine. Except. I don't know, though. Are you thinking about. What do you mean, you don't know? He just hit on you. That is so gross. What? People change. Like, look at Daphne. You've changed over the years. Just because he was a jerk in high school doesn't mean that he's still that way. He just sent her a junk pic in the first one minute of a conversation. Who doesn't do that? I'm a guy. And by the way, women do the same things. You talk to a girl for, like, two days, and it's like, hey, boobs on your phone all the sudden. That's just what people do now. That's true. This is kind of true. I mean, and I did kind of beg him for. You did? If a girl. Come on. Absolutely. If a girl was on the phone with me going, like, hey, I'm just sitting around the house. You wanna send me a picture? I'm like, yeah, obviously. So you can't really blame me, Josh. Oh, my gosh. But, Daphne, do you wanna go out with him? Then say no. Say no. I Feel bad because I set him up on the radio? Do not feel bad. And, well, he apologized. That was a really genuine apology. It'd be a funny story to tell people, you know? Might even be cool just to catch up, find out what we've been up to over the past few years. You know what I'm saying, babe? Eww. Did you just call me babe? Yeah. On second thought, looking at this photo, I'm gonna say no. Hahaha! Yeah, girl! Hahaha!

Hey, can I speak to Levi? Uh, yeah, this is him. Hey, what's up, man? How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. From what? Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Uh, oh, okay. Have you listened to the show before? I, I have not. Okay. Hey, cool. Thanks. Don't blame you, Levi. Not what? I don't even want to listen when I'm here, you know? No, no, it's not personal. I'm just not a big radio guy. Yeah, but for me it's personal, though. Anyway, let's not talk about that. Um, I want to talk to you because we got an email from one of our listeners about you. You got an email about me? Yeah, it's from a girl named Cassie. Cassie emailed you about me? Yeah, she did. We do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. So Cassie says that you had a wonderful date together, but you've kind of been blowing her off recently, and she feels like you don't want to go out again. Wait, wait, I just want to clarify. Other people have done this, right? I'm not the first guy that you've been contacted about. Does that make you feel better about the situation? If other people have done it before you? Well, I just want to make sure that, like, I'm not the first. No, but you're the best, Leila. You're not the first. We do a lot Of these. Okay, um, first of all, I just want to say that my date with Cassie was like, the best date I've ever been on. And I had a great time. And I really, really, really want to go out with her again. I'm just not ready. You're not? Why aren't you ready? Well, to be completely honest, I'm kind of broke. That first date kind of tapped me out, and I'm trying to save up enough money to take her on a second date. Oh, no, dude. Levi. Oh, man. Why are you paying for all this expensive stuff if you don't have the funds to do that? Like buying her the makeup and the shoes? Oh, she told you about all that stuff, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We talked to her about your date. She said you guys went to a really nice dinner, and then afterwards you took her to the mall and you were like, throw it in the bag, girl. Whatever you want. No, look, it's not really a big deal. Guys, I got a second. Um, I got it. I'm. I'm driving for Uber now, and so between that and my real job, I really think that, you know, it's gonna be easy to take her on dates like that. I just wasn't planning ahead cause I didn't know I was gonna meet her, you know? Did you say you just got a paper job? Wait, Levi, you took a second job in Order to take Cassie out again? Yeah. Oh, man, that is so sweet and so wrong all at the same time. Yeah, no, it's not right. I mean, look, let's be honest. What's money for if not to, like, spend it on people you like? Sounds like money for you. Should be to save it, but yeah. You realize when you go out on a date, you don't have to break the bank, right? Well, you don't know Cassie, but she's definitely worth breaking the bank. I mean, I'd even rob a bank. Not a big bank, like a small bank. Not a big bank, but a medium sized bank. That's illegal, but sweet. Yeah. If you don't have the bank, don't spend it. No, no, I get that. It's just. I think today, nowadays, it's just a nice concept to be able to take somebody out. And if I'm the one asking them out, I wanna be the one who can, like, you know, make it a date. Okay, I agree with you there. I do. I think that if you're the one that's asking, then you should be the one that treat. But she likes you for a lot of reasons. And there's a lot of other less expensive date options. And taking them to the mall. Like, you could go, I don't know, to coffee, man. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. In the dating climate nowadays, I think too many guys are content just being you. Know, typical. And I wanted to wow her. And I still want to wow her on our next date. That's the point. And this promotion that Uber's offering right now, if I give 150 rides in a three week period, I get a bonus. $500. So I was out last night until 4 in the morning giving rides to a lot of drunk people, and it was totally worth it. Dude, Levi, I think that. That is so kind, but you're missing the point. That's not how you wow a woman. It's not with money. You wowed Cassie because you listened to her, that you engaged her. You pulled a chair out for her. You made her feel respected and important.

Oh, no. Oh, wow. The oldest cliche in the book. How sad. Yeah, I know, right? You know, she's not even pretty, either. Well, they always say, like, never hire a hot nanny, right? That's what I thought, too. Okay, so what's your husband's name? Tom. Tom. Okay. What's the nanny's name? Kelly. Okay, so Tom and Kelly. All right, hang on a second. Write this down. Now, you said you think something is going on. What do you. What makes you think that? Well, at first, it was just a feeling, you know, like when you just know something's going on. Like, you have that intuition. Right? And, like, I could just tell that he liked her. And then I started noticing these little things. Like, he would be getting ready in the morning, and he seemed to dress a little nicer for work than on other days. And then I realized that the days he was dressing nicer were the same days that he was going to basically, like, relieve the nanny, you know, after work. Okay, so he was basically dressing up to look better for the nanny. Yeah. And I hate that I did this. I actually went out and got two cameras that I put up in the house, and he doesn't know that I did that. Oh, wow. Hold on. I just needed to see if I could find out anything, and. Okay, so far, I haven't seen anything. You haven't seen anything? So you went out and got nanny cams and didn't tell your husband? Yeah. I mean, I'm not gonna be the one who looks stupid if there's been something going on. No, you. You certainly are not. Okay, so what do you want us to do? I would really like to hear them talking to each other on the phone without them knowing. And I know you guys can do that. We can? Yeah. And I think the fact that you bought those nanny cams, that actually might be the perfect way to start the conversation. What. What if we have. Okay, shag, what if we have you text the nanny and be like, hey, I'm about to call you. I just found out my wife has been hiding nanny cams in her house. So you, shag, you texted ash, you text the husband and be like, I'm about to call you. Did you know your wife has been hiding nanny cams in the house? Okay, either way, Maria, when these two talk to each other, if there's something dirty going on, it's gonna come to the surface. Good. That's what I wanna find out. I just wanna know the truth. Okay, so let us send out these texts, and then when we come back, we'll do a Three Way call, and then you can listen in. Okay? Okay. Thank you.

I didn't think of that. Between the two people if they decide to go out again. Kevin is on the phone with us right now. And Kevin wants to call a girl named Simone. The interesting part about this though, is Kevin wasn't completely honest with her when they went out. He's very wealthy. His family is very wealthy. He comes from money. And usually that's a problem for him when he's dating, cause that's all that girls are interested in. Poor guy. So he tried to play it a little different this time. Kevin, you know that a lot of people are gonna be texting in going, who is he? What's his name? Even I wanna know. And I promised Kevin we wouldn't say who it is, but I can tell you, I talked to him off the air, and all he'll let me say is that his family got all their money in the tech industry. Okay. And that's it, right, Kevin? Yep. But I have confirmed it. It's legit. Kevin is a very, very wealthy man. Really? Yeah. Like very wealthy Jew? Yeah, that's what he said. Just let it go. Yes, very wealthy. Jose, I know you have problems. Paid your car payment. He has more money than you. Yes, I am, Jose. That's exact. Exactly why I Didn't want to tell this girl. Yeah, cause that's how people act towards you, right? Like, wait a minute. You're how rich? How rich? Oh, my god. Like what? Wait a minute. Like, what's your monthly paycheck? Yeah. Have you ever been turned down before, Kevin? Turned down? Yeah. Like, you know, denied another date? Like, you seem like a really nice guy, possibly handsome. I've never been turned down for anything. Ever. Nobody's ever turned me down for a date. Or when I wanted a car or when I wanted a plane or when I wanted to buy their business. No, uh, I. I guess, you know, it sounds really snobby to say, but I haven't, uh. It is really snobby. I've been the one doing the turning down, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine that. It's understandable. You have a problem that most people don't have, right? You know, I mean, you're. You're an attractive person for anybody to date, no matter what. You know, at this point, you guys are starting to scare me. I think y'all are gonna start asking me on dates. So can we just make the phone call, or. Yes, I'll make the call. I realize it is getting a little uncomfortable. We're just harping on your money now. All right, I'm gonna dial the phone number right now and see if we can get Simone on the phone. Here we go. Thank you. او hello? Hi, can I speak to Simone? Please. This is Simone. Hi, Simone. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm sorry, where did you say that you're from? Jubal? From Brooke and Jubal in the morning, the radio show. Okay, um, I'm not familiar with that show. Um. Oh, so you're the one. I don't get it. Yeah, you're not supposed to. Really. That's fine. So if you don't listen to our show, I'm calling you today because you recently went out on a date with somebody who does listen to our show, and he asked me to get a hold of you. His name is Kevin. Okay. He's texted you a few times and hasn't heard anything back. Did you not like going out with Kevin? This is just really weird that you're, I don't know, calling me and asking me about this. I understand. We make a ton of these phone calls. It's never not weird. But do you have a few minutes to tell us about your date with Kevin? I don't know. Is this gonna, I don't know, get really weird and personal? Cause I definitely don't want to do that. Get as personal as you want it to get. We're just wondering why you're not calling him back, that's all. And he's wondering why you're not calling him back. I don't know. I just guess I didn't really get the right kind of vibe from him. Was he, like, too nice? I mean, we talked To him, he sounded really nice. Maybe too nice. No, he was appropriately nice. He's the right level of nice. I just. I don't know. There's just something about him that didn't quite come across as the kind of person that I would normally want to date. Is he creepy? No, he wasn't creepy. He was sort of, um. Frumpy. Frumpy? I think. Yeah. My first impression was that he wasn't making a lot of effort for this date. So you, like, he dressed poorly? Yeah. I mean, it's not like he seemed. He hadn't washed. I don't know, like, I was wearing heels and I was wearing a really cute dress and I wanted to make a good impression and I didn't get the idea from him that was important. Is he. Were you? What? Cause I always think frumpy immediately. I think chubby. Are you not attracted to him because of his body build? No, he's cute. Not frumpy like chubby, just frumpy. Like, I threw this on and whatever. So you. You feel like he didn't put in enough effort to try to impress you? Yeah, he was very polite. It's not like he was a jerk or anything. He was a nice person. I just had this sort of feeling from him that he is not a particularly motivated person or has any sort of real kind of hustle, really. You know what? There's nothing more unattractive to me than somebody who isn't motivated. I will Agree with you on that. And so that's the vibe that you got, huh? Yeah. I mean, he just was so. He just seemed kind of vague and uninspired, and I. I have a lot of passion, and I. Other people who have a lot of passion. When he just didn't seem to have a. Yeah, you don't. You don't want to date somebody who's gonna sit on the couch and just watch Netflix all day, suck your bank account dry, right? Yeah. Yeah, I understand that completely. you wanna be with somebody who wants to make something of themselves. What is wrong with that crazy person in the background? Sorry. I'll explain to you why Jose's laughing so hard. Okay? I think I might know why you had a hard time connecting with Kevin.

Wow. Okay, so let's start off with your girlfriend. What is your girlfriend's name? Kate. Kate. Okay, so on Saturday, you were out of town? Yeah, I went on a fishing trip this past weekend with some of my buddies from college, and so I was gone the whole weekend. Okay. And this left Kate by herself? Yeah, and, well, actually, this is part of the story, too. You know, when Kate and I first started dating, we were together every day, all the time. And anytime I would go on a trip for something or work or whatever, she would ask if she could come with me. But a couple of weeks ago, when I told her I was going on this fishing trip, she just said okay. It was like it didn't bother her at all. So she used to be really clingy, but now she's kind of like, meh, fine, whatever. Yeah, and like I said, she never, ever used to be that way. Well, maybe she's just getting used to, like, you guys being, like, an exclusive couple. Like, I know I used to be that way with Kyle back when we first started dating. Now if he calls me and he's like, oh, I'm working overtime, I'm just like, okay, that's fine. Bring home Beer. Because I'm empty, so. So it's kind of like that new car smell wore off a little. I mean, I don't know if it's that so much as you just get used to things, basically, that's all. Okay, so do you think that's what it is, Dan? Maybe she's just used to you leaving. I mean, I don't know. I guess it could be. I'm not sure, but I mean, here's how I found out that she went up to dinner. So Saturday afternoon, we're out on the water. It's getting probably, I don't know, it's almost getting dark. And probably around 6 or so, I get this text message from a friend of mine. And he's like, hey, dude, is this your lady? And he sends me a picture of Kate eating dinner with this other dude. Oh, wow. Okay, so how did this friend get this pic of her? Did he take it? Yeah, he was. He was eating at the same place. Okay. Okay, I have a couple of questions. So first of all, what was she wearing? Was it like jeans and a T-shirt, or was she dressed up a little? Cause I mean, I feel like that is gonna tell us a lot about what kind of dinner this was. No, she was definitely dressed up. She had a dress on. It was a short dress, like one of those sundresses. Okay, well, where were they eating? There's that new place over on linhaven. I've been there. That's. Yeah, I took Nicole there for a date night. That is not exactly the type of place for a casual let's meet as friends kind of get together. Okay, so you get this message while you're out on the boat? Yeah. I'm surprised you had a signal. Like, so when you got it, did you call her? Did you call Kate and be like, so how's dinner going? Oh, I. I texted her and I was like, hey, I missed you. What are you doing right now? And she wrote, nothing. Just sitting on the couch, watching TV. Oh, wow. Okay. And how clear was this picture also? I mean, like, you were 100% positive it was her? Oh, yeah, definitely her. Did you recognize the guy that she was with? No. I mean, that's why I called you guys. Okay, so you would like to know who this other guy was then? Yeah, I wanna know who he is and why she felt like she had to lie to me about it. Okay, yeah, that. That's an important part of this too. Cause even if we find out, then, like, maybe she says it was just a friend. Well, then why did you feel like you had to lie about it? And why did you get all dressed up then? Like, I. I wish I could actually see this picture, like, what she's wearing. And if we. If we give you Ashley's phone number when We go to commercial break. Will you text her the picture while we go to break so she can kind of do her thing? Yes. Can you send me a copy so I can do my detective work and carefully analyse what I think is going on? Yeah, I can do that. Okay, so when we come back, we'll get Kate on the phone with us, and we'll try to figure out who this guy was and what the whole deception was about. Give me the sneaky music, because here was our plan of action. We decided it would be best to text Kate. Kate is the girlfriend. And pretend to be the guy who took her to the restaurant. So we texted Kate. We have her number. Pretending to be the dude who took her to the restaurant. This is going to get good. So, Ashley, start with the conversation from the beginning that you had with Kate. Okay, so the first thing I said was, hey, it's me. Just got a new phone, so that's why the number is different. By the way, a buddy of mine asked if we like that place I took to. I took you on Saturday. I told him I liked it, and he wanted to know if you did. And then she wrote back, loved it. Okay, so this establishes that it was the other good dude. We're trying to pretend to be him. Yeah. Here's where it gets good. Okay, so I wrote back, did you think it was romantic? And she wrote, yes. Then I wrote this. I said, my friend said, ask her if it's the type of place where if I took a girl, she would sleep with me. And she wrote back, well, it worked for you, didn't it? And then she put the little winky face with the tongue out. Okay. And when she sent that message, it was all, like, in the studio, it was all kind of quiet. And then Ashley goes, oh, my god. And so we're all like, what? And then she showed us. Yeah, so whoever this guy is, it looks like she slept with him, too. And that's the bad news that we just shared off the air with Dan. So we just asked Dan if you wanted us to call her, and, Dan, you said no, correct? I mean, I don't know. I don't really see the point now. Well, okay, here's why I think we should still do it. First of all, we still don't know who this guy is. Second, you. Do you think you're probably gonna dump her after this? I mean, there's no probably about it. Okay, then if you're gonna dump her anyways, I say we do it on the air as, like, a payback. But again, it's totally up to you. We don't have to do anything.

Like, those are things that you normally talk about, like what your parents do. I mean, maybe that's why it was so awkward, cause we didn't think to use those conversation starters. Yeah. Wow. Did you know the whole time? Sean? Did you know that she was your cousin? And you just hope she wouldn't find out? No. Gross.

What is wrong with you? Yeah, it's probably not the best complimenting her. Like, that's probably not the best thing to do. I'm just being honest, all right? It's good to compliment people. No. Yeah.

No, I don't think we're allowed to. No. No. I said no. Obviously. I never wanna see him again. Just for the record, Jessica, I feel horrible about this. And, you know, if you wanna meet up over coffee or something and talk about it, I'm down. I don't wanna meet up with you. No, I don't ever want to see you again. Oh, my god. They dressed Amber.

Yeah, yeah, I am. I just wanna know, like, of all the guys that I've dated, why is it this guy that's not calling me back? What reason does he have? Well, I'm gonna dial the phone number right now and get him on the phone and see if we can find out why. Okay, sounds good. Hello? Hi, can I speak to Jimmy, please? Yeah, this is Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning, the radio program. Why is the radio program calling me? Well, because one of our listeners actually emailed us and asked if we could get you on the phone. Her name is Amanda, and you recently took her out on a date. Oh, okay. So Amanda, holy cow. Emailed us and told us about your date, and she also said she really liked you a lot, and she's wondering why you're not calling her back. She said it's been, like, two weeks since you guys went out. She's been hoping you would call to ask her on a second date, but she's heard nothing, and she's wondering, is there. I bet she did. Whoa, what did you just say? Did you just say. I said, I bet she did. Why do you say it like that? Well, Amanda is a. Oh, boy. Amanda is, uh. She's Something else? Um. Um, we. We talked to her, just to let you know. We talked to her. She told us about meeting you. Thought it was really cool the way you are. I'm sure she did. Um, did you just. She didn't sound like anything that. I mean, you. Can I say, man? Can I say she's a real pisser on the air? Pisser? Sure. What do you mean by that? Like, she had a, like, problems? She's a nightmare. She's a nightmare. Did you say, she's a nightmare? She's a nightmare. Why is she a nightmare? Well, what did she tell you? She just said you guys went out to dinner and had some good conversation, ended the date with a kiss on the cheek, and she was hoping to hear from you again. That's it? Pretty much it, yeah. Well, let's look, okay? Amanda is a very attractive woman, but I could tell everything about her from her food order. What do you mean? Like, she's a vegetarian, and you just can't stand those people. Like, I feel the same. Oh, it's a lot worse than that. Okay, well, what could be worse? What did she do? Just ordering food that pissed you off enough to, like, call her a pisser or whatever? Let me give you a blow by blow description. She started off by asking for bottled water. No ice, and it couldn't be tap water. She explained all this to the waiter. Why is That so offensive to you, though? Oh, that's not offensive. That was just the opening salvo. All right? It got worse from there. Then she explained that she had certain dietary restrictions, like, she couldn't eat any red meat. Okay. No gluten, no dairy, no fish that swim. What? But crab. No fish that swim. No, you know, like. Yeah, I let that sink in. So no gluten, no dairy, no fish that swim. But she's a picky eater, obviously. Yeah, I even asked her. I said, what do you mean, fish that swim? Oh, so she. And she made this little wavy motion with their hand, you know, fish that swim. I said, yeah, I know fish that swim. Don't all fish swim? No, no. You know, there's some little fish that walk around you, like. Like shrimp, lobsters. Anything with little bitty legs are okay. Is that just because she, like, has, like, an allergy or something? I. Oh, who knows? I thought you were just. I thought you were just saying it, like, as a figure of speech when you were talking fish that swims. I didn't realize that was the exact words that came out of her mouth. No, she actually said fish that swim. You know, I. I was gonna just take it at face value, but she went on to explain to me that fish that swim have a higher mercury content, and so if you eat fish that swim, you're slowly killing yourself. You sounds really upset about this. I wanted to eat a whole fish right then. Okay, so is it alright? So she's a picky eater. I've never heard the fish that swims thing before. Why not? Why not go out with her on a second date though? Was that the only bad thing? Wasn't that enough? I don't know. I mean, it's high maintenance. Okay, it's a high maintenance issue. Can I ask? Cause I'm just curious. What did she end up ordering for dinner? I don't know. Some sort of salad, of course. With water dressing. You know something about her. Water dressing. With water dressing. So we talked to her about your date and she didn't mention her dietary restrictions. But she did also say you're the only guy that has ever not called her back for a second date. You know that? Yeah. That's kind of hard for me to believe. I can't imagine all the other guys in her life have put up with that. Oh my gosh. You know what, Jimmy? Thank you for being honest with us, man. I appreciate it. No problem. And now I feel like I must be honest with you because Amanda is actually on the other line listening to this conversation. Say what?

His name is Todd. Oh, okay. Okay. Now does it make sense why I was joking around about being from the National Rifle Association? Yeah, it exactly makes sense now. So Todd told us about your date. He said that you seemed a little weirded out that he carries a gun. After talking to him, he made me feel very comfortable about it. Okay. Um, so I wasn't that nervous, but, I mean, it is a little weird to carry a concealed weapon on you, so. Yeah, Todd talked to us. He said that He really enjoyed your date and he'd love to see you again. But he feels like the fact that he brought that gun on the date turned you off.

Um, no, actually has nothing to do with guns. Hey, do you mind telling us why then, so we can pass the news along to him? Well, we were watching Titanic and that's one of my favorite movies, and towards the end. What? Yeah, we went. We were watching Titanic, he put it in and I was just like, how. How sweet. He actually likes romance. Really nice, right? And that's like a four hour movie too.

My daughter was being bullied in high school by a few other girls. More than once. They ganged up on her, slapped her around and embarrassed her. The school wouldn't do anything but make excuses. So during summer break between her freshman and sophomore year, I got her outside and taught her how to box. Gloves, punching bag, jump rope, the works. To be honest, I really didn't technically teach her how to box. I showed her how to get her wind up, keep her chin down, and taught her how to hit, how to punch through, to counter punch and put together combinations. Put her shoulder behind it and her hip into it. And she did well, before summer was over, I had the bruises to prove it. Now, don't get the wrong idea. I told her to walk away when she could. I made her promise. But if she found herself jammed up, don't just stand there and let herself get beat up. Well, once school started, it was only a few weeks before the phone rang. They told me my daughter was alright. Then right away, off to the principal's office I went. The same three girls had jumped on her again in one of the bathrooms. When I got there, the first thing I saw was two girls sitting in the outer office wearing bloody clothes. The secretary showed me right Into the principal's office, and there sat my daughter without a scratch on her

I didn't think of that. Between the two people if they decide to go out again. Kevin is on the phone with us right now. And Kevin wants to call a girl named Simone. The interesting part about this though, is Kevin wasn't completely honest with her when they went out. He's very wealthy. His family is very wealthy. He comes from money. And usually that's a problem for him when he's dating, cause that's all that girls are interested in. Poor guy. So he tried to play it a little different this time. Kevin, you know that a lot of people are gonna be texting in going, who is he? What's his name? Even I wanna know. And I promised Kevin we wouldn't say who it is, but I can tell you, I talked to him off the air, and all he'll let me say is that his family got all their money in the tech industry. Okay.

I've never been turned down for anything. Ever. Nobody's ever turned me down for a date. Or when I wanted a car or when I wanted a plane or when I wanted to buy their business. No, uh, I. I guess, you know, it sounds really snobby to say, but I haven't, uh. It is really snobby. I've been the one doing the turning down, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine that. It's understandable.

You know, at this point, you guys are starting to scare me. I think y'all are gonna start asking me on dates. So can we just make the phone call, or. Yes, I'll make the call. I realize it is getting a little uncomfortable. We're just harping on your money now. All right, I'm gonna dial the phone number right now and see if we can get Simone on the phone. Here we go.

I understand. We make a ton of these phone calls. It's never not weird. But do you have a few minutes to tell us about your date with Kevin? I don't know. Is this gonna, I don't know, get really weird and personal? Cause I definitely don't want to do that. Get as personal as you want it to get. We're just wondering why you're not calling him back, that's all. And he's wondering why you're not calling him back. I don't know. I just guess I didn't really get the right kind of vibe from him. Was he, like, too nice? I mean, we talked To him, he sounded really nice. Maybe too nice. No, he was appropriately nice. He's the right level of nice. I just. I don't know. There's just something about him that didn't quite come across as the kind of person that I would normally want to date. Is he creepy? No, he wasn't creepy. He was sort of, um. Frumpy. Frumpy? I think. Yeah. My first impression was that he wasn't making a lot of effort for this date. So you, like, he dressed poorly? Yeah. I mean, it's not like he seemed. He hadn't washed. I don't know, like, I was wearing heels and I was wearing a really cute dress and I wanted to make a good impression and I didn't get the idea from him that was important. Is he. Were you? What? Cause I always think frumpy immediately. I think chubby. Are you not attracted to him because of his body build? No, he's cute. Not frumpy like chubby, just frumpy. Like, I threw this on and whatever. So you. You feel like he didn't put in enough effort to try to impress you? Yeah, he was very polite. It's not like he was a jerk or anything. He was a nice person. I just had this sort of feeling from him that he is not a particularly motivated person or has any sort of real kind of hustle, really. You know what? There's nothing more unattractive to me than somebody who isn't motivated. I will Agree with you on that. And so that's the vibe that you got, huh? Yeah. I mean, he just was so. He just seemed kind of vague and uninspired, and I. I have a lot of passion, and I. Other people who have a lot of passion. When he just didn't seem to have a. Yeah, you don't. You don't want to date somebody who's gonna sit on the couch and just watch Netflix all day, suck your bank account dry, right? Yeah. Yeah, I understand that completely. you wanna be with somebody who wants to make something of themselves. What is wrong with that crazy person in the background? Sorry. I'll explain to you why Jose's laughing so hard. Okay? I think I might know why you had a hard time connecting with Kevin.

Private curtain rods, too. I thought the only way she would have been able to do that was to put it in the ventilation system. And when you said they got rid of that, I'm like, what? Nope. The curtain rods. Oh, my gosh. Hands down, one of the most genius revenge stories ever. Congratulations to her and her new. beautifully smelling home. What do you think the husband, ex husband, thinks when he's reading the story? Oh, god. He's. Yeah, he's pretty sad that he cheated on his wife and asked her to move out. At this point, I'm sure I bet he's never gonna Eat shellfish again? It would take somebody very smart and vindictive to pull that off. Yeah, and I'm Angela. What's your best revenge story? Okay, I've got a good one. Uh, so one of the guys that I used to date would send me inappropriate pics of himself all the time while I was at work. Uh huh. And? Yeah. And I said several times, please do not do this. And he thought it was hilarious. So he just kept sending and sending and sending. Like, while you're in a meeting or something? Yeah, yeah, it's horrible. I mean, like, I had to act like nothing was happening, and it was popping up on the face of my phone. It's ridiculous. You're telling me, like, 10:30 in the morning is not the best time to receive those kind of pictures? Are you saying Jubal? Yeah, no time is the best time, but definitely not work hours. Right. Okay. Uh, yeah. So what did you do? So. Okay, so what I did was one day when he was in the shower, I went into his phone and I changed my contact number and switched it with his mom. Shut up! That's awesome. Oh, no. So genius. He sent his mom some can pics. Oh, yeah. She found her son in a whole new way that day. What? Great idea! Oh my god, that's so smart. That's a really, really good idea. I bet he never has sent an It makes sense, no? Yeah. To anyone that actually paid it forward. To so many women. Yes. There. Oh, my god, that's so smart. Or he really enjoyed it, and then you're like, whoa! Yeah. Or the mom sent back, like, a winky face. Yeah. And now that relationship just got really strange.

It's a radio show. And I'm not calling to sell you anything. I'm calling you because I got an email about you from one of our listeners. What? Yeah. Now, are you a little interested in what I have to talk about? I mean, not really, but. What are you talking about? You recently went on a date with a girl named Tiffany, right? How do you know that? Because Tiffany emailed me and asked me if I get you on the phone and find out why you're not calling her back. She works for the radio station? No, she listens to the radio show and asked if we could call you to find out if she did something wrong on your date because she would like to see you again. So she's wondering why you're not getting back to her. I mean, I don't know if I wanna talk about that stuff on the radio or whatever. Is it. Can you. Is there anything she emailed you? She'll tell you whatever she wants. I don't really feel comfortable. Yeah, but she doesn't know. I mean, unless it's something that is your personal life an embarrassing about you, I can understand you not sharing that. But is there anything I can tell her? Just to give her some sort of advice. I mean, like, talk to her about it and you'll. You'll get a sense of why no one's gonna Go on another date with her. Well, I talked to her about your date. She told us about it. She said there was an awkward moment where she accidentally hit herself in the nose and her nose started bleeding. Um, yeah. Yeah, that was one of many incredible moments of the date. Yeah, incredible. But you. I don't think you mean incredible like an actual good thing, right? No, I mean, it is, like, the most sarcastic thing. Yeah. Well, I appreciate you staying on the phone with me for a few minutes. If your date was that bad, don't you think it'd be nice to give her some advice so that in the future when she goes out with people, it isn't as painful as an experience as it sounds like it was? She's just the weirdest person that I've ever gotten in a date with. That's insane. How so? You ever meet one of those people that just blows everything up into, like, the biggest possible deal? Like, oh, my god, the traffic was the absolute worst? Like, everything is underlined. Yeah, everything is in caps lock. Everything is just 15 exclamation points. She was like, the traffic was the absolute worst traffic I've ever been in. I take New York traffic and take LA traffic and take Mexico City traffic or whatever she said, and add them all together. That's the traffic I was just in. You believe it, and it's like, there's no way to possibly believe that. That's ridiculous. It seems like you didn't even give her a chance, though. I mean, if you're talking about. She just obviously felt bad about the traffic and was trying to make up for it. I see your point, but it was with everything. It wasn't just the traffic. It was every single element of our date. Every story, every, like, reading of the menu. Whoa! You know, like, oh, my god, they have margaritas here? Oh, my god, I love margaritas, but I wanted to be the best Margarita. And the Margarita comes, and it wasn't just, like, take a sip and like, hmm, this is pretty good. You wanna try it? It's like, oh, my god, this Margarita is amazing. I've never had a Margarita like this before. Um, I've. I've definitely been around those type of people. I know exactly the type of person you're explaining. You just pray you're not at their table, but you just hear them from the other side of the room. But, god, this is the most amazing, life change, changing Margarita you've ever had, Eric. All right. They met a shaman on the top of the hill to, like, taste the salt of the Himalayas on the rim of the drink. I tried it, and it was like, yes, it's a Margarita! It's a Margarita! Poor girl is just excited. Yes, I've had a Margarita in my life. Give her a break. You know, we. We talked to her a little. Bit Eric and I didn't get that vibe from her at all. Really? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I mean, she described the date as, like, one of the best dates she'd ever been on, and Eric was the greatest guy she'd ever met. That's true. Right. But she kept telling, like, she had a bloody nose and, like, stayed at the table and kept telling her story and was like. And then I'm just sitting there and be like, you know, do you need something? Do you need a napkin or whatever? Yeah. And she's just like, oh, my god, you're the greatest guy. You're just, like, the greatest guy. I'm like, blood coming out of your nose? Like, no, I'm not the greatest guy. I'm just a human. And I noticed somebody else with a bloody nose, and I thought I might give them something to wipe it up with. Hey, Eric, I really appreciate you giving us a little bit of information on your date, man. That's. That's awesome. That's so funny. Yeah. I mean, I'm as exhausted now as I was after the date, just thinking about it. Well, that was the most. It was like a Marathon or, like, three marathons or, like, the longest Marathon in the history of the world. Eric, I should also let you know that Tiffany is actually on the other line listening to this conversation.

Her name is Mia. And recently, Mia's husband told her, after 27 years of marriage, that he was leaving her for his new mistress. Oh, gosh, I can't imagine what that feels like. 27 years of marriage. God. He also informed her that he would be kicking her out of their house, which they had purchased together as newlyweds, and the mistress would be moving in. Out with the old, in with the new. Oh, Mia, do not lay down and take that. So Mia was obviously devastated, especially because she had raised kids in that house and made a lot of memories there. Yeah, and it's her home. That's her home, man. Not anymore. New lady's home. Mistress's home. Gross. But her husband made her a financial offer that she couldn't refuse. So she accepted the money deal and agreed to move out so that he could have the house with his mistress. All right. And on her last night in the home, Mia decided to celebrate with a huge bottle of champagne and a giant platter of shrimp caviar and oysters. Ooh, way to go, Mia. Might as well go out with the party, you know? Hello. Yeah. The next day, Mia's husband and his young mistress moved in, and things were going perfectly for about a week. Uh huh. And then something changed. Uh oh. That's when they started noticing an awful Smell? Oh, no. Throughout the entire house. Oh, what you do. It was pungent, rotten, and ammonia scented, they say. Oh, like chemically. It was in every single room of the house, too. What? And they couldn't figure out what was causing it. At first, they thought maybe an animal had gotten into the attic and died. Uh huh. So they brought in exterminators and found nothing. Then they thought maybe it was mold, so they brought in a mold specialist, and no mold was found. Okay, that's already a lot of money there. It. Yeah, right. Like, they're in debt big time at this point. They're spending a lot. They cleaned all the carpets, replaced the entire central air and heating system. Again, it's expensive. Wow, that is expensive. It replaced it all. I thought for sure it was like fish in the ventilation system, and that didn't even work. They even installed an expensive ozone generator for the air filter to try to get rid of the smell. But no matter what they did, nothing got rid of the stench. And soon the husband and his mistress were having fights because of it. Yeah, I mean, nobody. Can you imagine living with a set? I mean, they described it as a set of a dead animal. Yeah. In your house 24 7. And obviously for a while if they got all that work done in the meantime. Right. The only thing that's changed is you moved in. It's Gotta be you. I didn't know you smelled like rotting animal. Uh, they were frustrated and disgusted, obviously, because they couldn't figure out where the smell was coming from or why it smelled so bad. So they decided to put the house on the market and just move on. Oh, my god. And that's extreme. Well, and how do you sell a house that stinks? That's exactly everyone that comes in. I mean, you're not gonna be able to sell it for any money. It's exactly what the real estate agent told them. The horrible stench, it's gonna be a major problem for perspective buyers. Yeah, and would drive the price down considerably. But they didn't care. They just wanted to get out. There's a sign outside. Must have no sense of smell. Right? Right. Hazmat suit available. Here's your gas mask to tour the home. Finally, they got an offer on the house. It was extremely low, but they needed the funds to move out and had no other offers, obviously because the place smelled so bad. So they took that extremely low ball offer. Oh, my god. And it turns out that offer was from Mia, the ex wife. Shut up! Shut up! Who wound up purchasing your house back at a huge discount. Oh, my god. And also remember, he made her a financial offer. So the money she's using to buy the house was the money he gave her to leave her house. So the mistress Could move in. So he bought her the house. And this is pretty much all legal. And Mia. You're so smart. I love her. The day Mia moved back in, she also

What happened? In high school, I was that kid everyone expected to become a doctor. 4.0 GPA, president of the science club, and parents who had my whole life mapped out. But one morning, I just couldn't take it anymore. I packed a backpack with some clothes, grabbed my savings of 2,047, and walked out the front door instead of going to school. My parents had been fighting all night about my future. Mom wanted me at Stanford studying medicine. Dad insisted on Harvard premed. Either asked what I wanted. That morning, dad had slammed a Harvard brochure on my cereal bowl, making milk splash all over my shirt. That was my breaking point. I left my phone on my desk, bought a bus ticket to Seattle, and didn't look back. I knew my parents would track my phone, so I left it behind. I've been researching this escape for months, reading about how to disappear and start fresh in Seattle. I found this tiny room above a bookstore. The owner, Rita, was this sweet old lady who didn't ask many questions. When I paid three months rent in cash, I told her I was 18, showed her a fake ID I bought online, and she just nodded. I got a job washing dishes at this small Italian restaurant. The owner, Tony, paid me under the table and let me eat whatever was left at closing. He'd lost his son years ago and kind of took me Under his wing. Every night, he teach me how to cook different pasta dishes after we closed up. Meanwhile, my face was plastered all over the news back home. Missing honor student. My parents offered a 50 thousand dollar reward. They hired private investigators, posted my photo everywhere. But I changed my appearance. Dyed my hair dark, started wearing glasses, changed how I dressed. Nobody looks twice at a dishwasher. Six months went by. I was actually happy for the first time in years. I discovered I loved cooking. Tony was teaching me everything he knew. The restaurant became my home. Rita would bring me books from her store, and we'd talk about them during my breaks. Then one day, this guy came into the restaurant. He ordered spaghetti and kept stare.

So I destroyed his moment in front of everyone in my family. There's one name that matters more than anything. The business. My grandpa started it from nothing. Just a wrench, a truck, and a ridiculous work ethic. Now it's this big local Empire. Auto Shops, property, even a commercial fleet. But since I was a kid, everyone said my cousin Nathan would take it over. He was the heir. The one with the polished handshake, the church smile, the button down shirts with his initials on the cuff. And me, I was hands on the grease stained. Stay out of the photos, cousin. Didn't matter that I worked every summer there. Learned the books showed up before the sun. If Nathan showed up once a month in a collared shirt, they acted like he was royalty. But I stayed quiet. I told myself, just work hard. It'll pay off. Then last year, Grandpa passed. Suddenly, everyone's talking succession. Nathan starts calling himself next gen CEO before there's even a will reading. Starts inviting investors over to Grandpa's house. Post a photo of Grandpa's office with the caption, big shoes to fill. Legacy continues. I snapped. I knew Grandpa better than anyone. I knew what he really thought about Nathan. Flashy spending, the fake smile. The way he dodged real work. So I went digging. One night, I stayed late in the office, dug through Grandpa's old file cabinet. Found something interesting. A USB drive on it. A video. Grandpa sitting at his desk. Filmed a month before he died. He starts talking. Really talking. Not about name.

The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My stomach, Dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. This psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. He sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room she made all pink And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us?

I worked as a flight attendant for eight years, and nothing tops the day I met Princess Pamela, who thought buying a first class ticket meant she owned the entire plane. It started when she boarded wearing a tiara. Yes, an actual tiara, and demanded that everyone call her princess. Not even kidding. She had this designer handbag that probably cost more than my monthly salary, and she kept waving it around like a royal scepter. As I helped store her carry on, she looked me dead in the eyes and said, I expect to be served my champagne exactly three minutes after take off. Not two minutes, not four minutes, three. And it better be at precisely 41 degrees Fahrenheit. She then pulled out a digital thermometer from her purse and placed it on her armrest. Before take off, she complained about the peasants in economy class being able to see her through the curtain. We actually tried to convince my colleague Ben to build a proper wall between the cabins using blankets and pillows. The real show started when we hit turbulence. Thirty minutes into the flight, Princess Pamela started pressing her call button like she was playing whack a mole at Chuck E. Cheese. When I reached her seat, she demanded we turn off the turbulence because it was ruining her blowout. I tried explaining that turbulence wasn't something we could troll. She scoffed, and Said, well, I paid $3,000 for this ticket. I'm pretty sure that covers the cost of smooth air. Then she pulled out her phone and threatened to call her daddy, who apparently owns half of Manhattan. The situation escalated when another first class passenger, this sweet elderly man named Howard, started laughing at her antics. Princess Pamela whipped around and hissed, how dare you mock me? Do you know who I am? Howard, bless his heart, just smiled and said, yes, you're the grown woman wearing a tiara from Claire's. The entire first class cabin erupted in Snickers. That's when she lost it. She stood up during the turbulence, despite the seatbelt sign being on, raised her champagne glass, and announced she was going to have every single person on the plane fired, including the pilot. Then Karma hit. Quite literally. A strong bout of turbulence sent her designer bag flying, spilling its contents everywhere. Her authentic designer wallet split open, revealing dozens of maxed out credit cards and overdue Bill notices. Tiara fell off, too. And guess what? Howard was right. It still had the Claire's price tag stuck to the bottom, 1299. The best part? One of the other passengers recognized her. Turned out Princess Pamela worked at a nail salon in New Jersey. The daddy who owned half of Manhattan was actually her second cousin, who managed a hot dog stand near Times Square. She spent the rest of the flight hiding under her blanket. But we could Still hear her fake crying and mumbling about how she was going to sue everyone on this aircraft. When we landed, she tried to be the first one off the plane, but Howard stood up and blocked the aisle with his cane. After you, Princess, he said, gesturing to all the economy passengers. She had to walk through the entire plane while everyone who'd heard about her meltdown stared and whispered the cherry on top at baggage claim. Her carefully curated facade completely crumbled when her knockoff designer suitcase broke open, spilling Claire's tiaras everywhere. Apparently, she'd been reselling them online as authentic royal headpieces.

But whenever I ask if he wants to hang out on the weekend, he, like, he always comes up with an excuse about why he can't. So you're dating a married guy? Basically. See, that's what my friend said she was like. Any guy that prefers dating during the week but won't see you on the weekends either has a weekend girl or is married. And you're his secret side piece. Okay, before we get too far into this, what is this guy's name? Jonathan. Okay, you said it's been about a month or so? Yes. Okay, let me ask the stupid question here. Does this guy work on the weekends? No, he's. He's an investment broker. So they don't even do business on the weekends except maybe play golf. Okay, see, an investment broker. He just sounds married. It's a married person job. I mean, I. I guarantee he's married, has kids and everything. Okay, pump your brakes here. When. When you guys go out? Heather, you said it's during the week? Yes. Does he ever seem like he's trying to be secretive when you're together? And by that, I mean, like, does he say, let's meet somewhere instead of picking you up? Does he take you places that are like 45 minute drives out of town? That kind of stuff? No, not really. We're pretty open. With our dating. So like, for instance, like on Valentine's Day, he took me to the melting pot and he kissed me in the parking lot in front of everybody. So. Okay, it doesn't mean he's not married. I mean, what if his family like, lives in another town and he just works here? I don't know. I mean, I met him on a dating website and he basically talked about how hard dating is. And he told me about his ex girlfriend. He just doesn't sound like he's married. Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, he could have just been making all of that up. We know people like that. Okay, so. So you want us to do what, Heather? Find out if he's married. That would be a great start, yeah. Okay. And I guess maybe find out why he's always busy on the weekends. I mean, maybe he just likes to have alone time on the weekends. We don't know, but we can find out. Hang on the line so we can get his number from you. Okay? Okay. Okay. How much money do you wanna put on this whole married thing? How much money? Yeah, how much money you wanna bet? I don't know. I don't wanna bet money. I mean, it's. It's dirty work Wednesday. How about this? How about if. Alright, if he is, if he's married, like you think, I will take you to chick fil A. But if he's not married, Then you have to take me and Shaggy to Pizza Hut Buffet today for lunch. Well, get ready to buy me lunch, because this guy is married. Alright, well we're gonna find out when we come back.

Do you remember a guy named Trevor? Trevor in my class? Yeah. Let me see if I can jog your memory a little bit. Okay, so you guys went to high school together. I guess he was in one of your classes, and one day you guys studied together. Okay, that still could be a lot of people. I'm thinking you might remember studying with this guy. He was a freshman and you were a sophomore. Okay. And I guess you guys had geometry together. Okay. And one day after school, you went over to his house to study. Okay. Okay. Nothing. Yet remember in Trevor? No, not really. Okay, um, well, the only other way that I think I could get you to remember him is he tried to impress you with a veggie tray. Oh, my gosh. Got it. Just so you remember. You remember the veggie tray? I do. I do remember that. Oh, that was the karate guy. The karate veggie tray guy. Yeah. So? And Trevor actually emailed us. Why? Because he wanted us to get a hold of you. He's still laughing. Because he had a huge crush on you in high school and I guess still kind of has a crush on you and saw you on Facebook the other day and wanted to see if you'd go out with him. Yeah. Oh, my god. Are you for real? Yeah, I am 100% serious. Yeah. He told us the whole story about how you asked him to study, and it was, like, seriously the most memorable moment of all of his high school career. Oh, god. Oh, my god. That is so weird. Were you interested. Were you interested in Trevor in high school, or was that just a study session for you? I just needed to pass geometry, and he. He was the smart guy. No doubt he was the smart kid. Was it obvious that he liked you, though? I don't know. I mean, he was younger, so you know how it is. Like, the younger guys, you know, look up to the Older girls, right? And as a sophomore, you don't wanna date a freshman. I mean, come on. This whole thing was so long ago. I kind of remember that afternoon. They would be hard to forget with the. The veggie tray is. But, um, you know, it. It didn't get a totally weird until the next day when his mom called me. Wait, what did his mom say? What did his mom say? Yeah. Oh, my god. I've never told anybody about this. Yes. His mom called me, and she told me that Trevor had been, like, really, really upset and crying in his room. Oh, man. Oh, my god. And we're just all devastated. And she wanted me to make sure that I knew that, like, he was a really good kid and that. And I said that the veggie tray was her idea.

You know, we're both single, so I told her, like, hey, you know, if you need anybody to hang out or dance with tonight, I'm right here. Oh, that's so sweet. If I was by myself at a wedding, I would definitely take a guy up on that offer. No, I mean, she. She did. And we talked during dinner. We got to know each other, did a few shots. We pretty much danced together the entire night. And in fact, people were, like, coming up to us and asking, like, oh, how long have you been together as a couple? And we were like, 45minutes. Haha. Wow. Okay, so the whole meeting people at a wedding thing actually works, then? I mean, I mean, it did for me, yeah. Okay, so the connection was there then? Oh. Oh, yeah, absolutely. In fact, after the reception was over, we. We went somewhere else for some drinks, and then I asked if she wanted to crash at my place. So she came over, spent the night. Wow. Okay. Wow. Way to go, Scott. So you guys, with your. Now, did you end up, um. You know. No, I mean, like, we messed around a bunch, but we didn't end up having sex. I gotcha. But so you enjoyed each other's company? Oh, totally, yeah. And When I tell you, I've never clicked with somebody so much in my life. I mean, I. I remember thinking, this. This person here could be my next girlfriend. This is. Wow, that's awesome. Okay, but I'm assuming something went wrong, though, or you wouldn't be calling us. Yeah, exactly. So, uh, so here's what went wrong. The next morning, she got up early and asked if I could make her breakfast and said that she had to get going, but she was gonna call me. So I wait a day or two, no call. And I'm telling myself, alright, just stay cool, stay cool, don't act desperate, don't overreact. Let's just let her make the first move. So I wait, and then there's nothing. So I'm finally thinking, all right, well, what if. What if she lost my phone number, you know, or something? Or like, what if she's been actually trying to reach me? So I sent her a text message asking what she was doing for Memorial Day weekend, and she's like, yeah, I am super busy. And that was the last time I heard from her. Oh, man. Okay. So she. She gave you the blow off? Yep, pretty much. And then the thing I can't understand was like, guys, the entire night we were having an absolute blast together. And I could tell she was really into me. I was totally into her. And I. I have no idea what happened. So once again, and We get these all the time. We have somebody who starts out super into you and then something happens and makes him pull a one eighty for no good reason. I can't tell you how many of these we've had to figure out. So I'm assuming that's what you want to know, why she acted so interested that night and now she's not. Yeah, yeah, like I. I just don't know what I did that made her give me the blow off like that. Yeah. Is there a possibility that she's married? No, no, no, she's not married. Cause we're both friends with the bride and groom and they both said to us, oh my gosh, we're so glad you guys found each other. You're perfect together. Yeah. I feel like if she was married and the weddings, like, by herself, somebody would have come up to you and be like, you know, she's married, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, she is definitely not married. Okay, so, great time at the wedding, you go for drinks, you come home, you do some heavy petting, and then the next day she's no longer interested. So that leaves us with the normal line of questioning here. Forgive us for asking. Um, did you. Did you try any weird sexual move on her? Absolutely not. Okay. None of that. So everything you guys did was pretty much by the book? Yeah. Okay. Yep. Did you go pee? Pee or poop in the bed? Like, or have terrible flatulence in your sleep? no, I did not. Okay, okay. Do you keep a collection of fingernails under your bed anyway, or something weird like that? No, no, that is disgusting. Cause one time, that was the. That was the reason. Um, okay, so you have this girl's name, this girl's phone number then? Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay, give it to us. We'll get her on the phone and we'll find out what's going on. Okay? Alright, great.

If. Well, no, I'm single. Oh, okay. So it wasn't another dude, then? No. Okay, so let's retrace the steps here for a minute. You. You meet him at a wedding? Was the wedding nice? Did you have fun at the wedding? Yeah, I had a great time. Okay, so then he said you guys went for drinks somewhere for a little bit. Did something happen while you guys went for drinks? Is he listening to us right now? No, no, no. He. He. He just texted us. Oh, okay. So was it during the drinks, then? Did he say something? No, it wasn't that. Uh, so I'll tell you what happened, but the whole story is, like, ridiculous. Okay, well, ridiculous is our forte, so. So what happened? Bring it on here. So we go out for drinks after the wedding, and that was fine, and I was really into him, so we went back to his place, but I made it clear that I was like, that it was just to talk. We were not having sex. Okay, and did he understand that part? Yeah. I mean, he was a perfect gentleman. Nothing bad. Okay, good. So. But. Well, something bad happened at some point, though, correct? I mean, so he's in the bathroom because he was brushing his teeth and stuff, getting ready for bed. And I was still in the dress. Like, I was still in the dress I was wearing from the Wedding. So I asked him if I can hang the dress up so it doesn't like get wrinkled. And he goes, sure. There's a bunch of hangers in my closet. So I open his closet and I'm looking for a hanger and I'm moving a bunch of shirts and stuff over, like to find a hanger. And I see this like, bright red suit hanging in the back of a closet. Almost like if somebody had a Santa Claus suit hiding in their closet or like something. Oh my god, you see? You slept with Santa Claus! No, it wasn't that. But I moved everything out of the way to see and it was a full adult size Power Ranger costume. Power Ranger? Like the TV show? Like, Go, Go Power Rangers? Yes. So I yell, hey, I love your Halloween costume! And he goes, what? And I go, I love the Halloween costume, the Power Ranger. And when I said it, I completely expected him to be all like embarrassed and go, oh my god, I'm so sorry you saw that. But that's like not what happened at all. Oh, so alright, so what did happen? He goes, oh no, that's not a Halloween costume. That's my cosplay suit. I wear it to all the con. Like, he's like, I wear it to all the conventions. And I'm like, what kind of conventions? And he goes, you know, Comic Con, Ranger Con. And he starts naming all these things Like, that he goes to. So was he on the TV show or something? Like, is he, like, a panelist at these conventions? No, he just loves Power Rangers and dressing up and acting like a Power Ranger when he goes to these things. And I'm thinking to myself, you're 30 years old, and you dress up like a freaking Power Ranger. I see. Okay, so did you ask him to put on the suit before you made out with him, or. Absolutely not. Okay, I wanted to get the hell out of there immediately, but I had no ride home, and I didn't want to wait outside for 30 minutes for an Uber, so I stayed the night, and the next morning, I got the hell out of there. I got you. So. So you like him, but you can't get around the Power Ranger thing? Um, no, sorry. I'm not trying to date a grown man who plays, like, superhero dress up on the weekend. You know, honestly, I don't blame you. I have never understood the whole grown up costume thing. You know, except on Halloween, that's fine, or kids birthday party, but this. Okay, Lindsay, um, we'll try to pass on the info for you so Scott knows exactly what happened. Yeah, I mean, tell him I'm really sorry. I just can't do the whole grown UPS in costume thing.

What? And you replied with, oh, cool, awesome. And I asked if you heard me, and you replied with, yeah, sure, whatever you wanna do. Like, are you kidding me? Oh, shit. Awkward. Wow. What?

We told him he could as long as he had the conversation on the air with us. Huh? How? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Oh, my god. Are you actually being serious right now? Like, you're for real pregnant? Yeah, I'm really pregnant. And I tried to Tell you that a week ago, but you're too busy playing your stupid game.

So for the first time, instead of clicking on my profile, I decided to click on his. Um, yeah, I thought maybe there was a cool new show that I haven't seen yet or something that he was really into. So anyways, I click on his profile and it's a bunch of, like, sappy, girly romantic movies. Oh, okay, so it sounds like he really misses you then. No, no, I. You don't understand. He hates movies like that. Like, when we're together, it's just like bullying teeth to get him to watch that kind of stuff. Okay, well, he must not hate him that much if he's watching them. Yeah, but what I wanna know is, why is he watching them in the first place? Like, is he alone watching these movies, or is he watching them because somebody is with him? Oh, okay, I see what you're getting at. So you think he might not be alone watching all these girly romantic movies? I mean, I just. I just can't see him sitting alone at home on a Saturday night watching Crazy Stupid Love by himself. Right? Okay, so you think maybe he's got some company over and that's who is picking these movies? They all sound like movies a girl would pick, not a guy. Okay, so. So what movies are They like. Are they comedies? Cause a lot of guys don't mind romantic movies if they're funny. No, they're like notebook, Crazy, Stupid, Love. And the last one he watched was, um. PS, I love you. Oh, I love that movie. It is so romantic. Okay, but that's my whole point though. Like, do you know any guy who would watch that by himself? Uh, no, probably not I, I would definitely say that's a date movie. Okay, and see, that's what I'm worried about. I got you. So, okay, so you want us to find out if your boyfriend is entertaining company while watching these romantic movies, then yes. Okay, and what is your boyfriend's name? It's Greg. Okay, and you're doing the long distance thing? Like, so where is he at? He's not in California or anything, is he? No, he's in Decatur, which is just outside of Atlanta. Okay, so he's still on the East Coast then? Yeah. Okay, good. Cause if we try calling him like in Idaho or something, he ain't waking up yet. Alright, so we need a plan here. We, we could send him a text or something. Maybe something like a line from one of those movies we. Which one of the movies did you say you liked? Natalia, I love PS, I love you. It is like I said, it's such a great movie. Okay, so is. Is there like a signature line in that movie? Like. Like a. Like a Nobody puts baby in the corner type line. Okay, well, the line is actually PS I love you, because the guy in the movie actually dies, but he leaves behind all these letters that he writes at the end. Okay, so that. So that. That might not work, then. Well, why don't we just text him and put, be honest, do you really like PS I love you or did you hate it? Okay, we could do that. That. That would certainly get a response one way or the other. I guess either. Look, he's either gonna say something mushy like, I liked it because I watched it with you, or he's gonna say, who the hell is this? And how do you know I watch that movie? So I think either way, we'll probably know right away what's going on. So let's do that. Let's send him that text now, and then we'll read what he responds with when we come back next. Okay, so Natalia did send Greg a text. And what did he. Well, what did the text say that you sent him first? Okay, it. I said, hey, it's me. I was just wondering, did you really like PS I love you or did you hate it? Okay. And did Greg write back? Actually, um, yes, several times. Okay, what. What did he say? So. Okay, so first he just wrote back question marks. So I wrote back, PS I love you. The movie on Netflix. Did you actually like it or no? And then he wrote back, you know, who is this? I think you have the wrong number. So I wrote, is this Greg? And he wrote, yes, who the heck is this? So I, you know, so it's definitely Greg, though. Alright, so let's call him and then we'll see if he answers real quick.

Was that you guys who were texting me? Yeah, well, well, sort of. We heard you were the expert on romantic movies on Netflix. So we heard.

Did you give your sister your Netflix password? Uh, no. She came to visit me a couple weekends ago with her boyfriend, and, um, uh, we actually ordered the, uh.

Would you watch those mushy movies with your girlfriend? Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course I would. Um, I mean, hopefully she wouldn't make do it. We really, really don't kind of do that, but, uh, I mean, I'd watch whatever she wants. Oh, isn't that nice? See? Do you feel better now, Kaylee? Yes, I feel much better. Okay, good. Alright.

Whoa. What was it? She just said something that was, like, totally inappropriate, and it was pretty offensive. Did she mean to be offensive or she. Was she just saying something was totally ignorant? No, it seemed pretty intentional. It was pretty cold and calculated, if you ask me. Wow. She didn't seem that rude. We talked to her a little bit about your date. She didn't seem like somebody who would be rude. You. But listen, I was surprised, too. Like, initially, I thought she seemed like a nice person, and then she, like, threw this thing at me, and I was like, wow. Okay. Wow. Not who I thought you were. You gotta tell me what it is. Yeah, she's just a hater, and I don't want to deal with people like that. Oh, my god. What did she do? Is she rude to the white staff or something? No. Uh, so, like, we were having conversation during dinner. Okay. And I told her that I like to cook. I cook a lot. And I told her that I particularly, uh, am very, very fond of the Barefoot Contessa on a garden. Um, like, I've seen all of her shows. I have all of her cookbooks. Is that a cooking show? Are you kidding me? Is this a radio show? Give me a break. Where? Hey, this is barely a radio show. I don't watch the Food Network or what is it on the food. I don't even know where that is. I've never heard of it. It's on the. Yeah, of course it's on the Food Network. Ina Garden. The Barefoot Contessa in the Hamptons. She's cooking meals for, like, Spielberg and stuff. Hello? Hahaha. Sorry, sorry. I didn't know who she was. Maybe I'll check it out sometime. I mean, I'm. From the sounds of it, I'm sure I'll like it. Yeah, it'll change your life. Okay. I think she's like the most. She's like the most amazing woman that's ever lived. She's beautiful. And the least. Responded in an extremely rude way. It was incredibly disrespectful. What did she say to you? First of all, she laughed at me. She like, dropped her fork and openly laughed. Like, everyone in the restaurant turned and looked. She was just laughing her face off at me. Because you like the Barefoot Contessa? Because I like the Barefoot Contessa, apparently. That's hilarious. I don't know. So. But then she says in a really loud voice, she goes, that lady, she's the worst. And I was like, speechless. Wait, I could not. I was like, what? What? So I'm confused. She said that she didn't like the Barefoot Contessa? And yes, she said she did not like the Barefoot Contessa. Not only that she didn't like her, she said she was the worst. And then she went even further. She said, she is so fake. Her show Is so boring and. Oh my god. Okay. And her recipes are like so simple. They're for like a middle school cafeteria. And I was like, oh, you have got to be kidding me. Ladies, you have got to be kidding me. You're that into cooking? This is bigger than food. This is. Yeah, the food's amazing. This is. This is about this woman, this incredible soul, okay? And. And to disrespect her like that? I don't think so. Not on my watch. I was like, you're coming for me? Are you joking? Yeah, I'm sorry, maybe. Okay, maybe you didn't hear me. She said she's the worst. It's like she insulted not only in the garden, but she insulted me. I mean, like, she just sort of said, what I believe in, the thing that I care about the most is a joke. I'm like, you know what, lady? I'm gonna toss this table over and walk out. What? Then why did. This is so crazy to me. Well, don't you. Don't you wish that you could tell Elise off a little bit then? I mean, let her know? No, I don't wanna have anything to do with her again. That bitch is dead to me. Okay, alright, well, I should probably not tell you this, but I'm gonna tell you anyway. Elise is actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. What?

Oh, okay. Well, I certainly hope that's not the case. What's your husband's name? It's Jason. Okay, and you said he took a trip last week? Yeah, to Detroit. Oh, that's my hometown. What was he doing up there? Well, so he has this company, and they were making this pitch to Chrysler up there, and he was just, like, part of the team that, um, was sent to do it. I got you. Okay, so I'm guessing he's probably in sales, then. Yeah, yeah, he represents the marketing side of the company. Nice. Okay, so he went up there last week. And you think it was while he was gone that he cheated? Uh, yeah, I'm thinking maybe. Probably at his hotel. Okay, what makes you think he cheated? Like, has he been acting differently, kind of suspicious? Yes, there's that. Um, and I found out that there was this woman who he told me was not going on the trip, and she actually did go. Red flag. So I'm like, okay, he lied to me about that. And this woman that went, does she work with him? Yeah. And. Okay, I cannot stand this woman, and he knows that. Okay, so hence the lie, then. How did you find out he was lying about that? Well, you know, we were chit chatting when he Got back, and he kind of just, like, let it slip. And he was telling me about the presentation, and he accidentally said her name. And I was like, oh, I thought that she wasn't going on this trip. And he. Looks like he got caught in the lie, right? Yeah. So he tried to scream the story, like, oh, I never said that. But I heard it. It was too late. So this other woman accompanied him on this trip, then? Yeah, it was this past week. And then I found out more evidence when I was doing his laundry. Oh, no. Oh, okay. What. What evidence did you find in the laundry? Like, a little lipstick on the collar, perhaps? No. Um. Oh, my god, this is so awkward. Uh. Oh. Say there was another kind of game, and, um, it was not on his cobbler. Oh, god. Oh, oh. Oh, wow. Oh, god, that's. That's nasty. I know. So you found, um. Actually, I don't even think I wanna know what you found. No, no, no, no, you probably don't. I probably don't. And it's just, like, not to get too gross, but, you know, I was concerned, so I did examine it kind of closely. Like, you know, I, like, looked at it closely, I smelled it, you know, like, when I think I wasn't crazy. Okay, wait, well. Well, you're. You're crazy, though. Yeah, that. That's true, but I just don't know if you're wrong. That. That's the point. So, um. Alright, so listen, you said his hotel was in Detroit, correct? Yeah. Okay. I mean, well, no, it actually, it wasn't in Detroit. There was a different city on. God, I can't remember. It was, um. It was the city that started with D. Also. It was. Was it what? Let me ask. Was it probably Dearborn? Yes, yes, yes, yes, that was it. Okay. Too. Too bad you didn't call us. I could have my mom drive 15 minutes and go to this hotel room or something, so. Okay. And do you know what type of hotel it was? Um, yeah, it was the Radisson. Okay, perfect. So. And what days was he actually there, do you remember? He got there on Thursday, and then he flew back on Friday. Okay, great. So listen, sit tight. I'm gonna need his phone number from you so you can give it to shag, and then we'll call him when we come back, okay? Okay. Hello? Yes, good morning. I'm trying to reach, uh, Mr. Jason. Nick, please. This is Jason. Hi, Jason. My name is Jack Harlow. I'm calling from the Dearborn Radisson. I hope I'm not bothering you, but the reason I called is because one of our room attendants found a woman's earring under the bed in your room that you stayed at last week. And we wanted to let you know in case someone in your party was looking for it. That It was recovered. And you said it was a woman's earring? Yes. So? I mean, not yours, obviously, but we thought maybe someone in your party may have lost it. Um, actually, hang on. I could put you on with her right now. Oh, just hold on. Hold on a second. Sure, no problem.

I'm close friends with the neighbors, and a little while back, I realized my neighbors, they don't take enough videos of their kids. So I'm putting together a video collage of their kids for them for their upcoming anniversary. What? Oh, my god. No, dude, you're watching that is. Yeah, yeah. Whenever I see the kids playing in the yard, I take out the camera, record it. I'm gonna put a soundtrack to it. The neighbors know. They're cool about it. The neighbors know. It's. It's. It's total misunderstanding. You know, it's unfortunate it happened during the date, but that. That's all it was. Well, hold up. It's not a big deal. You actually had a conversation with your neighbors about this? Yeah. So they know that you're videotaping their kids through your window? Yeah, they think it's a great idea. They're not the best at technology, and I'm really good at computers, so they're happy to have me capture some moments. Ah. Some moments where it looks like somebody spied on their children. Yeah. Like there's no audio. They're kind of far away. Like, I don't know that I believe you, Eugene. No, no, we're putting music to it. It's gonna be good. I know, dude, you just said that on. On the radio. Like, you hear yourself. This is like, a perfect example of the creepy level that you live at. What? I'm doing a nice thing for my neighbors. No, that's not how you do it. Yeah, Robin and Sandy, they love it. Dude, it was the middle of the night and it was raining. Like, that's a terrible time to get video, first of all, and also so creepy if kids went from car to house in the middle of the night. Wait, so, wait, were the kids in the yard in the dark, in the rain? I'm confused now. Yeah, yeah, they were playing in puddles. Now I have night vision on my camera. The kids were playing in the puddle. You're videotaping kids with night vision goggles, Eugene? Yeah, friendship never sleeps. I, I think you guys are misunderstanding what I'm saying. Yeah, I think other things never sleep. Eugene, you are literally have proof that the neighbors are cool with this. Yeah, yeah, I talk to them. I feel like we need to call the neighbors. Like, I feel like on this one, we need to. Yeah, I definitely feel like we need to call a lot of people. Yeah, go ahead, call them. Sandy loves me. Okay. Wow. I mean, okay, the video camera is dead. Let's just bring it back to the date. It just wasn't working for me, like, on every level, every step of the way. So you don't want to continue game of Thrones? I think that Might be what she's saying, Eugene, but. Oh, Eugene. I guess we can check for sure. Diana, would you like to go out with Eugene on a second date? We will pay for it. I would not. I would not. Okay, you started answering that before I even asked. Diane. Rude. Listen, Eugene, like, you obviously have this, like, nerdy side to you, which is awesome for somebody. And like, you know, if you could just bring it down a notch and maybe like, ask your date if they would like to play Yachty or if they would like to watch game of Thrones, maybe you could hit, hit it off with another fellow nerd and you'd. You'd really have a good time. But I'm not that person. Uh, yeah, okay. I think that you're just gonna have to chalk this one up as a loss, man. Yeah, lost for her. Okay. Yeah. You hear that, Diana? You lost. This is one that I'm totally fine to lose. Yeah, all good. Hey, hey, can you ask her if I can still just touch her boob? What? What? No. Eugene, that's so weird.

Uh. Oh, alright, what is the guy's name? It's Danny. Okay, and what is his ex's name? Her name is Melissa. Melissa. Okay. Alright, so give me the story. Alright, so, um, Danny's a personal trainer, but he's also part of a male review. Um, and that's like how he makes the most of his money. Alright, hold on a second. A male? Like a male review? Like Magic Mike style? Like male dancers? Yeah. Oh my god, which one is it? I bet I know. Um, I don't wanna say, but I think it's probably the one you're thinking of. I bet it is. I mean, I couldn't imagine. Dating a guy that does that for a living isn't that hard. Um, I mean, it's kind of strange watching him work, but, um, I mean, as long as he's coming home at night, like, I'm okay with it, you know? Okay, so how does the ex play into all of this? So a few weeks ago I went to see one of his shows and I was in the bathroom, like, touching up my lipstick, and I all of a sudden was surrounded by this group of girls. And they tell me, just so you know, Danny's with Melissa still, and you should stop trying to be his side piece, cause that's all you are to him. And I was like, excuse me? And they're like, yeah, you heard us. Your side piece, your Danny. Danny's with Melissa and you're the side chick, so. Alright, so this is like straight out of high school intimidation tactics? Yeah, I mean, it was like mean Girls or something. And so I like, I go to Danny and I'm like, hey, is your ex here right now? And he's like, yeah, I'm sorry about that. Just ignore. And I was like, okay, well, it's not her that's the problem. It's her friends. Um, like, they're coming up to me. But anyways, it was like a couple weeks ago, and since then, like, they keep showing up like every week, and it's like they're trying to scare me or something. Okay, did you ask Danny about the whole still being with Melissa part? Yeah, um, he said that they're not together anymore. But, um, why does it sound like you're not sure you believe him? I mean, I don't know, I, I, I tried to text her to like, handle things like adults, but she never wrote me back. Okay, so you got no answer? No, I got none. So who do you believe here? Do you think he's still with her and you're just the side piece? Or do you think he's just with you? I mean, I, that's what I wanna find out. That's why I called you guys. Okay, so you want us to find out? For you? Yeah, cause I mean, if you like. You still with her? Like, I'm not gonna look stupid in front of everybody, right? Not trying to be like someone side chick. Okay, well, we can try to find out. I mean, you. What you guys think like a Three Way call? Maybe get Danny and his ex on the phone, see what he says about Rachel. We can. I mean, yeah, that might work. Actually. Actually, I think I got a better idea. Rachel, you did say you have the ex's phone number, right? Yeah, I mean, I think it's her. I mean, like, it didn't write me back, so I don't really know if it's her or not, but I think it's her. Okay, I say we call the ex up first and find out if it is her. If it is, I think I have a great, great idea. Okay, shag. Your plan is we're gonna call the ex. Yep. Melissa. And see if she will agree to this. What we think we're gonna do is we're gonna call Danny twice. Once we're gonna call as if Rachel's calling it. Yep. And then. And then ask about Melissa. Yep. Then we're gonna hang up. She can hear everything, but she's gonna basically be on mute. Slash. Can't say anything. Then we're gonna hang up, call him back as Melissa, and ask about Rachel. If this works, this is gonna be really good. This is like third fly on The wall stuff here, darling. At random. Hey, so this is. The top number you gave me is Melissa's. Correct. Okay, so this would be Melissa we're calling. Hello? Good morning. I'm calling to speak to Melissa, please. Okay, who's calling? This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show. Nick, Ashley and Shaggy on Z, 1:04. Okay, what are you. What are you calling me for? Well, actually, we have a girl on the other line with us. Her name is Rachel, and I believe you may know her. Uh, uh, yeah, I'm familiar with her. Okay, so here's the thing. She is apparently dating Danny. But according to your friends, she's a side piece because Danny is with you. Yeah. No, no, no. She was dating Danny, but he broke up with her. Uh, I don't think so. What? Yeah, I think so, honey. Okay, so, shag, why don't you go over your plan real quick? Okay, so here's my plan. So, okay, ladies, what we wanna do is basically have each of you call Danny one at a time. Yeah. This way you can hear the truth while he's on with the other person. And since we have a third line, all you have to do is just kind of sit back and listen. Okay, but the only rule is you can't interrupt while he's on with the other person. We think this way, once and for all, the truth is gonna come out. The truth will set You free. But first it will piss you off. Exactly. Exactly. Yes. Okay, so. Alright, so this way you get to hear what he says about you guys. All the other person he's talking to. The other person. Is this okay with you, Rachel? Yeah, I mean, it's fine. I think she needs to hear this. Okay. And that's fine with you, Melissa? I mean, if she wants to get her heart broken and humiliate herself, then yeah, by all means, that's fine. Okay, so, Rachel, we're gonna call Danny right now, and then you could talk to him first. Just a heads up, though, he's probably not gonna recognize the number we're using. So is he the type person who will answer a number he doesn't recognize? Yeah, I think he'll answer. I mean, he uses this phone for booking gigs, so he usually answers strange calls thinking it might be work. Okay, so when he answers, just tell him it's your new phone or something so he doesn't suspect anything's up. Okay? Alright, here we go. Okay.

No. Did he try to like, get you to play strip Yahtzee or something? Yeah. No, thank. Thank god. Okay, so in the middle of yatchi, we're playing a good old round of yatchi, and then he was like, hold on, hold on. And he takes out a camera and Goes over to the window and starts videotaping the neighbor's yard across the street. What? Okay, wow. Why? What. What did he explain? I mean, I wanted to ask, but I decided I didn't even want to know. Oh, honestly, this is just a favor to his mom. I work with her. I'm sure he told you that. Yeah, yeah, he said that his mom set you guys up. Yeah, and I like her, you know, and we work together, we see each other every day. But once I got there, I was like, wow, this guy's, like, a little unstable. And I felt weird being there, and I was just sort of trying to plan how I was gonna get out of there. Okay, but let's go back to the video camera thing. What was he. So he videotapes his neighbor's yard? I mean, I don't even know. I didn't even ask, I. That's all I know is that he was videotaping his neighbors. Weird. I don't know. Yeah, okay, but after that, you stayed for a full episode of game of Thrones? I don't know, I just kind of figured I would wait out the episode and get out after that. Alright, well, you know, Diana, if you've listened to these second dates before, then you should know that Eugene is on the other line and wants to talk to you.

Dozens of people on it partying. There's a bar, multiple bedrooms, little jets you. That you can lower into the water. It was gigantic. That sounds amazing. I would be taking so many pictures and posting them on social media, like, look where I am. Was that not cool? I mean, it was fine until I found out the situation, and I was like, uh, it's kind of weird. What do you mean by the situation? We're in the hot tub, and we're just hanging out, and she got up to. To go get a drink. Um, and we were still in there. There's, like, some guys, some girls in there. But some of the guys there told me what the boat really kind of was. Um, I mean, I'd never been in this kind of situation before. What the boat was. What do you mean by what the boat was? Yeah, I thought it was just a boat. Yeah, a big floating object. Okay, so some rich guy owned it, but he has it to, like, entertain his, like, women. All the women on there were kind of, like, his girls, if that makes any sense. So you're saying that he's a pimp and they're all prostitutes? I'm, I'm not really picking up where you're putting that. I don't think so. I, I Didn't. I didn't get that vibe necessarily, but I. I thought it was more like a. I don't know what you call like a. Like a. Like a harem, I guess. Like his what? He's like a sugar daddy to these women. So you're saying that all the girls on there are, like, his girlfriends? Uh, kind of. The guy I was talking to kind of said that the girls could hang out on the boat and use all his, like, expensive cars and stuff if they did stuff for the guy. Oh. And I'm assuming not, like, do chores around his

I didn't tell anyone I was returning. I wanted to surprise Miguel. When I arrived on our street, I saw several cars parked in front of our house. The garden was decorated with blue and pink balloons. A banner read welcome our little miracle. I parked my car a street away and walked over. The door was slightly open. Music and laughter spilled from inside. When I stepped in, I froze in the middle of the living room. Carmen, my best friend, was visibly six months pregnant. My mother in law, Rosa, was gently stroking her belly while my mother served drinks. Gifts were stacked on a decorated table. So is the nursery ready? My aunt Elena asked. Almost, Carmen replied. Miguel insisted on painting it himself. He's been working on it every weekend. At that moment, my husband walked in, carrying more drinks. He approached Carmen and hugged her from behind, placing his hands on her belly. We just need to set up the crib. We picked it out together last week. I watched as my mother stiffened upon seeing me. She quickly walked over. Anna, we weren't expecting you today, she whispered, grabbing my arm. Let's go outside. We need to talk. I pulled away from her grasp. Talk about what? About how my husband got my best friend pregnant while I was working in another country. The I I chatter in the room died down. Carmen was the first To notice me. Her face turned pale. Miguel stood frozen, his hands still on her belly. Anna, he began, don't you dare. I cut him off. How long have you been cheating on me? No one answered. My father, standing in a corner, couldn't even look me in the eye. I can explain, Carmen said, taking a step forward. We didn't want you to find out like this. Oh? And how are you planning to tell me? After the baby was born or when they turned 18? My mother in law stepped in. Anna, please think about the baby. Carmen doesn't need this stress in her condition. Her condition? I let out a humorless laugh. The same condition I was in two years ago when I lost my baby. Where was your concern then, Rosa? The silence that followed was deafening. My mother tried again. Honey, I know this is difficult. Difficult for whom? For me, who worked non stop for nine months while my husband was sleeping with my best friend? Or for all of you who had to keep up the charade? Miguel finally stepped away from Carmen. Anna, can we talk privately? Don't make a scene. A scene? No, Miguel. A scene would be telling everyone how you convinced me to take that overseas job. How you said we needed the money to start our family. I turned to Carmen. Did he tell you that? Or did he say he was lonely and abandoned while his cruel Wife chased her career. Carmen started crying. It wasn't like that. We didn't plan this. Of course not. I suppose you just tripped and fell pregnant by my husband. These things happen, right? The guests began shifting uncomfortably. Some grabbed their bags ready to leave. My father finally spoke up. Anna, calm down. You're upset that. No, dad, I'm perfectly calm. In fact, I'm grateful. My mother frowned, confused. Grateful? Yes. Because now I see everyone for who they really are. My husband, the liar. My best friend, the traitor. And my family, the cowards who chose to protect this lie instead of me. I walked over to the gift table and grabbed one at random. This one's yours, mom. You bought a nice gift for your son in law's mistress's baby. Anna, please! My mother pleaded. I tore the wrapping paper open. It was a white baby outfit with blue details. How thoughtful. I hope you kept the receipt. Miguel stepped forward, trying to take the gift from my hands. Enough, Anna! You're making a fool of yourself. Making a fool of myself? No, Miguel. You did that all on your own. Getting my best friend pregnant while I was paying all the bills. My mother in law stood up, outraged. This is too much! Miguel was just looking for the happiness you couldn't give him. Always busy, always working. You're right, Rosa. I was too busy working. Working to pay the mortgage on the house where your son Was sleeping with my friend. I looked around the room. Every familiar face now look like that of a stranger. You know what? You can keep the house, the furniture, the gifts. But, Miguel, I suggest you get a good job, because you won't have access to my money anymore. What are you talking about? He asked, turning pale. I'm talking about how while I was overseas, I wasn't just working. I was also consulting a lawyer. I have proof of every penny I spent on this house, on you, on our marriage.

Eight year old woman. And when I was 13, my parents left me at a gas station to teach me a lesson. They never imagined I'd take that lesson seriously. It happened during one of those long, sticky summer road trips. The van was packed. Two siblings, a cooler full of melting sandwiches, my dad's country music playing just a little too loud. We were somewhere in the middle of nowhere. A stretch of cracked road framed by flat fields and heat shimmer. I asked for water, and my mom told me to run inside and grab a bottle. I hopped out, jogged into the gas station, found a cold bottle from the fridge, and walked to the counter with a couple of crumpled bills. I remember thinking I'd beat my siblings back to the van. I actually smiled. But when I stepped outside, the van was gone. At first I waited on the curb. Five minutes and 10. I walked around the side of the building, thinking maybe they pulled up to the air pump or went around the back. Nothing. I checked inside again. Still nothing. The cashier asked if I was okay. I told him my parents were probably just messing with me. I waited 30 minutes on that metal bench outside the door. Then an hour. The sun moved, shadows shifted, and the cars that came and went were never the right one. Cashier let me use the phone behind the counter. I dialed home. No answer. I tried my mom's cell, then my dad's. I left a voicemail. Another hour passed. The cashier called the local pool police. When the officers showed up, I gave them everything I could remember. Full names, our street address, what the van looked like, what everyone was wearing. One of the officers stayed with me while the other made a few calls. They offered me a juice from the mini fridge while I waited. Six hours after I'd been left there, my parents pulled back into the lot. No speeding, no panic. They parked like they were stopping for fuel. My mother stepped out first, adjusted her sunglasses, and asked the officers what the big deal was. She told them it was discipline, that I'd been acting out, and they thought I needed a wake up call. A reminder of what happens when you're careless or forget to follow directions. My father just nodded along, arms crossed. The police didn't press charges. They said it was a parental overreaction, but that no law had technically been broken. They warned my parents not to do anything like that again. I sat in the backseat of the van the whole drive home, silent. No one said anything to me. My brother laughed the next morning and said I looked like a scared puppy. When they finally picked me up, my sister rolled her eyes and told me to stop being dramatic. At school that fall, I didn't tell anyone what Happened. I just became quiet, focused. I turned in my assignments early, stayed out of group activities, ate lunch alone when I could. I stopped expecting birthday cakes or bedtime hugs. I stopped expecting anything, really. I started preparing quietly. I kept granola bars in my backpack, just in case. Learned how to open my bedroom window from the outside using a fork. I began hiding emergency cash in an old DVD case. I didn't know what I was preparing for. I just knew I needed to be ready for the next time I was left behind. We never spoke about the gas station again. Not even once. It became one of those family moments that got edited out like a bad photo. Everyone moved on except me. I never really had a choice. When I turned 18, I applied to every out of State College I could afford the application fee for. I got into one six states away. I packed everything I owned into two suitcases and left the morning after graduation. No party, no photos. No one helped me load the cab. My mother was watering her plants when I left. My father didn't look up from the television. I moved into a dorm with strangers and never went back. Over the years, I built something for myself. It wasn't perfect, but it was mine. A job I earned without any referrals. An apartment I furnished, one thrifted chair at a time. Friends who hugged hello and remembered My birthday. People who noticed when I was quiet and asked if I was okay. No one ever left me standing alone in a parking lot. I didn't cut my parents off completely. I didn't block their numbers. I didn't change mine. But I never called. I never messaged first. The last time I saw them was three years ago at a cousin's wedding. They smiled like everything was normal. Like I hadn't spent hours alone at 13. Wondering if I'd been kidnapped or forgotten. And now, 15 years later, something's happened. Something big. Something that dragged them back into my life. After all this time, they're about to learn what it really feels like to be left behind for good. Last week, I got a call from my mother. It came through in the middle of a work day. I saw

Growing up, my sister Brooke never let me forget I was adopted. While our parents showered us both with love, she'd whisper things like they only got you because the agency had a two for one sale. Or at least I know where I came from. I tried not to let it bother me, but every comment chipped away at my confidence. I was 8 when my parents chose me. They already had Brooke, who was 6 at the time, but they wanted another child. After seeing me at the agency, they said it felt like I was meant to be part of our family. But Brooke never accepted me. He'd hide my homework, blame me for things she broke, and tell other kids at school I was second hand goods. Despite her constant bullying, I worked hard in school while Brooke partied and barely maintained a C average. I was taking advanced classes and studying late into the night. Our parents noticed the difference, but didn't want to compare us. They praise both of us equally, even when Brooke clearly didn't deserve it. Everything changed during our senior year. Brooke was failing three classes and risk not graduating. Instead of studying, she spent her time making tik toks about how adopted kids were damaged goods and posting Instagram stories mocking my generic brand DNA. One day, I overheard her on the phone with Her friend. My parents only adopted her because they felt sorry for her. But watch. When college applications come around, they'll realise blood is thicker than water. All their money is going to their real daughter's education. That was the last straw. I had already been accepted to Princeton with a partial scholarship, but I hadn't told anyone yet. I decided to let Brooke dig her own grave. Every time she skipped class to hang out with her boyfriend, I kept quiet. When she forged our mom's signature on her failed math test, I looked the other way. I watched as she dug herself deeper and deeper. The day college decisions were released, our parents gathered

But whenever I ask if he wants to hang out on the weekend, he, like, he always comes up with an excuse about why he can't. So you're dating a married guy? Basically. See, that's what my friend said she was like. Any guy that prefers dating during the week but won't see you on the weekends either has a weekend girl or is married. And you're his secret side piece. Okay, before we get too far into this, what is this guy's name? Jonathan. Okay, you said it's been about a month or so? Yes. Okay, let me ask the stupid question here. Does this guy work on the weekends? No, he's. He's an investment broker. So they don't even do business on the weekends except maybe play golf. Okay, see, an investment broker. He just sounds married. It's a married person job. I mean, I. I guarantee he's married, has kids and everything. Okay, pump your brakes here. When. When you guys go out? Heather, you said it's during the week? Yes. Does he ever seem like he's trying to be secretive when you're together? And by that, I mean, like, does he say, let's meet somewhere instead of picking you up? Does he take you places that are like 45 minute drives out of town? That kind of stuff? No, not really. We're pretty open. With our dating. So like, for instance, like on Valentine's Day, he took me to the melting pot and he kissed me in the parking lot in front of everybody. So. Okay, it doesn't mean he's not married. I mean, what if his family like, lives in another town and he just works here? I don't know. I mean, I met him on a dating website and he basically talked about how hard dating is. And he told me about his ex girlfriend. He just doesn't sound like he's married. Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, he could have just been making all of that up. We know people like that. Okay, so. So you want us to do what, Heather? Find out if he's married. That would be a great start, yeah. Okay. And I guess maybe find out why he's always busy on the weekends. I mean, maybe he just likes to have alone time on the weekends. We don't know, but we can find out. Hang on the line so we can get his number from you. Okay? Okay. Okay. How much money do you wanna put on this whole married thing? How much money? Yeah, how much money you wanna bet? I don't know. I don't wanna bet money. I mean, it's. It's dirty work Wednesday. How about this? How about if. Alright, if he is, if he's married, like you think, I will take you to chick fil A. But if he's not married, Then you have to take me and Shaggy to Pizza Hut Buffet today for lunch.

Like, don't tell him about it. Yeah, totally. That's so exciting. Yeah, we, uh, we stole his phone over the weekend for a few minutes, and we were writing down all the phone numbers of people he's friends with and, you know, people he talks to all the time, and your number came up, and I was like, oh, that must be his new girlfriend that he keeps talking about. So we're really excited to finally meet you. Oh, hold on. He said that I was his girlfriend? Is that. Well, no, not really. But we all kind of know he's been seeing somebody new. Oh, yeah.

And so I show up, and I kind of do, like, the whole, you know, sexy underwear under the jacket thing. And then while I was there, she freaking shows up. Oh, my god, are you serious? Yeah, it was totally insane. And so she shows up, and then the security guy actually knows her. So I guess she just walked into his office, and I'm, like, in my underwear and shit. And so. Wait, Did you close my bag? And quickly. And I'm. Well, I hit under the desk. Oh, my god. It. It was the craziest moment of my life. She was, like, yelling at him about something, and I'm sitting there under his desk, um. And he's, like, right in front of me, and I'm like, do, do, Like, I'm. Yeah. So she. She never saw you at all? No, she never saw me. I was so freaking scared, though. My heart was, like, pumping out of my freaking chest, and. And it was totally insane. Yeah, sounds like it. And now, what about your boyfriend? Does he know? I'm sorry, what about my. What? She said, what about your boyfriend? Does he know? And you can go ahead and answer that with a, yeah, he knows, you stupid bitch. Oh, wow. What the hell was that? Did you hear that? Hear, hear what? I thought it was my boyfriend on the line. Am I like the loot? What's happening? Actually, Lauren, this is the Z Morning Zoo radio show, and right now, dirty work Wednesday is what's happening. That was your boyfriend. He kind of suspected something was going on with you and your boss, and, like, I guess he was right. Why? Who. Who is everybody here? Why are you in on this conversation? Can you please put Scott's sister back on the phone? Nope. I mean, actually, we don't even know if he has a sister. Okay, I'm just so confused right now. Well, um, that's cause you're a stupid idiot.

So did you get the date, or did she just have you donate and then not call you back and that's why you're emailing? Oh, I mean, like, it took a couple weeks. You know, I would text her, and she's like, I'm busy with this. You know, I have this work stuff. But after two weeks, I got the date. Oh, man. Nice. Congrats, my man. I bet you were nervous leading up to that night. Oh, Man, I. I was so nervous, but I took her out to this really nice Italian place. It was super romantic.

You can't stop with the lies, man. She should have clued you while you were ahead. Chris, how much for a kiss? Okay, now you're just turning her into a prostitute. No, no, She actually said, uh, that's not allowed. It actually came with the bed. That's what she said. That was her response? Yeah. No, I kid you not. She leaned in and kissed me right there. Oh, congrats. Oh, my god. Wow. I can't believe it. Okay, you are in love. I totally am. Why the hell is she not calling you back? That's what I can't figure out. I mean, it's just the next two days, you know, we were really, like, texting, like, a lot, you know, back and forth. But then, you know, as the week kind of went on, it was less and less, and the next week, it was barely anything. I was trying to get her to go out on another date. I kept getting not much of a response. And did you send her anything inappropriate? No, no, I was a perfect gentleman, I promise. Yeah, send her a picture and go, how much to touch this? It's like, how far can I go with this charity option? Yeah. No, I promise. Guys, I. I don't know. I'm like. Like, why would she kiss me at the end of it if, you know, the date was going horribly? Yeah, I mean, there's gotta be 20 other guys that are lining up for dates with her cause she's just so hot. All right.

What? You know, like, your friend who thinks that she's dating you or whatever. What's her name? Like, Rachel, I think she. You said that she's the one that. That stalks you while you're working. Oh, my god. What. What did she say? She. She was like, oh, he's not yours anymore. I'm dating him now or whatever, like, some shit like that. Babe, I told you since I started, you can't be sweating about groupies like this. Okay, so that's what she is then, right? A creepy. Yes. Look, I don't even know how she got your number. Hold up. I'm a groupie? That is not what you said a few minutes ago. Wait, sorry, who's this? It's Rachel. I told you, sweetheart, I tried to warn you. Wait, did you. Did you hang up? How are you on the phone right now? Hey, Danny. Who. Who the hell is that? Danny, this is the Z Morning Zoo on Z1 O four, and right now, you're on dirty work Wednesday. We actually have Rachel and Melissa on the phone with you right now. Okay. Okay. So are you gonna explain to me why you're calling me? A groupie behind my back? I, I, I didn't call you that. I just heard you say it. And you said it to your supposedly ex girlfriend. What is wrong with you? Yeah, the one that you, uh, called a bitch and you thought I wasn't listening? I definitely didn't say that. Oh, actually, Danny, you did. Shag. Yep. Here you go. Don't worry about her. She's crazy. Her friends are bitches. She's the biggest bitch of the whole group. Okay, what the fuck is going on right now? Seriously? I, I, I, I think, Danny, that's what the ladies would like to know. Just tell me the truth. Are you still with your ex? Are you with Melissa? Yes. And remember, she's listening right now. Danny, I, I, I don't know what you want me to say to you. How about the truth? That might be nice to hear. I thought you broke up with this bitch. I did. I did. Really? Cause we weren't broken up on Sunday when you spent the night here. Oh, okay, okay, listen. I'm sorry. You want the truth? Here's the truth. Okay? I care about both of you too much to break up with you, and I'm not just gonna dump you. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do that to you. To either of you. Okay, so. So instead you just keep messing around with both of them? That's not a great solution either. Dude, dude, you can just shut your Mouth bro. Okay, as far as I'm concerned, this is your fault. This is fine. Okay, so then what's your answer? Are you with her or are you with me? Tell me right now. Okay, what I can say is I'm just not with this drama or these games. Okay? So bye. All right. Okay, well, I don't feel like we really got an answer there. Well, I got the answer right, so I could to hear. What's that? Him calling you a bitch? Um, no. Him admitting that you still don't mean shit to him. I have a question here. Why the hell are either one of you still with him? He's obviously screwing you both over.

Uh. Oh, alright, what is the guy's name? It's Danny. Okay, and what is his ex's name? Her name is Melissa. Melissa. Okay. Alright, so give me the story. Alright, so, um, Danny's a personal trainer, but he's also part of a male review. Um, and that's like how he makes the most of his money. Alright, hold on a second. A. Like a male review? Like Magic Mike style? Like male dancers? Yeah. Oh my god, which one is it? I bet I know. Um, I don't wanna say, but I think it's probably the one you're thinking of. I bet it is. I mean, I couldn't imagine. Dating a guy that does that for a living isn't that hard. Um, I mean, it's kind of strange watching him work, but, um, I mean, as long as he's coming home at night, like, I'm okay with it, you know? Okay, so how does the ex play into all of this? So a few weeks ago I went to see one of his shows, and I was in the bathroom, like, touching up my lipstick, and I all of a sudden was surrounded by this group of girls. And they tell me, just so you know, Danny's with Melissa still. And you should stop trying to be a side piece, cause that's all you are to him. And I was like, excuse me? And they're like, yeah, you heard us. You're side piece. You're Danny. Danny's with Melissa and you're the side chick, so. Alright, so this is like straight out of high school intimidation tactics? Yeah, I mean, it was like Mean Girls or something. And so I like, I go to Danny and I'm like, hey, is your ex here right now? And he's like, yeah, I'm sorry about that. Just ignore. And I was like, okay, well, it's not her that's the problem. It's her friends. Um, like, they're coming up to me. But anyways, it was like a couple weeks ago, and since then, like, they keep showing up like every week and it's like they're trying to scare me or something. Okay, did you ask Danny about the whole still being with Melissa part? Yeah, um, he said that they're not together anymore. But, um, why does it sound like you're not sure you believe him? I mean, I don't know, I, I, I tried to text her to like, handle things like adults, but she never wrote me back. Okay, so you got no answer? No, I got none. So who do you believe here? Do you think he's still with her and you're just the side piece? Or do you think he's just with you? I mean, I, that's what I wanna find out. That's why I called you guys. Okay, so you want us to find out for You? Yeah, cause I mean, if you like. You still with her? Like, I'm not gonna look stupid in front of everybody, right? Not trying to be like someone side chick. Okay, well, we can try to find out. I mean, you guys think like a Three Way call? Maybe get Danny and his ex on the phone, see what he says about Rachel? I mean, yeah, that might work. Actually. Actually, I think I got a better idea. Rachel, you did say you had the ex's phone number, right? Yeah, I mean, I think it's her. I mean, like, it didn't write me back, so I don't really know if it's her or not, but I think it's her. Okay, I say we call the ex up first and find out if it is her. If it is, I think I have a great, great idea. Okay, shag, your plan is we're gonna call the ex. Yep. Melissa. And see if she will agree to this. What we think we're gonna do is we're gonna call Danny twice. Once we're gonna call as if Rachel's calling him. Yep. And then. And then ask about Melissa. Yep. Then she can hang up, she can hear everything, but she's gonna basically be on mute. Slash can't say anything. Then we're gonna hang up, call him back as Melissa, and ask about Rachel. If this works, this is gonna be really good. This is like dirt. Fly on the wall stuff here, darling. At red. Hey, so this is. The top number you gave me is Melissa's. Correct. Okay, so this would be Melissa we're calling. Hello? Good morning. I'm calling to speak to Melissa, please. Okay, who's calling? This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show. Nick, Ashley and Shaggy on Z 1:04. Okay, what are you. What are you calling me for? Well, actually, we have a girl on the other line with us. Her name is Rachel, and I believe you may know her. Uh, uh, yeah, I'm familiar with her. Okay, so here's the thing. She is apparently dating Danny. But according to your friends, she's a side piece because Danny is with you. Yeah. No, no, no. She was dating Danny, but he broke up with her. Uh, I don't think so. Uh, haha. Uh, yeah, I think so, honey. Okay, so, shag, why don't you go over your plan real quick? Okay, so here's my plan. So, okay, ladies, what we wanna do is basically have each of you call Danny one at a time. This way you can hear the truth while he's on with the other person. And since we have a third line, all you have to do is just kind of sit back and listen. Okay, but the only rule is you can't interrupt while he's on with the other person. We think this way, once and for all, the truth is gonna come out. The truth will set you free. But First, it will piss you off. Exactly. Exactly. Yes. Okay, so. Alright, so this way you get to hear what he says about you guys while the other person is talking to the other person. Is this okay with you, Rachel? Yeah, I mean, it's fine. I think she needs to hear this. Okay. And that's fine with you, Melissa? I mean, if she wants to get her heart broken and humiliate herself, then yeah, by all means, that's fine. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Okay, so, Rachel, we're gonna call Danny right now, and then you could talk to him first. Just a heads up, though, he's probably not gonna recognize the number we're using. So is he the type of person who will answer a number he doesn't recognize? Yeah, I think he'll answer. I mean, he uses this phone for booking gigs, so he usually answers strange calls thinking it might be work. Okay, so when he answers, just tell him it's your new phone or something so he doesn't suspect anything's up. Okay. Alright, here we go. Okay.

Wow. Okay, so let's start off with your girlfriend. What is your girlfriend's name? Kate. Kate. Okay, so on Saturday, you were out of town? Yeah, I went on a fishing trip this past weekend with some of my buddies from college, and so I was gone the whole weekend. Okay. And this left Kate by herself? Yeah, and, well, actually, this is part of the story, too. You know, when Kate and I first started dating, we were together every day, all the time. And anytime I would go on a trip for something or work or whatever, she would ask if she could come with me. But a couple of weeks ago, when I told her I was going on this fishing trip, she just said okay. It was like it didn't bother her at all. So she used to be really clingy, but now she's kind of like, meh, fine, whatever. Yeah, and like I said, she never, ever used to be that way. Well, maybe she's just getting used to, like, you guys being, like, an exclusive couple. Like, I know I used to be that way with Kyle back when we first started dating. Now if he calls me and he's like, oh, I'm working overtime, I'm just like, okay, that's fine. Bring home Beer. Because I'm empty, so. So it's kind of like that new car smell wore off a little. I mean, I don't know if it's that so much as you just get used to things, basically, that's all. Okay, so do you think that's what it is, Dan? Maybe she's just used to you leaving. I mean, I don't know. I guess it could be. I'm not sure, but I mean, here's how I found out that she went up to dinner. So Saturday afternoon, we're out on the water, it's getting probably, I don't know, almost getting dark. And probably around 6 or so, I get this text message from a friend of mine. And he's like, hey, dude, is this your lady? And he sends me a picture of Kate eating dinner with this other dude. Oh, wow. Okay, so how did this friend get this pic of her? Did he take it? Yeah, he was. He was eating at the same place. Okay. Okay, I have a couple of questions. So first of all, what was she wearing? Was it like jeans and a T-shirt, or was she dressed up a little? Cause I mean, I feel like that is gonna tell us a lot about what kind of dinner this was. No, she was definitely dressed up. She had a dress on. It was a short dress, like one of those sundresses. Okay, well, where were they eating? There's that new fuck place over on linhaven. Oh, I've been there. That's. Yeah, I, I, I took Nicole there for a date night. That is not exactly the type of place for a casual let's meet as friends kind of get together. Okay, so you get this message while you're out on the boat? Yeah. I'm surprised you had a signal. Like, so when you got it, did you call her? Did you call Kate and be like, so how's dinner going? Oh, I, I texted her and I was like, hey, I missed you. What are you doing right now? And she wrote, nothing. Just sitting on the couch, watching TV. Oh, wow. Okay. And how clear was this picture also? I mean, like, you were 100% positive it was her? Oh, yeah, definitely her. Did you recognize the guy that she was with? No. I mean, that's why I called you guys. Okay, so you would like to know who this other guy was then? Yeah, I wanna know who he is and why she felt like she had to lie to me about it. Okay, yeah, that, that's an important part of this too. Cause even if we find out, then, like, maybe she says it was just a friend. Well, then why did you feel like you had to lie about it? And why did you get all dressed up then? Like, I, I wish I could actually see this picture, like, what she's wearing. And if we, if we give you Ashley's Phone number. When we go to commercial break, will you text her the picture while we go to break so she can kind of do her thing? Yes. Can you send me a copy so I can do my detective work and carefully analyse what I think is going on? Yeah, I can do that. Okay, so when we come back, we'll get Kate on the phone with us and we'll try to figure out who this guy was and what the whole deception was about. Give me the sneaky music, because here was our plan of action. We decided it would be best to text Kate. Kate is the girlfriend. And pretend to be the guy who took her to the restaurant. So we texted Kate we have her number. Pretending to be the dude who took her to the restaurant. This is going to get good. So, Ashley, start with the conversation from the beginning that you had with Kate. Okay, so the first thing I said was, hey, it's me. Just got a new phone, so that's why the number is different. By the way, a buddy of mine asked if we like that place I took to. I took you on Saturday. I told him I liked it, and he wanted to know if you did. And then she wrote back, loved it. Okay, so this establishes that it was the other good dude. We're trying to pretend to be him. Yeah. Here's where it gets Good. Okay, so I wrote back, did you think it was romantic? And she wrote, yes. Then I wrote this. I said, my friend said, ask her if it's the type of place where if I took a girl, she would sleep with me. And she wrote back, well, it worked for you, didn't it? And then she put the little winky face with the tongue out. Okay. And when she sent that message, it was all, like, in the studio, it was all kind of quiet. And then Ashley goes, oh, my god. And so we're all like, what? And then she showed us. Yeah, so whoever this guy is, it looks like she slept with him, too. And that's the bad news that we just shared off the air with Dan. So we just asked Dan if you want us to call her, and, Dan, you said no, correct? I mean, I don't know. I don't really see the point now. Well, okay, here's why I think we should still do it. First of all, we still don't know who this guy is. Second, you. Do you think you're probably gonna dump her after this? I mean, there's no probably about it. Okay, then if you're gonna dump her anyways, I say we do it on the air as, like, a payback. But again, it's totally up to you. We don't have to do anything. I mean, I guess I do want to know who this guy is. And she's not gonna tell me, so. Okay, let's do it. Let's

This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Hello. How's it going? Good. I'm sorry, who are you? From Jubal, from Brooke and Jubal in the morning, the Radio show. Am I disturbing you at work or something? You sound, uh. Yeah, sorry, I'm. I don't mean to be rude. Why? I'm. No. Is this like a promotion to buy something? It is not a promotion to buy something. I'm actually calling you because a listener of ours sent us an email about you, and he wanted us to call you. Okay, I'll explain. His name is Kevin. You and him recently went out on a date. You probably remember Kevin, because he couldn't find the restaurant you were supposed to go to, and you ended up going back to your place and just having a few beers. Right. Okay, well, Kevin really liked you and is wondering why you're not calling him back. Is there something that Kevin did on your date to make you not want to see him again? You know, I just don't really feel like it's something to talk about, and. Yeah, okay, but is it More than him not being able to find the restaurant? No, that was super irritating. And, like, what grown man can't find a freaking restaurant? But, yeah. No, that's not the issue. That's not the issue? No. Is he. Is this some. Did he just, like, write an email and you guys are calling me and, like, wasting my day, or. Yep, that's pretty much exactly what happened. And I know. I know that you're at work, and you sound busy, and I don't want you to. He's just. What's that? I just want to know, like, what. The premise of this, so that way I know if I need to change my phone number. Whoa. No, we won't be calling you ever again after this. I'd appreciate you, though, hanging on, because it's a segment we do on our show called The Second Date Update. Basically, we want to tell Kevin what he did wrong on your date so he can learn not to do it again on other dates. It sounds like you don't want to see him again. Can you tell us what the main issue is? What did he do? He. I went to the kitchen to make us a drink, and when I came out, he wasn't in the living room. Where I left him, and where he was coming out from did not seem like the bathroom. And he seemed really weird about it. Like, he just seemed weird. And then I went, I Went back. It just got really awkward. It's not that big of an apartment, so it's not that hard to find the bathroom. And my door to my bedroom was a jar. You think you went in your room? I think he stole a pair of my freaking panties. What? What? For real? And I do not want him anywhere near me. Hold up. Okay, I was just gonna say that he went into your room, and that's weird, but you think that he stole a pair of your underwear? I think he couldn't find a restaurant, but he could find my freaking underwear drawer. Okay, Olivia, that's a. Like, that's it. That's a big claim. Are you sure you're not just imagining something? Why would you think that he would do that? He was just so weird, and it just. It was, like, awkward from the beginning, and I felt like I'd made a bad decision, even when I was letting him into my apartment, and it just got worse. And then when he wasn't in the living room, like, why didn't he just say, hey, can I please use your bathroom? Like, having common courtesy if you're a stranger, right? And then are you just assuming that he stole your underwear? Like, how do you. Are you missing underwear? The jar was a jar. Yeah, you could have possibly left that there, right? Yeah, but if you have a gut feeling about something, and I don't remember hearing The toilet run? Like, you know how after you pee and you flush, it kind of, like, runs for a little bit to fill up? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I don't remember hearing that. Are you missing underwear? I have, like, a hundred. Okay, so you don't know. I know. I know every single one of my underwear. They're all catalogued and charted. Yeah, I know. And I'm missing a pair. I wouldn't know either. So you don't. You don't really know. You don't have any proof that he took your underwear. But that's just what you're thinking. Yeah, I think he's really weird, and he creeped me out, and the freak flag went off, and I. Yeah, asked him to leave my apartment. You don't wanna ask him if he did take your underwear? Uh, sorry. My boss is giving me a weird look. I'll be right back. Okay. What was your question? You don't want to ask him if he did take your underwear? No, I don't ever want to talk to this guy again. Are you sure? Oh, that's a shame, because, Olivia, he's actually on the other line, and I would love to find out. Kevin, did you steal Olivia's underwear? Seriously?

I was only sleeping with you because you were so pathetic and I didn't want it. I didn't want you to just. Oh my god. Oh my god! Kill yourself or something when I broke up with you. I don't know. Listen, I gotta get off the phone. I'm sick of it. I'm going to your house. I'm telling your wife you got me pregnant. Chris.

Hi, is this Carolyn? Yes. Hey, Carolyn. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. Why are you calling me? Well, solid question. Because we do a segment on our show. It's called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody and end up not calling them back after, they can email us to get you on the phone and ask what happened. And we got an email about you from a dude named Jack. Oh, I'm so confused right now. What? I'll try one more time. So you went out on a date with a guy named Jack? Yeah, I did. Kind of. How did you know that? Because Jack emailed us. Jack emailed you? Yeah, about our date. Well, he emailed us because he said he had a really good time with you. But now you're not calling him back or answering his text messages, and he's confused. It's a good time. He said we had a good time? Yeah. Is this a joke? Am I being pranked right now? Wait, are you arguing with the fact that about the good time? Like, the good time is what's freaking you out? I don't even know Jack. Like, we didn't even go on a date. What? You just said you did. Kind of. We were supposed to go on a date. Like, our work friend, like, set it up with us, but he came into The bar, and he sat at a different table with another girl. Wait, what? What? Yeah. No way. Wait, you were at the bar to meet Jack? Jack walks in and goes and sits with a different woman? That's what I mean. Like, I kind of went on a date with him, but it didn't actually happen because he sat at a different table. Wait, did you ever talk to him? No. We were texting a little bit to set up the date, but I've never talked to him in the face. So, wait, you. You watched him walk in, sit at a different table, and then you didn't approach him? Yeah, I was just sitting there, and then he came in, walked right past me, and was talking to some other girl the whole time. So I wasn't sure if I made a mistake or he made a mistake. But I realized a whole thing was a mistake when I got a text from him later where he was telling me that he had a great time and he'd like to hang out again. That's awkward. Wait, though, so he accidentally went out on a date with another woman that was at the bar, who he thought was Carolyn? I mean, that's what it looks like. I don't know. How does that even happen? I mean, I have no idea. All I know is that he walked in, he sat down at another table, was chatting with this girl, Who looks nothing like me, you know? And then they shared a kiss outside the bar when they were done. Wait, wait, wait. You stayed and watch their whole date? Yeah, I was already having my drink, so I was just gonna finish it. And then I was like, watching them because they look like they're having a really good time. And I was kind of like, address the whole situation with myself. I was just really confused and I want. I mean, it was kind of funny at the end. Yeah, I would have ordered. I would have ordered food and just sit next to him and hear the conversation. Yeah, I was just like, really slowly sipping my drink because I didn't know what was happening. Well, and what. I mean, like, in an entire evening. Why did you never go up and tell him that you were Carolyn? I mean, he looked like he was having a good time with that girl. And you know, if somebody makes a stupid mistake like that, like, I really don't want to, like, talk to them or go on a date with them. So it was almost like a blessing in disguise, cause, like, how do you make a mistake like that? Like, did you never ask her if her name was Carolyn? Like, I don't understand. Right? I wonder if her name was Carolyn. Like, what are the chances of her name being Carolyn? No way does she look Kind of like you at all. We have the same color hair. Blonde. But, you know, I honestly think I'm a little bit prettier than her, and I don't. I know that sounds bad, but, like, I am. And how did she sit through a whole date being called Carolyn? Yeah, we needed to talk to Jack. To figure it out? Yeah, good luck figuring it out. I don't. I know him. And I know that he didn't go out with me, so that's gonna be a hard one to crack. Well, you wanna hang on and figure out what happened? Because he's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you.

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day, my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello? Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce, I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple extra Expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with, so I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line. So I ran up by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why don't wait? Till you get home, you check the email, you call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria. Because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

What did you learn? When I started dating William, I didn't know his family owned half the expensive restaurants in our city. I was a waitress at a diner, making minimum wage, living in a tiny studio apartment with a broken heater. On our first date, I suggested we meet at my usual coffee spot. He showed up in a Tesla, looking completely out of place among the regular customers with their chipped mugs and laptop chargers. I noticed right away how he kept touching everything with his sleeve pulled over his hand. When I asked if he wanted to split a muffin, he politely declined, saying he wasn't hungry. Later, I found out he'd never eaten at a place that didn't have at least one Michelin star. Despite our differences, we clicked. He was funny, smart, and genuinely interested in my life. He didn't act superior when I told him about my community college classes or my dreams of opening my own bakery someday. everything changed when he invited me to his family's monthly dinner. I spent two weeks tips on a dress from a consignment shop. It was navy blue with tiny pearls on the collar, the nicest thing I'd ever owned. When I arrived at their mansion, the maid who opened the door looked more expensive than me. William's mother took one look at my dress and said, oh, darling, is that vintage? How sustainable of you. The dinner Was a nightmare. They had five different forks, and I used the wrong one for my salad. William's sister asked what my parents did for a living. When I explained that my mom worked at Walmart and my dad wasn't in the picture, she choked on her wine. But where did you summer as a child? He asked, completely serious. Then came the incident that changed everything. William's mother announced that their chef had prepared a special truffle risotto. I took one bite, and my throat started closing up. Turns out they'd use some fancy mushroom I was severely allergic to. Didn't have my Epipen because I'd never encountered it at any place I could actually afford to eat. William rushed me to the hospital in his Tesla. While I was still on the journey, his mother swept in, wearing her designer coat. Instead of asking if I was okay, she pulled William aside, and I heard her whisper, darling, if she can't even handle proper cuisine, how will she survive the Governor's Ball? That's when William surprised everyone. He turned to his mother and said, actually, Nancy makes the best chocolate souffle I've ever tasted. Better than your chefs. Mother gasped like he'd slapped her. She's been teaching me to bake, he continued. I'm investing in her bakery idea. And if you can't handle that, we won't be at any of your balls. His mother stormed out. Later that night, still in my hospital gown, William confessed something he'd Been taking secret baking lessons at a community center. Because he wanted to understand my passion. He showed me videos on his phone. Him covered in flour, burning cookies, setting off smoke alarms. Three years later, our bakery, Humble Crumbs, is the most popular spot in town. We serve both two dollar cookies and two hundred dollar wedding cakes. William's mother still won't eat here, but his sister became our biggest customer. She even admitted our five dollar muffins taste better than the fifty dollar ones at her country club. The best part? We still use those chipped mugs from our first date coffee shop. I bought their whole set when they were going out of business. William doesn't use his sleeve to touch them anymore. Last week, a food critic called our place unpretentiously perfect. William framed the review right next to my old consignment shop dress.

My university had this stupid rule where we couldn't have pets in our dorms, not even fish. The punishment was a 500 dollar fine and immediate removal of the animal. But my therapy cat, Luna, helped with my anxiety attacks. I wasn't about to give her up. Barbara, our dorm supervisor, was absolutely obsessed with enforcing this rule. She done random room checks for 15 years and bragged about confiscating over 50 pets. She even kept a wall of photos in her office showing all the contraband animals she'd caught, like some twisted trophy collection. My first week, she caught someone with a hamster and made this huge show of calling animal control. While the poor girl sobbed, Barbara just stood there smirking, telling everyone, rules are rules, dear. I knew I had to be smart about keeping Luna, so instead of just sneaking her in, I spent three days reading every single page of the university's housing policies. Most of it was boring stuff about noise levels and trash disposal. But on page 43, I found exactly what I needed. No pets or animals are permitted in university housing facilities unless specifically required for documented medical conditions. The keyword was documented. Nowhere did it specify who needed to do the documenting. So I went to my regular therapist and got her to write an official letter stating that Luna was essential for managing my anxiety. I Also printed out research papers about the benefits of emotional support animals. When Barbara burst into my room during a random inspection and saw Luna, her eyes lit up like she just won the lottery. Well, well, what do we have here?

Hi. Um, this is gonna sound really strange. Um, we don't know each other, but I was out running and I found somebody's phone, and I'm trying to track down who it belongs to. And so I was, I just started calling people in this phone, and I wanted to make sure whoever lost it gets their phone back. Okay, so I called you because whoever's phone this is just texted you a couple days ago. So basically, I called you cause I was hoping maybe you could help me find them. Oh, I got you. Um, well, the number you're calling from doesn't come up as one of my contacts, so I'm not really sure whose phone you have. Right, well, no, I, I, I'm not calling from the actual phone because I didn't want to use up their minutes or anything. So can I, can I just read you a text real quick, and then maybe you can look through your text conversations and tell me who sent it to you? Um, sure. Okay. Uh, hang on a second. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so, um, they sent you a message a few days ago, whoever this is, that said, um, that's fine, but I'm paying next time. You earned it. And then it has a heart and a winky face, so I assume maybe it was your wife or your girlfriend or something, cause that's, that's, that's why I called you. Well, it's not my wife. Cause I'm not married. But, yeah, I, I know whose phone that is. Oh, okay, great. Um, is there any way you could possibly give me their name so I can look up their address to kind of return their phone to them? Not really comfortable giving out her information. Um, maybe you could just turn it into the cops or something, and I can get a hold of her and let her know they have it. Okay, I gotcha. I didn't think about the fact that, like, trying to track down a woman I've never met is kind of creepy. No, no, it's cool. I, I mean, it's, it's nice that you're doing the right thing. I just don't think she'd want me giving out her personal info like that. I, I understand. Um, one more thing, though. Um, why does this phone number come up as Chris when it calls you? I'm sorry, what? When this phone that I found, when it calls you or text you, why does it come up as Chris? You just said this was a woman's phone. How. How do you know that? How do I know it's a woman's phone? You just told me it

Suddenly, day one without cigarettes and my body declared war on me. I've been smoking since I was 15. Half my life spent inhaling roughly 14,600 packs. That 292,000 cigarettes. At five minutes per cigarette, I'd spent nearly three years of my life just smoking. The decision wasn't dramatic. No cancer diagnosis or ultimatum. Just a moment when I watched my five year old daughter pretend to smoke a crayon, holding it exactly how I hold my marl bros. Right down to the way she flicked imaginary ash. What are you doing, Emma? I asked, already knowing I'm being you, daddy, she said, taking another pretend drag. I quit that night. Flushed the cigarettes, deleted my smoke break alarms and told no one. Previous attempts had failed when announced, like my brain needed an audience for its surrender. By 10:00am Wednesday, my hands trembled so badly I spilled coffee across my keyboard. My coworker noticed. Hangover? He asked. Quitting smoking, I admitted. His eyebrows shot up. Cold Turkey. Jesus, Mark, that's like jumping out of a plane without checking if your parachute works. By afternoon, the headache arrived. Not dull, but primal, like my skull was being crushed in a vice. Every sound became weaponized. The office printer might as well have been a jackhammer beside my ear. That night, I dreamt of cigarettes. Not just smoking them, I was swimming through to them. Thousands floating in a sea of tobacco. Each One calling my name. Day two brought rage, pure, irrational fury that made me snap at Emma for dropping her spoon at breakfast. It's just a spoon, I shouted immediately, horrified at myself. Her little face crumpled. My wife Jen took her to school instead of me. Get it together, she whispered. Call your doctor. My doctor prescribed nicotine patches, which felt like cheating, but also like survival. Your brain is literally rewiring itself, he explained. The receptors that have been flooded with nicotine for years are screaming for it. Day three. The insomnia was so bad I hallucinated. My mouth produced saliva like I was about to vomit. Constantly. Food tasted like wet cardboard. I found myself standing outside a gas station at 2 a m. Staring at the cigarette ads. Making a teenager exiting looked at me with concern. You okay, Mister? I wasn't, but I didn't buy cigarettes. Day 5 brought the dreams again. I dreamt I was smoking and woke up with crushing guilt, patting the bed for cigarette burns before realizing it wasn't real. The physical symptoms were brutal, but nothing compared to the psychological warfare. Every stress trigger felt like neon signs flashing S M O K E N O W. Day 7. Could suddenly smell everything. My co workers Cologne from across the room, the garbage from inside the house while I was still in the driveway. The lingering smoke in my car upholstery that I've been nose blind to for years. I Deep cleaned my car that weekend, gagging at the yellow residue that came off the windows. Day 14. I could climb the stairs without sounding like I was dying. My daughter noticed. Daddy, you're not making the scary breathing anymore. Day 30. The craving still ambushed me, but less frequently. I gained 8 pounds, but my skin had lost its grayish tint. My wife kissed me one morning and paused. Your mouth tastes friend, she said. Better. Day 60. I found an old jacket with a forgotten pack in the pocket. Instead of excitement, I felt revulsion. I showed my wife, who watched nervously as I crushed each one under the faucet. I didn't think you'd actually do it this time, she admitted. Neither did I, I confessed. It's been six months now. The money I've saved, nearly $2,000, paid for Emma's first real bicycle and a weekend away with my wife. My persistent cough disappeared. Food tastes incredible. Sometimes I still reach for cigarettes that aren't there. Phantom limb syndrome, but for addiction. But when Emma hugged me yesterday and said, you smell nice, daddy, instead of wrinkling her nose and pulling away, I knew with absolute certainty I would never smoke again. The war isn't over, but for the first time, I'm winning.

I used to be the person everyone called when they needed something. The one who would drop everything to help a friend move or stay late at work to finish someone else's project. My boss would text me at 11 p m. And I'd respond immediately. I'd cover shifts when co workers called in sick. I'd volunteer for the projects nobody wanted. I was raised to believe kindness would always come back to you. For five years at Davidson Media, I was the first to arrive and last to leave. I helped my co workers meet their deadlines. I brought coffee for the team when everyone was stressed. I even let my boss, Diane, take credit for my ideas during presentations because she said it would look better coming from management. When my dad got sick last year, I asked Diane if I could work remotely two days a week so I could drive him to chemo. She sighed and said, we really need you in the office, but I suppose we can make it work for a month or two. I was so grateful that I worked twice as hard on my office days, making sure nothing fell through the cracks. Dad's treatment was supposed to last six months, but after three months, Diane called me into her office. She said the remote arrangement wasn't working. The team needed me physically present every day. And besides, it Had been long enough. I explained that dad was only halfway through treatment. He couldn't drive himself and had no one else. She just stared at me until I lowered my eyes and said, I understand. I spent the next week burning through my savings to hire drivers for dad. I was exhausted, constantly worried about him, but still the first one in the office every morning. Then came the Maxwell Project, a huge account that could make or break our quarter. I spent weeks researching, building the pitch, creating mockups, everything. I even missed one of Dad's appointments to finish it. The day before the presentation, Diane asked to see my materials. I handed over everything, including my presentation notes. The next morning, I arrived early, excited to present my work, only to find the conference room already full. Diane was at the head of the table, showing my slides to the clients. I stood in the doorway, frozen as she used my exact words. My research, my ideas. When she saw me, she smiled and said, oh, good. Jennifer, can you grab coffee for everyone? We're just getting started. The client turned, saw me, and said, aren't you presenting this? Before I could answer, Diane jumped in and said, oh, no, this is my project. Jennifer just helped with some research. I got the coffee. I stood in the back of the room and watched as she was praised for my work. The client loved it. They signed A three year contract, the biggest in company history. When the executives came down to congratulate the team, Diane accepted all the praise. She got a bonus, she got a promotion. I got a fifty dollar gift card to Starbucks. That night, dad called. He'd fallen trying to get from the taxi to his front door. He had been lying on the ground for 20 minutes before a neighbor found him. If I had been there. I kept thinking, if I had just been there. Two days later, the company held a Celebration for the Maxwell deal. Diane was given an award. I stood and clapped with everyone else. Then came the announcement that made everything stop. Diane would now head up a new division created specifically for the Maxwell account. And she needed a strong team. She spent 10 minutes talking about the qualities she was looking for, then announced her first hire. Ryan. The guy who had been with the company for six months and hadn't contributed a single thing to the project. I sat there stunned as everyone congratulated him. Then Diane looked at me and said, Jennifer, I need those quarterly reports by end of day. I know you won't let me down. Something broke inside me. Five years. Five years of saying yes, of staying late, of missing time with my sick father. Five years of watching others take credit for my work. Five years of being nice. I stood up, walked to the bathroom, And stared at myself in the mirror. My hands were shaking. I barely recognized the woman looking back at me. That was the moment, that exact moment, when I decided being nice wasn't working anymore. I couldn't fit. What happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

They didn't know I own the hotel. I decided to keep quiet and observe the annual family reunion. It was a tradition my mother insisted on maintaining, though for me it always meant a weekend of constant comparisons and cutting remarks. This year would be no different, except that the luxurious hotel where we would stay was now my property, thanks to the inheritance my grandfather had secretly left me six months earlier. When I arrived at the lobby of Hotel Miramar, my heart was beating fast. I watched as my sister Lucia, the family favorite, was welcomed with hugs and smiles by everyone. No one noticed my presence until my mother saw me and frowned. I thought you wouldn't come, Carmen, she said, not bothering to hide her disappointment. I wouldn't miss our family reunion for anything in the world, I replied with a smile that didn't reach my eyes. My brother in law, Roberto, Luccia's husband, looked me up and down, evaluating my outfit as always. Seems like the graphic design business isn't so lucrative after all, he commented with a mocking smile. If only they knew my small company was now a respected agency with international clients. But I never bothered to correct their assumptions. What hurt me most was the secret I kept. This five star hotel with its impeccable gardens and Ocean View now belonged to me. Grandfather had always seen something in me that the Rest of the family ignored. We distributed the rooms, my mother announced as manager. Miguel handed out the keys. My sister and her husband received the presidential suite with Ocean View. My parents an executive suite, my cousins deluxe rooms. And me. Carmen, you'll stay in room 1 0 8 on the first floor, the room next to the laundry. The smallest and noisiest room in the hotel. Everyone exchanged glances, some with shame, others with poorly disguised amusement. Miguel, the manager, seemed uncomfortable. Ma'am, we could look for another option for the young lady, he began, but my mother interrupted him. It's not necessary. Carmen is simple. She doesn't need luxuries. I saw how Miguel looked at me with concern. He knew who I really was. But we had agreed to keep my position as owner's secret during this family reunion. It's fine, Miguel, I said calmly. Room 1:08 will be perfect. I took the key and headed to the elevator, feeling my family's eyes on my back. On the way, I heard my cousin Daniela whisper, as always, Carmen settles for the leftovers. The room was exactly as I remembered, small, with a window overlooking the service area and the constant noise of the laundry machines. I sat on a single bed and took a deep breath. I wasn't here to confront my family or to humiliate them by revealing I was the owner. I was here to understand why they treated me this way. Why, after 30 years, They still saw me as the least valuable. That night, during the welcome dinner at the hotel restaurant, my family occupied the best table. My chair was partially hidden behind a column. While everyone ordered the most expensive dishes on the menu, I ordered a simple salad. Can't you afford something better, Carmen? My father asked with a mixture of mockery and pity. We can treat you if you want. The salad is fine, thank you, I replied, maintaining my dignity. The conversation revolved, as always, around Lucia's achievements, her recent promotion at the bank, her new house in the exclusive neighborhood. Our Lucia always knew what she wanted, my mother said proudly. Not like Carmen, who wasted her life with his drawing business. The head chef approached our table to personally greet the guests. Upon seeing me, he made a small bow that didn't go unnoticed. Was the salad to your liking, Miss Carmen? He asked respectfully. Delicious, Antonio. Thank you, I replied. My family looked at me strangely. You know the chef? Lucia asked, surprised. We've crossed paths before, I replied vaguely. The truth was that I had personally hired Antonio three months earlier, after grandfather left me the hotel. The night progressed, and with each glass of wine, the comments directed at me became more cutting. The secret I kept was weighing on me more and more. Should I reveal the truth? What would they do if they knew that every insult, every humiliation occurred under my Own roof, Miguel approached discreetly. Miss Carmen, there's an urgent matter that requires your attention, he said quietly. If you don't want to wait for part 2, you can watch the full story on my YouTube channel.

I used to be the person everyone called when they needed something. The one who would drop everything to help a friend move or stay late at work to finish someone else's project. My boss would text me at 11 p m. And I'd respond immediately. I'd cover shifts when co workers called in sick. I'd volunteer for the projects nobody wanted. I was raised to believe kindness would always come back to you. For five years at Davidson Media, I was the first to arrive and last to leave. I helped my co workers meet their deadlines. I brought coffee for the team when everyone was stressed. I even let my boss, Diane, take credit for my ideas during presentations because she said it would look better coming from management. When my dad got sick last year, I asked Diane if I could work remotely two days a week so I could drive him to chemo. She sighed and said, we really need you in the office, but I suppose we can make it work for a month or two. I was so grateful that I worked twice as hard on my office days, making sure nothing fell through the cracks. Dad's treatment was supposed to last six months, but after three months, Diane called me into her office. She said the remote arrangement wasn't working. The team needed me physically present every day. And besides, it Had been long enough. I explained that dad was only halfway through treatment. He couldn't drive himself and had no one else. She just stared at me until I lowered my eyes and said, I understand. I spent the next week burning through my savings to hire drivers for dad. I was exhausted, constantly worried about him, but still the first one in the office every morning. Then came the Maxwell Project, a huge account that could make or break our quarter. I spent weeks researching, building the pitch, creating mockups, everything. I even missed one of Dad's appointments to finish it. The day before the presentation, Diane asked to see my materials. I handed over everything, including my presentation notes. The next morning, I arrived early, excited to present my work, only to find the conference room already full. Diane was at the head of the table, showing my slides to the clients. I stood in the doorway, frozen as she used my exact words. My research, my ideas. When she saw me, she smiled and said, oh, good. Jennifer, can you grab coffee for everyone? We're just getting started. The client turned, saw me, and said, aren't you presenting this? Before I could answer, Diane jumped in and said, oh, no, this is my project. Jennifer just helped with some research. I got the coffee. I stood in the back of the room and watched as she was praised for my work. The client loved it. They signed A three year contract, the biggest in company history. When the executives came down to congratulate the team, Diane accepted all the praise. She got a bonus, she got a promotion. I got a fifty dollar gift card to Starbucks. That night, dad called. He'd fallen trying to get from the taxi to his front door. He had been lying on the ground for 20 minutes before a neighbor found him. If I had been there. I kept thinking, if I had just been there. Two days later, the company held a Celebration for the Maxwell deal. Diane was given an award. I stood and clapped with everyone else. Then came the announcement that made everything stop. Diane would now head up a new division created specifically for the Maxwell account. And she needed a strong team. She spent 10 minutes talking about the qualities she was looking for, then announced her first hire. Ryan. The guy who had been with the company for six months and hadn't contributed a single thing to the project. I sat there stunned as everyone congratulated him. Then Diane looked at me and said, Jennifer, I need those quarterly reports by end of day. I know you won't let me down. Something broke inside me. Five years. Five years of saying yes, of staying late, of missing time with my sick father. Five years of watching others take credit for my work. Five years of being nice. I stood up, walked to the bathroom, And stared at myself in the mirror. My hands were shaking. I barely recognized the woman looking back at me. That was the moment, that exact moment, when I decided being nice wasn't working anymore. I couldn't fit. What happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

Hi. Is this Lindsay? Uh, yeah, it is. Can I ask who's calling? Um, this is, um, actually the Z Morning Zoo radio show. Nick, Natalia, and Shaggy on Z1O4. How are you this morning? Oh, I'm great. How are you guys? We're great. So, listen, we were calling you because we asked people this morning if they ever had a date that started great, but then it ended really bad. And we got a text from somebody named Scott. He said he met you at a wedding a few weekends ago. Do you. Do you remember meeting Scott? Uh, yeah, I remember him. Okay, so he said that things between the two of you started out really great, but ended kind of different. But he said he didn't know why. Does that sound right or. Um, sort of. First of all, we never went on a date. I met him at a wedding. Right, he mentioned that, but he texted us that the whole night he met you seemed to be perfect. But then the next day, he thought you were gonna call or text, and you never did. And he was kind of wondering if there was a reason for that. Um, yeah, there is kind of a reason. Okay. So we want to protect your personal life as much here as possible. So if it's something like, you know, I'm in another relationship or I was at the time, and we don't need to get into That at all? If. Well, no, I'm single. Oh, okay. So it wasn't another dude, then? No. Okay, so let's retrace the steps here for a minute. You. You meet him at a wedding? Was the wedding nice? Did you have fun at the wedding? Yeah, I had a great time. Okay, so then he said you guys went for drinks somewhere for a little bit. Did something happen while you guys went for drinks? Is he listening to us right now? No, no, no. He. He. He just texted us. Oh, okay. So was it during the drinks, then? Did he say something? No, it wasn't that. Uh, so I'll tell you what happened, but the whole story is, like, ridiculous. Okay, well, ridiculous is our forte, so. So what happened? Bring it on here. So we go out for drinks after the wedding, and that was fine, and I was really into him, so we went back to his place, but I made it clear that I was like, that it was just to talk. We were not having sex. Okay, and did he understand that part? Yeah. I mean, he was a perfect gentleman. Nothing bad. Okay, good. So. But. Well, something bad happened at some point, though, correct? I mean, so he's in the bathroom because he was brushing his teeth and stuff, getting ready for bed. And I was still in the dress. Like, I was still in the dress I was wearing from the Wedding. So I asked him if I can hang the dress up so it doesn't like get wrinkled. And he goes, sure. There's a bunch of hangers in my closet. So I open his closet and I'm looking for a hanger and I'm moving a bunch of shirts and stuff over, like to find a hanger. And I see this like, bright red suit hanging in the back of a closet. Almost like if somebody had a Santa Claus suit hiding in their closet or like something. Oh my god, you see? You slept with Santa Claus! No, it wasn't that. But I moved everything out of the way to see and it was a full adult size Power Ranger costume. Power Ranger? Like the TV show? Like, Go, Go Power Rangers? Yes. So I yell, hey, I love your Halloween costume! And he goes, what? And I go, I love the Halloween costume, the Power Ranger. And when I said it, I completely expected him to be all like embarrassed and go, oh my god, I'm so sorry you saw that. But that's like not what happened at all. Oh, so alright, so what did happen? He goes, oh no, that's not a Halloween costume. That's my cosplay suit. I wear it to all the con. Like, he's like, I wear it to all the conventions. And I'm like, what kind of conventions? And he goes, you know, Comic Con, Ranger Con. And he starts naming all these things Like, that he goes to. So was he on the TV show or something? Like, is he, like, a panelist at these conventions? No, he just loves Power Rangers and dressing up and acting like a Power Ranger when he goes to these things. And I'm thinking to myself, you're 30 years old, and you dress up like a freaking Power Ranger. I see. Okay, so did you ask him to put on the suit before you made out with him, or. Absolutely not. Okay, I wanted to get the hell out of there immediately, but I had no ride home, and I didn't want to wait outside for 30 minutes for an Uber, so I stayed the night, and the next morning, I got the hell out of there. I got you. So. So you like him, but you can't get around the Power Ranger thing? Um, no, sorry. I'm not trying to date a grown man who plays, like, superhero dress up on the weekend. You know, honestly, I don't blame you. I have never understood the whole grown up costume thing. You know, except on Halloween, that's fine, or kids birthday party, but this. Okay, Lindsay, um, we'll try to pass on the info for you so Scott knows exactly what happened. Yeah, I mean, tell him I'm really sorry. I just can't do the whole grown UPS in costume thing.

And you had a great time, right? Yeah, I had a great time. Because I believe you really liked me. I do like you, Heather. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna marry you. That doesn't mean that we're obligated to have anything beyond that night. Oh man. You are the biggest ass I have ever met. In my entire life, I've never met someone as awful as you. Ever. I don't really have much response to that. All I can say is that at the end of the day, ask yourself this question. Were you going home with me if I asked you? No. Hahaha. I saw the look in your eye at the end of the night. If I wanted to take you home with me, I 100% could have. And I didn't. I didn't even kiss you. I respectfully ended the night with you.

At what point did I sign a contract with you that gave me any obligation with you whatsoever? You have an obligation just to be a Good human being. Like, life is not business. You don't do this to people. I never once treated you unkindly or disrespectfully until you called the radio station trying to call me out. He's right. Yeah, he's not right. He didn't treat her badly when they went out, he treated her like an object. Okay, whether he said it to her face or not, that is totally. That's as disrespectful as you freaking get. He was nice about it. Yeah. Oh, my god, you guys are idiots. I'd like to go out on a nice date. Yeah, and then you stopped texting me completely, so, um, I don't really think that that's treating me well, do you? Just leaving somebody hanging like that after taking them on a nice date? You couldn't even just be honest and be like, actually, I went out with you to close the deal? Like, oh, that's kind of. I might have even respected that a little more, but I had to call a radio station and get them to talk to you. Give me a break. I'm gonna tell my dad to pull the deal with you. Like, well, it's a little late to pull the deal. Deal's closed, so it's not gonna happen. Dude, Trevor, how do you have, like, zero remorse whatsoever? You know, I might feel a little bad about it, but when I open my bank account, I feel pretty good about how my business has gone. Oh, my god. You narcissistic. I feel sorry for you because you may say you have a bunch of money and you love your business, but you have no heart and no soul. And I pity you. You're gonna end up alone. Look, you never would have known about any of this if you hadn't done this whole thing that you're doing right now. I would have killed and wondered. I actually. Really? For the rest of your life of the guy that you could have had and all whatever happened to him. Well, we should have a nice time that night. Hahaha. Why not try to have another nice time? Trevor, would you like to go out on a second date with Heather? I know you have money, but we'll pay for it. Please don't even offer that. I don't wanna go. Are you sure? You know what, Heather? I think there's another deal that might be good for your dad in a couple of months. So maybe we just wait until then. Oh my god, you did not. Oh Trevor, I can guarantee you my dad will not be doing any more deals with you. Trevor, thank you for being brutally honest with us. Yeah, anytime. Oh my god, I just. I'm angry.

To your dad anymore. It's a good point.

Like, she's a vegetarian, and you just can't stand those people. I feel the same. Oh, it's a lot worse than that. Okay, well, what could be worse? What did she do? Just ordering food that pissed you off enough to, like, call her a pisser or whatever? Let me give you a blow by blow description. She started off by asking for bottled water, no ice, and it couldn't be tap water. She explained all this to The waiter. Why is that so offensive to you, though? Oh, that's not offensive. That was just the opening salvo. All right? It got worse from there. Then she explained that she had certain dietary restrictions, like, she didn't need any red meat. Okay. No gluten, no dairy, no fish that swim. What? But crab. No fish that swim. No, you know, like. Yeah. Now let that sink in. So no gluten, no dairy, no fish that swim. But she's a picky eater, obviously. Yeah, I. I even asked her. I said, what do you mean, fish that swim? Oh, so she. She made this little wavy motion with her hand, you know, fish that swim. I said, yeah, I know fish that swim. All off. Fish swim. No, no. You know, there's some little fish that walk around you, like, like shrimp, lobsters. Anything with little bitty legs are okay. Is that just because she, like, has, like, an allergy or something? I. Oh, who knows? I thought you were just. I thought you were just saying it, like, as a figure of speech when you were talking fish that swims. I didn't realize that was the exact words that came out of her mouth. No, she actually said fish that swim. You know, I. I was gonna just take it at face value, but she went on to explain to me that fish that swim have a higher mercury content, and so if you eat fish that swim, You're slowly killing yourself. You sounds really upset about this. I wanted to eat a whole fish right then. Okay, so is it alright, so she's a picky eater. I've never heard the fish that swims thing before. Why not? Why not go out over there on a second date though? Was that the only bad thing? Wasn't that enough? I don't know. I mean, it's high maintenance. Okay? It's a high maintenance issue. Can I ask? Cause I'm just curious. What did she end up ordering for dinner? I don't know. Some sort of salad, of course. With water dressing. You know, something about her. Water dressing. With water dressing. So we talked to her about your date and she didn't mention her dietary restrictions. But she did also say you're the only guy that has ever not called her back for a second date. You know that? Yeah. That's kind of hard for me to believe. I can't imagine all the other guys in her life have put up with that. Oh my gosh. You know what Jimmy? Thank you for being honest with us, man. I appreciate it. No problem. And now I feel like I must be honest with you because Amanda is actually on the other line listening to this conversation. Say what?

You know, we're both single, so I told her, like, hey, you know, if you need anybody to hang out or dance with tonight, I'm right here. Oh, that's so sweet. If I was by myself at a wedding, I would definitely take a guy up on that offer. I mean, she. She did, uh, and we talked during dinner, we got to know each other, did a few shots. Uh, we pretty much danced together the entire night. Uh, and in fact, people were, like, coming up to us and asking, like, oh, how long have you been together as a couple? And we were like, 45minutes. Haha. Wow. Okay, so the whole meeting people at a wedding thing actually works, then? I mean, I mean, it did for me, yeah. Okay, so the connection was there then? Oh, oh, yeah, absolutely. In fact, after the reception was over, we. We went somewhere else for some drinks, and then I asked if she wanted to crash at my place. So she came over, spent the night. Wow. Okay. Wow. Way to go, Scott. So you guys with your. Now, did you end up, um. You know. No, I mean, like, we messed around a bunch, but we didn't end up having sex. I gotcha. But so you enjoyed each other's company? Oh, totally. Yeah. And when I tell you, I've never clicked with somebody so much in my life. I mean, I. I remember thinking this. This person here could be my next girlfriend. This is. Wow, that's awesome. Okay, but I'm assuming something went wrong, though, or you wouldn't be calling us. Yeah, exactly. So, uh, so here's what went wrong. The next morning, she got up early and asked if I could make her breakfast and said that she had to get going, but she was gonna call me. So I wait a day or two, no call. And I'm telling myself, alright, just stay cool, stay cool, don't ask desperate, don't overreact. Let's just let her make the first move. So I wait, and then there's nothing. So I'm finally thinking, all right, well, what if. What if she lost my phone number, you know, or something? Or like, what if she's been actually trying to reach me? So I sent her a text message asking what she was doing for Memorial Day weekend, and she's like, yeah, I am super busy. And that was the last time I heard from her. Oh, man. Okay, so she. She gave you the blow off? Yep, pretty much. And then the thing I can't understand was like, guys, the entire night we were having an absolute blast together. And I could tell she was really into me. I was totally into her. And I. I have no idea what happened. So once again, and we get these all the time. We have somebody who starts out super into you and then something happens and makes him pull a one eighty for no good reason. I can't tell you how many of these we've had to figure out. So I'm assuming that's what you want to know, why she acted so interested that night and now she's not. Yeah. Yeah. Like I. I just don't know what I did that made her give me the blow off like that, you know? Yeah. Is there a possibility that she's married? No, no, no, she's not married. Cause we're both friends with the bride and groom and they both said to us, oh my gosh, we're so glad you guys found each other. You're perfect together. Yeah. I feel like if she was married and the weddings, like, by herself, somebody would have come up to you and be like, you know, she's married, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, she is definitely not married. Okay, so great time at the wedding, you go for drinks, you come home, you do some heavy petting, and then the next day she's no longer interested. So that leaves us with the normal line of questioning here. Forgive us for asking. Did you. Did you try any weird sexual move on her? Absolutely not. Okay. None of that. So everything you guys did was pretty much by the book? Yeah. Okay. Yep. Did you go pee? Pee Or poop in the bed like. Or have terrible flatulence in your sleep? no, I do not. Okay, okay. Do you keep a collection of fingernails under your bed anyway? Or something weird like that? No, no, that is disgusting. Cause one time, that was the. That was the reason. Um, okay, so you have this girl's name, this girl's phone number then? Yeah, yeah, I do. Okay, give it to us. We'll get her on the phone and we'll find out what's going on. Okay? Alright, great.

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? She was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue? No, I would.

Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay, okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder? Yeah, well, number one, I don't know why someone would do that, but I. I could think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex, or she doesn't want people to know. Or she's on her Job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out. Why. Why is that a big deal? Yeah, well, yeah. Her name is summer. Her name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants. And if. Yeah, if we were to, I don't know, like, long term relationship, get married at some point, her name would be Summer Pants. What? That. That is the dumbest. I think that's amazing. Yeah, I. I would love that. Well, I would not love that. It make me very uncomfortable knowing maybe people are making fun of her behind her back or something like that. Oh, my god, you jumped so many steps, by the way. Well, I know I'm going fast, but I'm looking for a long term relationship, so I'm not there to just mess around with people and so. So you're looking for a forever pants? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't be a smarty pants and you'll. Okay. You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time? No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay, but you are so many assumptions here. One, that she would even take your name when you got married. Like, a lot of women keep their last name, and that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry to take your last name? Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. Hahaha. But you're Daniel Pants. And you don't think Summer Pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay, well. And that's it? That's the only reason? That is the biggest reason, yes. That is so ridiculous to me. you never did. I mean, yes, you could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing. And years of great jokes. Yeah, yeah, that's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge. No, I'm allowed to. Okay, you're allowed to. Well, Daniel, I do have to let you know that summer is on the phone listening right now and she wants to talk to you. What? Yeah.

So for the first time, instead of clicking on my profile, I decided to click on his. Um, yeah, I thought maybe there was a cool new show that I haven't seen yet or something that he was really into. So anyways, I click on his profile and it's a bunch of, like, sappy, girly romantic movies. Oh, okay, so it sounds like he really misses you then. No, no, I. You don't understand. He hates movies like that. Like, when we're together, it's just like bullying teeth to get him to watch that kind of stuff. Okay, well, he must not hate him that much if he's watching them. Yeah, but what I wanna know is, why is he watching them in the first place? Like, is he alone watching these movies, or is he watching them because somebody is with him? Oh, okay, I see what you're getting at. So you think he might not be alone watching all these girly romantic movies? I mean, I just. I just can't see him sitting alone at home on a Saturday night watching Crazy Stupid Love by himself. Right? Okay, so you think maybe he's got some company over and that's who is picking these movies? They all sound like movies a girl would pick, not a guy. Okay, so. So what movies are They like. Are they comedies? Cause a lot of guys don't mind romantic movies if they're funny. No, they're like notebook, Crazy, Stupid, Love. And the last one he watched was, um. PS, I love you. Oh, I love that movie. It is so romantic. Okay, but that's my whole point though. Like, do you know any guy who would watch that by himself? Uh, no, probably not I, I would definitely say that's a date movie. Okay, and see, that's what I'm worried about. I got you. So, okay, so you want us to find out if your boyfriend is entertaining company while watching these romantic movies, then yes. Okay, and what is your boyfriend's name? It's Greg. Okay, and you're doing the long distance thing? Like, so where is he at? He's not in California or anything, is he? No, he's in Decatur, which is just outside of Atlanta. Okay, so he's still on the East Coast then? Yeah. Okay, good. Cause if we try calling him like in I know or something, he ain't waking up yet. Alright, so we need a plan here. We, we could send him a text or something. Maybe something like a line from one of those movies we. Which one of the movies did you say you liked? Natalia, I love PS, I love you. It is like I said, it's such a great movie. Okay, so is. Is there like a signature line in that movie? Like. Like. Like a Nobody puts baby in the corner type line. Okay, well, the line is actually PS I love you, because the guy in the movie actually dies, but he leaves behind all these letters that he writes at the end. Okay, so that. So that. That might not work, then. Well, why don't we just text him and put, be honest, do you really like PS I love you or did you hate it? Okay, we could do that. That. That would certainly get a response one way or the other. I guess. Either he. Look, he's either gonna say something mushy like, I liked it because I watched it with you, or he's gonna say, who the hell is this, and how do you know I watch that movie? So I think either way, we'll probably know right away what's going on. So let's do that. Let's send him that text now, and then we'll read what he responds with when we come back next. Okay, so Natalia did send Greg a text. And what did he. Well, what did the text say that you sent him first? Okay, it. I said, hey, it's me. I was just wondering, did you really like PS I love you or did you hate it? Okay. And did Greg write back? Actually, um, yes, several times. Okay, what. What did he say? So. Okay, so first he just wrote back question marks. So I wrote back, PS I love you. The movie on Netflix. Did you actually like it or no? And then he wrote back, you know, who is this? I think you have the wrong number. So I wrote, is this Greg? And he wrote, yes, who the heck is this? So I, you know, so it's definitely Greg, though. Alright, so let's call him and then we'll see if he answers real quick.

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day, my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello? Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce, I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple extra Expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with, so I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line. So I ran up by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why don't wait? Till you get home, you check the email, you call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria. Because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

I was halfway through my sandwich when the old speakers buzzed loudly. They always did before an announcement. But this time, it didn't sound like the lunch schedule. The principal's voice came on, but it was shaky. Attention, students. Everyone must return to their classrooms immediately and lock the doors. This is not a drill. The lunch ladies stopped serving, and I looked at my friends, and they looked at me, and then we all moved at once. The time we got to class, our teacher was already closing the blinds. She locked the door behind us and told us to move our desks to the corner, away from the windows. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Our teacher tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that they were right outside, and I believe them. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she got up again and Walked back to her laptop. Then something changed because her face went pale. She looked at me and asked if there was a Jack Arthur in here. The whole class turned to me like I was in trouble. She asked me to come to her and whispered if I had anything in the room that belonged to me. I told her just my backpack. She told me to grab it and wait by the door. I didn't understand what was happening, so I waited. Few minutes later, there was a knock and the teacher opened the door and told me to go with the officer. Outside, the hallway was full of cops and medics. I thought maybe I was being arrested and tried to think what I did wrong. But then I saw the soda machine near the bathrooms tipped over and next to it a shoe and a leg sticking out. The officer stepped in front of me fast and told me to keep my eyes forward, but I'd already seen it. He took me to a side room and told me to wait. Then the door opened and my uncle walked in. He lives an hour away and he never comes to school, so I asked him if I was in trouble, but told me I was safe. I asked about my little brother Timmy, but he didn't answer. Instead, he told me I needed to be strong for him, but I didn't understand. He asked me to Wear a blindfold and told me

I was always told that my older brother ran away with his friends, but it never really made sense because I still saw his friends around town. I remember the first time I heard about him running away. It was around 1987, and I was about 8 years old. My father told me over dinner that my brother had left home while I was away at school that day and told me not to look for him. I felt really sad because I really loved watching television with him and riding our bikes together. And for him to leave without saying goodbye, it really hurt my heart. While I rolled around the peas with my fork, I asked my dad when my brother would be coming back. My dad's expression turned grim as he told me that my brother would most likely never return. That broke my heart even more. The following day, I saw my dad cutting down my brother's favorite tree in the backyard. I tried to run out and stop him, but my dad told me that he needed to remove the tree so that he could send it to my brother. That was another thing that never made sense to me, but I accepted it. As a kid, days turned into weeks and weeks into years. It had been 10 years since my older brother ran away. I was ready to Finally accept the fact that I would never see him again until I saw his best friend enter the grocery store I worked at and saw my chance of closure. I approached him casually and asked if my brother lived with him or contacted him.

You're just being the best daughter you can be and I respect that. Yeah, thanks. And just so you know, it is a shared account. I put as much money as you put into it. I know, I know. I just want to make sure we are using that money wisely and not spending it on stupid things. So my dad is a stupid thing to spend money on? I didn't say that. I clearly stated that I think it's going to a good use. Whatever. You gonna be home soon? Don't think so. He asked if I could stay another night. Oh, okay. Just let me know if you need anything. Thank you, baby. I was thinking I'll be around the area tonight since I'm helping out my friend down there. You want me to stop by and bring you guys some food? I already told you, I stocked up his fridge with food. Okay, maybe just to say hello then. It's fine, baby. Trust me. He doesn't like too much going on. He only likes my company. Alright, talk in a bit then. Alexa, where the fuck are you? With my dad. What are You. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more

And I cannot stand when they tell me to watch my tone. Like, hey, dumbass, all I said was okay! In a monotone voice.

My friend Liam and I used to play this stupid game where we'd steal each other's stuff and hide it. Nothing serious, just phones, wallets, keys. We'd give them back after a few hours, usually with a dumb note saying, gotcha. It started our freshman year when he took my phone during lunch and left it in my locker with a sticky note. I got him back by swiping his car keys and putting them in the teacher's lounge. It went on for months. The whole school knew about our little prank war. Even teachers would roll their eyes when one of us frantically searched our backpacks, knowing the other was probably behind it. The stakes kept getting higher. Laptops, textbooks. Once even Liam's basketball Jersey right before a game. But we always returned everything. No damage done. Then one day, I spotted Liam's college acceptance letter sticking out of his backpack. Ail full ride. He hadn't told anyone yet. Was waiting to surprise his parents at dinner. Perfect target. I thought I slipped it out while he was in the bathroom, planning to make him sweat for an hour before giving it back. But when I got home that night, I couldn't find it anywhere. Not in my backpack, not in my locker, not in my car. I tore my room apart three times. Nothing. My stomach dropped as I realized what happened. It must have fallen out somewhere at school. I called Liam in a panic, confessing what I'd done. He laughed at first, thinking I was setting up another prank, and his voice changed when he realized I was serious. Are you kidding me? That was my only copy. Yale needs the signed form back by tomorrow. I raced back to school, but it was locked up for the night. Janitor wouldn't let me in even when I begged. I sat in my car crying, knowing I just screwed up my best friend's future over a stupid game. At 3:00am, I was still awake when headlights flooded my window. It was Liam.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

What's her name? She said Alex, but I don't know any girls called Alex. No, I don't either. You probably met her in the club after you left us. When did I leave? I don't know. 11? I was drunk too, remember? So what should I do then? Just ask her, I guess. What's the worst that can happen? Oh, and ask for a selfie, too. Look, I'm really sorry, but I don't remember you. Can you tell me when and where we met? It's okay. Lol. You Were really drunk, to be fair. We met at the club that I work at, and you came in at, like, 11:30. Anyway, you saw me dancing and told me I looked really hot. We carried on talking, and you bought me a few drinks and you asked me if I wanted to come to your place after my shift. So we left together and ended up in your bedroom. And, you know, we wrestled. We wrestled. It was good. It was very good. And I wanna do it again. If you're down. Obviously. Hell, yeah, I'm down.

When I was 11, my mom would drop me off at the local mall every weekend with $15 and her credit card for emergencies only. She called it our arrangement. She got me time and I got independence training. The first few Saturdays, I thought I was the luckiest kid alive. Freedom, a food court and the arcade. I'd stretch that $15 by getting the free pizza samples and spending hours at GameStop. This college age employee, Marcus, noticed me hanging around every weekend. Back again, buddy, he'd say. Then let me play the display consoles longer than other kids. By my fourth solo Saturday, I had a routine. I knew which restaurants gave the biggest samples, which bathrooms were cleanest, and where to sit to charge my phone. I'd text mom updates like she asked, but she rarely responded until pickup time. This older security guard, Officer Ray, started appearing wherever I went. One rainy Saturday, when the mall was nearly empty, he sat down across from me in the food court. Your mom works nearby? He asked casually. I nodded, repeating the line she taught me. She's at important meetings. I'm old enough to handle myself. He studied me for a moment, then slid me his half finished pretzel. My shift ends in an hour. I can never finish these. What started as occasional Saturdays became every weekend, then extended to Friday nights, too. Mom would text last Minute. Can you handle dinner at the mall? Use the emergency card. Love you. I'd watch movies alone, sitting between families so I wouldn't look weird. Once, a dad offered me some of their popcorn, thinking I'd been separated from my parents. The kindness made my throat tight. The worst day was when I got food poisoning from day old sushi. I was violently sick in the public bathroom. A woman called mall security when she heard me crying in the stall. Officer Ray found me curled on the floor. He helped me clean up and took me to the security office, where they called my mom 17 times. No answer. They finally reached her four hours later. He was at a spa retreat three hours away. Can he just take an Uber home? She asked them. The mall manager had seen me alone too many times. He showed Officer Ray footage of me wandering alone from opening till closing, Friday nights through Sunday evenings for six straight weekends. I remember Officer Ray's face hardening as he watched. When my mom finally arrived the next morning, she brought me a milkshake like everything was fine. The security office had called child services. Mom kept saying he's mature for his age and kids need independence these days. The case worker just kept writing in her note. I spent that summer with my grandparents while mom had supervised visitation and therapy. During family counseling, we discovered she'd been dating a married man. Those weekend

I recently turned in my English essay, and the next day, my teacher called me up to her desk. I was feeling pretty good. I actually put effort into this one. Maybe she was going to compliment my writing. Nope. She folded her hands, looked at me like a detective about to crack a case, and said, there's no way you wrote this. I laughed, thinking she was joking. She wasn't. She picked up my paper and pointed at a word. Ubiquitous. I nodded, yeah. She narrowed her eyes. You don't even know what that means. Now I knew this wasn't about my essay anymore. This was personal. I calmly defined the word, used it in three different sentences, and even threw in a synonym for extra credit. She crossed her arms. Okay, you must have used AI to write this. What? First I was too dumb to know big words. Now I was too smart to have written this myself. She made me run my essay through an AI detector. It came back 100% human written. At this point, I had proved her wrong twice, but she still would not back down. She tapped her desk, pretending to think, then went, then you must have copied this from another essay. I couldn't believe it. I literally wrote this from scratch, but now I was being accused of plagiarism. I told her to run it through a plagiarism checker. I did, and I passed. I sat back, arms crossed. Now, surely she'd apologize. She sighed, looked me in the eyes, and handed me my paper with a big fat zero written at the top. I stared at it. Wait, so what's the reason now? She shrugged. I just don't believe you. At that point, I was done. I stood up, walked to the door, and before I left I turned around, looked her dead in the eyes, and said, you know what's really ubiquitous? Your terrible grading. Then I walked out with my zero and my dignity.

I was a lunch lady at Westwood Middle School for 15 years. The kids called me Miss Rosa, and I knew every single one by name. I knew who was allergic to peanuts, who needed extra portions because they didn't get enough at home, and who was having a bad day just by the look in their eyes. Every Friday, I baked chocolate chip cookies from my grandmother's recipe. It was my small way of giving the kids something to look forward to at the end of the week. The principal knew about it and always grabbed one for himself. Then came that awful Monday in October. Three students and two teachers called in sick with terrible stomach pain. By Tuesday, 15 more kids were out. The school nurse called it a stomach bug, but by Wednesday, the health department was involved. I was serving lunch when the principal and two men in it's came into the cafeteria. They asked me to step into the office. That walk felt like a mile long with all the kids watching. Your Friday cookies, the health inspector said, showing me pictures of children in hospital beds. They tested positive for rat poison. My knees gave out. I collapsed into a chair, my mind racing. How could this happen? I had made those cookies the same way for years in my own kitchen. They suspended me on the spot, took my keys, my badge, Everything. I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone from the school while they investigated. The local newspaper ran a front page story. School lunch lady poison students. They printed my picture and everything. My phone rang constantly with angry parents. Someone threw eggs at my house. My neighbour of 12 years asked me to stop waving to her children. The worst part was knowing those kids thought I had tried to hurt them. Kids who trusted me to feed them every day. Two weeks later, police showed up at my apartment with a search warrant. They tore through everything. My clothes, my photo albums, even my grandmother's recipe box. They took

I had an entire family come to my office once because their daughter attempted to Hannah Baker themselves. The father and mother explained to me that long before they ever had their kids, they had only wanted boys. They believed that raising boys would have been a lot easier and were risk free because they couldn't get pregnant. Having a girl to them meant a lot of attention, arguments, and too many hormones to worry about. So. So they actually got pretty lucky and had three boys up until their last child. They found out that their fourth child was going to be a girl and attempted to abort her immediately. The abortion pill ended up failing, and they had a baby girl. When I asked the mother and father why they would even try to abort their baby, since that would have gone against their Christian values, they argued that their baby surviving was proof that she was a devil spawn and was sent as punishment to their family and the world. Their daughter, however, was actually the sweetest girl in the world. She's 10 years old and grew up knowing what her parents thought of her. For her entire life, she never felt love and was told that she was a mistake that couldn't be removed. She always felt like she shouldn't have been alive, so she tried to take matters into her Own hands. She did things to herself I'd rather not say, in an attempt to remove herself from the equation. When her family brought her to the hospital, they told her during her entire recovery process that she proved their point by being an attention seeker. Since her stunt, she's been completely absent from school and refused to leave her bed. So her father told her that they would take her to therapy, which she became excited about until she realised that meant the entire family had to go. Her father and mother repeatedly cried to me asking why their daughter was such a screw up and why she was wasting her life away. I told them they were insufferable idiots and were immediately going to be reported to CPS, that I was going to personally see to it that they'd be arrested. They told me that they knew they shouldn't have gone to therapy since it was a bunch of hippie mumbo jumbo. If not for therapist laws, I would have adopted that poor girl myself and saved her from her cult of a family. After a couple of days, a social worker was sent to their home and investigated the home where they found pictures upon pictures of their daughter. Her room was clean and the fridge was stocked with her favourite foods. The social worker was suspicious and sat the girl aside and asked if she felt safe. She admitted that they changed everything up to look Good. So they wouldn't be frowned upon by their church. She then asked to leave and was soon placed in foster care. Alicia, if you're out there reading this, I hope you're loved. Now, sweetie.

I was a lunch lady at Westwood Middle School for 15 years. The kids called me Miss Rosa, and I knew every single one by name. I knew who was allergic to peanuts, who needed extra portions because they didn't get enough at home, and who was having a bad day just by the look in their eyes. Every Friday, I'd bake chocolate chip cookies from my grandmother's recipe. It was my small way of giving the kids something to look forward to at the end of the week. The principal knew about it and always grabbed one for himself. Then came that awful Monday in October. Three students and two teachers called in sick with terrible stomach pain. By Tuesday, 15 more kids were out. The school nurse called it a stomach bug, but by Wednesday, the health department was involved. I was serving lunch when the principal and two men in suits. I'm into the cafeteria. They asked me to step into the office. That walk felt like a mile long with all the kids watching. Your Friday cookies, the health inspector said, showing me picture. There's of children in hospital beds. They tested positive for rat poison. My knees gave out. I collapsed into a chair, my mind racing. How could this happen? I had made those cookies the same way for years in my own kitchen. They suspended me on the spot, took my keys, my Badge. Everything. I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone from the school while they investigated. The local newspaper ran a front page story. School lunch lady poison students. I printed my picture and everything. My phone rang constantly with angry parents. Someone threw eggs at my house. My neighbor of 12 years asked me to stop waving to her children. The worst part was knowing those kids thought I had tried to hurt them. Kids who trusted me to feed them every day. Two weeks later, police showed up at my apartment with a search warrant.

So my grandparents threw them a humiliation party and made all relatives hate them. My brother got a car for his 18th birthday. Not a new car or anything, it was a 20 year old Lexus that was in pretty good shape and he rubbed it in my face for the rest of the time. He was in his senior year of high school. Compared with my brother, I get just as good grades as he does. Better in some cases even. I worked my hardest in the hope of fairness. I even volunteered to clean up garbage in my local area. Then. My 18th birthday came and went a few weeks ago and the only thing I wanted, the only thing I was hoping for, was a car. I wasn't expecting something like a new car or a sporty car, just something reliable like my brother got. The party was different from my brother's 18th. For his 18th birthday my mom baked the cake herself. It was a delicious layered chocolate pudding cake. I got a sheet cake from the supermarket for his. They got a DJ for me. It was my dad's old boombox with a couple of mix CDs. We went through the whole party and my parents might have just been waiting to spring a surprise gift on me, but that didn't happen as Things were wrapping up. I asked them why there was no car when my brother got one, and they said that they felt like he worked harder for it. I wondered what he did that I didn't do, because I did all of that and more. My grandma was nearby and heard everything. And then she asked them why as well. She lectured my parents that she was very disappointed in them for showing favoritism. Then she announced to everyone still there that my parents thought getting their first born son a car and DJ was fine, but not their second. And then she even pointed out how much harder my parents tried for my brother's 18th birthday than they had for mine.

Last month I was riding my bike when I spotted two women on the street screaming at each other, pulling hair, the whole dramatic scene. I pulled over, parked my bike, and leaned against a lamp post to watch. Out of nowhere, a guy in a sleek black BMW tapped my bike with his bumper, locked eyes for a moment before he smirked and said, you stopped to watch too, huh? I laughed. Looks like we both got front row seats. Instead of arguing, we turned our attention back to the chaos, squinted at the woman in the red dress, and said, I'm putting my money on her. She looks scrappy. I shook my head. Nah, the one in jeans has that crazy, unhinged energy. She's got this. He nodded. All right. A pack of smoke says I'm right. I fished a half empty pack of cheap cigarettes from my pocket and we shook on it. Few minutes later he went to his car, came back with two beers, and we cracked them open while the fight raged on. Then, just as expected, the woman in jeans threw a wild punch, sending the red dress lady straight to the pavement. Then a traffic cop rolled up, noticing his bumper still touching my bike. What's going on here? He asked. The guy just shrugged. Little tap. We're handling it. Before we left, he handed me $200 and said, for the bike, man. Thing is, My bike wasn't even that messed up. $20 was all it took to fix. A few days later, I got a text from him. Another fight downtown. Drink, smokes. And just like that, I've got a new fight watching, Buddy.
