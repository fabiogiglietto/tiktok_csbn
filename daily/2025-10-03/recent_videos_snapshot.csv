Emma had always been the attention seeking sister. When I got engaged to Tyler, she immediately started planning ways to make my wedding about her. She dropped hints about how she wished someone would propose to her, how she was getting older, how weddings made her so emotional. I ignored most of it because I was too busy planning the actual wedding. Two weeks before the big day, Emma casually mentioned she'd found the perfect dress. She showed me a photo on her phone. It was clearly white. Not cream, not ivory, not off white. Pure white with lace details that looked almost bridal. Emma, that's a white dress. I said, it's champagne. She lied, even though we could both see it was white. You can't wear white to my wedding. Oh, please, it's 2024. Those rules are so outdated. Besides, it'll look different in photos. I told my mom, who just sighed and said Emma would probably change her mind. I told my maid of honor, Katie, who offered to spill wine on Emma if needed. But honestly, I was too stressed with last minute wedding planning to fight about it. The morning of my wedding, I was getting ready in the bridal suite when Katie burst in. Your sister just walked in wearing that white dress, and it's worse than the photo. I looked out the window and saw Emma Posing for photos with our cousins. The dress was absolutely white, floor length, and had this dramatic train. She looked like she was trying to be a second bride. But here's where it gets good. My husband's family is Italian, and his grandmother, Nona Rosa, takes traditions very seriously. She's this tiny 85 year old woman who doesn't speak much English, but somehow always knows what's happening. During the ceremony, I could see Nona Rosa staring at Emma with this look of pure disgust. After we set our vows during the cocktail hour, Nona Rosa marched straight up to Emma. You wear white to someone else's wedding, she said in her broken English, loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.

That he's like one of my best friends. Yeah. John, this sounds like it's really hard on you, isn't it? Oh, man, you have no idea. I mean, I mean, at first it was just like, keep your mouth shut. It's none of your business. Yeah. Then I was like, well, maybe I'll, maybe I'll talk to him about it. Yeah. Now I'm just like, I wish I never found out. But you did find out and I imagine your conscience is eating away at you about this. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, it is. But I just wish there was a way she could find out without me being involved at all. Well, I mean, you called us, so you're pretty much involved now. Um, but if you want to, we could plan a way where maybe he admits to it while she's listening on the phone and then he doesn't know. Like, would that work? Maybe, maybe you call him and ask him about it. But we're listening on the other line and we have her on the other and she, and he has no idea she's listening. Well, see, that means I'm, I'm pretty much losing the friend for life cause he's Gonna know I set him up and I don't want that I gotcha okay, maybe we can figure out a way to get him to admit it without even using you at all um, give me a few minutes on this one either way I think we're gonna need to get Beth on the phone cause she obviously needs to hear this now do you do you have her number? Uh, my and my girlfriend has it okay, wait, I'll go get it okay, I need you to get that number and then get his number too when we come back I think I have a plan that may or may not involve America's No. 1 rated fake morning show Scotty and the buzz oh god yeah here's what I'm thinking tell me if you like this idea okay, what if we pretend we're calling for Scotty in the bus show but we never do Scotty in the bus what if I say great idea great idea so I don't have to hear the voice I'm the producer of Scotty in the buzz show and we got a call from this Dario girl who said I slept with my ex and and we wanted to clear it with you before we put her on the air kind of like getting confirmation like yes yep yeah permission okay yeah and then maybe he'll go so you basically gonna do my job if that's okay with you but you your job was To get Beth.

In our family, when a husband dies, the widow has exactly 40 days to follow him into the afterlife. They called it the Eternal Service. Packed because apparently men needed servants even after death. I was seven when I watched my Aunt Ling drink the ceremonial poison at Uncle Ling's 40th Day memorial. Her hands shook as she raised the cup, but her mother in law held her wrist steady, making sure every drop went down. Aunt May was 23. She tried to run on day 38. Made it all the way to the bus station before Uncle Ling's brothers dragged her back. I remember her begging, saying she was pregnant. They said the baby could serve Uncle Ling, too. My mom would brush my hair every night and tell me how romantic it was that wives love their husbands so much they couldn't live without them. But I saw the way her hands trembled. Whenever dad got a cold, I saw her counting his gray hairs. Like she was calculating how many years she had left. Sometimes I catch her staring at the kitchen knives. Not in a scary every way, but like she was measuring which one would be sharpest in 20 years. The thing about this tradition was it wasn't even that old. My great grandfather started it after his brother's widow remarried someone younger and prettier. He said it was about loyalty, but Everyone knew it was about control. Dead women can't inherit property. Dead women can't remarry. Dead women can't testify about what their husbands did to them. Dead women can't tell anyone about the bruises hidden under their funeral clothes. The ceremonies were always the same day. 40 would arrive and the whole family would gather. The widow would wear white, her husband's favorite address. She'd serve tea to his relatives one last time. Then they bring out the cup. Always porcelain, always with painted flowers. The poison smelled like almonds. They'd make her drink it in front of everyone, then lay her next to her husband's photo until she stopped breathing. Usually it took about 20 minutes. The younger kids were supposed to watch to learn about duty. When I was 15, Dad had a heart attack. That he survived, but it changed everything. Mom started acting differently. She'd wake me up at 3:00am for lessons. First, she taught me how to forge signatures, making me practice Dad's name until I could do it perfectly. Then came the banking stuff. How to transfer money without triggering alerts. How to hide assets in different names. She showed me websites for fake IDS. Taught me which states were easiest to disappear in. Made me memorize bus routes to the Mexican border. Just in case you ever need to disappear, she'd say. But we both knew who really needed to disappear. Then she showed me the videos. She been collecting them for years. Grainy footage of widow ceremonies from old family gatherings. She had them hidden on an encrypted hard drive labelled recipe collection. She'd pause at certain moments. Look at Aunt Ling's cup. See how it's different from Aunt May's, she'd say. Look at Aunt Lou's funeral. Notice how the coffin is so light when they carry it. Look at how her sister keeps checking her phone during the burial. That's when I Learned about the secret network. For 20 years, widows have been faking their deaths. Some use special drugs that slow their heartbeat to nothing for 48 hours. One aunt was a nurse who'd been stealing them from the hospital for years. Others had doctor friends who falsified death certificates for cash. There was a whole underground railroad of safe houses in other states where dead women started new lives. They had new name, new social security numbers, new everything. Mom taught me the code words at family gatherings. Such a peaceful passing meant the widow escaped successfully. She fought till the end. Meant someone was suspicious. Beautiful ceremony meant they needed help with documents. The flowers were perfect. Meant they needed money. She's with him now. Meant she didn't make it out. I started helping when I was 17. Creating fake

My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it, and if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM, even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there, and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night, and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month, and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach, but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie, since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk, and my T V. Left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway. But I took the stuff that Mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple. Told them I'd moved out, that I was safe, and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voicemails. My mom was crying, and half of them, my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine. Gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it.

You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humour, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

But what she didn't know was that I am the owner. Last Saturday night, this woman storms into my restaurant with five friends, completely bypassing our host stand. She's wearing designer everything and has this entitled smirk that immediately puts me on edge. I need the VIP section, she announces loudly enough for half the dining room to hear. The owner's my college roommate, tell him Jessica Martinez is here. He always keeps table 7 open for me. I'm standing right there in my server apron, having just finished helping bus tables during our Saturday rush. I've owned this place for three years and have never seen this woman in my life, but something about her smugness made me genuinely curious about how far she'd take this lie. Let me check with management, I tell her, suppressing a grin. While she waits, Jessica starts telling her friends how she practically designed the menu and helped me get this place off the ground. Pure fiction. But her friends are eating it up, taking selfies and posting about their VIP treatment. I decide to seat them at table 7, our actual premium table with no listed prices, reserved for celebrity guests and special occasions. The menus I give them are our exclusive tasting collection, featuring items like Wagyu beef, ported lobster, and bottles of wine that cost more Than most people's rent. Oh my god, he gave us the good menus! Jessica squeals to her friends. See, I told you we were tight. While serving them, Jessica keeps making increasingly bold claims. She tells everyone how she helped me choose the restaurant's color scheme, how she introduced me to my celebrity clients, how I always comp for meals because she's basically a business partner. The breaking point came when she snapped her fingers at me and said, waiter, boy, this champagne isn't expensive enough for my friends. Bring us your most exclusive bottle. You know, the one you save for me. That's when I brought out our 1 200 dollar Dom Perignon vintage, 2000 thousand and eight. Jessica didn't even blink, just waved her hand dismissively and told her friends, he always brings me the good stuff. Throughout the evening, they ordered like money was no object. Appetizers of a select caviar, multiple bottles of premium wine, dry aged steaks, and desserts paired with rare cognac. Jessica kept live streaming parts of the dinner, bragging to her social media followers about her exclusive access and VIP lifestyle. The most insulting moment came when one of her friends asked,

The Coast Guard had been hunting narcotic runners in Miami waters all summer. And with my dark skin and old fishing boat, I looked like every dealer they profiled. I looked so suspicious that Marina security trailed me to my slip every time. Harbour patrol always circled twice when they saw me with my kids. So when the Coast Guard's cutter aimed straight at us, I knew we were targets. Screamed over the loud speaker while still 50 yards out. Cut engines now! My eight year old started crying. The Coast Guard jumped aboard before my daughter's tears dried. He circled me like a shark while three guardsmen kept hands on weapons. His eyes locked onto my Navy anchor tattoo. The Coast Guard made me lift my shirt and traced his finger over my combat scars from Syria. Then he turned to my kids huddled in the corner. My daughter buried her face in her brother's shoulder. The Coast Guard pointed at them and laughed. Teaching them the family business early, huh? He grabbed my arm and twisted it behind my back. The other Guardsmen just watched. My son reached for me, but I shook my head. The moment I shook my head at my son, The Coast Guard grabbed my shoulder. He put me down to my knees hard. The Coast Guard stood over me and started his lecture. He told my kids their daddy, Was a nobody, a narcotic dealer, a waste of space. When I quietly mentioned serving in naval intelligence, he bent down close. Bullshit. Maybe a dishwasher on base. He tore my shirt while pretending to search for track marks. The Coast Guard examined my scars and shook his head. My daughter heard every word. My son's fists clenched, but he stayed frozen. My children watched him tear apart their father, piece by piece. The Coast Guard pulled out his cuffs and made a show of it. He clicked them on tight while my kids stared. My eight year old reached for me, but Coast Guard stepped between us. He blocked her with his body and she stumbled backward. Her little hands shook. The Coast Guard looked at both my children and then back at me. He shook his head slowly like he was disappointed. Then he spit on the deck right next to where I knelt. What kind of father brings kids on narcotic runs? My son pulled his sister close. Then he spotted the decorated urn wedged between in our fishing poles. The brass caught the sunlight. I tried explaining through tears. My father. Vietnam Purple Heart. Today's memorial. The Coast Guard just laughed and pop the lid. He held it over the water. I lurched forward, but the stop me. He tilted it slowly at first, then dumped everything. The ashes hit the waves and spread out like a gray cloud. My daughter broke free and ran to The rail! Grandpa! She reached toward the water. The Coast Guard stepped back and smiled. The Coast Guard stepped back and smiled while my daughter cried for her grandpa. I lost it. Tried to stand, but he tackled me into the railing. My ribs cracked against the metal. He grabbed my neck and forced my head over the side into the same water where my father's ashes floated. He held me under. I fought, but the cuffs made it impossible. Gonna join your narcotic dealer, daddy? Down there? My children screamed. He yanked me up, gasping. Water poured from my mouth, then down again. Kids are better off without you. My eight year old begged him to stop. The other guardsmen look sick, but stayed frozen. My body went limp just as a Navy patrol boat roared up. The captain stood with binoculars locked on us. He grabbed his radio and his voice boomed across the water. That's Commander Williams, Naval Intelligence.

I'm sitting at my reserved table at this fancy Italian place when a couple walks up and says, excuse me, you're at our table. I politely tell them I have a seven PM reservation under my name. The woman rolls her eyes and says, as well, we have one too and we were here first. I show them my confirmation email. The guy gets aggressive. Look, we eat here every week. The hostess knows us. You need to move, the woman adds. We tip really well here. They know to take care of us. I refuse and say I'm not moving for my confirmed reservation. The guy starts raising his voice. This is ridiculous. We're regulars. Other diners start looking over. The woman notices and it's louder. Can you believe this? Some people have no courtesy. I flag down our waitress, hoping she'll check the reservation system. She walks over looking nervous. The couple immediately pounces, thank god you're here. This person took our usual table. The waitress looks between us awkwardly, oh, there might have been a mix up. Maybe you could sit at the bar. The couple smurfs like they've won. The woman crosses her arms. See, even she knows this is our table. The guy adds, we've been coming here for three years, same table every Friday. I'm getting heated, but stay calm and ask the waitress to check her system. He hesitates and says, well, they Are very good customers, the woman jumps in. Exactly. We spend serious money here, not like some random walk in. I tell her I'm not a walk in and show my confirmation. Again, the guy dismisses it. Anyone can fake an email these days. The woman suggests, why don't you just go somewhere else? There are plenty of other restaurants. Other customers are now openly staring at the scene. One couple at the next table starts whispering. The waitress looks uncomfortable and suggests again, the bar has really nice seating, same menu. The guy nods approving. Perfect solution. Everyone's happy. I refuse to budge and ask to speak to the manager. The woman laughs. Oh, please. He knows us personally. The guy adds. We had dinner with him last month. Good luck with that. The waitress says the manager is busy in the kitchen. The couple exchanges knowing looks. The woman leans in. Look, we can make this easy. Easy or hard, your choice. I ask what that means. The guy explains, we know the owner. One word from us and you'll never get a table here again. I stand my ground and say I'm keeping my legally reserved table. The couple gets more aggressive. The woman starts talking to nearby tables. Can you believe some people? No respect for loyalty? The guy joins. In three years we've been coming here, this is what customer service has become. A man at another table nods sympathetic. The woman turns back to Me, last chance, move or we'll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are. That's when I pull out my phone and call the restaurant right there in front of everyone. Hi, this is Johnny. I made a reservation for seven PM under Johnson. There's some confusion about my table. The couple's confidence wavers slightly. The guy I whispers, what is he doing? The hostess who seated the couple answers. I put it on speaker so everyone can hear. Oh, Mister Johnson, yes, table 12 is definitely yours. Wait, someone else.

I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him Twig Boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me, a weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously, 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats and a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts, the LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely. While mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy. She'd beam at dinner when he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body wait for the first time. The best part was Emily starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout. He flex and quote Sidema, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidema. Refusing to Garrett anymore. Teachers got email signed Sidema while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer because Sidema trained alone and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed from painting concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this. The whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements and notes about breaking through with page after page of Sidema quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test His power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over. With shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole.

I admit it, I messed up. I had forgotten my phone was on silent. And so for two hours straight, I sweated my butt off on Smash Bros at my friend's house and forgot to text my girlfriend Cindy back. So when I finally saw her, 15 missed calls, she was furious. I need to know you're actually where you say you are, she said, but I already sent you my location and a picture of us on the coach. It's not enough. What if there are girls hiding behind you on the couch or what if it's just an old picture? I'm not stupid, Trent. From now on when you're out, we video call so I can see or you can wake up single. The next day she hung up practically foaming at the mouth. The first few calls were painfully awkward. I'd have to go around the house, introduce each of my friends to her, basically give her a house tour to show it's all clear before she hang up and randomly call again in the next hour or so to make sure I didn't change locations or invited over girls to my friend's house. After a few days like this, everyone was going crazy over her rule. My friend Jeff pulled me to the side with a concerned look. Dude, honestly, if she's gonna act crazy, you gotta do it too. That's When it came to me, a brilliant idea. The next time I was at Jeff's house, I answered Cindy's call in my best David Attenborough voice. Here we observe the male human in his natural habitat approaching the buffalo wings. With caution, I slowly turned the camera towards my friends who immediately caught on and started acting like wildlife. In the background, dinner was pretending to be a gazelle and Jeff was chest beating like a gorilla. Very funny, Cindy said, rolling her eyes at us. The next Friday, we took it further. I answered the call holding a microphone, reading out a fake weather forecast while Jeff held up a map glued to a pizza box. Currently, we're experiencing a high pressure system of Mario Kart moving through the living room area, I announced. Temperatures are rising as we travel through Rainbow Road. Now back to you, Cindy. Stop being weird, Cindy said. Just show me where you are and who's with you. I went around the room pulling each friend into a news interview, asking random questions about incidents that never happened. Cindy hung up before the second interview could even begin. Then at dinner's birthday dinner the following week, I went full cooking show host. Hello and welcome. Tonight's restaurant special is pasta with what appears to be some kind of red sauce. Locals like to call it spaghetti. My friends jumped in as sous chefs, with one describing the texture of the breadsticks. Another rated the Seasoning. Some people at the restaurant gave weird looks. Others started watching and laughing. Cindy lashed out. No more performances. But we couldn't stop, not without one last banger. That night, every single friend was there at my apartment for game night. What are you guys up to, I asked, watching them carry in different costumes. Jeff grinned. Don't worry about it, he said. All secretive, exchanging suspicious glances at each other. This time, I had no clue what was up. So when Cindy called, I answered, completely normal. Hey, babe, just playing games with the guys. She was immediately suspicious, narrowing her eyes. Why are you being so normal? What are you planning? Honestly, I didn't plan anything tonight other than play video games. Just as I panned the camera over to my friends, Jeff stood up behind me and shouted with a strong Spanish accent, Maria, how could you betray me with my twin brother? Tom emerged from the kitchen in a wedding dress, blonde wig and red lipstick that looked like a toddler applied it. I did nothing with your twin because I'm in love with the doctor. Before Cindy could process what was happening, dinner burst through the bedroom door wearing my bathrobe and a bad mustache made from electrical tape. That is right, Mi amigo. She is in love with me and we shall elope on the back of our family donkey and marry on top of El Castillo and Yucatan. Cindy and I stood there. With our mouths hung open, fully immersed in their 10 minute telenovela they called The Passions of Game Night, complete with a written script, costume changes, a random man playing dramatic Spanish guitar music in the background, all ending with the characters getting amnesia out of nowhere. Jeff even got slapped 17 times, falling and getting up dramatically each time. It was glorious. When the telenovela finally ended with Jeff ascending to heaven on a ladder while wearing angel wings made of paper plates, Cindy was silent for a full 10 seconds. Okay, she finally said, bursting into laughter, you win. That was just unbelievable. But I get it. The rule was ridiculous too. So let's just go back to normal. Texts, keep me updated. No more house tours. No more proving I'm not hiding some random woman in kitchen cabinets, I teased. She grinned. Yes, if you guys can put this much effort into proving a point, I doubt you'd be out there doing all that again for another crazy girl. But the thing was, it didn't end there because when Jeff got his own girlfriend with the same crazy rule, all the boys looked at each other with the same wicked thought.

My ex boyfriend, Jake, and I broke up two years ago, but we stayed friends. He was dating this girl, Emma, who seemed nice enough. And when their wedding invitation came in the mail, I honestly felt happy for them. Invitation said cocktail attire, and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream coloured with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning. I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me, and this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic, but figured maybe I was just imagining things. And Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress wedding. Oh, no. I tried to Explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer. But she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me. I expected him to be angry or embarrassed. Instead, he started laughing. Not mean laughing, but genuine can't help it laughing. He said, mom

My boyfriend, Felipe, had been making little comments about my talking for months, saying I could bore anyone to death or asking if I ever ran out of things to say. I told myself it was just him joking. But one night at his best friend's party, I was telling her about my promotion and he said, Jesus Christ, would you just shut the f up for once in your life? He said loud enough for the whole party to hear. Nobody cares about your boring job and you sound like a dead desperate attention whore. Everyone went dead silent while my face burned and Felipe just laughed and said this was what he dealt with every day. I didn't say another word the rest of the night and Felipe was loving it on the drive home, cranking up the music and going on about how peaceful everything was without my yapping. When I stayed quiet through Sunday, breakfast, too, he literally kissed my forehead and said we should do this more often. I didn't talk the rest of Sunday, which he seemed to love. But then Monday morning, he missed his huge presentation because I didn't remind him to set his alarm like I always did. He woke up two hours late, losing his mind about why I didn't wake him. I just stared at him while he ran around like a headless chicken trying to find His laptop and his good tie. His boss called to tell him not to bother coming in at all. And Felipe spent the whole night raging about almost getting fired while I sat there silent, making him even matter. This is your fault, he kept saying. But I just looked at him with dead eyes and said nothing. Then he completely forgot his mom's 60th birthday dinner because I usually handle all family stuff for him. She left six sobbing voice mails that I obviously didn't mention, each one more hysterical than the last. And by the time he checked his phone, she was convinced he hated her. He called me a psycho bitch for taking this so far. But honestly, his tantrum just made me more committed to never speaking to him again. His mom called his sister crying about how her only son had abandoned her. And suddenly the whole family was involved in the drama. Everything snowballed from there because his coworker had stopped by our apartment Tuesday when he wasn't home and I just stood there mute while she asked if I was okay for like 10 minutes straight. She kept asking if Felipe hurt me, if I needed help, if I could blink twice for yes. And I just stared at her until she left looking terrified. She went back to the office convinced Felipe was abusing me. And suddenly he was getting called into meetings about domestic violence resources and mandatory counseling. His boss, Literally asked if they needed to do a welfare check on me. And Felipe had to explain that I was giving him the silent treatment, which made him sound even more like an abuser. Friday's company gala was absolutely beautiful to watch unfold. Every executive who tried talking to me got complete silence while Felipe scrambled to explain I was just shy, which nobody bought because I've been chatty. At last year's event, the CEO's wife cornered me in the bathroom trying to slip me women's shelter pamphlets. And when I wouldn't respond, she called security to make sure Felipe wasn't holding me hostage or something. HR put him on immediate leave before we even made it to the parking lot, saying they needed to investigate the concerning reports about his home situation. Saturday, his friends came over for game night and finally understood why everyone was worried. What the hell did you do to her? His best friend asked. After I served snacks, without saying a word, Felipe actually admitted what he'd said and you could feel the temperature drop. They all left making excuses about early mornings and forgotten commitments. And his best friend told me I deserved better on his way out, which made Felipe throw a beer bottle at the wall after they were gone. By Sunday, Felipe was coming apart at the seams because his sister was threatening to call the cops, his mom had disowned him and his job was investigating him for abuse. Just say something, he screamed, following me around the house. One word and this nightmare ends. But I walked past him toward the garage to grab orange juice from the spare fridge, still not making a sound even when he grabbed my arm trying to stop me. The garage was a death trap of crap from the previous owners, paint cans from the 80s, boxes of rusted tools, old chemicals, all piled on these rickety metal shelves that look like they'd collapse if you breathed on them wrong. He followed me in there, still screaming about how I was destroying his life when he positioned himself right under the worst shelf, loaded with ancient paint cans that had to weigh a ton. He was gesturing so hard the whole thing started shaking and I watched the rusty brat it bend under 200 pounds of toxic chemicals. You know what? You're right. I don't want your voice back. I don't even want you anymore, he yelled. You were getting fat anyway. Now at least you're fat and quiet. The shelf made this horrible groaning sound and started tipping forward, all those cans sliding toward the edge. While Felipe kept ranting about how much better his life was now, the bracket snapped completely and everything started falling toward his skull. Full story on the channel below.

What happened? We had a small incident at school today. Did he get a bad grade? Did he break something? Worse than that? He knocked out a classmate during class. Knocked out my son? That's impossible. He punched a classmate during an argument. A punch he doesn't even know how to fight. He can barely open a jar of jelly. There must be a mistake. Unfortunately, there's no mistake. We have witnesses including the teacher who said the hit was so precise it looked like boxing training. Witnesses. What happened that made him do this? He said the other kid insulted his mom.

Help me roast this tea. So the teacher, she's so bad at her job, she can't even keep your violent little brat from throwing punches in class. Talking about someone's mom is a low blow.

At the very least, he Deserved a punch. Even with the provocation, that doesn't justify his actions. At least tell me the other kid got suspended, too, sir. The other kid ended up in the hospital. So if the school didn't suspend him, my son had to suspend him. Your son is suspended for 7 days. 7 days at home playing PlayStation. He's definitely going to hate that. You're a terrible father. Oh, and there's one more thing. After what happened, your son asked the teacher a question. What question? He put his hand in his backpack and asked the teacher. Teacher, do you know what comes after 44? What?

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you, she shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby? I deserve to be the first mom. Tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I, I better abort my baby within one week or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places, she announced to our entire cul de sac. She just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, she called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a t. E. D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming Down her face and said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower when the door or flew open, it was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise, I'm almost due, she announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date, that was eight weeks, weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in The Philippines and paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box cutters sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the, the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. The baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was call me from her hospital bed. You did this, she gasped through the oxygen mask. My baby is dying because you couldn't wait until me to have a child. The craziest part about all this is now that she was fighting for life, suddenly the fam.

How much is he short? Only 48,000 dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short 48,000 dollars. Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes. Yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money. Hold on. He makes 200 dollars a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. A 50 thousand dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom. My brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this. When you managed our finances, we were always in the red because you kept funneling money to your family. Now we finally saved a bit and you're pulling this again. You're his brother in law. He's buying a car for his wedding. Such an important event. Just help him out when he has money. Later, he'll definitely take care of you. Ha! I'm going to call your brother right now. Call what for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me, too? And $48,000. I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question, but you can't lend me $5,000. Is that the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000. So why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally. I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death situation. I'm done talking. To you, I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now. Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

It happened during an argument about her curfew. Carmen would let me stay out until midnight, she screamed. She actually understands me. I wish she was my real mom instead of you. I stood there in our kitchen holding the car keys she wanted, feeling something inside me shatter. Carmen, my ex husband's 26 year old wife, yoga instructor who bought my daughter designer clothes and let her drink wine at dinner. The cool mom who didn't enforce bedtimes or check homework. Your curfew is still ten PM, I said quietly slipping the keys into my pocket. I hate you, Natalie shouted. You're ruining my life, dad and Carmen treat me like an adult. She ran to her room and slammed the door. I heard her immediately on the phone. Mom's being a total bitch again. Can you come get me? 40 minutes later, my ex pulled up in his BMW, didn't even come to the door. Natalie dragged her overnight bag downstairs refusing to look at me. I'm staying at dad's this week, maybe permanently. Natalie, you have school. Carmen will drive me. She doesn't have a real job anyway. The job was intentional. I work 50 hours a week as a nurse to keep our apartment, pay for her braces, her phone, her life. Carmen teaches yoga three times a week and post motivational quotes on Instagram. After they left, I sat on Natalie's bed, looked Around her room, the walls still had the stars we painted together when she was 7. The bookshelf I built with my own hands, the quilt my mother made before she passed. But her Instagram was full of photos from her dad's house, Carmen's pristine kitchen, the pool, the shopping sprees, captions like with my favourite person, heart, eyes under, selfies with Carmen. Not one photo of us. I was the one up all night when she had pneumonia at 3. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to read, how to be kind. I worked doubles to pay for her dance classes while her father found himself in Thailand for six months. But Carmen was fun. Carmen was young. Carmen didn't make her eat vegetables or go to bed or study. Natalie stayed at her dad's for 2 weeks, posted constantly about her amazing bonus mom and their girls nights. Carmen taught her how to contour, bought her outfits. I'd said we're too grown up. Let her boyfriend sleep over. Then Carmen got bored. I got the call at 2:00am, Natalie crying, mom, can you come get me? What's wrong? Dad and Carmen went to Vegas. They left me here alone. I, I think someone's trying to break in. I drove 20 minutes in my pajamas, a baseball bat on the passenger seat, found her hiding in the bathroom shaking. The break in turned out to be tree branches scratching the window. But she'd been alone for Two days. I said I was mature enough to handle it, she whispered in the car. Carmen said it was good practice for college. You're 15. I know. Back home, I made her hot chocolate, real cocoa, not the sugar free kind Carmen buys. Natalie sat at.

Marry him anyway, my grandmother told me when I showed her the prenup my fiance's lawyer had drawn up. But first become exactly what they think you are. Everyone else said to run. My friends were horrified. My sister called me pathetic. The prenup basically said if we divorced, I'd get nothing. No alimony, no assets, no claim to anything acquired during marriage. Brian came from old money. His family was convinced I was a gold digger, a nurse marrying a tech CEO for his bank account. The prenup was their idea, protecting their precious son from the calculating poor girl. Sign it, grandma said, then go back to school. With what money? His. She was right. The prenup said nothing about education expenses during marriage, thing about him paying for my life while married. It only protected assets and divorce. So I signed it. His family celebrated. His mother actually said, so glad you understand your place. The day after our wedding, I enrolled in law school. Ryan thought it was cute. My little wife wants to be a lawyer. His friends laughed about how I'd never finish. I finished top of my class, law review, passed the bar, first try. His mother sneered at graduation. Such a waste. You'll be having babies soon. Anyway, I started my MBA next. Ryan paid for everything. We were married, shared finances. The prenup couldn't touch that. His family rolled their eyes at family Dinners while I discussed international business law. Seven years in, I had a law degree, an MBA and had started a consulting firm with the money Ryan gave me for shopping. Built it from nothing to six figures while being the perfect trophy wife at his events. His family still treated me like trash, still made jokes about the prenup protecting them from me. Ryan started believing them, getting cocky, cheating because what was I going to do, leave with nothing? Year 10, I filed for divorce. Ryan laughed. You get nothing. Remember that prenup you signed? Actually, I said I get everything I built. While the prenup protected his pre marriage assets and his income, it said nothing about businesses started during marriage with marital funds. My law degree taught me that. My MBA helped me build it. My consulting firm was worth $2 million. Started with his money? Yes, but legally mine. That's fraud, his mother screamed at mediation. That's marriage. My lawyer, my study partner from law school replied she used marital assets to build her own career. Completely legal. They tried to fight it at $300,000 on lawyers trying to break my business claim. But I documented everything perfectly, every dollar traced, every paper filed correctly. My grandmother's advice that everyone thought was stupid, become exactly what they think you are, then become something they never imagined. I thought I was a gold digger. Fine. I dug through their legal gold mine and found my own treasure. The best part was during the divorce proceedings, Ryan's lawyer tried to argue, I'd planned this all along.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her color. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost, like $3,000. When I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding, she said absolutely not, because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came, and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for Decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special. I was standing there watching Brianna boss around the photographers, when suddenly I heard gasps from the guests. There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here? You weren't invited! Brianna screamed loud enough for everyone to hear. The entire wedding party stopped what they were doing to watch. Grandma didn't even

Ever since I got to Mrs. Coleman's sixth grade class, she had this sick habit of making fun of the way I talked. See, I have this stutter that comes and goes, especially when I'm nervous or put on the spot. And this woman seemed to get off on calling me out every single time. At first, I thought maybe I was being dramatic, like, maybe she didn't mean it that way. But then it got worse. Way worse. Every time I'd raise my hand to answer something, she'd cut me off. The second I started struggling with a word. Oh, for crying out loud, just spit it out already, she'd say, rolling her eyes like I was the biggest inconvenience in the world. The whole class would get this uncomfortable silence, you know, like they wanted to say something but were too scared she'd turn on them next. Honestly, I don't blame them. Mrs. Coleman was the type of teacher who'd write you up for breathing too loud if she was having a bad day. After a few weeks of this garbage, I completely stopped raising my hand, stopped participating in anything. My grades started tanking because I was too terrified to speak up. Even when I knew the answers. I just sit there in the back row, trying to be invisible. My mom started noticing I was acting weird at home. She kept asking what was wrong, but I didn't want to be a snitch, you know? Plus, part of me thought maybe she wouldn't believe me or would think I was exaggerating. One night, when I was doing homework at the kitchen table. She sat down across from me and said, Alex, you used to love reading out loud to me. What's going on at school? I tried to brush it off, but she kept pushing, gently. Finally, I just broke down and told her everything. I told her how Mrs. Coleman would imitate my voice when I stuttered.

My neighbor, Mrs. Daniels, called 9 1 1 like it was her personal hotline. Monday she reported my kids for trespassing because their ball went in her yard. Wednesday she called the cops because my autistic son was making noise in our own backyard. Friday she called saying the kids were in danger because they were playing tag. The 9 1 1 operator probably recognized her voice better than her own family did. Things got worse as spring turned into summer and her calls went from annoying to actually dangerous. First, she called CPS and said we left our kids alone outside. I was sitting right there on the porch with a book when the social worker showed up. They close the case right away, but people had already started talking about us. Two weeks later, during my daughter's birthday party, she called the fire department about a gas leak. Five fire trucks showed up with their sirens going and scared all 12 kids at the party. The firefighters didn't find anything, but she went on Facebook saying we were probably making drugs. The worst thing happened in July when my autistic son had a meltdown in our yard. She called 9 1 1 and said a child was being beaten. Showed up ready for a domestic violence call and found me hugging my upset kid. Officer Martinez said something about her false reports, but Nothing happened to her. She started calling during my work zoom meetings on purpose. Other neighbors told me she kept notebooks full of made up complaints with dates and everything. She actually brag to people about making families like ours want to move away. Everything went crazy on a Tuesday in August when I got a letter from her lawyer wanting $15,000. She said we cause her emotional distress even though she was the one who called 9 1 1 53 times. I tried to talk to her like a normal person, but she said she'd add harassment to the lawsuit. That same day, my autistic son had his first friend from therapy come over to play. While the two kids were quietly playing with Legos, she called about suspicious people in my yard. Police cars surrounded my house, and both seven year olds were terrified.

After 12 hours of labor, the nurse handed me my son for the first time, and my brain completely rejected what my eyes were showing me. Sarah was destroyed from 12 hours of labor, her blonde hair plastered with sweat as she reached for our baby with shaking arms. But I stood paralyzed. The child in my white hands had deep brown skin and tightly coiled black hair that looked like someone had played the cruelest possible prank on us. Isn't he beautiful, Sarah whispered. And I forced myself to nod, even though my throat felt like it was closing. She must have seen something in my face because her smile faltered and she said, I know he doesn't look like what we expected, but remember what I told you about my great, great grandfather? I did remember vaguely some story about distant relatives with darker features, but this baby looked completely black. And my mind was racing with possibilities I didn't want to consider. The next few hours were a blur of nurses checking vitals and Sarah's family bursting through the door. They raced here for the emergency delivery while my family searched desperately for flights from Colorado. Her mother cradled our son like precious gold, and her sister kept touching his tiny fingers and saying he had Sarah's exact chin. Their pure joy made my doubts feel poisonous. Sarah watched me watching them and finally reached for my hand. Are you okay with this, she whispered. And her voice broke something open in me. I kissed her forehead and promised I'd be the best father this baby could have. This wasn't what we'd expected, but we were still a team. Nothing would change that. But the poison started seeping in. The moment I left the hospital to grab clothes from home, my phone exploded with messages from my mother, who'd seen the photos Sarah posted. That is not your child, her text said in all caps, followed by, I told you she wasn't good enough for our family. My best friend Jake called while I was driving and said, dude, I'm sorry, but there's no way. You need to get tested ASAP before you sign anything. Even my brother, who'd always loved Sarah, texted, man, the math isn't mathing here. By the time I got back to the hospital, my head was spinning with doubt. Sarah was nursing the baby and singing softly, looking like the perfect mother. But all I could think about was how she'd been working late so many nights during her pregnancy and how her phone was always face down on the counter. My mother called again while Sarah was sleeping and spent 20 minutes listing every time she'd caught Sarah in a lie, which were really just miscommunications, but suddenly seemed sinister. She played you for a fool, my mother said, and now she's trying to pass off another man's baby as yours. The Next morning, I couldn't even look at the baby without feeling sick. Sarah noticed immediately and asked what was wrong. But I just shrugged and said I was tired. She tried again, reminding me about her cousin Marcus, who had similar features, even pulling up photos on her phone. But my mother's voice kept echoing in my head, especially after her text that morning saying there were no flights left and she'd come when things were sorted out. When the discharge papers came, I told Sarah I needed air and walked out of the hospital. I sat in my car for an hour reading text after text from friends and family, all saying the same thing, that I was being scammed, that no genealogy could explain this, that I needed to protect myself. I didn't go back inside. Instead, I texted Sarah that I needed a paternity test before we were done, then turned off my phone and drove to my buddy's house to crash on his couch. My brother caught the first flight out when I finally called him, and we spent days feeding each other's doubts while I ignored Sarah's desperate attempts to reach me. She's probably scrambling to figure out her story, my brother said when we grabbed beers at some dive bar near. Thank god you didn't sign the birth certificate, my mother added during one of her hourly calls, her voice full of relief, like I dodged a bullet instead of abandoned my family when I finally agreed to meet for the test. I made.

I lost my son to the streets when he was 14. That was it. Deshawn started running with the nigeltron, stealing, carrying guns, disappearing for weeks at a time. His dad was in prison, so it was just me working double shifts at the hospital while watching my baby throw his life away piece by piece. But I fought like hell to get him back. I never stopped praying he'd come home alive. That year, everything changed completely. Deshawn got arrested on a weapons charge, facing ten years as an adult. But the feds made him an offer. Cooperate with their investigation, testify against his crew, and he'd get probation plus witness Protection. They promised me he'd be safe. We've done this hundreds of times, Mrs. Serena. Your son will be completely protected. This is his ticket out of this life forever. Deshawn took the deal without hesitation. When he was freed eight months later, something was different in his eyes. He looked at me and said, Mama, I'm done with this life. I wanna make you proud for once. The prosecutors relocated us across town. New apartment, new phone numbers, new identities. They said the gang thought he was still locked up. We were completely invisible. I went overboard helping him rebuild his entire future. Got him enrolled in GED classes, drove him to community college. Every morning at 7:00am sharp, he studied like his life depended on it. Which It literally did. Applied to Howard University for business administration. Talked constantly about opening an auto shop, helping kids like himself escape the streets. When the Howard acceptance letter came in March, full scholarship, he screamed so loud, the neighbors complained. First person in our family to go to university. He was blowing with pure joy and pride. His community college graduation was May 20th. Then Howard in the fall. I took my first vacation day in three years. Bought a new dress from the department store, got my hair done professionally. I wanted to look perfect when they called his name. Sean had his speech memorized. Practiced it every morning in the bathroom mirror. The night before graduation, Desean was trying on his cap and gown for the hundredth time, practicing his walk across an imaginary stage. I was making his favorite dinner, my grandmother's fried chicken recipe. We stayed up late talking about Howard. He hugged me tight and said, and tomorrow is our day, Mama. We made it. That morning, Deshawn woke me up at 6:00am, grinning ear to ear. Graduation day, he yelled. We had breakfast together. He put on his suit, and I took pictures of him in his cap and gown. He left early to get to the venue and practice his speech one more time. I was driving to the ceremony alone, singing along to the radio, when my phone rang. It was the hospital Miss

My best friend Mike called me at 3:00am last Tuesday, voice shaking. I need to tell you something, and I need you to listen without hanging up. We've been friends since middle school, so I knew something was seriously wrong. Remember that guy Derek, who kept harassing my sister at work? The one who followed her home and kept showing up at her apartment? I remembered Derek was this creepy older guy who wouldn't take no for an answer. Mike's sister Emma, had filed multiple complaints, but nothing stuck. Well, he's not going to bother anyone anymore, Mike said quietly. My blood went cold. What do you mean, he's not going to bother anyone? There was this long pause where I could hear Mike breathing heavily through the phone. I was driving home from Emma's place last night around midnight. She'd been crying because Derek showed up at her work again, this time with flowers and a note saying he knew where she lived. I was so angry I could barely see straight, Mike continued. That's when I saw Derek's car parked outside her apartment complex. He was just sitting there in the dark, watching her windows. I pulled over and walked up to his car. When he saw me, he started laughing and said Emma would come around eventually. I snapped. I dragged him out of the car, and we started fighting in the parking lot. But then he Hit his head on the concrete when he fell. There was so much blood and he wasn't moving. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. My hands were shaking as I held the phone. Mike, please tell me you called 9 1 1. Another long silence. I panicked. I put his body in his trunk and drove his car to the old quarry outside town. You know, the one where we used to go swimming as kids. The car is at the bottom of the lake now with Derek inside. I hiked back to my car and drove home like nothing happened. I felt sick to my stomach. This was my best friend. The guy who helped me through my parents divorce, who was the best man at my wedding. Mike, we need to call the police right now. This was self defense, or at least manslaughter. If you explain what happened. No, he interrupted. They'll never believe me. A guy with Derek's background doesn't just disappear without someone looking into it. But if they find the car, I'm going to prison for murder. The next few days were torture. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't look at my wife without feeling like I was keeping this horrible secret. Mike acted completely normal, even asking if I wanted to grab drinks that weekend. But something felt wrong about his story. Derek was a big guy, probably 200 pounds. Mike was maybe 150, soaking wet. How did he drag A body that size and get it into a trunk by himself? And why would Derek be parked outside Emma's apartment when she moved to a new place across town two weeks ago? I started doing some digging. I called Emma and casually asked how she was doing with the Derek situation. Oh, that's been resolved for weeks, she said. My new boyfriend Jake had a talk with him, and Derek hasn't bothered me since. When did this happen? I asked about three weeks ago. Jake used to play college football, and I think Derek got the message pretty clearly three weeks ago. But Mike said this happened last Tuesday. Then I remembered something else. Mike had been acting strange for months, not just the past week. Paranoid, jumpy, asking weird questions about loyalty and friendship. He'd been having money problems, too. Something about gambling debts. I decided to drive out to the quarry myself. If there really was a car down there, I needed to see it with my own eyes. When I got to the spot where we used to swim, the water was crystal clear. You could

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I moved in with my girlfriend Tessa after dating for 8 months. Everything seemed perfect. She was funny, smart and had this golden retriever named Milo who she absolutely adored. Only problem was Milo seemed to hate my guts from day one. This dog would bark at me non stop whenever I walked in the room. He'd pee on my clothes if I left them on the floor. One time he even snapped at me when I tried to kiss Tessa goodnight. But every time I brought it up, Tessa would just laugh it off. He's just protective of me, she'd say with this sweet smile. Dogs can be jealous when their owner gets a boyfriend. He'll warm up to you eventually. I really wanted to make it work. I took Milo on long walks every morning before work. I bought him expensive treats and toys. I even let him sleep in our bed even though he growled at me all night. But nothing worked. If anything, he seemed to get worse. The weird part was I started noticing Milo only acted aggressive when Tessa wasn't around. When she was home, he'd just ignore me or give me these creepy stares. But the second she left for work or went to the store, this dog turned into a complete psycho. One afternoon while I was making lunch, Milo straight up lunged at me and bit my ankle hard. Blood was Dripping down into my sock. When Tessa got home an hour later, I showed her the bite marks and told her what happened. He looked at the wound then at me and said, you must have done something to provoke him. Milo doesn't just attack people for no reason. I couldn't believe it. Tessa, look at my leg. Your dog bit me and drew blood. Maybe you stepped on his tail or something. She said shrugging. Dogs don't lie, Jordan. People do that. Stung. But I didn't want to be the guy who made his girlfriend choose between him and her pet. Instead, I went online and bought a cheap pet camera. I set it up in the hallway where Milo spent most of his time when Tessa was gone. The first day of footage was normal. Milo just slept on his bed and ignored me. But on the second day, I caught something that made my blood run cold. Right before Tessa left for work, she knelt down next to Milo and whispered something in his ear. I couldn't make out the words, but after she left, Milo immediately got up and started barking at me aggressively. I rewind the footage and turned up the volume. Clear as day, I heard Tessa say.

Now they are furious. My husband and I are moderately more financially stable than my brother's family, primarily because we both worked hard academically and earned partial college scholarships while my brother and his wife spent high school partying and ended up with an unplanned pregnancy at 17. Because of this history, my parents consistently do significantly more for my brother's family than they do for us despite our responsible choices and stable lifestyle. When it comes to gifts and special treatment, the disparity is absolutely glaring. My eight year old daughter Emma receives cheap toys from discount stores and maybe a 20 dollar gift card for her birthday, while my nephews get expensive gaming systems, tablets, designer clothes and elaborate vacation trips to theme parks. The difference in treatment is so obvious even extended family members have commented on how unfair it seems. My brother needs emergency childcare. My parents will immediately cancel their own plans and drive across town to help him out, no questions asked. If I need babysitting assistance, I have to give them at least 2 weeks advance notice plus offer to pay them for their time and they'll still find excuse is to decline half the time. They've made it clear that my brother's needs take absolute priority over mine in every situation. Because of this blatant favoritism, my daughter has developed a distant relationship with my parents. She's polite but not particularly warm. Or excited to see them, unlike how she acts with my husband's parents, who treat her like she's the center of their universe and shower her with genuine affection. Earlier today, we were having one of our infrequent family gatherings at my parents house. I asked if she could play on the large trampoline they'd recently purchased for their backyard. My father immediately said no, explaining that the trampoline was specifically for my nephews and not for Emma to use. When she asked why not, he said my brother's kids visit more often so they needed their own special equipment. Emma started begging to at least try it for a few minutes, but dad remained firm. That's when my daughter stomped away and declared loud enough for everyone to hear, this is why I like Nana and papa better. They're actually nice to me and don't treat me like I don't matter. She was referring to my husband's parents who absolutely adore her. My parents faces turned red with anger and embarrassment. My mother furiously demanded that I discipline Emma for being disrespectful toward her grandparents. I should force Emma to apologize for saying something so hurtful in front of the entire family. I looked at my mother calmly and replied, what exactly did you expect? He thinks you both hate her because you treat her completely differently than her cousins. She's 8 years old. She notices when she's excluded from things they're allowed to do. My father Started arguing that they don't play favorites. But I cut him off. I pointed out that my nephews had been jumping on that trampoline for the past hour while Emma was forced to sit inside and watch. I mentioned that.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. And for three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM wear navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through for free. Without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor and honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date her. I picked her up that Saturday. Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together and my supposed favorite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she explained the Situation. My parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner's son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride, she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe, she said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised but took it, whispering thanks so quietly I almost missed it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. When her uncle made a toast, I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. Couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer. Just follow me. Stop thinking so hard. She looked Up at me and for a moment, her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands. The crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm for making her happy, even if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest that had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me, really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat when I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect fake boyfriend. Where even now the words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for 5 minutes feeling like an idiot before driving. Home. The next morning, Poppy's sister texted me. You left your.

I was a guest at my coworker's wedding when his 14 year old daughter from his previous marriage stood up during the objection part. She was supposed to be the flower girl, but had been acting strange all morning. When she spoke up, everyone thought it was just going to be something cute like I want daddy all to myself. Instead, she pulled out her phone and started playing a video. It was a recording of the bride telling someone on the phone that she'd already arranged for his daughter to go to boarding school. Right after the wedding, she. She was saying how she couldn't handle having that brat around and he'll get over it once she's gone. The groom's face just crumbled. He turned to his bride and asked if it was real. The bride started crying, saying she only did it because she loved him and wanted them to have their own family without baggage from the past. His daughter ran up to him crying, and he just picked her up and walked straight out of the church. The bride tried to run after them, but his sister blocked the aisle. The wedding coordinator later told me the bride had already secretly submitted boarding school applications using the groom's forged signature. The daughter had found the acceptance letter in the bride's email when borrowing her iPad for homework.

The first time she opened her mouth in court, I didn't expect her words to stop a sentencing. We were packed into that courthouse like sardines. The walls felt too close, the benches too hard and my heartbeat too loud. My daughter, Olivia, just 8 years old, sat beside me, swinging her feet. She looked so small in that big room. Her Sunday dress too formal. Her hair and braids I'd redone three times that morning just to keep my hands busy. Across the aisle sat the man who had taken everything from us. He was just 20, a kid, really. He didn't look dangerous, just tired, like he hadn't slept since the night he pulled the trigger. But I didn't care how tired he looked. My husband was gone and he was still breathing. The widow of the store clerk, my husband's boss, sat silently, her eyes hollow. Next to her was her son, maybe 10, clinging to her arm. I wanted to reach for Olivia's hand, but she was busy twisting the edge of the paper heart she'd made that morning, the one I didn't have the strength to ask about. The prosecutor spoke first, cold, clinical. The victim was an innocent man, a father, a husband. This was a violent, senseless act. Then came the defense. They talked about his upbringing, broken home, drug addicted mother, foster care. They showed pictures of his bruises, his grades, his Attempts at rehab. This doesn't excuse the crime, his lawyer said, but we asked the court to consider who he was before he picked up the gun. I hated how calm they all sounded, how measured, like this was just another case. The judge asked if anyone else wished to speak. I felt the weight of the room tilt toward me. Everyone expected the grieving wife to stand, but I couldn't. I'd written 10 different versions of a statement and tore up every single one. The only thing I wanted to say was give me my husband back. That wasn't an option. Then Olivia raised her hand. I didn't even realize what she was doing until she was already standing, walking to the front like it was show and tell. The courtroom murmured. The bailiff looked to the judge, who gave a small nod. And just like that, my daughter stood before the man who murdered her father. My name is Olivia, she said, her voice small.

After I caught her texting her ex, I didn't say a word. Just walked to the bedroom and started packing. She kept laughing from the couch. You're being dramatic, Michael. It's just texting. I pulled out my laptop, opened my banking app, and started clicking. Her laughter died when she heard the notification sounds. What are you doing? Still silent. Removed her from my car insurance. Cancelled her phone plan that I paid for. Click. Change the Netflix password she used Daily. Michael, stop. This isn't funny anymore. But I wasn't done. Logged into our shared Spotify account, change the password. Then Amazon Prime, then Hulu, then Disney Plus. Every single subscription she used but never paid for. Even changed the Wi Fi password on our router. Are you seriously going through every account right now? Next, I opened my credit card app, removed her as an authorized user. Then my gym membership cancelled her guest privileges. My Costco card revoked her access. This is insane. You're being psychotic. I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door. She jumped up, panic setting in. Wait, where are you going? You can't just leave! Finally spoke. You asked what I was going to do. I'm showing you my phone. Buzzed Uber outside. Michael, I'm sorry. It meant nothing. Then neither does this. I walked out. The Uber driver was cool. Helped me load my stuff without asking. Questions. We drove away. I saw her standing in the doorway, still holding her dead phone, realizing she couldn't even connect to Wi Fi to call for help. Twenty minutes later, my phone exploded. Her number was already disconnected since I'd canceled the plan, but her friends started texting me. She's crying at Starbucks because she can't call an Uber without her phone plan. She tried to drive home, but remembered you took her off insurance. He's asking everyone for Netflix passwords because she was watching a show. She went to the gym, and they wouldn't let her in. Then came the really good stuff. Her sister called me. Michael, what did you do? Madison's at my place having a complete meltdown. I did exactly what she suggested. She says you cut off everything. Her phone, insurance, streaming accounts, gym access. That's petty. Petty is texting your ex behind your boyfriend's back for two months. Two months? She said it just started. I sent her sister a screenshot of the oldest text I'd found from March. It was now may. Oh, my God, Michael, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Her sister called back an hour later. She's been lying to everyone. I read through more of those texts. She was planning to leave you. I know. Right after her ex said he wasn't ready for a relationship. So you were her backup plan. Exactly. Keep me around for bills while pursuing him emotionally. The next day, I got A call from an unknown number. Madison using her mom's phone. Michael, please.

I woke up to my teenage daughter Kayla's piercing screams. I ran into her bedroom and couldn't believe what I saw. She was completely bald, her blonde hair scattered across her pillowcase. She was sobbing, telling me her little sister Reese must have shaved her head while she was sleeping. She stumbled to the bathroom mirror and started screaming even louder when she saw her collection. Problem was in eight hours, and she was supposed to be a shoe in for Queen. Now it was ruined. Where's Reese? I demanded. And my husband found her sitting on her own bed in her unicorn pajamas with his electric razor on her nightstand. Reese, what did you do? I asked, trying not to scream while Kayla sobbed in the bathroom. I had to stop her from going to prom, Reese said in that small voice she uses when she knows she's in trouble but thinks she did the right thing. This was my baby, who still crawled into Kayla's bed during thunderstorms. The same little girl who Kayla taught to ride a bike last summer. The one who followed her big sister everywhere, asking endless questions about everything. I couldn't believe she would sabotage her sister's big night like this. Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Kayla's boyfriend, Steven, let himself in like he always did on Saturday mornings. He. He Came upstairs calling about corsage colours, and stopped dead when he saw Kayla's bald head. What the hell happened to your hair? He asked, and quickly rearranged his face into concern. Baby, don't cry. We can fix this. Maybe get you a nice wig. You'll still be the prettiest girl there. Kayla was crying harder now. Steven pulled her against him while glaring at me like this was my fault. Did Reese do this? I always said that kid was weird. This is assault, Missus Adams! Reese appeared in the bathroom doorway, still in her unicorn pajamas. I cut off all her hair so she couldn't go to prom with you because you're mean to her, Reese! I yelled, but she kept talking in that determined little kid voice. You hurt my sister all the time, Devin. I see the purple marks on her arms where you grabbed her too hard. The bathroom went silent. Steven laughed, but it sounded forced. Kids make up crazy stories, Missus Adams. Tell her, Kayla. Tell your mom how good I am to you. Kayla wouldn't look at anyone. I felt ice spreading through my chest. I took pictures on Mommy's phone when Kayla was sleeping, Reese said, her voice getting stronger. You push her into walls, you hit her tummy where nobody can see. Then you buy her presents after so she won't tell. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands and opened my photos. There they were, close UPS of Kayla's Arms with finger shaped bruises. Her ribs with dark purple marks. I felt my stomach drop. Oh my god, I whispered. Kayla, is this true? Steven's face was getting red. Those could be from anything she plays.

What makes you special? When I was 11, I started noticing this weird thing. Whenever someone lied to me, my tongue would tingle like when you lick a battery. The first time it happened was at school when my friend Mia said she didn't take my pencil. My tongue buzzed like crazy and later I found it in her desk. I thought it was just in my head, but it kept happening. In middle school, when kids said they didn't copy my homework, buzz. When they claimed they weren't talking about me behind my back, buzz. By 8th grade, I realised I had some kind of superpower, but it freaked me out. I stopped shaking hands with people because what if they were lying about something and I could taste it? I stopped eating at potluck because what if someone lied about washing their hands? My classmates already thought I was weird, so I never told anyone. But my gift made me unbeatable at group projects and friend drama. People thought I just had really good instincts about people. I didn't correct them. Then junior year happened and everything changed. My mom had been dating this guy, Trevor for about 6 months. He was one of those smooth talkers who remembered everyone's birthday and always brought flowers. Mom was totally smitten. But every single time Trevor opened his mouth around me, my tongue went fuzzy. Not just a little tingle, but full on electric Shock mode when he said he loved spending time with our family. Buzz when he complimented my mom's cooking. Buzz when he claimed he was just looking out for us. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The guy was a walking lie detector nightmare. I tried telling my mom about my bad vibes, but she brushed it off as teenage attitude. She said I was just protective and needed to give him a chance. But I knew something was wrong. One afternoon I came home early from school and caught Trevor in my room. He was holding my tablet, scrolling through it like he owned the place. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed. Hey, kiddo, just checking this for viruses, he said with that fake smile. Your mom asked me to make sure you're staying safe online. My tongue practically exploded. The buzzing was so intense I could barely think straight. He was lying through his teeth. My mom would never ask you to do that, I said. He shrugged. She worries about you. You know how moms are more buzzing. I grabbed my tablet from him and told my mom everything when she got home. But Trevor had already spun some story about me being disrespectful and trying to cause problems in their relationship. Mom took his side. That's when I decided to set a trap. I left my tap.

As I walked across the stage alone, my phone buzzed. A text from my dad, you owe us an apology. Plus 37 missed calls. I didn't expect to graduate alone, but the empty chairs in the family section told me everything. Before I even walked across the stage, my name echoed through the auditorium. Applause blurred into static, and I gripped my diploma like a lifeline. Then my phone buzzed. A text from my dad, you owe us an apology. Followed by 37 missed calls. Apologize for what? For working three jobs to get here? For not being born? My sister, Claire. The air outside smelled of cut grass and balloons. Sat by a fountain alone, rereading that text until the words burned into me. Apologize. My parents hadn't just skipped my graduation. They had scheduled my sister's baby shower on the same day. And every time I brought it up, they brushed me off. Ryan, this is once in a lifetime for your sister, my dad said. You'll have other ceremonies, my mom added. That morning, I'd still held out hope. I kept checking the parking lot. Nothing. Not a single familiar face. Instead, I got told to apologize. When I finally went home, the living room looked like a pink explosion. Balloons, confetti, pastel mountains of baby gifts. Claire sat on the recliner like it was a throne. She didn't even look at Me? Did you bring something for the baby? We're still accepting gifts. I had nothing left after scraping together money for a graduation suit. No flowers, no balloons. Just the quiet hope that maybe my family would understand. Instead, my mom cut me off. Ryan, your attitude is unacceptable. We had to choose, and we chose your sister. She needed us more. I whispered. I needed you, too. My dad's face hardened. Walking across the stage isn't the same as bringing life into this world. Be grateful we're even celebrating you now. Claire laughed. Don't sulk. You'll get another graduation when you do your masters. This one was just practice. That was it. I left. The following weeks were worse. Relatives whispered about how selfish I was for missing her shower. At a barbecue, my uncle chuckled. You really should have been there for your sister. Months later, I tried again. My grandmother asked me to visit. I walked into the house to find another baby shower underway. The second shower. And the first words out of my dad's mouth were, you weren't invited. This is for family. Claire smirked. It's fine, dad. He can stay. Make himself useful. The gifts are heavy. I hauled boxes from the car while relatives whispered. He skipped the first shower out of jealousy. Poor Claire. The breaking point came with dessert. My dad tapped a glass. Claire, there. We are so proud of you. You've brought this family together. In a way, nothing Else ever has. You've given us purpose. Then he turned to me. Ryan, maybe one day you'll understand what it means to put family above yourself. Until then, we'll keep praying for you. The applause was thunderous. I stood there. Diploma erased. Years of sacrifice erased. While my family clapped for the daughter who had never lifted a finger. Something snapped. I didn't yell. I didn't argue. I just.

I saw my six year old daughter standing outside, freezing in the snow. I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every, every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly. This whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He Picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we

My teacher asked, does anyone here know how to deliver a baby? I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. It looked wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what? What's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone. I gripped the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mister Gonzales, you're scaring me. I call my mom. No, he Swerved around a car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted, but I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzalez kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17. I said, stupid, like that made any difference. I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

The doctor said she had four months with brain cancer, so when she asked to try cigarettes and wine, I figured why not? She's 16 and dying. Normal rules don't apply. We spent three weeks bonding on the back porch. She'd smoke these little cigarettes I bought her and we'd split a beer while talking about everything she'd never get to do. It was beautiful. In this twisted way, she seemed more relaxed than since the diagnosis. Those evenings became sacred to us. She'd tell me about boys she had crushes on but never got to date. We'd talk about college majors she'd researched but would never pursue. She wanted to study marine biology, said she'd always dreamed of swimming with sharks. The irony wasn't lost on either of us that she was more afraid of living than dying. I watched my wife struggle with what we were doing. She'd see us through the kitchen window and her face would crumble, but she never said anything. How do you argue with a dying kid's last requests? How do you be the parent who says no when time is running out? She started taking longer shifts at work, I think to avoid watching us slowly poisoning ourselves. My daughter started sleeping better. The constant anxiety that had consumed her since the diagnosis seemed to fade. With each cigarette, she'd lean against my shoulder and we'd just sit in comfortable Silence, watching the sunset. I memorize those moments knowing I'd replay them forever after she was gone. She told me things during those sessions that broke my heart. How she felt guilty for being sick, how she worried we'd spend all our savings on treatments that wouldn't work. She was scared of the pain, but more scared of leaving us behind. I held her while she cried, both of us smoking and pretending it was helping. The strangest part was how normal it felt after a few days. This was just what we did now. Father, daughter bonding over beer and cigarettes because the universe dealt us the worst possible hand. The next morning, Dr Martinez called while we were having breakfast. She put it on speaker like always, turning the volume all the way up. He sounded strange, like.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts, having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister, and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot, holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying, but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 centimeters dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack. Head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane, but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family. Your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls. At this point, the last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating. With another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too. I needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but part down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years ago. My Knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused. Check, taking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop? The dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar, talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone. Probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb, his 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again, fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework, completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab programme, 60 days, some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapse the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox. Maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,500 for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewellery, our t v, Emma's laptop and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The kid Had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed, not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad who died when she was 6. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born, $180,000 that was meant to get her through whatever college she wanted without debt. Emma's crazy smart, like scary smart. Her teachers keep telling me she could get into Harvard or Yale if she keeps her grades up. But even with scholarships, those schools cost a fortune and our incomes too high to qualify for financial aid. That money was supposed to be her safety net, her ticket to whatever future she wanted. I told my husband absolutely not. The fund was off limits, period. That's when he lost it, started yelling about how I was choosing money over his son's life, how addiction was a medical condition, how we had a moral obligation to help family. He kept saying medical emergencies come before education, like Emma going to college with some luxury instead of her entire future. The worst part happened three days later. I came home from work early and found my husband and Emma sitting at the Kitchen table. She looks like she'd been crying. And there were all these pamphlets spread out about the rehab place. My husband had asked her directly if she'd be willing to give up 30,000.

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I owned every cable, every tower, and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. I need options, he said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse. Half the price, double the speeds, and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact at the grocery store. At Pete's Diner, Conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. Tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain, and I was 3 months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers. Fifteen years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now, it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract. That connects infrastructure piggybacked completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall and Filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Harry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

That's why you're blocked until I'm home. When she came back expecting me at the airport, she found out who was really waiting for her. I run a cyber security firm. My fiance, Rachel and I had been together for four years. Wedding planned for December. She announced a Miami bachelorette trip with her sister Emma, cousin Sophia and best friend Megan. When I offered to book their hotel through my corporate account for a discount, she snapped, you don't need to know where we're staying. Why do you need to control everything? It's a girl's trip, David. You don't need to know what happens on a girl's trip. That's why you're blocked until I'm home. Then she held out her hand. Your ring stays here. What happens in Miami stays in Miami. I slipped off my engagement ring without argument. Her triumphant smile told me everything. She he'd already decided what would happen in Miami that night. I activated the parental controls I'd installed on her phone months earlier when fixing her hacked Instagram. She'd forgotten about the admin access. Her sister Emma texted their group, can't believe David bought that Bachelorette story. The wedding photographer wants confirmation. He's lying down Thursday. Wedding photographer. Our wedding wasn't until December. I checked his portfolio. He specialized in elopements and destination ceremonies. The Uber to the airport wasn't going to Mia. It went to a private airfield. The Pilot filed a flight plan to Turks and Cacos where you can marry immediately without waiting period. Her maid of honor, Megan, posted a story from the plane. In her champagne glass reflection, I saw a man's hand wearing a Princeton class ring. I knew that ring. It belonged to Connor, her ex who dumped her for a job in Switzerland five years ago, the one she cried about for months, the one whose mother told her she wasn't good enough for their family. Her location showed the Beaches Resort Chapel. Through the resort's public webcam, I watched my fiance in a white dress exchanging vows with Connor while her friends smiled. The same friends who'd eaten dinner at my house two nights ago. But Connor wasn't the only one with a secret. His job in Switzerland was actually federal prison for embezzlement. He'd been released six months ago, broke desperate with fraud convictions that meant no legitimate firm would touch him. I called Rachel's father, a federal judge who'd been saving for our wedding. I sent him screenshots of Connor's criminal record, his bench warrant for unpaid restitution and live footage of his daughter marrying a con victim who owed the government $3.8 million. Judge Miller was on the next flight out with federal marshals. Her sister Emma hadn't turned off location sharing. I sent her husband the coordinates showing her at the chapel during work hours when she claimed to be at a dental conference. Cousin Sophia's boyfriend Screenshots of her texting another man about their hotel room. Megan's employer got videos of her using the company credit card at the resort bar.

Twice. So I let go completely. Two years later, I walked into that house party with a crowd that left her absolutely stunned. Regina ended it twice. First time at her apartment after dinner. I need space. You're always here, always texting, always needing to know where I am. Second time, when I tried to fix things a month later. You're too clingy. You have no life outside of us. That word destroyed me. Clingy. Like loving someone completely was a character flaw. Three days later, she was already posting stories with hunter, one of our mutual friends from the group. The same hunter who'd been at every game night, every birthday, every random Tuesday hangout. They weren't even subtle about it. Same coffee shop we used to go to, same booth, same drinks. Except now hunter was sitting where I used to be. Our entire friend group just rolled with it. Hunter and Regina just clicked. They'd say like I'd never existed. Like three years of being part of their circle meant nothing. Lorelai, who I helped move twice, suddenly couldn't text back. Graham, who'd crashed at my place countless times, acted like we'd never met. They chose sides without anyone asking them to. Was completely alone. No girlfriend, no friends, no weekend plans, no one to text stupid memes to. So I did the only thing I could. Started saying yes to everything. Coworker mentioned. A hiking group. Yes. Random gym buddy. Invited me to trivia night. Yes! Neighbor needed someone for their recreational basketball team. Absolutely yes. The hiking group LED to Anna, Declan, and Carlos, three people who actually wanted to hang out. Trivia night introduced me to an entire crew of movie nerds who did weekly screenings. Basketball connected me to guys who grabbed beers without making it feel like an obligation. Within six months, I had three different group chats going. Multiple invites every weekend. Inside jokes with people who didn't know Regina existed. He knew me as the guy who was always down for whatever, not the clingy ex who got dumped while I was building an actual life. Regina and hunter were imploding. According to Instagram, their posts went from constant to sporadic. Couple photos replaced with solo shots. Hunter's friends would occasionally mention drama when I ran into them. She's jealous of everyone. Can't handle him having other friends. Sound familiar? A year and a half in, I met Zoe at a concert my new friends dragged me to. She was there with her roommates, dancing like nobody was watching. We talked between sets about the most random things. She collected vintage postcards, had opinions about every food truck in the city, made me laugh until my sides hurt. When she asked for my number, she said it was because I seemed like someone with good friend group energy. Four months of dating before the universe decided to be hilarious. Her roommate Rachel was dating Someone named Graham? Yeah, that Graham. My former friend who'd ghosted me when Regina chose hunter. When Zoe mentioned meeting Rachel's boyfriend's

Our chemistry teacher, Mr Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week. Senior year, everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. Twelve year old sister Lily walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. Text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle, just held out his fat hand phone. See you next Tuesday, Mr Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged, explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk. Maybe you'll think twice next time. That afternoon changed everything. Lily never made it home. Some freak in a white van had been watching Jefferson Middle for weeks when she tried calling Marcus 1st like she always did when scared. His phone phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on 8th. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking, wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged 10 years. He walked straight to Rodriguez's room during lunch. I need my phone back.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day.

I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

As a kid? When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule, no video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant, the closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on, no sound effects, no music, no voice acting, just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of elf gaming. I wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds and just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head and left the game running. He opened my door and I held my breath pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I can see the Light from my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble, he walked over to my tea. I was dead. Caught red handed, game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this. My mom's footsteps came up the stairs. I was.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day.

I understand that you've been married for three years, but I'm hurting also because I had no idea that he was married to you, and he's been acting like we are creating. Okay, but you know what I'm saying. Three months of casual dating is nothing compared to an actual marriage. No, no, no. Okay, I wasn't. Oh, my goodness. Wait, listen. I wasn't. Okay, does he take off his wedding ring every time you see him? Yeah, he. Girl, he has never been wearing a wedding ring ever. Like, never ever. And I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. Oh, my. Of your marriage. I had no idea that he was married. Like, so. That's what I'm saying. So obviously, it's not been casual dating. In my opinion, and in my eyes, we have been building something together. So forgive me for sleeping with your husband, but I had no idea that he was your husband. Do you feel me? Oh, man. Um. Okay, well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you, but obviously, like you said, I guess she didn't tell you. This is not necessarily your fault. I'm sure. I hope That you wouldn't go out of your way to sleep with a married man. But if you said that you don't know that he's married, I guess I don't really have any choice to believe you, so. Oh, my god. What? I'm going to. I mean, I honestly wouldn't. I wouldn't go out of my way to sleep with a married man. But, like, here's the. The fact of the matter is that I did, you know, and I do have feelings for Desmond. So I don't really know. Like, I don't really know what to say right now. I'm feeling very overwhelmed, and I'm sorry. I don't. This is really totally, completely awkward and weird, but, like, I don't know what's going on, either. I have no idea. I'm. I just. I'm. I'm so.

Her name is Kelly. Okay. Okay. Kelly's a hot girl name. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's. That's what I always think, anyway. And so she works out, like, all the time. She's, like, really in shape and all that stuff. Okay. Is that something you talked to her about, or you just assume we. Because we. We talked a little bit about that. You know, she never eats sugar, never eats bread, and, um, she's always strict about her diet. I get that. I mean, I'm not quite as good. To look amazing, those are the things that you have to sacrifice. That's why I've never been willing to do it. Take all the fun out of your life. Yeah. So we hung out, went out to dinner, and I even got the, you know, the cauliflower appetizer. We had sushi. You were trying to lead into her lifestyle, so less carbs today. Yeah. Yeah, I was all in on it, you know? And then we went over to. We went bowling over at Cosmic Balls, you know, and they got the neon lights and the loud music, you know, we were having, like, a good time. Balls are. That is a good. And that's where you can, like, order some mozzarella sticks for yourself on the side and eat them over, like, the bathroom where she can't see you. Tell him, hey, leave them over on the stall. Too on the stall. But the thing is, the bowling, it ends like at 11:00. And I was like, I thought the date went well. And I was thinking, we just call it a night, okay. But out of nowhere, she was like, hey, like, what are we gonna do now? Oh, I love it. Like she wants to keep going. Yeah. I'm thinking, wait a minute, that's a fastball. Belt buckle. So I just said, fastball, belt buckle. Is she a little bit in the eyes and knock it out of the park, guys. Oh, I thought he said belt. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, belt. That's like the perfect place to hit a ball. It's a sweet spot. Alright, it's a layup. Are you a little bit older than Kelly? No. Well, I think I have a couple years on her, but not that much. Okay, but girls say like, what are we doing now? After a date? Yeah, after we're having a good time. You like dinner and a date? Well, I just said, well, you know, you want to come over? Yeah, yeah, okay. But you know, she needed to get coffee first. So we just went to one of those gas stations and got some coffee and. Oh, gas station coffee. You couldn't wait to Starbucks? That's open 24 hours. She suffered from heartburn the rest of the evening. It's not easy to get a coffee. I guess at 11:30 it is. If you know the Prices, yeah. Yeah, but not all, like, Starbucks or whatever. I mean, maybe that's not even a thing. Like, was it. Was she fine with that? It's not like we're in Miami in the 80s. You just got to figure out a place to get told. You are definitely older than Kelly. I'm not. I read this right

I'm like furious. You know, maybe you should tell your female co host again, whoever she is. Oh my God. She needs to learn a lesson and know her place. Okay. Every other woman does. Yeah, I'll do that for you. I'll do that. I'm gonna. Hey, Brooke, men are talking. Hi, this is Scott. Hey, Scott, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Scott, you there? Uh, I don't know who this is. Oh, you don't? That's what I just said. What? What is this? My my name is Jubal. I'm calling from brick and Jubal in the morning, the radio show. And I'm calling you because you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners and they were hoping that we could get a hold of you. Why is a radio show calling me about a date? Well, we do a segment on our show called The 2nd Date Update. So you recently went out on a date with a girl named Jenna. Yeah. Okay. And so Jenna emailed us because you haven't been answering any of her phone calls and she thought you guys had a great time, but she's wondering if she did something wrong or if there was a specific reason that you're not calling her back. No, there's nothing specific. Just, you know, not digging to going through with things that you know There's no point to so you feel like there's no point in continuing to try to date Jenna? I mean, I just know that it's not gonna work let me ask you this was it because she dressed too conservatively right? Please. I know that's annoying. No, that had nothing to do with it. Okay. Well, she was she was actually concerned that that might be the issue. No, that's that's that's not the reason why well, if that's not the reason why can you kind of give us a little bit of information so that at least I can tell her hey, don't worry about the way that you dress it wasn't that yeah, you can tell her that that's fine but I mean, as far as like a more specific thing it's just kind of like one of those things where it's not gonna work and really to be honest, she's cute and everything but I'm looking for a different breed of girl a different breed. What does that even mean? We're not breed like we don't come like thoroughbred or no, there are some thoroughbreds out there and there are some definite runs believe me. I know I know what you're talking about Scott. Yeah, I mean, there are some breeds of all kinds of humans. Thank you. But what are you looking for then? You know, basically I'm a guy who works a lot pretty successful at what I do and you know is she not Pretty enough? No, she's fine. She's very cute. I'm not saying that the bottom line is that like, I don't know how to say this, but she's too smart. What you said too? Did you just say too smart? Yeah, too smart. Yeah, that's right. She is too smart. I'm not looking for, um, a smart girl. What you want for, um, a smart girl what you want that might be the, that might be the best way to be turned down for a date ever is for somebody to tell you that you're too smart. That's like a compliment, but then also a let down at the same time. Why? What? What do you mean you, you only date dumb girls? Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that. Um, I just want someone who is not as smart and someone who's not as ambitious as Jenna is. Why would you not? I, I, I feel like I look for the opposite and I've never had the opposite. So I've had the other thing and trust me, it's not all that's cracked up to be, but I feel like I want the opposite and and why would you want to be with someone who's not ambitious and not smart? Well, like I said, I'm pretty successful and, um, I need someone who's just gonna focus on me and not their own career or their own motivation. Oh my God. Oh, so cool. So you just want someone to be home And look pretty for you and make you some dinner every once in a while. You know, I'm a good looking guy. I do really well. Basically, I just been looking for some arm candy. And there's nothing wrong with that. Well, there is because you're treating your woman as a trophy no matter who she is. So there's lots of things wrong with that. There is a ton of benefits, okay. She gets to go on a lot of great vacation, a lot of business trip.

Just calling you to see how you're doing today. Trying to recruit new listeners to the show. Is that really what you're doing?

And we got an email from a girl named  Colleen  okay. Yeah. And  Colleen  told us all about your date. She said that you met through a friend of hers. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But I'm telling you right now though, if you wait too long, that ship's gonna sail. Cause she actually did tell us that it's been so long since she's heard that she's just thinking about cutting it and not even trying anymore. Yeah. She doesn't wanna spend her days thinking about some guy that's not thinking about her. Like that's, you have to understand that she doesn't wanna waste your time. Uh, look, I really fucked up and, uh, and I, yeah. Okay. Well, can you tell us what happened? Yeah. All right. Just you're not gonna tell her? No, we'll tell her something else if it's that bad.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said, loud enough for the entire room to hear, I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. Twenty two family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncles who had been in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us. Now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again! Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's When my 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with the sweetest voice imaginable. You're about to become very famous. Derek's angry red face drained to white so fast I thought he might pass out. His hands, which had been clenched into fists, started shaking. What the hell are you talking about? He demanded. I've been recording everything for the last hour, Chloe announced to the entire room. Every nasty comment, every threat, every single slap. And guess what, Uncle Derek? It's already uploaded to three different cloud servers. She turned to face his entire family, who were now staring at her like she'd grown a second head. Did you all know that in this state, witnessing domestic violence and failing to report it when children

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

I thought Doctor Martinez had seen everything, 23 years of experience, wrote the textbook on emotional regulation, had a waiting list longer than a CVS receipt. His office wall was covered in certificates, including one from the Dalai Lama. I was there because I'd gotten into a fist fight with a mall Santa. Not my proudest moment. Anger, Doctor Martinez said during our first session, is like holding a hot coal. You're only burning yourself. He had this perfectly calibrated therapist voice like NPR merged with a yoga instructor. Behind him sat a collection of stress balls shaped like world leaders heads. I noticed Nixon was particularly worn out. Session one was textbook. We explored my triggers, discussed coping strategies. He gave me a worksheet about identifying emotions. I pretended to care. He pretended to believe me. We were both professionals at this dance. Session 3, I mentioned my coworker Brad. Brad replies all to every email, even the automated ones. Brad clips his toenails at his desk. Brad pronounces it expresso and corrects others who say it right. Doctor Martinez's left eye twitched just once. Brad sounds challenging, he said, squeezing Stalin's head. Session 5 changed everything. I was ranting about my gym. They play the same Ed Sheeran song on repeat for three months. The same song. Doctor Martinez set down his notepad. Which song? Thinking out loud, he went pale. My gym plays shape of You four months, I've counted 847 times. By session seven, we'd abandoned all pretenses. He for us both coffee and we just vent. His mother in law moved in and rearranged his entire house while he was at work. My HOA, find me for my grass being 0.5 inches too tall. He got a parking ticket. While contesting a different parking ticket, I found out my ex was dating my dentist. Session 9, he told me about his colleague, Doctor Peterson. He steals my yogurt every day, writes his name on my yogurt, says he's conducting a social experiment on possession and ownership. I have a pee HD from Harvard. I don't need his experiments. I need my strawberry yo plate. Session 11 was when the universe chose violence. I walked in to find him on the phone. White knuckle Churchill ceramic head. What do you mean the insurance doesn't cover therapy for therapists? I am the therapy. He hung up, looked at me. My therapist just fired me. Said I was too negative. M E. I teach positivity seminars. Then his phone buzzed, a text from his teenage daughter. Dad, I'm dropping out to be an influencer. Also, I crashed your car into a subway. The restaurant, not the train. Something in his eyes changed like watching a documentary about damn failures. First a crack, then a trickle, then you know what? He stood up eerily calm. Buddha was wrong. Nisha was wrong. Young Freud, all of them wrong. He picked up his stress ball collection. Some people just need to be punched. Some situations don't have a breathing exercise sometimes. He launched Nixon at his diploma. The only path to inner peace is accepting that everyone else is the problem. He opened his window, started throwing everything out. Books, certificates, the meditation fountain that never worked anyway. Twenty three years of breathe and count to 10. You know what? I've been counting to 10 my whole life. I'm at like 84 million by now. His secretary knocked. Doctor Martinez, your three o'clock is here. Tell them to breathe and count to 10, he screamed, launching Roosevelt out the window. Security.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too. I needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. Man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years ago. My Knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday is our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the AMC theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. He was at the concession stand talking to the teenage manager. Showed her phone again. He Pointed toward the theaters, she went to check each one, opening doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. Maybe. I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my usual time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying my face. Good. Same as always? Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

Instead of waiting for my husband and son to come home to celebrate with me, I received a video from my husband's first girlfriend. In the video, my husband and my son were with her and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. After seeing that, instead of calling him to confront him, I silently packed my suitcase and signed the divorce papers. It was unusual for my husband, Dominic, to come home at midnight and find the house completely dark. No matter what time it was, I always left a light on for him. That night, he handed our son Grayson over to the housekeeper and went straight to the master bedroom. I was sitting on the sofa with a carefully packed suitcase by my side and the I divorce agreement on the coffee table in front of me. Dominic frowned. Paisley, what is this? Another one of your dramatics? I didn't have the strength for his criticism. My voice came out calm and firm. I want a divorce. His face showed disbelief. Why? Because I forgot your birthday. It doesn't matter, I replied, pushing the divorce agreement toward him. Sign it. Let's end this. He flipped through the pages mockingly. You're leaving empty handed. Where will you go without me? A bitter laugh escaped my lips. He was so sure he had me trapped, thinking I had no one in here fell and nothing to hold on to. I push The papers even closer. Sign it. Don't waste time. For a moment he hesitated, then his voice hardened. Fine, divorce it is, but Sonny's custody is not negotiable. You won't get him. Suddenly, Grayson appeared, looking at me with tears streaming down his cheeks. I'm staying with dad. I don't wanna go with you. You're a horrible mother, a witch. That's enough, Grayson. Dominic snapped, but Grayson's rage didn't subside. If you hadn't gotten in the way of dad and Marisa, she'd be my mom now. I cut the tension with that same cold voice. I don't care, Grayson. I don't care about anything. I just want the divorce. That word left Dominic in silence. He clenched his jaw and his eyes darkened with frustration. Are you sure about this? I tossed the pen onto the table. Sign it. Let's end this. Dominic's frustration gave way to a flicker of doubt. Before he could sign, I grabbed my copy, took my suitcase and headed for the door. Tomorrow at 9:00am sharp at City Hall. Don't be late, I said without hesitation. Just as I was about to walk out, Dominic grabbed my wrist tightly. Let go, I said coldly, he sneered. In such a rush to leave, you already have a lover. I looked him straight in the eyes. If you don't want to wait for part 2, you can watch the full story on my YouTube channel.

My husband's on the way home. I lied immediately feeling nervous from his question. The delivery driver held my Chinese food peeking into my house. What does your husband look like? He asked. Sorry, listen, I have a movie to catch. Here's an extra tip. I pushed a 5 dollar Bill at him and reached for my food. What does he look like? He pressed more desperately. His tone making all the hair on the back of my neck stand up straight. I grabbed my food and practically slammed the door in his face before turning the dead bolt. Now, I know weird people deliver food all the time, but I wasn't ready to become a true crime story that people we'll make YouTube videos about. But 20 minutes later, just as I'd forgotten all about him, I walked into the kitchen to get some ice cream and noticed that his car was still parked on the street with the engine running. When his eyes met mine through the window, I closed the blinds in a panic and fell to the floor covering my mouth. My phone buzzed with text from an unknown number. This is your delivery driver. Where is your husband? Are you still by yourself right now? I didn't respond, but my hands were shaking. Another text came through immediately. Please answer. It's important. Through a crack in the blinds, I watched him get out of His car and walk back toward my house. The pounding of my heart filled my ears. I crawled around, turning off all the lights, closing all the blinds on the first floor. Then a third text. I'm outside. Two words that made my spine tingle. I heard his footsteps on my front porch, gently knocking like he didn't want to scare me even more than I already was. Annabelle, he said, voice calm and eerie. Annabelle, I know you're in there. Please come out. I couldn't take it anymore and figured if I threatened him with the cops, he'd leave. I stupidly opened the door just a crack with the chain still on. You need to leave or I'm calling the police. Before I could react, his hand shot through the gap and unhooked the chain. He grabbed my arm and dragged me out of my house. I tried to scream but he was already throwing me into his back seat and slamming the door. I tried to leave but the child lock trapped me inside. I kicked at the window weakly, even screamed. As he calmly got into the driver seat. He reached down and pulled out a baseball bat that he said in the passenger seat, call the cops, he told me what I said. Suddenly thrown so far off, all the panic drained from my body in an instance. Call the cops now. He repeated it while staring straight ahead at my house. His hands were on The steering wheel. And he wasn't even looking at me. I fumbled with my phone and dialed 9, 1 1. There's a delivery driver. And he grabbed me and forced me into his car. I told the dispatcher, but even as I said it, something felt wrong. Why would he want me to call the.

Tobacco Harris Duke Legacy. Father owned a billion dollar company. The wedding was planned before our fifth date, scheduled for the family foundation's 100 anniversary gala. My parents had already commissioned the oil painting of our future children. Two weeks before the wedding, my brother called. We're adopting them. All three kids, Carlos and I are going to be dads. My heart broke. My parents first grandchildren, three of them, and they'd never know. Three kids who desperately needed grandparents never had a stable family. And my parents would rather pretend they didn't exist unless I thought. At our rehearsal dinner with 500 guests, including the governor at our table, I stood up for the toast, pulled out my phone. Before I marry Isabella, everyone should see who's missing. I. I took the photo on the wall, my brother and Carlos at the adoption ceremony. Three kids clinging to them like life rafts. The oldest 10, holding his straight a report card. The middle child in his soccer uniform. It overcame developmental delays and now LED his team. The youngest with her violin headed to state competition. Everyone gasped, shocked, unsure how to feel. My brother isn't dead. He's happy. He's married to a brilliant surgeon and these are your grandchildren. I looked at my parents that you'll never meet because your homophobic hatred matters more than three kids who need a family. My father stood up. Shake those Aren't real grandchildren. But Isabella's hypothetical children are. Children who don't exist are more real than three kids who call him daddy. My mother was crying, you're destroying everything. You destroyed everything when you threw away your son for liking the wrong gender, she yelled. The bloodline ends with him disgusted. The bloodline. Carlos saves babies for a living. My brother runs a free clinic. Those three kids were thrown away by their bloodlines. But sure, let's talk about legacy. The governor was already leaving. Isabella's family followed. The wedding was off before the appetizers arrived. Parents screamed about the shame, the ruined foundation gala, the million dollar wedding they couldn't get refunded. Good. I said, now you know how those three kids felt when their biological families threw them away. Except my brother chose them. You're throwing away grandchildren who already exist. Kicked me out that night. Drained my accounts, too. But I'd already taken out loans already matched at a residency program. I already knew where I was going. My brother opened his door at midnight. We just held each other and cried. That was five years ago. I'm Uncle Rob now. Help with homework, teach the oldest premed concepts since he tests at college level. Watch the middle one score soccer goals at front row at violin recitals. Those three kids my parents said weren't real. They're honor students, athletes, musicians. They're loved. My parents still tell people they have no children. Spent 3 million on fertility treatments. For my cousin rather than acknowledge three grandchildren exist.

I was 15 when I got pregnant, except it wasn't on purpose. You see, like every other 15 year old girl, my boyfriend was toxic. Like scream at you for interacting with a male teacher, then go through your phone. Toxic. So when he caught me going to the hospital to visit my godfather without telling him, he was determined to punish me. He told me the only way he'd let me get away with it was if I let him pop my cherry with no rubber. He said that would prove that I loved him and I would have said no, but the anger in his eyes made me too scared of what would happen if I dared to refuse. So I said yes. Long story short, I got pregnant and never saw him again. I wish that was an exaggeration, but he blocked me on everything and transferred to a school across the country. I was so freaked out that I told my parents as soon as I found out, we'll help you take care of it was the first thing my mom said. Meanwhile, my dad just nodded quietly. I don't know why I believe them, but I did. And their words were the only reason I didn't get a baby unalive because no one else wanted to come near me anymore. The entire school was calling me a w word and they had spread rumors about me. Trying to baby trap my ex boy friend. So I dropped out. All I had was my parents and everything they gave me until I gave birth. Because instead of coming home to baby Anna's nursery, I came home to all of my stuff packed up into bags. I swear I thought they were pranking me. But then my mom said we're not cleaning up the mess you made. I looked over to my dad who stood there with his arms crossed. But I thought you said we just said that so you wouldn't terminate the pregnancy, but now we're done with you. Consider yourself disowned. I fell to the floor crying while baby Anna whipped in my arms. I had nowhere to go and instead of helping me drive somewhere, they retreated to their bedrooms and locked the door. I was shattered. That was my rock bottom. I ended up getting an Uber to my Aunt Becky's house and she took me in. As soon as she showed me the bedroom, I crawled right in and fell asleep. I was still in the post pregnancy state and life felt like it was doomed. I woke up the next morning at 4:00am to Becky shaking me awake. If you're staying here, then you have to follow the rules was all she said before handing me a sweeping brush. You have to do your fair share of everything. Two hours of house chores minimum. You have to cook me five dinners. A week. Showers are five minutes long max. And most importantly, if your baby wakes me up more than once in a week, I will kick you out. Well, it was either Aunt Becky's house or the streets. So I just nodded, ready to accept my new life of modern day slavery. The next few years of my life were as bad as you'd expect. Every time Anna cried at night, adrenaline would pump through my blood. Sometimes I even had to sit with her in the front garden during winter. And Aunt Becky abused me in every way possible, so much so that it reminded me of my ex boyfriend. And I only had one lifeline, a job at a 24 hour diner where the manager, Rosa, let me bring Anna during night shifts. He'd sleep in the break room while I served coffee to truckers and studied for my GED between orders. The day Anna turned 4, I finally had enough, saved $1,200 and a promise of a studio apartment from Rosa's cousin. I packed our things while Becky was at work, not that there was much to pack. Anna's drawings, the teddy bear Rosa gave her, my GED certificate. That studio apartment was 400 square feet of heaven. Our first night, Anna and I ate McDonald's on the floor and she said, Mama, can we be loud here? When I nodded, she squealed at the top of her lungs, then looked at me with wonder when no One yelled at us. That's when they showed up. I was at a pickup helping Anna carry her solar system project to the car when I saw them, my parents standing next to a Mercedes looking like they'd stepped out of a catalog. My dad wore a suit that probably cost more than I made in three months. Suddenly, my mother was walking toward us. Hello, sweetheart, she said. But she wasn't looking at me. She was looking at Anna with tears in her eyes. You must be Anna, I shoved.

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago, and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kaio, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level, and for some reason Trish hated this the most. First time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konnichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles, unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told me to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve, but I was so secure in Kaido and I's relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She'd corner him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google Translate. Whenever we were talking, she'd always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido, and other times facing him directly and giving him the effing eyes. The Thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then. But we were in the middle of a very busy service. And I told myself I'd do it right after. Big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese businessmen came in for food. They were at my section. But Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying hi, hi! While scribbling nonsense. Forty five minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish did it. While Kaido ran to get the Epipen, she pointed at me and told her cousin, who is the manager, that I changed the order to sabotage her. And without verifying anything, her cousin wrote me up on the spot in front of everyone. One more incident and you're terminated. I went home crushed and just cried to Kaido. I was wondering

My best friend Jess was getting married and asked me to be her photographer. I've been doing photography for like three years now, mostly just for fun and some side cash, but nothing super professional. She said she trusted me more than some random person and honestly couldn't afford a real wedding photographer anyway. The wedding was beautiful. I spent the entire day running around getting shots of everything. Her getting ready, walking down the aisle, the first kiss, all the family photos. I was exhausted but felt good about it. I probably took like 800 photos that day. After the reception, just pulled me aside and said she couldn't wait to see them. He was literally glowing with excitement. I told her I'd edit them and have them ready in a week. That's when things got weird. Two days later, just texted me asking if I could rush the photos because her and her husband Jake wanted to post them on social media. I said sure, no problem. But then she started texting me every single day asking for updates. Like multiple times a day. Then she called me crying saying her mom was asking about the photos and could I please just send her like five unedited ones. I sent her a few thinking that would calm her down. Wrong. The next day she showed up at my apartment unannounced. She had Jake with her and they both looked Stressed? She said they needed to talk about the photos. Apparently, just's mom had been showing the unedited photos I sent to family members, and now everyone was asking why the photographer didn't know how to use proper lighting. Just said she was embarrassed and needed me to fix them immediately. I explained that editing takes time and I was working on them, but she cut me off and said she'd found another photographer who could fix my mistakes for $500. He wanted me to send her all the raw files so this other person could edit them instead. I was honestly hurt. These weren't even bad photos. The lighting was a little dim in a few shots because the venue was dark, but nothing that couldn't be fixed in editing. That's literally what editing is for. But here's where it gets really messed up. When I hesitated about sending the raw files, Jake stepped in and said they weren't paying me anything anyway, so I should just hand them over. He said they'd already been more than generous, letting me practice on their wedding. Practice? I had busted my ass for 12 hours straight on their wedding day. I barely ate, missed most of the reception, and my feet were killing me from running around in heels all day. That's when Jess said something that made my blood boil. She looked me dead in the eye and said, if I was a

So my boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. I'm starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't want to seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said. I took a deep breath. So, um, I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team. I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. I brought donuts every Friday. And covered for people when they were sick. What do you mean core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at 5 sharp, and I sat there alone, pretending to work while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie, who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram Story, like right now. I open Instagram and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see.

We got married for a green card. I know how that sounds, but hear me out. Elena needed to stay in the country to finish med school. I was broke and desperate to split rent in San Francisco where even studio apartments cost more than my monthly salary. My roommate Ben, suggested his girlfriend's friend who was facing deportation. She clean, quiet and desperate, he said. Perfect match for your situation. We met at a Mission District Starbucks on a Tuesday. She was already there when I arrived, punched over thick medical textbooks, highlighter marks all over her hands, dark circles under her eyes, told me she'd been pulling all nighters. When I sat down, she looked up and said, you must be the guy who needs a wife. Straight to business. I liked that. We talked for exactly 47 minutes. She needed legal status to avoid losing her medical school spot three months before graduation. I needed someone to help cover my 15 dollar rent. We both needed to convince immigration we were legit. She had no criminal record. I had good credit. Perfect strangers entering a contract. The wedding was just us and two witnesses at city hall on a Thursday morning. I wore my only good shirt. She wore a white dress from target that still had the tags on it. We exchanged rings from a convenience store, took an Awkward selfie for immigration files and shook hands afterward like we just closed a business deal. Our apartment became a study in polite coexistence. Claimed the living room as her study space. Medical textbooks creating fortress walls around her. I worked double shifts at a tech startup, coming home exhausted while she was already deep in flashcards. We'd pass each other in our tiny kitchen, maybe say good morning, share the coffee maker and careful shifts. For six months, we were like the world's most courteous strangers. She studied 18 hours a day, surviving on instant ramen and determination. I worked 70 hour weeks trying to prove myself at a company that treated junior developers like this, posible coffee filters. We developed a rhythm of avoidance that somehow worked. I'd leave her dinner leftovers in the fridge. She'd buy my preferred coffee creamer without being asked. Then my dad had a massive heart attack. I got the call at 2:00am from my sister crying so hard I could barely understand her. Dad's in the ICU. You need to come home now. I just collapsed in our hallway, phone still in my hand, making sounds I didn't recognize as my own voice. Elena found me there 20 minutes later, coming back from a late library session. She didn't ask questions, didn't say anything about how pathetic I looked. She just sat next to me on the floor and held my hand while I fell apart. Her thumb traced small circles on My knuckles while I tried to explain through broken sentences that my dad might die and I couldn't afford the plane ticket home to Chicago. She drove me to the airport in her beat up Honda at 4:00am, waited with me until my flight boarded and pressed $200 cash into my hand. For whatever you need, she said quietly. When I came back a week later, drained and grieving but grateful my dad had survived, she'd meal prepped containers filling our entire fridge. Little notes stuck to each one. Heat for three minutes, add hot sauce, your favourite chicken teriyaki. She'd also somehow paid our full rent while I was gone. Something shifted after that. She started asking about my day when I got home. I began making enough dinner for two without discussing it, she'd fall.

My co worker stole my lunch straight out of the fridge and then accused me of attempted murder when their throat started closing up. Careful with that pad tie, my friend said as I walked past her desk Tuesday morning. The food thief's been especially bold lately. I just laughed it off because I've been working here for a year and my lunch had never been touched. And besides, my name was written in black sharpie across the lid of my distinctive purple container. Who would be stupid enough to steal something so clearly labeled? But things had apparently gotten so bad that my coworker started writing contains laxatives on her perfectly normal sandwiches, and I've been stupidly confident that my luck would continue. I was deep in my work when I heard what sounded like someone knocking over chairs in the break room. Then Derek, our newly promoted director, came stumbling out with his face already going puffy and red. His hands were at his throat, and he was making these horrible wheezing sounds. Epipen! He gasped, fumbling at his pockets. Can't breathe. Someone called 9 1 1 while another co worker helped him with the Epipen. In the chaos, I ran to see what happened and found my purple container open on the counter. My pad Thai was half eaten, and my name in black marker stared up at me like an accusation. The peanut sauce was still Visible on the fork. My boss called me into his office the next day. I have to ask, I said, looking uncomfortable, did you know Derek had a peanut allergy? I told him I had no idea. Derek and I barely interact, and it's not like he wore a medical alert bracelet or ever mentioned it. I pulled out that day's lunch, which was also pad Thai, because I made a huge batch and ate several bites in front of him. This is literally what I eat three times a week, I said. He nodded, seeming satisfied. Derek shouldn't have taken your food. This is on him. I thought that was the end of it. Then a week later, HR called me in for a formal investigation. Derek sat there with the HR director, arms crossed, explaining how I'd obviously targeted him. She's been jealous ever since my promotion, he said, giving me this condescending look. He claimed he only borrowed food when he had back to back meetings, like it was some noble sacrifice. She left it right in front like they. The HR director, a woman I'd never seen smile, was bizarrely aggressive. When my boss tried to defend me by saying the container was clearly labeled, she wouldn't even look at him. We can't prove Derek stole anything, she said. For all we know, you offered it to him. This looks like a calculated attack on someone in a vulnerable position. Then she actually suggested Derek should Sue me for reckless endangerment and emotional distress from nearly dying. My boss kept trying to interject, but she steamrolled over him every time. This could be considered assault, she said, leaning forward. You brought a deadly weapon into the workplace. It's pad Thai, I said. It's food. My food with my name on it. Two days later, I was called into HR and fired on the spot. She seized her opportunity perfectly. With the owner gone on business for the past month, she knew no one could stop her. She cited workplace endangerment and malicious intent, then had security escort me through the office with my belongings in a cardboard box, making sure everyone saw me leave like some kind of criminal. The humiliation lasted about as long as my drive home, but

What she accidentally overheard during the appointment made me uninvite my entire bridal party. I was dead asleep, and my phone rang at midnight. The caller ID showed a number I didn't recognize, but something made me answer. Is this Rachel? A woman's voice thick with tears. Yes. Who is this? My name is Carla. I'm a spray tan artist at Bronzo. I just. I need to tell you something about your wedding, about your bridesmaids. I sat up suddenly wide awake. My wedding was in five days. My entire bridal party had appointments at Bronzo tomorrow for matching spray tans. Your maid of honor, Jessica, came in tonight for an early appointment. Carla, I continued, she was on speaker phone the whole time. I heard everything. I couldn't sleep without telling you. What did you hear? Carla took a shaky breath. They're planning to ruin your wedding. All of them. They have a whole plan. My stomach dropped. That's impossible. These are my best friend. I recorded it. Carla said. I know I shouldn't have, but it was so horrible. I'll send you the audio. The recording came through immediately. I recognized Jessica's voice right away. Talking to someone on speaker while Carla worked. Operation Ugly Bride is a go. Jessica laughed. Everyone knows their role. My bridesmaid Ashley's voice responded. I got the dress. My seamstress friend is taking it in four sizes tonight. Rachel won't Know, until she tries to zip it tomorrow. Another voice. My cousin Megan. I booked the wrong makeup artist, the one who did that Halloween zombie wedding. Told her Rachel wants dramatic look. Perfect, Jessica said. And I confirmed with the DJ. He's going to play nothing but Rachel's ex's favorite songs, including their song for the Father Daughter Dance. I listened in horror as they detailed their plan. The flowers have been changed to the ones I was allergic to. The photographer was instructed to only take unflattering angles. They'd even coordinated their bridesmaid dress malfunctions to happen during the ceremony. Why? Ashley asked in the recording. I mean, I'm in, but remind me why we're destroying her wedding. Jessica's voice turned cold. Because she doesn't deserve Chris. She. I think she's so perfect with her perfect job and perfect life. Someone needs to bring her down. Plus, Chris had feelings for me first. He only asked her out because I was dating Brad. Girl, that was five years ago, Megan pointed out. Doesn't matter. I introduced them. He was supposed to be mine. This wedding is a joke. The recording continued with more details. They've been planning this for months, ever since I asked Jessica to be my maid of honor. Every supportive text, every planning session, every happy moment had been fake. The best part, Jessica giggled, is the speech I'm giving. I'm going to tell everyone about her anxiety attacks. That time she wet herself at Camp in seventh grade. How Chris almost broke up with her last year because she's so clingy. She'll die of embarrassment. Ashley agreed. Maybe she'll run out of her own wedding. That's the goal. Chris will see what a mess she is and realize he made a mistake. Carla came back on the line. I'm so sorry. Had to tell you. No one deserves that. I hung up and immediately called Chris. He answered groggily until I played in the recording. I heard him get out of bed. He's jingling. I'm coming over, he said. This is insane. We spent the night contacting vendors. The florist confirmed the flower change. The DJ admitted to the playlist swap. The makeup artist thought the zombie request was weird but assumed it was a themed wedding. The seamstress had already taken in my dress when we picked it up at 3:00am. After threatening legal action. It was unwearable, four sizes smaller, with the seams reinforced so they couldn't be let out. By 6:00am, we had a new plan. I called each bridesmaid individually, starting with Jessica. Hey, can't wait for today's tanning session? She chirped. Actually, there's been a change. The wedding is off. Silence. Then what? Why? Chris and I decided to elope. Too much stress. We're flying to Vegas this afternoon. Jessica tried to sound supportive, but I heard the disappointment. Oh, but all the planning. Yeah. You can cancel your spray tan appointment. Sorry for the inconvenience. I made similar Calls to the others. Each one

My girlfriend came home at 2:00am with her underwear and dress torn open screaming for me to help her. She collapsed into my arms and I could feel her whole body trembling. She kept throwing up and shaking all over our carpet. I helped her to the couch and got her a glass of water while trying to stay calm myself because I was sure my worst fear just happened. Luna is without a doubt the strongest person I know. She worked as a prosecutor and dealt with assailers, PDF files and slaughterers every day without flinching. But now she looked broken and small, literally rocking on our couch, kept apologizing for ruining my night, which made no sense. And I assured her she did nothing wrong. At the club, some guy had cornered her outside the bathroom when she was alone. According to her, he towered over her, was super muscular and his breath reek of whiskey. He pushed her against the wall and put his hands where they didn't belong while she screamed for help. The music was too loud and her friends were too far away. She tried to fight back but he already had his way with her. The worst part was what happened next. Luna found security and told them exactly what occurred. She pointed out the guy who was laughing with his friends near the VIP section. The bouncer just shrugged and said, what do You want me to do without any witnesses, lady? he leaned in close and told her that the guy was the owner's nephew, so maybe she should just go home and sleep it off and that it probably wasn't that bad. I felt rage building in my chest as Juna explained how the manager said the same thing, how her friends wanted to call the police, but the staff threatened to ban them, all of them, from every club in a 5 mile radius for causing trouble. Literally. Other women at the club whispered that the same guy had done this before, but nothing ever happened. Police protected him because his uncle owned three clubs in the city. Juno was a prosecutor who put criminals away for a living, but even she knew this would go nowhere. Rich guys with connections didn't face consequences for raping women in dark clubs. There would be no cameras in that hallway and no witnesses willing to testify. The system she worked for every day had failed her completely. I held her while she cried and felt more helpless than ever before in my life. I didn't know people who could handle this kind of thing. There was nothing I could do that would touch that man. But then I remembered that my father would know what to do. My dad had spent 30 years working construction in the roughest parts of the city. He knew people from a different world than mine. People who handled problems outside the law when the law wouldn't help. I spent my whole life trying to distance myself from that part of his past, but now I needed it. The next morning while Juno was sleeping, I drove to my parents house. My dad was drinking coffee in the garage like always, surrounded by his tools and old boxing trophies. I told him everything and watched his face go from confused to furious. He sat down his mug so hard it spilled everywhere. You know the guy's name? He asked in a voice I'd never heard before. I showed him the club's Instagram where the nephew was tagged in VIP photos flashing expensive watches and bottles. My dad studied the pictures like he was memorizing every detail of the guy's face. My father made some calls right there in the garage. I could only hear his side of the conversations, but they were short and serious. He used names I didn't recognize and mentioned favours that were owed. When he hung up, he told me to go home and take care of Junah. He said he would handle everything else. Three days later, the local news reported that the club owner's nephew had been found in an alley behind one of his uncle's properties. Both his hands were broken in multiple places. His ribs were all broken, his eyes were swollen and he had a 1,000 dollar bottle of tequila shoved up his bum, the report said. No witnesses came forward and no cameras covered that particular alley, so they couldn't prosecute anyone. The interesting part was what they found in his apartment during.

My billionaire uncle taught me his trick when I turned 25 and inherited his pharmaceutical company. He said, never let them see the real you first. Make them fall for broke you. So I created a fake dating profile as Mike the struggling musician, posted photos in my crappiest clothes, mentioned my time, any studio apartment, and ramen diet. I even got a part time job at Guitar Center to sell the story. I matched with Emma, who seemed perfect. She was studying to be a veterinarian, drove her mom's old Corolla, and always suggested cheap date spots like food trucks and free concerts in the park. She'd split, put every Bill down to the penny, insisting she knew how tight money was for musicians. After three months, I was falling hard. She'd bring me homemade lunches to Guitar Center, saying she made extra and didn't want it to go to waste. Never asked about my music career or pushed me to make it big. She just seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with Broke Mike. Then she started acting strange. She'd disappear for hours with vague excuses about studying at the library. She'd make secretive phone calls and step outside when I was around. Once I saw expensive designer shopping bags in her backseat that she quickly covered with a blanket when she noticed me looking. I was getting paranoid. Was she cheating? Was I just her bro boyfriend while she Had some rich guy on the side. I hired a private investigator thinking she was seeing someone else. The report came back with photos that made my jaw drop. Emma entering a massive mansion with a circular driveway. Emma stepping out of a brand new Tesla Model S. Emma in an evening gown, shaking hands with the mayor at some charity gala. I was curious. Here I was, pretending to be poor to avoid gold diggers, while she was living this secret rich life and playing me for a fool. I confronted her at what I thought was her small apartment near campus. Turns out it was just the guest house on her family's estate. Emma? Who the hell are you, really? She looked terrified and broke down crying. My dad owns the largest chain of veterinary hospitals in the state. My family's worth over $200 million. But every guy I've dated since high school only wanted me to fund their business ideas, introduce them to my rich friends. She wiped her eyes, mascara running. I've been living in the guest house and driving Mom's old car because I wanted to meet someone who'd like me when they thought I had nothing. You're the first person who never asked me for money or tried to impress me with expensive plans you couldn't afford. She looked at my shocked face. Please don't hate me, Mike. I know I lied, but I was just so tired of guys seeing dollar signs instead of Me? That's when I started laughing hysterically. Emma, I need to tell you something about my pharmaceutical company. Her confused expression was priceless. Remember how I said I inherited some money from my uncle? Well, he didn't just leave me money. He left me the entire company. I'm worth about $800 million. We just stared at each other in this ridiculous guest house. Two rich people who'd been pretending to be broke because we were both terrified of being used. She started laughing, too. So you're telling me I've been buying you lunch because I thought you were struggling, while you've been letting me pay because you thought I was a poor vet student. Pretty

My wife was 8 months pregnant when her body started rejecting both the baby and her. We were at a routine checkup when Doctor Sins went quiet during the ultrasound. He called for a second doctor, then a third. Their hushed conversations in the corner made my stomach drop. Severe preeclampsia. He finally said, we need to deliver today. But there was a complication. The baby's cord was wrapped around his neck three times. Any attempt to deliver naturally would likely put his life in serious danger. But a C section with my wife's blood pressure that high could have put her life at serious risk. The doctors explained our options in clinical terms that felt surreal. Emergency delivery with baby survival rates at 30% or wait for her condition to stabilize with baby survival dropping to near zero. How long do we have to decide? I asked. You don't, Doctor Sin said. I need an answer now. My wife grabbed my hand. Her grip was weak, but her voice was clear. Save him. I looked at the woman I'd loved for eight years, the person who made me coffee every morning, who still left me stupid love notes in my lunch, who was asking me to let her die for someone we've never even met. No, I said. The room went silent. My wife's eyes filled with tears. Save her, I told the doctors. Whatever it takes. They rushed her into Surgery for an emergency C section anyway, the safest compromise they could try. I sat in the waiting room for two hours, fearing that my decision might have cost our son his life to save my wife. When Doctor Sins finally came out, his scrubs showed the toll of the operation. Your wife is.

My friend Katie always had something to say about my face. Every time we hung out, she'd make these little comments like you'd look so much better with just some mascara or I have lipstick that would really help you out. I kept brushing it off because we've been friends since middle school and I figured she meant well. But then came her engagement party last month. I showed up in a nice dress, hair done, feeling good about myself. Katie took one look at me and said, oh, honey, you really should have told me you weren't doing makeup. I would have brought my kit. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear, including her fiance's family, who I was meeting for the first time. I felt my face turn red. Her mom even chimed in saying, Katie's right, dear, a little colour would really brighten you up. I spent the whole night feeling like everyone was staring at my bare face. Katie kept introducing me as her natural friend with this fake sweet smile. That night I texted my sister about it. She was furious and said Katie was being a total jerk. Then she offered to do my makeup for the wedding since she works at Sephora. I told her no at first because I didn't want to be petty. But she convinced me that looking good wasn't About Katie, it was about me feeling confident. Two weeks before the wedding, my sister and I went shopping. We got everything, foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, palettes, the works. She taught me how to do a full glam look that made my eyes pop and my skin look flawless. We practiced three times until I could do it myself. Morning of Katie's wedding, I woke up at 6:00am to start getting ready. I did my makeup exactly like my sister taught me, then put on this stunning blue dress I've been saving for a special occasion. When I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized myself. I looked amazing. I got to the church early and found my seat.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank.

That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

As a kid? When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule, no video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant, the closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on, no sound effects, no music, no voice acting, just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of elf gaming. I wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds and just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head and left the game running. He opened my door and I held my breath pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I can see the Light from my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble, he walked over to my tea. I was dead. Caught red handed, game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this. My mom's footsteps came up the stairs. I was.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. The rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped. I'm in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. Quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. Figured if I could reach them, I might find help or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule. No video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework, and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room, so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant. The closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on. No sound effects, no music, no voice acting. Just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of elf gaming. I'd wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life. Until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds. Just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long, so I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and left the game running. He opened my door, and I held my breath, pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I can see the light. From my TV screen. Still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble. He walked over to my. I was dead. Caught red handed. Game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

I'm not controlling you. I'm married to you. That's exactly what a controlling person would say. I wasn't talking to Emily anymore. I was talking to Sarah, Lisa, and Michelle through Emily's mouth. Emily wanted to explore while staying married. She wanted to see other people while keeping me as backup. That's when she delivered the line that ended everything. All my friends think you're controlling for not wanting to share me. Maybe they're right. Share me like she was a toy, a resource to be distributed. Share you, I repeated. Emily, we're married. We don't share each other. That's such an outdated way of thinking. Then explore. But not as my wife. I walked to our bedroom and started packing her suitcase. Jake, stop. What are you doing? I'm helping you explore. Your friends think I'm controlling. They can have their friend back. I was just talking. I didn't mean it. You want to date other people. I want to be married. We want different things. Emily started crying. I just wanted to talk about it. We did talk. You said your friends think I'm controlling for not wanting to share you. But I love you. You love me enough to cheat on me? That's not love, Emily. I finished packing and set the bag by the door. You need to decide if you want to be married, be married. If you want to be single, be single. But you can't be both. She grabbed her keys. I'm Going to Sarah's. Good. She's the one who wanted this. Emily slammed the door. I sat in the sudden quiet, feeling hollowed out, but oddly peaceful. I didn't hear from Emily for three days. On Monday, I called the divorce attorney. Two weeks later, Emily cornered me at the grocery store. I was confused. She. I said my friends gave me bad advice. The same friends who said I was controlling. Where are they now? Emily's shoulders sagged. Sarah's dating some guy from a bar. Lisa got back with her ex. Michelle said I was bringing down the group's energy. So they got what they wanted. You're single and they moved on. I don't wanna be single. I'm not married to you anymore, Emily. The divorce was finalized six months later.

We keep everything separate. I nodded. Great idea. Then I shared. I'd already removed my name from our recent home deposit. Her parents shocked when they Learned their daughter forfeited 50 K.

She put in $34,000, $30,000 from her parents, plus $4,000 saved. Ownership would be sixty forty, reflecting our contributions. I'd already sent my $50,000 to escrow two weeks ago. Claire said she was sorting out her parents transfer. We had time before the deadline. Then came dinner at her parents house. Her mom had prepared an elaborate feast. Clearly something was brewing. Midway through the meal, Claire tapped her glass. I've been reflecting on our future and I've made a decision. I think we need a prenup. Everything stays separate. What's mine is mine. What's yours is yours. Her father immediately chimed in. Wise move, Claire. Safeguarding assets is smart. Claire flashed that smug smile she uses when she thinks she's outsmarted someone. We keep our money separate, file taxes apart, and if something happens, we each walk away with what we brought. She explained confidently. Even the house? I asked. No, the house would be shared. We're both on the deed. But once we're married, it's joint property, equal split. The audacity was breathtaking. She wanted complete financial separation. When It suited her.

Getting me to cover most of the house while protect taking her family's money. A mutual friend mentioned she'd called me a bank with a proposal, so I consulted my lawyer about the purchase agreement. He confirmed I could withdraw without penalty as long as Claire Hadn't deposited her portion yet when she announced the prenup ambush. I knew she'd been deliberately delaying her deposit to spring this trap after I was financially committed. You've got 72 hours to deposit your share or you lose the house and the five thousand dollar earnest money.

Almost, she would say, before smiling sweetly. Then she touched Mom's face. You're so brave wearing makeup at your age. Most women would just give up. Mom's eyes got watery, which meant she was really touched. Aunt Penn even complimented my dad, saying, yours such a saint for sticking around with her. Most men would have found someone younger by now. Mom's hands were shaking when she cut the cake, probably from happiness. On the drive home, mom was really quiet, and when dad asked if she was okay, she said something about passive aggressiveness, which I didn't understand, but I figured it must be another way adults say I love you. I decided that if Aunt Penn loved mom so much that she gave her all those special compliments, I should do the same thing for Aunt Penn, because I love her, too. The next Sunday at church, I saw my chance. When Aunt Penn walked up wearing a pretty, flowery dress, I remembered exactly how she talked to mom and said to her, wow, Aunt Penn, you look pregnant in that dress. When's the baby coming? Her face went completely white, then red, then kind of purple, and she just stood there with her Mouth open like a goldfish. Mom, who was talking to Missus Abernathy, turned around so fast she almost spilled her coffee. And then she started coughing really hard, but it sounded more like laughing for some reason. Aunt Penn finally said, thank you, sweetie, in this tiny voice, and mom had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom because she was coughing laughing so much. Dad asked me what I said, and when I told him I was just being nice like Aunt Penn, he got this funny look.

My therapist told me to write letters to an imaginary boyfriend. I know it sounds crazy, but after my last breakup left me feeling completely broken, she said it would help me figure out what I actually wanted in a relationship. So I made up this guy named Ryan. Perfect guy on paper. Thoughtful, funny. Remembered my coffee order, never interrupted me when I talked about work drama. I was supposed to do this exercise for a month. Seven months later, I was still writing to Ryan. Every single night before bed, I tell him about my day, write about fights we'd have and how we'd work through them without screaming at each other. I even wrote about him meeting my parents at Christmas, how he'd bring my mom flowers and actually listen when my dad talked about golf for three hours straight. The problem started when I printed one of the letters at work by mistake. My coworker Ben found it in the printer tray. Tuesday morning, he walked over to my desk holding this piece of paper, grinning like he'd discovered buried treasure. So who's the mystery boyfriend? He asked, waving the letter around. Ryan. Sounds like a catch. When do we get to meet him? I should have laughed it off, made up some story about a guy I was seeing, and instead I panicked. I grabbed the letter so fast, I knocked Over my coffee, all over my keyboard. Ben just stood there looking confused while I frantically tried to clean up the mess, mumbling something about how it was nobody important. That night, I sat in my apartment staring at the stack of letters I'd written. 43 letters to a guy who didn't exist. I realized I'd been comparing every real guy I met to Ryan, and obviously none of them could compete with someone I'd literally designed to be perfect. Then something weird started happening. I began noticing things about Ben that reminded me of stuff I'd written about Ryan. Like how he always brought me soup when I called in sick, never questioned it or made it weird how he actually listened when I talked instead of just waiting for his turn to speak. He even started putting that ridiculous Sriracha sauce on everything. After I mentioned in one letter how Ryan loved spicy food, it hit me. One Friday when we were walking to the parking garage after work, Ben stopped at the little flower stand outside our building and bought daisies for his neighbor because her cat had just died. That's exactly something I'd written about Ryan doing. Standing there watching him count out quarters for this tiny old lady, I realized I might have been writing about Ben this whole time without even knowing it. So I told him everything. Right there in the parking garage, between a Honda Civic and someone's motorcycle. I explained about The therapy exercise about Ryan. About how I'd been writing love letters to an imaginary person for seven months, like some kind of crazy person. I told him how he'd somehow become everything I've been pretending Ryan was, and listen to the whole thing without interrupting once. When I finished, he was quiet for so long, I thought he was going to call security or something. Then he smiled and said, well, that explains why you always knew exactly what kind of coffee I liked. Turns out he'd been trying to ask me out for months, but thought I had a boyfriend because I kept mentioning Ryan. We've been together for three weeks now, and I finally threw away all those letters. Ryan was great, but Ben's real.

Back in 2,018, I got custody of my sister Emma's three kids after she left them alone for two weeks to go on what she called a vacation. The nine year old Caleb was basically raising his two little sisters, changing diapers and trying to feed them cereal for dinner. When the neighbors called the cops after hearing the baby crying for hours. Found Emma's drug stash under the couch and arrest warrants piling up on her kitchen counter. The kids were a mess when they came to live with me. Caleb had this haunted look, like he'd seen way too much for a seven year old. At the time, the middle one, Sophie, was four and kept asking when mommy was coming back. The baby, Grace, was only 3 months old and had diaper rash so bad it made me want to cry. The first few months were brutal. Caleb would wake up screaming from nightmares, and Sophie would hide food under her bed because she was scared there wouldn't be any tomorrow. I had to move them to a new school district, find new daycare, basically rebuild their entire world from scratch. My apartment wasn't ready for three kids, so I slept on the couch for months while they figured out sleeping arrangements. Caleb refused to sleep alone for the first year, so he'd camp out on the floor next to my couch with his blanket every single night. Emma Went to prison for child endangerment and drug possession. The whole family was furious with me for betraying her. But what was I supposed to do? Let those kids suffer? During her trial, she sat there crying about how I ruined her life, never once asking how the kids were doing. For six years, I've been mom, dad, homework helper, bedtime story reader, everything. Caleb Learned to ride a bike in my driveway. Sophie had her first day of kindergarten holding my hand. He took her first steps in my living room. These kids don't remember Emma as their mom anymore, because, honestly, she never really was one. Last month, Emma got out of prison early for good behavior. Her first call wasn't to apologize or ask how the kids were doing. She called demanding I bring them to see her immediately because she was ready to be a mother now. She actually said I could give them back like they were borrowed lawn equipment or something. I sat down with Caleb, who's 15 now, and asked what he wanted. He looked me dead in the eyes and said he never wanted to see her again. He remembered everything. The hunger, the fear. Having to take care of his sisters when Emma would disappear for days. Sophie, who's 10 now, barely remembers Emma at all. She calls me mom and has for years. Grace doesn't know Emma exists, and honestly, I've never brought her up. But my family won't let It go. My parents keep calling, saying I'm being cruel, that Emma deserves a second chance, that blood is thicker than water. My aunt even showed up at my house last week yelling about how I'm poisoning the kids against their real mother. She said it was my fault the little ones don't remember Emma because I never took them to visit her in prison. The thing is, I did try to maintain some connection at first. I sent Emma pictures and updates when she was locked up. She never responded. Not once. Never asked about birthdays, school plays, nothing. When Caleb broke his arm falling off his skateboard, I called the prison to let her know. She couldn't be bothered to call back. The kids are thriving now. Caleb made honor roll last semester and plays varsity soccer.

My parents got divorced when I was 10 because my mom had an affair with this married guy named Greg. I know because his wife showed up at our house screaming about it. She kept coming back, too, like three more times over the next couple years. The cops had to remove her twice. My mom always blamed my dad for me finding out. But like, I wasn't deaf. Greg never had kids of his own. So after he married my mom, he tried to be this father figure to me. Every time he attempted to parent me or give me advice, I'd shut him down hard. I tell him I already have a dad and he doesn't get to replace him just because he helped wreck my family. My mom would get mad, but I didn't care. When my dad died when I was 19, I made the decision not to tell my mom. She found out after the funeral was over. I didn't want her there and I definitely didn't want Greg showing up trying to comfort me about losing the man whose marriage he destroyed. My mom was pissed about missing the funeral. She said I owed it to her to let them be there for me. I told her their support wasn't wanted, especially not for losing dad. But after dad died, both my mom and Greg expected everything to Change. They thought now that dad was gone, Greg would automatically become my father figure. Fast forward to when I got engaged last year. I asked my grandpa to walk me down the aisle. When my mom found out, she completely lost it. She called me up screaming about what the hell I was thinking. She said Greg had been there raising me since I was 10 and he deserved father of the bride honors, not some random guy. That's when I snapped. I told her she was partly right. He wasn't some random guy. He's just the guy she cheated on my dad with, nothing more, nothing less. My mom went ballistic. She said I was being childish and vindictive and that I needed to get over it and appreciate how hard Greg tried with me. She said it was like I was trying to punish them for the affair when it had nothing to do with me. I laughed at that. I told her this wasn't punishment. These were consequences and she had to live with them same way Greg does. The wedding happened three months ago and my grandpa walked me down the aisle. My mom showed up, but she barely spoke to me. Greg sat in the back looking uncomfortable the whole time. During the reception, my mom tried one more time to get me to acknowledge Greg as a father figure. She brought him over to the head table and said he wanted to give A father speech. I looked at both of them and said loud enough for nearby tables to hear that the only father I had was dead and Greg was welcome to give a speech as a guest, but not as anything more than that. The entire table went quiet. Greg turned red and walked away. My mom followed him. They left early. My mom texted me the next day saying I embarrassed them and that I was cruel. I texted back that actions have consequences and she chose her actions 17 years ago. She chose Greg over keeping her family intact.

My teacher made us all have assigned seating, and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone, just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square, and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk. Just one word. Look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hands started shaking so bad, I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag, and I'd probably be first. I. I pulled the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned, and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me. The bathroom pass. I could ask to go to the bathroom, walk past it to the office. Warn them quietly. They could call the police. Lock down the school. Do it.

By the time I was 17, I had already raised eight of my mom's adopted children. You see, my mom was obsessed with social status. Every adoption got her another newspaper article, another 10,000 likes on Facebook. The thing was, she never actually wanted to parent them. That was my job. It all started when I was 9 and she brought home the first baby. Immature infant from Guatemala who needed round the clock care. You're so mature for your age, she'd said, handing me the feeding schedule at 3 a m. This will teach you responsibility. Well, I was making the kids packed lunches when she called a family meeting and slid photos across the table. Three babies from Ukraine, all under 2, one with cerebral palsy. Mom, I can't do this anymore, I said, voice shaking. I need to finish school. I've already missed 47 days this year. She tilted her head. Are you saying you won't help these innocent children? I'm saying I'm 17 and exhausted. That night, after everyone was asleep, she came to my room. Fine. Don't help. She showed me their medical files. But either you care for them, she said quietly, or they suffer. Your choice. My head spun while I processed what she was saying. She knew I couldn't watch babies suffer, that I would always choose them over me. The next morning, I tested the waters. Instead of staying home with Vance, who had The flu. I went to first period. Just one class. When I got home, I found my four year old brother, Danny on the kitchen floor, shaking. He's diabetic and his blood sugar was 32. Mom was on the couch scrolling through her phone. Oh, no, she said, not looking up. I completely forgot his insulin schedule. Guess that's just what happens when you choose to be selfish. That afternoon, I tried telling my school counselor. I didn't even finish the sentence before my phone buzzed. Mom's text. Gigi's inhaler seems to be missing. Help me look when you get home. I ran home and found mom holding the inhaler, examining it like she'd never seen one.

But the worst part was what I walked in on that evening. Mom had all the kids who could talk sitting in a circle. Remember? She was saying in her sweet voice, if anyone ever asks, I'm the best mommy ever. Because if you say anything else, they'll take you away and you'll never see each other again. Six year old Gigi was crying. But you're mean to Talia. My name. Mom's face went cold. Old Talia wants to abandon you. I'm the only one keeping this family together. Now what do we say if someone asks? THE children CHORUS in tiny, terrified voices you're the best mommy ever. She made them practice it five more times before bed. I stopped fighting after that. If she wanted me to give it my all, I would do exactly that. I dropped out of school. Not officially. Just stopped going. And when I did show up, I brought the toddlers. These are mine. I told my chemistry teacher when she asked why I was bringing children to learn about the periodic table. I sold her jewelry to buy formula and kept every receipt. I used her credit card at the pharmacy, let them flag it for fraud. When a teenager bought $400 of prescription medications. Two weeks later, she announced she was adopting. Premature twins with serious heart defects need surgery within six months or They won't survive, she said at dinner, like she was discussing the weather. The adoption agency needs proof of a full time caregiver. She looked right at me. I told them you deferred college. The next morning, she left for a five day charity retreat in the Bahamas. Just left a note on the counter with the twins feeding schedule. One was on a heart monitor that beeped if his oxygen dropped below 90. It dropped every hour. Then Francesca, our three year old, had a seizure in the bathtub while I was trying to cool the babies down. I called 9 1 1 with the baby under each arm. Francesca convulsing on the bathroom floor. The paramedics found me. Saw thing covered in vomit with 14 kids, the twins monitor shrieking. Where are your parents? They asked. I showed them Mom's text from the Bahamas. Handle it. That's what you're for. Don't call again. I'm in a meditation session. The hospital social worker pulled me aside the next day.

I was always the one who threw it, handled the logistics, dealt with supplies, managed the guest list, hated the themes. This year was supposed to be killer. A horror movie villain theme with custom decorations I've been collecting since August. I'd already spent weeks planning turn the basement into a haunted maze with motion sensors and fog machines, coordinated with the neighbors so they wouldn't complain, timed everything around the cop's usual patrol schedule, even hired my cousin to work the door. Everything was perfectly set until Alan decided he was still bitter about last year. Apparently, hooking up with my ex at my own party made me a terrible friend. We were broken up for three months, showed up with another date, and we connected in the backyard all over again. He complained to everyone that I betrayed him because he helped me through the breakup. Yet there I was, repeating my mistakes. Hurt wasn't just Alan making demands. It was my so called best friends immediately agreeing I shouldn't throw the party this year. These people whose high school memories were made at my parties, who never contributed a dollar or helped clean up, decided to throw their own competing party without me. No discussion, no trying to work it out, no Consideration for our tradition, Isaac's hosting this year, my former best friend announced casually. His parents are gone, too. You understand, right? Less drama this way. I didn't understand, but I backed off anyway. Stopped planning, removed myself from the group chat, watched from afar as they acted like they could easily replace what I built. Like throwing a party was just having an empty house and some alcohol three days before Halloween. Alan text me, panic. Turns out none of them knew about Isaac's neighbor being a cop who work night shifts. They had no idea about permits for street parking, keeping music levels under ordinance limits after 11 p m. Or that Isaac's house was in the neighborhood that got extra patrols on Halloween. Their party planning consisted of a Facebook event and a Venmo for Beer Money. Dude, Isaac's mom just said she might come home early, Alan said desperately. And we don't know where to get enough alcohol. Can you hook us up with your brother's friend? Also, do you still have those speakers? I almost laughed. I'm not part of this party, remember? You all made that very clear. Come on, don't be petty. We really need your help.

Nobody knows how to handle this stuff like you do. Then Isaac himself texts asking if maybe they could move the party to my house since my parents were confirmed gone and his were being weird about it. The audacity was absolutely incredible. The same people who said I ruined friendships wanted my house and connections. I screenshot his message and send it to my Instagram story with one response. Sorry, I'm uncomfortable helping people who chose drama over tradition. Maybe figure it out yourselves. They scrambled desperately for the next two days, but couldn't pull anything together. No one knew about getting kegs without an older brother's I D. No one thought about Ice Cup. So having enough bathrooms for 200 people. They had no contingency plan for cops, no sober person managing the door, no way to control who showed up. Meanwhile, I used all my preparation to throw my own party. I reached out to the older kids who graduated last year, invited the college crowd who actually appreciated a good party. My cousin ran the door like a checking IDS and keeping randoms out. We had three beer pong tables going, a DJ my brother knew from school, and the basement haunted house was absolutely terrifying. The best part started exactly 55 minutes into their party. I was showing people the haunted basement when everyone's phone started blowing up. Isaac's party was getting busted. Massive police response. Cop cars, neighbors filming everything. Someone had parked Blocking the cop neighbor's driveway. Music was rattling windows. Three houses down, a freshman was puking on the front lawn when the cops rolled up. My phone lit up with desperate texts. Can we come to yours? Is your party still happening? Please? The cops are writing tickets to everyone. Isaac's parents are driving home right now. His dad. Dad is losing his mind. Sorry, I responded to the group chat. We're at capacity. Wouldn't want to create any drama or awkward dynamics. The aftermath was absolutely brutal for them. Isaac got grounded until Christmas, lost his car privileges. Twelve people got 5 hundred dollar fines each. Alan got caught running from cops and faced additional charges. Someone's parents tried to sue Isaac's family for underage drinking liability. The whole thing became school legend, but not the way they wanted. My party went until 3:00am without a single issue.

We split everything evenly, had this jar in the kitchen where we all threw in cash for groceries and beer and nobody cared if you left dishes in the sink. For a day or two, everything was perfect until my roommate Jay started dating this girl Karen. At first she seemed cool. When he brought her to game night, she was all smiled. He found out I had my own room and lived with three guys. Her whole vibe changed after his night shift job. If I came out to the living room, she'd straight up ask why I was out there. If I went to the kitchen, she'd tell me I was being disrespectful and interrupting their time together. He even complained that me doing my laundry was ruining their mood. Like what? The worst part was when I'd be talking to Jay about normal roommate stuff and she'd literally start making out with him to shut down our conversation. We all started laughing it off because her fake moaning, screaming, she woke up our other two roommates accusing Jay of cheating and me of sleeping with all the guys and she dim grocery jar and slapped it in Jay's hand. Me and Cam told Jay she couldn't come over anymore if she couldn't handle me living there. He asked for a week to figure it out. That's when things got really weird. During that week, money kept disappearing from our grocery jar, my clean Dishes would randomly appear dirty in the sink. Ramped it by going to our landlord's mom with fake evidence. That's when I decided Karen needed to go. Karen was pissed and called me rude for making decisions without her input. Cam backed me up immediately stay in his room so they could hang out. The next day, that's when me and Cam put our theater degrees to work, went to Cam's room right next to Jay's and made a big show about Jay not being able to know we were hanging out alone. We started shaking the bed and making time call. He saw exactly what we told him, me beating Cam at Mario video games all night. Our other roommate confirmed he heard us talking trash during Mario party, not doing anything else. The next day, Jay called a house meeting without Karen.

Um, I'm playing Beat Saber, I said, pointing to my Quest 3 headset. Beat what? He demanded. I cast my screen to my phone and showed them footage of me slashing through blocks to a dubstep remix of let it go while doing deep squats and aggressive hip thrusts. I've been exercising, I said, my face burning red. In VR, in secret, because I'm embarrassed about how hard I go. Everyone stood there processing. So no affair? My mother in law asked. No affair? I confirmed, showing them my Beat Saber profile. Just me, ranked 4,847th globally, absolutely destroying blocks at 2:00am because I'm too embarrassed to let anyone see me exercise. My dad looked at the headset, and all those noises were me aggressively playing a fitness game. Yes, I said. Jake kept staring at the screen, showing my gameplay. The moaning, the it's coming, the harder. It's a really intense workout, I protested. I burn like 800 calories an hour. My sister started laugh, crying. You organized a whole intervention because your wife is secretly getting ripped in VR? My brother in law had been recording the whole thing. This is going straight on TikTok, he said.

That's definitely cheating, his brother said. She's having an affair in your bathroom at 2 a m? Like, if only they'd heard themselves, they would have known it made no sense.

My fiance said, thinking I'd raise another man's child. But she. I'm a 28 year old union electrician making decent money. I've been with Britney for three years. When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me. Because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. He wasn't excited. More like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped. Plus her health insurance. Nearly $8,000 so far. Plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer, Derek, from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decided to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him. Damien's got great insurance and steady money, but girl, you're really settling. Derek can't provide what this baby need. Britney replied, Damien can. My blood went cold. I Guess Damien's okay, Ashley continued, but you deserve better than some electrician who thinks Applebee's is fine dining. Britney laughed. I care about him enough, and honestly, he's so desperate to play hero that he'll never question

I got Emma inside, gave her her weighted blanket and headphones. Buddy stayed in position guarding her. Twenty minutes later, three police cars, an animal control van and a CPS worker showed up. My hands were shaking as I opened the door. Ma'am, we've received reports of child neglect, child endangerment and a dangerous animal attack, the lead officer said. Behind him, Karen stood in her driveway. Phone out, live streaming to her Facebook group. I have cameras, I said immediately. Everything's recorded. We reviewed the footage. Right there on my porch. The CPS worker watched Karen climb my fence, watched her terrify my daughter. Watched Buddy perform exact exactly as a 30,000 dollar service dog should. Protecting Emma while calling for help. Watched me respond immediately. The animal control officer spoke first. Ma'am, that's the best trained service animal I've seen in 20 years. The CPS worker was next. I'll be filing a report, all right? About the neighbor harassing a special needs child. But the lead officer, he walked straight to Karen's driveway. Ma'am, you're under arrest for criminal trespassing. Filing a False report and harassment of a disabled minor. The live stream caught everything. Her Facebook friends watched her get handcuffed, but the dog was aggressive.

I said yes for reasons I'm not ashamed of. But those reasons don't obligate me forever. I looked at Lauren. I promised your mother I'd take care of you. Not that I'd underwrite a lifestyle. Lifestyle? Chase repeated, ugly in his mouth. Yes. The mortgage, the kids, school, groceries, your car, the bar tabs. Where the story about me changes. Depending on the audience. His mouth closed tight. Lauren looked at the tablecloth like it might offer a script. I did. Slowly. I'm not angry. Anger burned off long ago. I'm clear. I kissed Lauren's cheek.

My autistic daughter Emma doesn't speak. She communicates through her service dog, Buddy, a golden retriever trained to alert us when she's having a meltdown or trying to communicate urgent needs. We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbour Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one. Buddy had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7 a. M. She and Buddy do Rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode. When her routine gets disrupted, she self harms, hitting herself, pulling her hair. Buddy was doing his trained response.

Nobody wanted it because the rent was pretty high, but I really needed that money. I was getting desperate. Like, eating ramen for dinner every night desperate. Then Jeremy showed up to my open house. It was like the perfect renter from a movie or something. He came with this thick folder of paperwork. Credit score over 800, clean background check, references from his church pastor, and two different jobs. He even brought homemade chocolate chip cookies for my kids with. Totally melted my heart because my husband used to do stuff like that. The guy was so polite. Called me ma'am, complimented how clean I kept the place. Said he just wanted a quiet spot to live while he saved up for his own house. When I told him the rent was 12 a month, he didn't even flinch. Just smiled and said that sounded fair. Then he did something that made me think I'd hit the lottery. He pulled out an envelope full of cash and paid 6 months up front, $7,200. Just like that. Said he preferred paying in advance to avoid any hassles. I tried to play it cool, but inside I was jumping up and down. That money meant I could finally catch Up on my mortgage and buy groceries without counting every dollar. For the first two weeks, Jeremy was like the dream tenant.

Six months ago, my wife Kathy left me and our 14 year old daughter for my business partner, Leon. We've been married 16 years, together for 19. I found out through texts on her phone they've been having an affair for three years while Leon and I built our company together from nothing. When I confronted her, she didn't even deny it. Just said she was sick of hiding and wanted to leave. I was devastated, completely blindsided. I begged her to work things out, told her we could go to counseling, anything. She got annoyed and dropped the nuclear bomb. She only married me because she got pregnant and didn't want to be alone. She tried to love me for 16 years, but it never worked. Now she found someone she actually loved and wasn't going to let me hold her back. She filed for divorce immediately. Didn't want alimony, didn't fight for the house, just wanted a fair split of assets so she could get out fast. Leon apologized profusely, said he'd wanted to tell me, but didn't know how. Within weeks, he sold his shares back to me and they moved to Boston for Kathy's new high paying job opportunity. My daughter was absolutely heartbroken. Mom just abandoned her without looking back. For six months, complete radio silence. No birthday calls, no weekend visits, nothing. Despite Having partial custody rights, my daughter refused to even mention her mom's name. We were slowly healing, building our life back together. Then last Tuesday night, 11 p M, someone's frantically pounding our door like the house was on fire. Through the people. Kathy, my daughter, immediately begged me not to answer. Said she didn't want to see her. But I thought it must be some kind of emergency.

I asked, so we can both flirt with anyone? His face brightened. Yes, perfectly healthy. The excitement in his voice was obvious. That sounds fun. If flirting keeps us young, let's do it. He practically glowed with relief and left the room smiling. He thought I'd sit home while he had his fun. He had no idea what was about to happen. That night at my birthday party, I watched David corner Veronica immediately. She wore a black dress cut low, and he couldn't keep his hands off her arm. They whispered and giggled while everyone watched. My sister looked ready to say something, but I beat her to it. I Walked over to David's best friend, Carl. Carl, you look incredibly handsome tonight. I touched his chest. Carl's face went red. Um, thanks, I continued. David says flirting keeps you young. Do I look young to you, Carl?

I had work to do. Because what Samantha didn't know was that I'd gotten promoted to senior partner three months earlier. She still thought I was making $65,000 when I was actually pulling $400,000. I had found a new apartment in a building she'd always dreamed about living in. I slowly moved my important things out. I changed the lease to remove her name, since I've been paying the full rent anyway. I installed a ring doorbell and connected it to only my phone. I changed the locks and packed all her things into boxes and moved them to a storage unit. She came home drunk out of her mind, and left in the morning for work hungover. She didn't notice anything had changed. At 8:45, I was at my new apartment. She texted around lunch about dinner plans, said I was busy. She said she'd see me at home. But the cruel reality hit her when she got home at 7. She called me, but I didn't pick up. She texted me that her key wasn't working. I wonder why. Then she tried the doorbell, but it didn't recognize her anymore. By 7:15, the building manager told her she wasn't on the lease anymore. She was panicking. Now what the hell did you do? She screamed when I finally answered. I graduated from being practice. I said calmly, what are you talking about? Let me in right now! No, I Heard what you said to your co workers yesterday. You called me your practice boyfriend. Training wheels before the real thing, remember? She went silent. Then she said you were there. Another pause. Jordan, that was just jokes with my friends. Which part was the joke? When you said you were trading up soon? Or when you touched Patrick's arm and told him very soon? I could hear her.

I was on Facetime at 1 a m. With my girlfriend when my mom burst through my door without knocking, finding me mid laugh with Nadine on my phone screen. Are you serious right now? Mom shrieked, grabbing my phone while Nadine's confused face disappeared into darkness. This is completely inappropriate. It's a school night. Dad appeared behind her, shaking his head like I'd committed some federal crime. They didn't care that I had straight A. Is that this was my chance with my crush, or that these late night calls were the only thing keeping her interested in me? You're 16. You don't need to be talking to girls at all hours. It was insane. Complete device lockdown after nine PM. Phone physically placed in their bedroom every night. Wi-Fi router programmed to kill my connection. Even my laptop taken away just in case. Mom installed one of those parental control apps that sent her alerts if I even touched any device after. Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my clock.

She's good, he said over drinks, but they all crack eventually. my ex wife acted sweet for two years before the spending started. I decided on the ultimate test. Six months into our marriage, I came home looking devastated. I sat her down and held her hands. The investments crashed. We lost everything. The house is being or closed. The cars are being repossessed. We have maybe 10,000 left. I watched her face, waiting for the disgust, the anger, the quick exit plan. Christina pulled me into her arms. It's okay. We'll figure it out. My teeth salary can cover a small apartment. You're brilliant. You'll rebuild. She spent that night making budget spreadsheets, looking up affordable neighborhoods near her school, calculating how to stretch her 35,000 salary for 2 p. The next morning, Christina called her principal to ask about summer school positions for extra income. She canceled her gym membership, started buying generic groceries, walked instead of taking the bus to save the fare. For three weeks, I watched her transform our supposed poverty into a managed life. She Learned to coupon. She took on tutoring jobs in the evenings. Never once complained. Never once asked what happened to the money. Never once suggested calling my parents for help. Then she found The bank statement I'd hidden poorly in my desk drawer. The real one showing the 40 million still sitting in various accounts. He walked into the living room holding the paper. I expected rage. Instead, tears rolled down her face. You never trusted me. This whole time you were testing me. Watching me like I was some experiment. She set the paper down gently. I knew. I'm not stupid. The black card that mysteriously disappeared after a week. The sudden bankruptcy with no lawyers involved. Your parents calling to chat. Norm

This is Attorney Wells from the state office. I'm calling about your grandmother, Ruth Collins. She passed last month and left specific instructions to contact you. My heart stopped. Grandma Ruth was my dad's mom, and she died when I was 12. I told him he had the wrong person. No, miss, this was your biological grandmother, Ruth Bennett. She's been looking for you for years, but your adoptive parents blocked all contact. She left you her entire estate, $2 million, her house in Oregon, and a letter she wanted you to read. I had to sit down right there in aisle 7, between the cereal and the pasta sauce. People were staring, but I didn't care. A real grandmother money. This had to be some kind of scam. But it wasn't. Attorney Wells explained that my bio parents had died in a car crash when I was two, and Grandma Ruth had been fighting the adoption for years. My adoptive parents had convinced the courts she was too old and unstable. I've been getting monthly checks from her the whole time. Money she'd sent for me that they kept for themselves. The letter destroyed me. Grandma Ruth had written it. Just before she died, she told me about my real parents, how mom was a Teacher who loved reading, how dad played guitar and made terrible jokes. She talked about family traditions I'd never gotten to experience, birthdays they'd missed, and how she'd set aside money for my college that my adoptive parents had stolen.

I left my Amex black card on the kitchen counter for a week, but it went untouched, so I suggested we go shopping for her new wardrobe. I have enough clothes, Christina said, heading to her teaching job at 6 a m. I offered to buy her a car. She said the bus route was convenient and she liked reading during the commute. Two months in, I took things a step further. I brought her to the Cartier store for our anniversary. Pick anything, I said, watching her face carefully.

Nobody had expected him to bring actual human blood to class. This is deoxygenated blood, Mister Inguian announced. As you can see, it's dark red, not blue. Never blue.

I was also wishing her a happy birthday, since that seems to have been forgotten, too. The color drained from Josh's face as he stared at me, and I could see the moment it hit him what day it was. The silence that followed was diminishing, and Josh's arm tightened around me as he finally looked at my dress like he was seeing it for the first time. Of course she looks beautiful. She always does, he said. But the Words felt hollow after two years of nothing. Ruby raised an eyebrow and looked directly at me when she responded. Does she now? Because from what I gathered, she didn't even know that. Josh practically dragged me away after that, making excuses about needing to say happy birthday to his coworker. But the damage was done. The car ride home was 20 minutes of him suddenly noticing everything about my appearance, from my hair to my shoe use to the perfume I've been wearing for six months while desperately trying to make birthday plans at 11 at night. I can't believe that woman was hitting on you right in front of everyone on your birthday, he finally said. I turned to look at him. She had known me for just 30 minutes, and I didn't even have to tell her it was my birthday. The silence was deafening.

When my dad found out I was pregnant, he didn't care that it was a man twice my age who forced himself on me. All he saw was a slut. He threw me out in the snow in the middle of the night. I was 16, and I had no idea where to go. I spent the night in the park bathroom, trying not to freeze to death while touching my stomach and thinking about this baby I never wanted. Miss Nyla found me the next morning sleeping in the school bathroom because I couldn't stay in the park after what happened with those men who kept circling back. It was my English teacher who always said I could write my way out of this town if I just kept believing in myself. She took one look at my garbage bags, and I completely broke down. I sobbed so hard I couldn't breathe. You're coming home with me, she said, and I collapsed against her because nobody had hugged me since that night, and I needed someone to tell me I wasn't disgusting. She canceled her classes and drove me to her house. I cried the whole way because kindness felt so foreign. Miss and Nyla lived alone in a house full of books and cats that wouldn't leave my stomach alone. Like they could sense the life inside. She made me a bedroom in Her office and came to every doctor's appointment, where nurses assumed she was my mother and we never corrected them. At night, she'd hold my hair during morning sickness and tell me about her wife Marina, who died three years ago. They'd tried for kids for a decade but ran out of time. Maybe you're both my second chance, she whispered, while I threw up again and I sobbed because this stranger was being the mother mine refused to be. We fell into a routine where she watched me do online school while I helped grade papers. Slowly my belly grew, and so did this feeling that maybe I could love this baby even though I hated how it started.

Frozen solid. My phone started buzzing within 10 minutes. First text from Mom. Honey, our cruise confirmation just disappeared from my email. What happened? The travel agent says it was canceled and they can't find our booking anywhere. I looked around the room at all their faces, still laughing, still making jokes about my dramatic overreaction to the cake incident. Jessica was showing people the video she'd taken, replaying my shocked expression question over and over. I typed back slowly, maybe ask Jessica to pay for it. With her dollar store budget, I'm sure she can cover 15 grand with her wheel missing toy money. Then I picked up my crying daughter, grabbed my keys and for bag, and walked out of my own party while they were still laughing. The next morning, I woke up to six to seven missed calls, 89 text messages, and my phone still buzzing non stop like an angry hornets nest. Jessica, you ruined everything! Do you know how much that cruise meant to mom and dad? They've been planning this for months! Dad, this is be non childish. It was just a stupid cake that cost too much anyway. Call the travel agent and fix this right now or you're no longer my son. Mom, sweetie, please call me back. I think there's been a terrible misunderstanding. you didn't mean to cancel our Family vacation over a little accident? We can buy you a new cake! But my favorite message was from my Uncle Bob. The same one who'd been clapping and cheering during Dad's toast about not wasting money. Hey, any chance you could spot me the money for the cruise instead? I already requested time off work and told my boss I'd be gone. This is really messing up my schedule. I smiled and made Mickey Mouse pancakes for my daughter's actual birthday breakfast.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It started when Principal Morrison announced the new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a thirty foot Ethernet cable to school and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr. Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet? Sir, the policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. Put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed placed tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr. Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain. Each person holding a laptop connected to each other. Passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria. Like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr. Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. Then use the TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr. Morrison banned using school devices as intermediary. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard, claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. Three teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendant system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aid and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it, though. Instead, she sold the service. Bring her your device. She'd connect it for you, then change your MAC address so it looked like a printer. By week three, half the school was showing up as HP Laserjet on the network. Why do we have 400 printer? Mr. Morrison asked it. Those aren't printers. I T. Replied, then what are they? Creative student. The arms race escalated. Ryan figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there, he used a drone with a camera. During lunch, when The bathroom was empty. The footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property? Into the courtyard, sir. The bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr. Morrison put curtains on the bathroom windows. But the masterpiece came from quiet. Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those passwords. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with the password admin 1 2, 3. And had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be? Isn't this

Except this time was different. This time I wasn't dropping my plans for her. God, I can't believe he did this to me, she said. Already pulling up Netflix on my team. We're watching that show we used to love, and you're gonna tell me I'm better off without him? I went back to my room and grabbed my duffel bag with my gear while she ranted about the guy she loved so much. She ditched me 47 times. My friends pulled up to the driveway and honked the horn twice, open the front door and started lacing up my shoes when Mara turned to look at me with a confused expression. Where are you going? Utah rock climbing, I said calmly. She jumped up from the couch so fast she almost knocked over the wine. What? You can't leave! I'm literally having a crisis right now. Then she actually started unpacking my duffel bag, throwing clothes and gear I had neatly packed across the room. Cancel it! Tell them you can't go! I dropped the bag and started picking everything back up again, and one of my friends stepped out of the car and walked over. Shocked at what she saw, she awkwardly started helping me pick up some of the throne stuff and bring it over to the car. Without asking, Kathy closed the door and glared at me. He cheated on me with his coworker. Don't you even care? Mom died four Months ago, I said flatly, you were at Jake's friend's party. Did you even care? I threw her words back at her. Kathy's mouth hung open, instantly. Speechless? That's what I thought. I reached for the door and stepped out with my bag still open. She ran to block my doorway, arms spread wide like she could physically keep me there. I have nobody else. You can't do this. Sure you can. If I did it, so can you. I walked to the car with her following me, her voice getting more desperate with each step. I'll make it up to you. Please. We can talk when you get back. I opened the car door and threw my bag in. She grabbed the door frame. Please, just one night. One night, and then you can go on your trip. I looked at her standing there with the same desperate expression can I had at the hospital when my mom was fighting for her life. Kathy, you disappointed me 47 times. There's not gonna be a 48. Please go home when you're done. I shut the car door.

I was working as a night shift nurse in a children's cancer ward in Los Angeles when it happened. The job was emotionally draining, but rewarding in ways I can't explain. That particular night was especially difficult. We'd lost a patient earlier, a seven year old girl named Nia, who'd been fighting leukemia for three years. Parents were devastated, and holding them as they collapsed in grief had taken everything out of me. Around 2:00am, I was doing my rounds when I noticed someone sitting alone in our family waiting area. It was unusual for visitors at that hour unless something was critical. As I approached, I realized it was Johnny Depp, dressed simply in jeans and a plain black jacket. I recognized him immediately, but understood celebrities value their privacy, especially in vulnerable moments. Can I help you? I asked professionally, not acknowledging who he was. He looked up with tired eyes and explained he was there to visit a young fan named Tommy, who was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy. Tommy had written to him through a foundation, but the letter had been delayed for months. Johnny had only received it yesterday and came straight away, not realizing how late it was. I explained visiting hours were over, but saw the genuine concern in his eyes. Tommy talks about your move. He's constantly, I admitted. Pirates of the Caribbean plays on repeat in his room. Something in Johnny's expression, Changed a mix of determination and sadness. I can come back tomorrow, he offered, but I could tell he was worried about whether Tommy would still have it tomorrow. Many of our patients didn't. I made a decision that could have cost me my job. Follow me, I whispered, leading him through the quiet corridors. Ten minutes, no photographs, and if anyone asks, you're Tommy's uncle who got special permission. Tommy was asleep when we entered, thin and pale against the white hospital sheets, tubes and monitors surrounding his small nine year old body. His walls were covered with Pirates posters. Johnny stood frozen in the doorway, visibly emotional. He quietly pulled a chair beside Tommy's bed and just sat there for a moment.

So last summer, I was getting ready for this pool party at my friend Jess's house. Like, 40 people were gonna be there from our high school, and I was super nervous because my ex would be there with his new girlfriend. Jess had given me this bikini a week before as a joke gift for my birthday. It was is this tiny, bright neon green string thing that barely covered anything. The top was basically two triangles, and the bottoms were like dental floss. She said she found it at some sketchy online store and thought it would be funny. I tried it on, and honestly, it looked amazing on me. Way better than my usual boring black one piece. But it was definitely meant to be a gag gift. This size was somehow perfect, though. Like it fit me better than any swimsuit I'd ever owned. I kept staring at myself in the mirror, thinking, maybe I should just wear it for real. The day of the party, I'm standing in my room holding both suits. My safe black one piece that made me look like a mom, or the neon green string situation that made me look like I belonged in a music video. I kept thinking about how my ex Tyler dumped me three months ago, saying I was too conservative and boring in bed. His new girlfriend, Madison, was this wild party girl who posted thirst Traps every day. So I said screw it and put on the green bikini. I threw a cover up over it and drove to Jesse's house. When I got there, the party was already going strong. Music was blasting, people were jumping in the pool, and I could smell the barbecue from the backyard. I found Jess by the snack table, and she nearly choked on her drink when she saw me. She was like, oh, my god, you actually wore it? And started laughing. I told her I wanted to try something different.

My autistic daughter Emma doesn't speak. She communicates through her service dog, Buddy, a golden retriever trained to alert us when she's having a meltdown or trying to communicate urgent needs. We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbour Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one. Buddy had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7 a. M. She and Buddy do Rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence, trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode. When her routine gets disrupted, she self harms, hitting herself, pulling her hair. Buddy was doing his trained response, putting his body between Emma and Karen while alert barking. For me, Karen was screaming, it's attacking me, rabbit dog! I scooped up Emma, who is now completely nonverbal and scratching at her arms. Get out of my yard! I shouted at Karen, who was still filming. This is child endangerment, she yelled back. Leaving a disabled child with a vicious animal. I'm calling CPS and animal Control. I got Emma inside, gave her her weighted blanket.

Half an hour later, she came storming in, yelling about how embarrassing it was when her cards got declined, how her friend had to pay for lunch. I was sitting on the couch with voice papers in my lap and boxes beside me. When she stopped yelling, I told her, real calm, yeah, I canceled the cards because you don't need them anymore. That's when she noticed the papers and boxes. I handed her the divorce papers and explained this was her graduation from practice marriage. The look on her face was worth every penny I'd spent on her. Pure shock, then panic, then desperate backtracking. She tried every approach, claiming it was a joke, apologizing, getting angry, making it my fault. But the damage was done. I'd heard exactly what she thought of our marriage. When she tried to argue. She couldn't be kicked out because it was her house, too. I showed her the prenup. You could see her face change as she realized how screwed she was. She signed away any claim to everything. I gave her two hours to pack and get out. She tried crying, tried arguing, tried one last desperate plea. I told her she should have thought about that before calling me. Practice

Haley acted completely normal while I sat there thinking how she basically admitted to using me as a financial safety net. Monday morning, I called in sick, went to my lawyer. Best decision I ever made was insisting on that prenup three years ago. Haley hadn't been happy about it. Kept saying it showed I didn't trust her. Turns out my paranoia was justified. The clean up was straightforward. Anything I owned before marriage stayed mine. Anything I earned during marriage stayed mine. Unless she could prove financial contribution. Since she'd quit working and hadn't contributed financially in two years, she had no claim to the house, savings, or car. I spent the week quietly preparing. Moved money from joint accounts, changed passwords, updated contact information. Haley never noticed because she never paid attention to finances anyway. I had divorce papers drawn up Thursday.

I've been married to Haley for three years. Decent marriage, or so I thought. I made good money. She'd quit her job a year after we got married to figure out what she really wanted to do, and I've been supporting both of us ever since. Last Friday, she had her girlfriends over for dinner, like she did every month. I cooked, serve them, then went to clean up. That's when I heard my name and tuned in. Honestly, girls, Anthony's just my practice husband until I find someone better. I literally froze with a plate in my hand. Her friend asked what she meant by practice husband, and Haley started explaining how I was good for now because I paid all her bills and did the cooking, but she wasn't planning to stay with me forever. Said I was fine for practice, but not husband material long term. The problem was she couldn't leave me yet because I paid for everything. All three started laughing like it was the funniest thing ever. What hit me wasn't just what she said, it was how casually she said it. Like obvious accepted fact. She wasn't confessing some secret, just stating the situation, like commenting on the weather. After her friends left, I waited an hour before confronting her. When I asked about the practice husband comment, she acted confused at First, when I spelled it out, her whole demeanor changed. Oh, that? Yeah, I said that.

I didn't yell, I just smiled. The entire table went quiet because they knew that smile meant something was coming. Later, Amanda and mom were giggling in the kitchen. Don't look so serious, mom said. It was just a prank. You're acting like they burned down your house, Amanda said. I worked months of overtime for that laptop. Amanda shrugged. Then buy another one. Dad walked in. Have to let things go. They're just kids. That was it. They weren't going to apologize. Something shifted that night. I'd spent years being the bigger person, but watching Carla cry while everyone laughed broke something inside me. I started thinking about everything I'd done for this family. Bills I'd covered when Amanda forgot rent. Times I'd bailed them out. A month later, mom called. Amanda's in a tough spot. Could you help with rent? The same sister whose kids destroyed a two thousand dollar laptop while everyone laughed? You can't hold on to that forever. No. A week later, I checked my joint emergency account. Nearly $1,800 gone in a transfer to Amanda. I called mom. Why did two grand disappear? Amanda was about to get evicted. That wasn't your money to give. That night, I closed the account and transferred everything to My personal savings. Then I made a spreadsheet listing every favor over the years. The total shocked me. I removed Amanda as my emergency contact, updated my will. So

I've been given three Grace periods in 12 months, I said calmly. Continuing without a payment plan would be a liability. Dad called, furious. Did you tell them to put us on prepaid? We'll go under! Maybe you should have thought about that before you laughed while my kid cried and stole from my account! When Amanda posted about people turning their backs on family, I sent her husband screenshots of her luxury purchases and the stolen money. Amanda called, screaming, how dare you! You went behind mine first! With been months, everything collapsed. Dad's business lost contracts. They sold the house below market value. Amanda's marriage was shaken. Mom finally called to apologize. We laughed when we should have defended Carla. We've paid for it. Amanda showed up weeks later, defeated. You ruined me! You ruined yourself! I just stopped cleaning up after you. That evening, Carla brought me a drawing. A big tree standing tall after a storm, with two figures smiling at the bottom. Looks like we made it through, she said. I framed it and hung it where the melted laptop used to Sit. When my family called to pull me back into their chaos, I didn't answer. Not out of anger, but peace.

Yesterday, she gave them all back. When Heather was 18, she walked into the kitchen carrying an old Adidas shoebox and said, dad, I need to show you something. She set the box on the counter and lifted the lid. Inside were hundreds of napkins, post its index cards. They were every lunch note I'd ever written her. You kept these? I asked. She nodded. Every single one. I'd started writing them when she was 6. The divorce between her mom and I had been final for two months. Her mom got weekends and holidays. I got weekdays. I meant I did all the school stuff. The problem was, I didn't know how to do school stuff. That first Monday of kindergarten, I packed Heather a peanut butter sandwich, apple slices, and a juice box. She came home talking non stop about everyone else's lunch. Catherine's mom made sushi rolls that look like pandas. And Julie's mom cut her sandwich into a butterfly with cookie cutter. And Joyce had a note from her mom in her lunch box that said, I love you to the moon and back, with a drawing of a rocket ship. Did you like your lunch? I asked. It was fine, she said, but I could tell she was envious. That night, after she went to bed, I stared at her lunch bag. I couldn't make sushi. I didn't own cookie cutters. But I could write I Grabbed a napkin and wrote, you're braver than you know. Love, dad. The next morning, I tucked it under her sandwich. When she got home, she ran to hug me and said, I saw the napkin. Ellie asked if my mom wrote it, and I said, no, my dad did. Nobody else's dad writes notes. I love you, dad. So I kept writing them. At first they were simple. Have a great day, or, you're my favorite person. Then I started adding drawings. Terrible ones. A cat that looked like a potato. A son with sunglasses. Our dog if our dog was made of circles. My first grade, I was writing jokes. What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. Told me her table laughed so hard, the lunch monitor had to shush them. Second grade, I started writing them based on what was happening before her spelling test. You got this. Those words don't stand a chance. After she'd fought with her friend. Being kind when you're hurt is the hardest kind of brave. Sit down, Heather said that morning in the kitchen. I need to show you how I organized them. She'd separated them into sections with rubber bands and labeled sticky notes. The first bundle said, funny. She pulled one from third grade. Why don't eggs tell jokes? Cracker. Another one had a drawing of me attempting to dance at her recital. This is still the worst drawing you've ever done, she said. Laughing. The next section was labeled Bad Days. These were thicker napkins, longer notes. She pulled one from seventh grade. You are exactly who you're supposed to be. Not who they say you are. Not who you think you should be. Who you are. That hey, Ruth had told everyone I was weird for not having a mom at home. That I was probably weird, too. How did you know? She said that I hadn't known. I just wrote what I wished someone would tell me. She pulled out another bundle. This one made my chest tight. The label said, saved me. This section is from eighth grade. Mostly. She said she pulled out a coffee stained napkin. You're not alone. You never have been. You never will be. Even when I'm not there, I'm there. She showed me another one from that year.

She could come back when she had a real plan. She ran to her room crying and my husband came in asking what all the yelling was about. When I explained, he said maybe I was being too harsh. Emma's always been a homebody and maybe forcing her out wasn't the answer. But I stood my ground. The next day, Emma's grandmother called me screaming. Emma had called her crying about how I was kicking her out for wanting to be a traditional wife. My mother in law went on this whole rant about how back in her day women didn't need careers and how I was being a terrible feminist mother for not supporting my daughter's choices. Then Emma's best friend's mom texted me saying I was wrong for not respecting my daughter's dreams. Apparently Emma had been telling everyone I was forcing her to abandon her values and become some kind of career obsessed woman who doesn't want kids. But that's not what I said at all. I never said she couldn't be a stay at home mom. I said she needed a backup plan. Some kind of skill or education or work experience. Even just working part time at target would give her basic customer service skills and show her what it's like to earn her own money. The whole thing came to a head last week when Emma announced she joined some online matchmaking group for traditional Wives. She showed me this website where women post profiles talking about how they want to be homemakers, and men look for wives who will stay home. Some of these women were 18, 19 years old, talking about how they're looking for older men who can financially support them immediately. I told her she was basically looking for someone to take care of her like a child, not a partner. That set her off again. She screamed that I didn't understand her generation, that I was stuck in some second wave feminist mindset, and that plenty of women choose to be traditional wives. My husband finally stepped in and said we needed family counseling. Emma refused. She said she'd rather move out than listen to some therapist tell her that her dreams were wrong. So I told her, fine, start packing. She's been staying with her grandmother for the past week.

My daughter Emma just turned 18 and graduated high school two months ago. Since she was about 15, she's been talking about how she doesn't wanna go to college or get a job. She wants to find a husband and be a stay at home mom, period. That's it. That's her entire life plan. At first I thought it was just teenage talk, like how kids say they want to be astronauts or YouTube stars. But she's been dead serious about it for three years now. No college applications, no job hunting, nothing. She spends most of her time watching these TikTok videos about traditional wives and reading blogs about homemaking. Last month she came to me with what she called her life plan. She was going to live at home with me and my husband until she found a husband. She figured she'd meet someone at church or maybe through friends, marry them within a year or two, then have kids right away. When I asked what she'd do if something happened to her hypothetical husband, she just shrugged and said she'd move back in with us. I lost it. I told her that wasn't happening. If she wanted to live at home after graduation, she needed to either get a job or go to school. Community college, trade school, something she didn't have to get a four year degree. But she needed some kind of plan that didn't involve sitting around waiting for Prince Charming. She started crying and said I was being mean and that being a mom was a real job. I told her I wasn't saying being a mom wasn't work, but what happens if her husband dies or leaves or gets disabled? What if they can't have kids? What if he turns out to be abusive? She needed something to fall back on. That's when she dropped the bomb. She said her backup plan was literally me and my husband. If anything went wrong, she just moved back home and we'd support her and any kids she might have. I asked what would happen if we died or couldn't help anymore, and she said, I don't know, mom. This is ridiculous. None of it is going to happen. I told her she was being naive and that I wouldn't enable this fantasy. I said if she graduated and didn't have a job or wasn't in school.

I had just been served divorce papers during my lunch break by someone named Sophia, citing abandonment after five years of marriage. The problem was that I had never been married and had definitely never met anyone named Sophia in my entire life. Maybe it's a different Ryan, my coworker suggested as he studied them more carefully. But then his expression changed. This has your Social Security number and your address and your parents names as in laws. I stared at the signature on the marriage certificate attachment, and my blood ran cold because it looked exactly like my handwriting, down to the way I always make my R's too narrow. This has to be identity theft, I said, but my voice sounded shaky. I dialed the law office with trembling hands, trying to explain that someone was impersonating me. The attorney listened patiently before responding, Mister Ryan, I understand this is emotional, but denying your marriage won't make this simpler. And we have extensive documentation, including wedding photos and joint tax returns. I tried to process that they supposedly had wedding photos of me that I'd never seen. Where are you claiming this marriage took place? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Vegas, five years ago. You've been living together in the marital home ever since, though apparently you haven't been there for the past two years, she replied. But five years ago, I was living alone in my current apartment. And I had the least to prove it. There must be some mistake. I've never even been to Vegas. I insisted the attorney side. Mister Ryan, your wife has photo albums and five years of documentation. Perhaps you should review the materials I'm sending before making

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exact three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself in A hospital bed with an IV in her arm. Starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardianship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn

There wasn't gonna be a 48. Everyone told me I was too lenient with my best friend Kathy, and always made excuses for her when she flaked out on plans to be with her boyfriend. And maybe they were right. I mean, two years ago, she had offered to take me out for brunch after I was feeling down over losing my job, when she suddenly texted me, can't make it. Jake surprised me with breakfast in bed. And the worst part of it was that I was literally already there at our reserve table ordering two mimosas. Then it was the birthday dinner where she showed up 90 minutes late, then left after 10 minutes because Jake asked her to come over. Same thing when I was moving apartments and when my mom was having surgery, and I really needed a friend. And you think that was the final straw, right? No. It wasn't until Kathy flaked out on my mom's no. That I realized I was chasing after someone who clearly didn't want me around like I wanted her. So I stopped inviting her to things, focused on myself, joined a climbing gym, made some new friends, and made space for old friends who actually wanted to be there. And by the time my birthday came around, my dinner table was full of people who cared and made time for me, too. But just as things started turning Around Kathy came back, I was packing up my climbing gear when I suddenly got a flood of texts. Jake cheated on me with crying emojis filled my notifications. I glanced at it, then went straight back to packing. Three more texts came through in rapid succession. Um, hello. I'm literally heartbroken. Then I'm coming over getting wine and ice cream. That only made me pack even faster. My phone rang, and I let it go to voicemail. A text instantly popped up. Are you seriously not gonna be here when I need you? Well, that was ironic.

Roger sat down his juice box deliberately and said, stop defending her. She let you turn in your lab report a week late. A week? She gave me a zero for being one day late. I suddenly felt defensive of Miss White. Maybe he had a good reason, I said quickly. She's strict, but she's fair. There has to be an explanation. Megan's voice came out sharp. Roger, what exactly have you seen? Roger pulled out his phone. His movements quick, angry. I made a list. Look at this and tell me this is normal. He showed everyone his notes app. The list made me uncomfortable. Me sleeping in class without punishment. Me eating full meals during lectures. Me getting bathroom passes whenever I wanted. Me staying after school with a key to her classroom. Megan leaned forward, reading everything. This. This does look weird. What's your explanation? An explanation? I insisted. There's nothing to explain. She's just being helpful. Roger wasn't finished. He swiped to another page. This was yesterday. Tell me this isn't suspicious. The photo showed Miss White putting bags in my car after school. I stared at it, my mind racing. This is innocent. She was helping me with something. Helping you with what, exactly?

You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd cheered. I just left. The next morning, she realized she'd lost more than just me. My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god! God, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a. She lied to me and broken the one promise I made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because Maya and Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance, and I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back, I told her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile.

So I've been dating Emma for about 8 months now and she's amazing. The only problem, her family. They're one of those Italian American families who never shut up about being Italian, even though none of them have ever been to Italy. And the closest they get to speaking Italian is saying Grazie, Olive Garden. Emma warned me before I met them. She said her dad, Marco, and her uncle Sal always do this thing where they throw around random Italian words to seem authentic, especially when they want to intimidate someone or show off. Her mom does it, too, but mostly just says Madonna Mia every five seconds. The first time I met them was at Sunday dinner at her parents house in Jersey. I walked in and immediately Marco goes, hey, you must be the boyfriend. Come stop. I just smiled and said hi because honestly, I had no idea what he said. Then throughout dinner, they kept dropping these Italian phrases and looking at me like I should be impressed or something. Uncle Sal kept calling me Ragazzo, which I'm pretty sure he thought meant tough guy or something. Here's the thing they didn't know. My mom is actually from Milan, like actually from Italy, not Italian American. She moved here when she was 25. And I grew up speaking both English and Italian at home. I'm completely fluent. But Emma had never heard Me speak it because why would it come up? We live in Boston, not Italy. So anyway, this went on for months. Every family gathering, every dinner, they do their little Italian show, making comments in broken Italian, thinking I couldn't understand. I caught them saying stuff like, questo regato non capicioniente, which means this guy doesn't understand anything. Real classy. Breaking point was Emma's birthday dinner last month. We're at this nice restaurant and her whole family is there. Marco starts telling this story about how his grandfather came from Sicily, and he's going on about family, honor and tradition. Then he looks right at me and goes, you Americans, you don't understand LA famiglia. You don't know what it means to have Italian blood. I just sat there eating my pasta while Uncle Sal chimed in with, see, BC, we Italians, we stick together. We protect each other. Capisce. He was trying to sound threatening, but honestly, he just sounded like he Learned Italian from watching the Godfather. Emma was getting embarrassed and kept apologizing with her eyes. Her cousin Tony started going off about how nobody understands Italian culture anymore and how Americans have no respect for tradition. This whole time they're throwing around basic words like baney and familia like they're speaking some ancient secret language. That's when I decided I'd had enough. I put down my fork, l'ho diretti at Marco and said in perfect Italian, scusi ma devo dire qualcosa Io parlo Italiano perfettamente. Perch√© Mia Madre √® di Milano Ho sentito tutto quello che avete detto negli ultimi Otto mesi. The entire table went dead silent. I mean, you could hear the people at the next table chewing. Marco's face went from confused to red to white in about three seconds. But I wasn't done. I kept going.

I worked months of overtime for that laptop. Amanda shrugged. Then buy another one. Dad walked in. Have to let things go. They're just kids. That was it. They weren't going to apologize. Something shifted that night. I'd spent years being the bigger person, but watching Carla cry while everyone laughed broke something inside me. I started thinking about everything I'd done for this family. Bills I'd covered when Amanda forgot, rent times I'd bailed them out. A month later, mom called. Amanda's in a tough spot. Could you help with rent? The same sister whose kids destroyed a 2 thousand dollar laptop while everyone laughed? You can't hold on to that forever. No. A week later, I checked my joint emergency account. Nearly 1,800 dollars gone in a transfer to Amanda. I called mom. Why did two grand disappear? Amanda was about to get evicted. That wasn't your money to give. That night, I closed the account and transferred everything to my personal savings. Then I made a spreadsheet listing every favor over the years. The total Shocked me.

I bought Carla an even better laptop. Meanwhile, Amanda posted pictures of her kids with expensive new tablets. I screenshotted it. Evidence. Through work, I had influence over supplier relationships my dad's business relied on. When contract renewals came up, I was asked about their account. Late payments, missed shipments. They've been given three Grace periods in 12 months, said calmly. Continuing without a payment plan would be a liability. Dad called, furious. Did you tell them to put us on prepaid? We'll go under! Maybe you should have thought about that before you laughed while my kid cried and stole from my account! When Amanda posted about people turning their backs on family, I sent her husband screenshots of her luxury purchases and the stolen money. Amanda called, screaming, how dare you! You went behind mine first! Within months, everything collapsed. Dad's business, lost contracts, sold the house below market value. Amanda's marriage was shaken. Mom finally called to apologize. We laughed when we should have defended Carla. We've paid for it. Amanda showed up weeks later to feed. You ruined me! You ruined yourself! I just stopped cleaning up after you. That evening, Carla brought me a drawing. A big tree standing tall after a storm, with two figures. Smiling at the bottom. Looks like we made it through, she said. I framed it and hung it where the melted laptop used to sit. When my family called to pull me back into their chaos, I didn't answer. Not out of anger, but peace.

My sister's kids threw it in the fire. While my parents laughed, my sister chuckled. Maybe this will teach her not to be spoiled. I just smiled, closed my wallet and the whole room went silent. My daughter Carla just turned 13. She loves digital art and I've been saving for months to buy her a 2 thousand dollar laptop for her birthday. Her birthday fell around Easter, which I meant the big family gathering at my parents place. My sister Amanda arrived with her three kids who have no rules at home. Within minutes, they pulled Carla's sketchbook out and scribbled all over her drawings. Carla came running outside holding back tears. Relax, it's just paper. She can draw more. Amanda shrugged. At dinner, I had the laptop wrapped in a gift bag on her chair. Carla opened it carefully and her face lit up. Dad, this is amazing. She hugged me tight. Before I could even take a picture, one of Amanda's kids grabbed the laptop. He ran toward the fire pit holding it over his head while the others cheered. Stop, I yelled, but it was too late. He tossed it in like a frisbee. This sound when it hit the flames was sickening. Carla gasped, went quiet. I fished it out but the casing had already melted. That's when I heard the laughter. Amanda was laughing. My parents were chuckling. Dad said, Maybe that'll teach her not to be spoiled. Carla was shaking, tears rolling down her face. My whole family was acting like this was some kind of joke. I set the melted laptop down slowly and looked directly at Amanda. She smirked. It's just a computer. You can buy another one. Maybe get her something she needs instead of spoiling her. I didn't yell. I just smiled. The entire table went quiet because they knew that smile meant something was coming later.

Chose the one who could file fastest. Then I contacted his wife. We met at a coffee shop while our spouses were on another work trip. Hers to help her mother, his for a conference that didn't exist. I showed her everything. She just stare at the hotel receipt from their weekend. The same weekend her mother had been in the hospital for surgery. He used my mother's cancer for a fair time, she said, voice flat. Sunday evening, my wife came home from her weekend with her sister. Kissed me hello. Said she missed me. Asked if I wanted to order Thai food. I hit record on my phone, per lawyer's advice. How's your sister? I asked. Good. We had fun shopping. That's nice. Where'd you stay? She named a hotel the wrong one. She couldn't even keep her lies straight. Funny, because the Marriott Downtown says you stayed there with Mark. Her face went white, then red. Then came tears and denials. Then partial confession. Just one kiss at a bar months ago. She swore. Nothing more. I laughed. Actually laughed. Eight months, Rebecca. I've seen everything. The photos you sent him. The I love you messages. The plans to leave me after my parents Anniversary. Because you didn't want to ruin my grief, period. She tried everything. Blamed me for working too much. Said I'd grown distant after my parents died. Then when nothing worked, she went nuclear. You have no family left. I'm all you have. You'll be completely alone. She knew exactly where to strike. My parents died in a car accident two years ago. No siblings. She'd been my only family. Better alone.

Also, you're not infertile. You're on birth control. The pills are in your medicine cabinet, behind the vitamins. The funeral home erupted. Now, Grandpa's voice continued calmly, my granddaughter, if you're holding guardianship papers right now, and I know you are, because you always want the best for everyone, read page 4, subsection C, out loud. My hands trembled as I flipped through the pages. Permanent and a reversible transfer of parental rights. The guardianship was never meant to be permanent. Your mother's friend drafted those. Stand up, Joe. A man in the fifth row reluctantly stood, face bright red. Mom was freaking. Turn this off! He's destroying our family! Evelyn, you're about to say I was always manipulative. Three, two, one. He was always manipulative, she screamed. Too predictable. Oh, and sweetheart, his voice softened, addressing me. Check under that pregnancy book I gave you. There was a USB. And in seconds, a recording of my mother's voice filled the funeral home. When dad dies, let's tell Opie the cancer's back. She always caves when I cry. And here's the kicker. Grandpa's video continued over the chaos. The trust can only be accessed by biological parents. Guardianship changes nothing. You exposed yourselves for money you could never touch. The funeral home turned in to a battlefield. Family members screaming, mom lunging for the screen, the funeral director calling security. I stood there ripping those guardianship papers into pieces. One more thing. Grandpa's voice echoed for the last. Time about the trust money. I already put it in a locked account for the baby, accessible only at 18. To the child directly. Oh, and Evelyn, if you're still watching this, your parking meter ran out 20 minutes ago. He kept going. And what he said next made my face drain of color. My mother's face went from angry to terrified. Turn it off! She screamed. She doesn't need to know. And after I found out, I was ready to destroy them in the same way they destroyed me. But worse.

Rebecca called 6 7 times between six PM and midnight. Messages progressed from confused to angry to desperate. She claimed Connor didn't mean it, was just showing off for friends, that I was overreacting to. Typical teenager behavior. I texted back once saying I needed space and would contact her when ready, then blocked her number to avoid the emotional manipulation building in her messages. Monday morning, I contacted my bank and removed Rebecca as joint account holder. Called the mortgage company. Thankfully, my name wasn't on the loan. Rebecca had refinanced in her name only six months before we moved in together. The mortgage was due the first. By the fifth, Rebecca contacted me through a mutual friend with a frantic message explaining she didn't have enough money to cover the mortgage, begging me to reconsider. She claimed she talked to Connor and he was very sorry, wanted to apologize personally. I responded that I appreciated her reaching out, but my decision was final. I'd already put a deposit down on a one bedroom apartment across town. Rebecca's sister called Thursday night saying Rebecca was having panic attacks about potentially losing the house. Tried guilting me about abandoning a single mother and her child. I calmly explained I've been financially supporting them for two years while being treated as an outsider in my own home. Friday evening, Rebecca showed up at my brother's place crying, begging to talk. Against better judgment, I agreed to Speak on the front porch. Rebecca looked like she hadn't slept in days. Admitted she'd been wrong. Undermine my authority with Connor. Gotten too comfortable with our financial arrangement. Offered to add my name to the mortgage. Suggested couples counseling. I listened to everything, then explained the issue wasn't just about chores or Connor's attitude. She created a dynamic where I was expected to provide without receiving respect or having any real say in household decisions. Told her I cared about them both, but couldn't continue being treated like a premium rent paying tenant.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exactly three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, college funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself. In a hospital bed with an IV in her arm, starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardian ship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific the constructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn is perking up right now thinking this is about trust distributions, he said, and Mom's eager face shifted to

I moved out quietly. I'm 38. Been with my girlfriend Rebecca for three years. She has a 15 year old son, Connor, whose biological father moved states away when Connor was eight. The deadbeat sends maybe $200 monthly when he remembers. Rebecca works part time at a dental office making $30,000 while I pull $95,000 as a project manager. When we moved in together two years ago, I took over her 2 thousand two hundred dollar mortgage payments, plus utilities, groceries and Connor's expenses. Phone, clothes, sports equipment, everything. Rebecca insisted we keep separate finances, which I stupidly agreed to. Looking back, this arrangement only benefited her while I shouldered the financial burden. Connor and I had what I thought was a decent relationship. I never tried replacing his father, but expected base, take respect and help with household chores. Taking out trash, keeping his room clean, weekend yard work. Nothing unreasonable. Rebecca constantly undermined me, saying I was too strict or Connor needed time to adjust. Red flag I ignored. Last Saturday, I was in the kitchen making lunch when Connor's three friends came over. They were hanging out in the living room and Connor was complaining loudly about raking leaves that morning. Our house has thin walls and they weren't keeping voices down. One friend asked why Connor had to do chores when his Mom's boyfriend was home. Connor's response hit like a punch to the gut. My real dad would never make me do chores like this loser. This guy thinks he can boss me around just because he pays for stuff. My mom says I don't have to listen to him anyway. His friends laughed. Once said Connor was lucky having someone pay for everything while doing whatever he wanted. Connor agreed, adding that his mom told him I wasn't going anywhere because I was too.

I didn't mention that friendship groups take time to develop, that you need to show up consistently, that you need to do the reading. Then our friend Maria threw a dinner party. Katie saw it on Instagram. That night, everyone from our friend group was there, including me. Why wasn't I invited? She asked. When I got home, I felt terrible. Maria said she texted you two weeks ago asking if you were free Saturday the 15th. You never answered. Katie checked her phone.

She'd been so focused on making her own plans that she never participated in anyone else's. She only reached out when she needed something. Never gave anything back. After eight years of me handling the emotional labor, she didn't even know what friendship maintenance look like. Please, can we just go back to how things were? Katie begged. I'll apologize to everyone. I'll fix this. Please help me fix this. There at game night right now, I said quietly, your college roommate is hosting. She asked me to co host next month.

I immediately tell him that if Susan and Greg are gonna be there, count me out. Dan keeps pushing me to come, saying I should just put my feelings aside for once and join the group. Against my better judgment, I agree to go. I show up and there's six of us total. We're all talking and catching up and then everyone starts ordering. Most people get stuff around $40, which is pretty normal for this place. Then Susan and Greg's turn comes up. Susan orders this lobster dish that's like $95 plus she gets an appetizer and expensive wine. Greg gets surf and turf for $120 plus drinks. I'm watching this happen and I already know what's coming next. When the waiter gets to me, everyone's looking at me expectantly. I pick up the menu, scan it for like two seconds, point to the 4 dollar Miller Lite and tell the waiter that's all I want. Dan immediately goes, dude, why aren't you eating anything? I just shrug and say, I lost my appetite. Two other friends at the table look at each other, then flag down the waiter to cancel their food orders, too. They just got drinks instead. The whole dinner was awkward after that. Susan and Greg are eating their fancy meals while half the table is just sipping beer. I could tell they were getting nervous because they kept picking at their food instead of actually eating it. And the check comes. The total was insane because of their expensive orders. Greg immediately grabs the waiter and goes, can you split this six ways? Without even asking anyone, I stand up and correct him. Actually split it three ways. Three of us only had drinks. Greg looks at me all confused and goes, what? What? We always split the Bill evenly. I look him dead in the eye and say, well, three of us didn't eat any food so we're just paying for our drinks. The math was brutal. Dan, who probably ate like $50 worth of food, got stuck with a 146, 98 check.

It all started when my manager, Kevin, kept calling me Jamal. My name is Marcus. I've worked at this insurance office for two years, and Kevin has called me the right name maybe five times total. Every email, every meeting, every casual conversation. Jamal this, Jamal that. The worst part? There's actually a guy named Jamal who works in accounting on the third floor. We look nothing alike except for both being black. Corrected Kevin probably 20 times the first month. Hey, it's actually Marcus. Then I tried being more direct. Kevin. My name is Marcus, not Jamal. Then I tried humor. Unless you're planning to pay Jamal salary, you might want to use my actual name. Nothing worked. But Kevin wasn't the only one. Linda from HR called me Deshawn twice in one week. My cubicle neighbor Beth introduced me to her husband at the office Christmas party as Terrell. Even the receptionist who sees my name on packages daily called me Antoine when I picked up mail. I was venting to my girlfriend about it over dinner and she just started laughing. You know what you should do? Start calling them random white names back. See how they like it. At first I thought she was joking, but the more I thought about it, the more genius it seemed. The next morning, Kevin walked up to my desk with some paperwork. Morning, Jamal, he said, dropping the Files. Morning, Chad, I replied without looking up. He paused. Uh, it's Kevin. Oh, right. Sorry, Kenneth. My bad. He walked away looking confused, but I. I could tell he thought it was just a one time thing. Boy, was he wrong. I started calling Linda from HR Becky. She corrected me once, then twice, then eventually just gave up. Beth became Brittany, sometimes Ashley if I was feeling creative. The receptionist rotated between Madison, Caitlin, and Jessica, depending on my mood. But Kevin got the full treatment. Dad, Brad Hunter, Preston Tanner. I had a whole rotation going. I'd switch it up every few days to keep him on his toes. The best part was watching their faces when they realized what was happening. Kevin finally caught on during a team meeting, when I called him Braden in front of our district manager, Marcus, he said, getting visibly frustrated, my name is Kevin. We've worked together for two years. I looked him dead in the eye and said, oh, wow, two years? That's crazy, I've been correcting people about my name being Marcus for two years, too. Weird how that works, right, Blake? The room went completely silent. Our district manager started choking on his coffee trying not to laugh. Kevin's face turned red. That's. That's different. How exactly is it different, Brock? That's when Linda jumped in. Look, Marcus, I think there's been some misunderstandings here. Absolutely, Bailey. I think you're right. She blinked. It's Linda and I'm Marcus. Funny how names work. Words spread around the office pretty quick. Some people thought it was hilarious. Others thought I was being petty. But you know what happened? People suddenly got really good at remembering my actual name. Kevin tried to write me up for being disrespectful, but when he brought it to HR, Linda had to explain to our district manager why Kevin was upset about being called the wrong name. The irony wasn't lost on anyone. The meeting lasted about five minutes before

I agreed. I drove to his house and showed him the years worth of texts from his daughter detailing how she was cheating on me. The fight started over coffee creamer. I bought the wrong brand and within minutes, Megan was screaming about my thoughtlessness. I can't do this anymore, David, she yelled. We're done. I stood there completely calm because I knew this wasn't real. It was a performance. I knew because I'd read the script a year earlier. I'd picked up our shared iPad to look up recipe. Her eye message was still open. The first message was from Julian. A photo of them at lunch. She'd called a work meeting. The message below, can't wait until you're finally free from that boring project manager, and we can do this every day. I scrolled up and found a years worth of conversation. It wasn't just an affair. It was a detailed exit strategy. They mocked my job, my friends, my life. They had their future planned out. The scheme was simple. Megan would stay with me, enjoying my financial security while I saved for a ring. She'd push for a specific diamond. The moment I proposed, he'd manufacture a fight, break up with me, and after a few weeks, go public with Julian. The ring was their prize. Seed money for their new life. Instead of confronting her, I documented Everything. Every few weeks when she was out, I'd screenshot their conversations and say,

So my grandpa died two months ago, and my dad has been acting like he just won the lottery. He's already picked out a new truck, started looking at vacation houses, and keeps talking about how he's finally gonna live the good life. The thing is, I'm the one who helped Grandpa write his will three years ago when he was still sharp, and I know exactly what's in it. Dad's not getting what he thinks he's getting. My grandpa was this tough old guy who owned a small auto repair shop for, like, 40 years. Super smart with money, never spent on anything fancy. Drove the same beat up Ford for 20 years. But he was also really good at reading people. And honestly, he wasn't too happy with how my dad turned out. See, my dad's always been the type to count other people's money. When grandpa got sick last year, dad started coming around way more often. But it was obvious he was just waiting for the inheritance. He'd make these comments like, when I get the shop, I'm gonna modernize everything. Or, can't wait to see what grandpa's been hiding in his bank accounts. It was honestly pretty gross to watch. The real kicker was when Grandpa was in the hospital for his final stay, dad spent more time on his phone looking at boats online than actually talking to Grandpa. I remember sitting There, watching dad scroll through some Marina website while Grandpa was trying to tell him stories about the old days. Grandpa noticed, too. I could see it in his eyes. Now, here's what actually happened with the will. Three years ago, Grandpa called me over and said he wanted to update his will. He was always closer to me because I actually helped him at the shop sometimes and didn't just show up when I needed something. We sat at his kitchen table with this lawyer he'd known forever, and Grandpa laid it all out. The auto shop going to Carlos, his head mechanic, who's been there for 15 years and actually knows how to run the place. Carlos has been like a son to Grandpa. Comes by every weekend to check on him, brings his kids around. Real family stuff. The house, that's going to my cousin Emma, who's been helping Grandpa with groceries and doctor appointments for the past five years while dad was too busy to visit regularly. Dad gets $5,000 in Grandpa's old toolbox. That's it. The really crazy part is Grandpa left me as the executor of the will, which means I have to be the one to break all this news to everyone. He told me straight up, I want you to handle this, because you'll do it right, and you won't let anyone push you around about it. But here I am, two months later, watching my dad make all these plans. And I haven't said anything. Part of me feels bad because he's genuinely excited. Like, yesterday he showed me this RV he wants to buy and was talking about how him and mom are going to travel the country. But the other part of me remembers all those times.

So on day 21, I made it permanent, 20 days of silence. That's what my wife decided I deserved after I suggested she help with household responsibilities instead of treating me like her personal butler. But here's the thing about playing the silent treatment card. Sometimes the other person decides they prefer the quiet. I finished a 12 hour shift and walked into what looked like a tornado hit our kitchen. She's piled high take out containers scattered everywhere and her on the couch scrolling through her phone. I made the apparently unforgivable mistake of saying, hey, think you could give me a hand cleaning up before dinner? The look she gave me could have frozen hell over. Excuse me, I work too. I'm not your maid. I never said you were. I thought we could tackle this together since we both live here. That's when she stood up, grabbed her purse and delivered the line that would define the next three weeks. Figure it out yourself and don't expect me to talk to you until you learn some respect. The front door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. When she came back two hours later, I thought we'd have a normal conversation. I was wrong. She walked past me like I was invisible and went straight to the bedroom. Day 2 rolled around and still nothing. I tried the reasonable approach. If I came across wrong yesterday, we should Talk. She poured her coffee, walked past me and left for work without acknowledging I existed. By Day 5, I realized what this was. This wasn't about dishes or respect. This was control. She decided freezing me out would make me grovel and apologize for something I shouldn't apologize for. Day 7 was when something clicked. I was eating a sandwich watching her perform her silent tantrum routine and I started laughing. Here was a grown woman who thought giving me the cold shoulder was going to break me down dead. It was showing me exactly who I'd married. By Day 10, the house had gotten remarkably peaceful. No arguing about whose turn it was to take out trash, no passive aggressive comments about the dishwasher, no dramatic sighs when I wanted to watch sports. I was starting to see the upside. Day 15 brought reinforcements. Her sister called asking if everything was okay because my wife seemed stressed. I told her everything was fine. I was giving my wife the space she'd requested. When her sister tried to dig deeper, I said, she knows how to end this anytime she wants an adult conversation. But here's what she didn't realize during her tantrum, I was using this time to think about what my life had become and what I wanted it to be. Day 20 arrived with her pacing around like a caged animal, looking at me with this expression that screamed, aren't you going to do something but I was doing something. I was planning exactly what came next cause tomorrow was Day 21 and she was going to try breaking her silence and pretending this episode never happened. Day 21 started exactly how I expected. She was going to walk into the kitchen with that carefully rehearsed casual attitude, ready to graciously end my punishment and pretend the past three weeks never happened. Except I wasn't there for her performance. I'd left at 5:30 that morning, two hours before she got up. My overnight bag was in the car along with every.

My sister sneered, he didn't deserve it anyway. I took my kid and left. The next morning, mom called, crying, please talk to the venue before they cancel your sister's wedding. I saw the cake missing from the dessert table, then found it in the trash, completely smashed. Becky was scrolling her phone with that smug smile. What happened? I asked, trying to stay calm. She didn't look up from her phone, just shrugged. He didn't deserve it anyway. My six year old was playing with friends, completely unaware his moment had been trashed. Relax, James. It's just cake, she said when I pressed her. It wasn't just cake. It was his excitement. Talking about his Dinosaur birthday for a month. Hours of decorations I set up alone because no one else helped. I grabbed my son and left. He asked why everyone went home early. I promised a new cake. Just us. No family called that night. Next morning, mom called, not about my son, her voice shaky with panic. James, please talk to the venue before they cancel Breckie's wedding. Stunned she was calling about Breckie's wedding 24 hours after ruining my son's birthday. Are you not gonna say anything about yesterday? Brecky can be harsh, but this is her big day. No drama with the venue. Something snapped. Every holiday, Brecky came first. Every photo, she got center stage. Every time I was told to let Things go. Mom explained the venue was canceling because Brecky hadn't paid. She wanted me to cover it. I hung up. Dad showed up, arms crossed. We need to talk about Brecky's wedding. I asked if he knew what happened. He drugged. Kids are resilient. What matters is your sister's wedding doesn't become a circus. My kid's birthday was just noise to him. You're good with people. You make more than brekkie. It's nothing to you. The family rule said out loud, James fixes

So on day 21, I made it permanent. 20 days of silence. That's what my wife decided I deserved after I suggested she help with household responsibilities instead of treating me like her personal butler. But here's the thing about playing the silent treatment card. Sometimes the other person decides they prefer the quiet. I finished a 12 hour shift and walked into what looked like a tornado hit our kitchen. She's piled high, take out containers scattered everywhere. And her on the couch scrolling through her phone. I made the apparently unforgivable mistake of saying, hey, think you could give me a hand cleaning up before dinner? The look she gave me could have frozen hell over. Excuse me, I work, too. I'm not your maid. I never said you were. I thought we could tackle this together since we both live here. That's when she stood up, grabbed her purse, and delivered the line that would define the next three weeks. Figure it out yourself. And don't expect me to talk to you until you learn some respect. The front door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. When she came back two hours later, I thought we'd have a normal conversation. I was wrong. She walked past me like I was invisible and went straight to the bedroom. Day two rolled around and still nothing. I tried the reasonable approach. If I came across wrong yesterday, we should Talk. She poured her coffee, walked past me, and left for work without acknowledging I existed. By day five, I realized what this was. This wasn't about dishes or respect. This was control. She decided freezing me out would make me grovel and apologize for something I shouldn't apologize for. Day 7 was when something clicked. I was eating a sandwich, watching her perform her silent tantrum routine, and I started laughing. Here was a grown woman who thought giving me the cold shoulder was going to break me down dead. It was showing me exactly who I'd married. By day 10, the house had gotten remarkably peaceful. No arguing about whose turn it was to take out trash. No passive aggressive comments about the dishwasher. No dramatic sighs when I wanted to watch sports. I was starting to see the upside. Day 15 brought reinforcements. Her sister called asking if everything was okay because my wife seemed stressed. Told her everything was fine. I was giving my wife the space she'd requested. When her sister tried to dig deeper, I said, she knows how to end this anytime she wants an adult conversation. But here's what she didn't realize during her tantrum. I was using this time to think about what my life had become and what I wanted it to be. Day 20 arrived with her pacing around like a caged animal, looking at me with this expression that screamed, aren't you going to do something? But I Was doing something. I was planning exactly what came next. Cause tomorrow was day 21 and she was going to try breaking her silence and pretending this episode never happened. Day 21 started exactly how I expected. She was going to walk into the kitchen with that carefully rehearsed casual attitude, ready to graciously end my punishment and pretend the past three weeks never happened. Except I wasn't there for her performance. I'd left at 5:30 that morning, two hours before she got up. My overnight bag was in the car along with every

You're going to regret this. Before storming out an hour later, I heard her on the phone, taking the early withdrawal penalty on her 4:01 k to help her brother. She never understand did why I hadn't helped. And so the same situation happened again two months later. I was reading the paper at breakfast when she walked in and slapped a medical Bill on top of my newspaper. My dad needs surgery. $8,000. I'm taking it from the emergency fund, and I'm not asking. She already had her laptop open, logging into our bank account. I reached over and closed the laptop. No, you're not. She opened it again immediately. Watch me. I closed it again, keeping my hand on top this time. She yanked the laptop away and threw it across the room. It hit the wall and the screen cracked. My dad can't walk without this surgery. I already destroyed my retirement for my brother because of your little power trip. You are helping this time. Interesting how it's our money when you need it, but my problem when I needed you. She screamed even louder. Your mom was already dead. There was nothing to do. My dad needs actual help, and I needed my wife to comfort me. Guess we don't all get what we need. She leaned across the table, her face inches from mine. If you don't help with this, we're done. I mean it. Your ultimatums aren't my problem either. She Stormed off in anger. But I guess she must have called her dad and told him the truth, because she returned 20 minutes later with a red face and puffy eyes. My dad said I'm in the wrong, she admitted, which surprised me. I've been horrible. I shouldn't have said those things about your mother. God, I actually told you it wasn't my problem. She started crying harder when you said those same words back to me. About my brother, about my dad. I finally got it. I'm sorry. Your family problems are my problems. That's what marriage means.

I was sitting on the edge of our bed, crying my absolute eyes out because I just got a call telling me that my mother had passed away in her sleep. My wife, Sonic, walked through the door, saw me crying, and instead of comforting me, she said, the kitchen sink is clogged again. I looked up at her, trying to process what I just heard. Sonic, I just found out my mom died. She's stood there in the doorway, arms crossed, and I'll never forget what came out of her mouth next. Okay, but that's not my problem. My problem right now is the kitchen sink, and I want it fixed. The words hung in the air between us like poison. 23 years, a whole life built together. And she was standing there telling me my mother's death wasn't her problem because the damn it was clogged. I sat there staring at her, waiting for her to realize what she just said. Maybe take it back. Show some sign she was human. Are you serious right now? I asked, my voice barely a whisper and still rough from all the crying. Do you even love me? She actually rolled her eyes. Oh, grow up, Dave. Your family problems aren't my problems. The sink needs to be fixed, and I have friends coming over in an hour. My family problems aren't her problems! That's what she had to say in response to my mom dying. I stood up, walked past her to the kitchen, and fixed the sink. It took me 10 minutes. Then I sat alone in our bedroom to plan my mother's funeral and realized the woman I'd married was a stranger. That night, I made a decision. If that's how she wanted our marriage to work, then that's exactly what she'd get. Three weeks after Mom's funeral, I was in the garage working on my car when Sonic burst through the door.

I agreed anyway, knowing I'd been the one keeping every friendship alive for nearly a decade. Look at this, Katie said, waving her phone in my face. It says women who maintain independent friendships report higher relationship satisfaction. 68% say it improved their marriage. I tried once more. How exactly does this work? Simple.

She said the scar made me look like a warrior goddess and asked if I'd model for her portfolio about resilience and beauty. I thought she was mocking me until she showed me the test shots on her camera, where somehow the scar caught the light and made me look powerful instead of broken. Within a month, those photos went viral on Instagram, with millions of women sharing them and calling be brave and beautiful. A modelling agency called saying they wanted to sign me specifically because my scar told a story that resonated with people tired of perfect faces. My first campaign was for a major makeup brand with a tagline beauty isn't perfect, and my scarred face was on billboards in Times Square. Every interview asked about the scar, and I told the truth about Jackson. And suddenly I was getting invited to speak at conferences about domestic violence. The modelling money let me start a foundation for women hitting abuse. I was on magazine covers and women would stop me crying, saying my story gave them courage to leave their own abusers. Jackson lost everything once my story went public and his company fired him for reputational damage. His mother called, begging me to stop ruining his life, but I wasn't doing anything except telling the truth when asked. Sophie, my assistant, forwarded me screenshots showing he was living In his car after being evicted and getting rejected from every job. Once they googled his name. His new girlfriend had left him when she found out what he did, and his friends disappeared once the news article started circulating. He'd gone from a successful marketing executive to unemployed.

Now he's back to ruin it. My husband Jackson, has been an alcoholic for years, and today he'd been drinking since noon. His boss had sent him home early for being hungover, and somehow that was my fault. When he came home, the first thing he did was hurl his pint glass at me. No greeting, no hug or kiss. Just glass shattering against my cheek and blood running down my face. I ran to the kitchen and pressed a dish towel to my face, all while he screamed that no one would ever want me now that I was damaged goods. The ER doctor said the cut would leave a permanent scar running from my left temple to the corner of my mouth and asked if I wanted to file a police report. I'd covered for Jackson for years, but knowing that my face was ruined was the last straw. I'd always wanted to be a model, even though Jackson has forbidden it. Now that dream was dead and I was done. I said yes, I wanted to file a report, while Jackson's mother called me 46 times to say I was overreacting and ruining her son's future over a little accident. Six weeks later, I was living in a women's shelter with a restraining order and a face that made strangers stare then quickly look away. The scar had healed into A curved line that looked like a crescent moon had been carved into my skin. I wore hoodies with the hood up even in summer, and avoided mirrors because Jackson's voice saying damaged goods played on repeat in my head. But slowly I started going to the support group meetings where other women had their own scars, both visible and hidden. The counselor kept telling us we were survivors, not victims, but I still flinched whenever someone looked at my face too long. Then a photographer

His voice cracked and he grabbed my shoulders hard enough to hurt. Two. I had a headache from studying. He actually stumbled backward and had to grab my desk to keep from falling. Oh, god, no, no, no! He was pacing now, running his hands through his hair so violently I thought he'd rip it out. And when did you take them? Like an hour ago. Dad, what's wrong? You're scaring me. He stopped dead and his face went even wider. I took one, too, 20 minutes ago. I thought they were Tylenol. He sat on my bed and put his head in his hands, and that's when my stomach dropped. Because dad never panics. Not even when our house almost burned down last year. We need to tell your mother. Oh, god, she's going to kill me. He looked at me with genuine fear in his eyes. You feel anything? Dizzy? Hot? Is your heart racing? I wasn't before, but now my heart was pounding from pure terror. Mom came running when dad yelled for her, and I've never seen someone's expression change so fast. Confused, to furious, to absolutely horrified in about two seconds. You left them where she could find them. She was screaming now, actually screaming? Are you insane? She rushed over, checking my pulse with shaking hands, looking at my pupils, feeling my forehead.

Mary had to be invited, too. She's changed, he insisted. She deserves a second chance. Has she apologized? I asked. You shouldn't pester her for an apology. Let bygones be bygones. I put my foot down. No apology, no invitation. Dad's ultimatum was swift. If Mary isn't invited, I won't attend either, and I won't walk you down the aisle. He tried to guilt me, saying their absence would cause gossip and reflect poorly on me. Instead of caving, I disinvited him completely. I asked my paternal grandfather to walk me down the aisle instead. Grandpa immediately agreed and expressed his disappointment in Dad's behavior. He'd always known about the favor and blame dad placed on me. My wedding day was beautiful. Grandpa walked me down the aisle with pride, and we celebrated with people who truly cared about my happiness. But the real shock came during the reception. Grandpa stood up and made an announcement. He was gifting me his vacation house as a wedding present. Out of my son and granddaughters, he said, you're the one who truly appreciates family and will cherish this place. Dad had always assumed he'd inherit everything as Grandpa's only child, including that vacation house. When dad found out about the wedding and the gift, he lost it completely. He called me screaming, saying he couldn't believe I'd gone through with it without him. What really sent him over the edge was losing the inheritance. He'd count It on now. Dad and Mary are furious, demanding I return the house to him and claiming it's his legal right as the heir. Mary's been calling me an opportunist who manipulated Grandpa's generosity. Dad's favoritism and ultimatums didn't just cost him his daughter's wedding. They cost him the inheritance he was counting on.

So I refused to back down and asked my grandpa to walk me down the aisle instead. My father has always blamed me for my mother's death during childbirth, while my older sister Mary became his golden child who could do no wrong. I spent my childhood doing every household chore, being constantly ignored, and carrying guilt for something completely beyond my control. The breaking point came during a Thanksgiving visit when my sister met my then boyfriend of two years. Mary flirted shamelessly with him all night, constantly touching his arm, leaning into his personal space, calling him gorgeous while putting me down by saying she never thought her ugly duckling sister would land someone like him. When I pulled her aside and asked her to stop, she laughed in my face and called me pathetically jealous. At night, I went to bed early, emotionally and physically exhausted by the blatant disrespect in my own family's home. My boyfriend said he'd come up soon, but never did. The next morning, I found him in Mary's bed, both half naked with two empty wine bottles and glasses scattered on the floor. Mary's reaction when I caught them? Zero apology. She had the audacity to tell me to get out of her room so she can get dressed, like I was invading her privacy. Then she spent weeks bragging to Our cousins. About stealing my man in one night. And claimed he told her she was way better in bed than me. Dad's response when I told him what happened. They're both adults. You should have been more careful about the kind of man you brought around, Mary. He obviously has loose character. That's on you for not seeing it. He actually blamed me for bringing a cheater around his precious daughter. As if.

This Saturday, we're hosting a charity basketball tournament. $5 to watch, 20 to play. All proceeds go to Mister Patel's treatment. Bring your friends. Let's pack the gym. No Pep rally, no posters. Just that message. And somehow it worked better than any hype machine. The buzz was instant. Saturday came, and the turnout was beyond anything we expected. Not only did our entire school show up, but students from three neighboring schools came too. Some brought their families. Local businesses chipped in with food, raffle prizes and donations. One restaurant matched every dollar raised. The gym was packed wall to wall. Teams played from morning until night. And nobody wanted to leave. By the end of the weekend, we had raised over $15,000. I'll never forget the look on Mister Patel's face when Marcus handed him the envelope. He didn't say anything at first, just hugged Marcus tight. Eyes full of tears. And Marcus just smiled and said, we're all behind you, sir. It felt like a perfect ending. But

That's when she completely broke down and confessed everything. She'd faked the entire kidnapping. Spent 18 straight hours in that library writing her history paper on post war propaganda during the Cold War. Survived on vending machine coffee and energy drinks. All because she couldn't face failing my class and losing her scholarship. The administration was furious. Suspended her immediately. Talked about pressing charges for filing false reports, wasting police resources. But I asked to see her paper first. Couldn't help my curiosity about what drove a kid to such extremes. What I read blew my mind. 47 pages of brilliant analysis connecting Cold War propaganda techniques to modern social media manipulation. Original research, primary sources. I'd never seen students use arguments so sophisticated. They belonged in graduate school. This girl understood desperation and manipulation better than most political science professors. She'd lived it for one terrifying night. I stared at that paper for hours. Technically, she missed the deadline. School policy was clear, but she demonstrated more understanding of historical context through her actions than most students showed in their writing. The irony was perfect. A paper about propaganda written during an act of propaganda. I gave her an A. Quietly, never announced it. She graduated with honors by half a point, kept her scholarship, never spoke about what happened again.

I teach A P. History at Jefferson High, and my final paper deadline was legendary for being brutal. No extensions, no excuses, no second chances. I'd failed seniors weeks before graduation before. Everyone knew this. This girl, Rebecca, had a 78% average and needed a solid A on the final to graduate with honours. Her scholarship depended on it. When the deadline hit, she wasn't there. Her paper wasn't submitted. Nothing. That morning, Rebecca's mom burst into Principal Wilson's office, sobbing hysterically. Her daughter never came home from tutoring last night. Phone was dead. Location tracker showed nothing for hours. Complete panic mode hit the school. Missing person's report filed within an hour. Police brought dogs. Local news vans started showing up. Teachers were crying in the break room, talking about how sweet Rebecca was. Everyone assumed the worst. Search parties formed, helicopters circled the area. Social media exploded with her picture. The whole town was looking for this girl. Her mom was on the news, begging for her safe return. Even I felt sick, thinking something terrible happened to one of my students. Twenty four hours passed. Nothing. Then suddenly, around six PM, Rebecca was found behind some dumpster at a gas station 20 miles away. She told police this wild story about being grabbed by some random guy who panicked and let her go. But things felt off immediately. Zero injuries on her body, no defensive wounds. Her phone records showed it never actually left the city limits. Most suspicious part was security footage from near her last known location.

My grandmother passed away last year and settling her estate turned into a nightmare thanks to one absolutely ridiculous Bill. She'd been in a nursing home for her final six months, and we thought we'd handled all the paperwork and payments. Then three months after her funeral, I got a Bill in the mail addressed to her estate for eight hundred forty seven dollars and fifty cents from Sunset Manor Care Facility. I figured it was probably some final medical charge we'd missed, so I called to sort it out. The billing department put me on hold for 20 minutes before a woman named Janet came on the line. She very matter of factly explained that the charge was for post residency room cleaning and restoration services. I was confused. What exactly does that mean? Janet cleared her throat and said, well, when residents pass away, we have to thoroughly sanitize and restore their rooms for the next occupant. It's quite an extensive process. I asked for an itemized breakdown, thinking maybe they'd had to replace furniture or something. What I received in the mail two days later made my blood boil. The Bill included charges like Spiritual Cleansing Ceremony, $200, Sage burning and Negative Energy Removal, $150, Medium consultation to ensure peaceful transition, $300 and blessed water room purification, $75. But the most outrageous charge was one hundred twenty two dollars and fifty cents for exorcism services to remove Lingering presence, I called back immediately and asked to speak to a manager. When I explained how offensive and fraudulent these charges were, the manager

Just one last game night with the family. We thought it was sweet. Like, of course grandma wants to go out playing cards. The day of the wake, we all showed up expecting the usual sad stuff. But when we walked in, there were these white envelopes taped everywhere with people's names on them. My cousin Jake got his first and opened it up.

My Aunt Linda got sent to the basement. Uncle Pete had to check under the garden gnome outside. My mom's riddle LED her to the attic, where she found this old photo album we'd never seen before.

My siblings and I always joked about how none of us looked anything like our dad. It was just a silly family joke and we all laughed about it. But one day, our youngest sister saw a DNA test kit on sale, and she suggested we finally settle the question of who was really dad's kid. We thought it was funny, so we agreed to do it just for fun. None of us had any doubts or suspicions because we were sure it would just be a laugh. I'm the oldest of four siblings, two boys and two girls. My youngest sister had always been the favourite, and our parents worked hard to give us everything we needed, even when money was tight. We all took the DNA test while laughing the whole time, making dumb bets and teasing each other. Then we sent off the samples and forgot about it for a few weeks until my phone buzzed with the results. I opened the email expecting something funny, maybe even a confirmation that we were all just being dramatic. But my smile disappeared right away. Out of the four of us, only our youngest sister was actually related to our dad. At first, I thought it had to be a mistake. There was no way this could be real. I stared at the screen for a full minute before I even moved. My hands were shaking as I called my siblings Into the room and showed them the results. My brother said it had to be wrong and suggested we take another test. No one argued. We all needed to believe it was a fluke. So we did. We went to a different place for testing and waited nervously, each day dragging longer than the last. That second test felt heavier, like we were waiting for a sentence. When the second results came back the same, we knew our lives had changed forever. We went to our mom, hoping for answer.

I'm out there grilling burgers in my regular jeans and a band T-shirt, trying to be friendly, asking if anyone wanted drinks or anything. That's when Amy started in on me. First it was about my hairline. Oh, Jake's going bald already, and he's only 24, she said while laughing with her friend Madison. I just stood there flipping burgers, pretending I didn't hear it, but my face was getting hot. Then she spotted my tattoo when I rolled up my sleeves. Yeah, his buddy Tyler gave him that masterpiece in his garage. Real professional work, right? The tattoo is pretty shitty, I'll admit that. But hearing her tear it apart in front of people who barely knew me was rough. When I grabbed a beer around 4 p m, she goes, better make it a light one. Jake's a total lightweight. He'll probably be passed out by 8:00. Her friends were eating this up, giggling like we were in middle school or something. The worst part came when one of her friends asked about my truck. Before I could even answer, Amy jumps in with, oh, that piece of junk? It barely runs. I keep telling him to get a real car, but you know how?

I'll be completely ready. Jennifer's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Oh, my god, thank you so much. I knew you'd come through for family. Mom started tearing up. You're such a good sister, Laura. I gave them my old address with a straight face. You know, the completely empty apartment I'd already vacated, the one with the bright for rent sign posted in the front window.

I ordered pizza, unpacked my last moving box, and watch Netflix without any guilt or interruptions.

She knocked on the door for 10 solid minutes before my former landlord, Mister Peterson, came out. Can I help you with something? He asked. Lately, I'm looking for Laura Mitchell, she said, balancing four year old Sophie on her hip. While Emma and Jake ran circles around the parking lot screaming, oh, she moved out two weeks ago. Nice girl. This unit is available if you're interested in renting it.

The month before that, she left them with our 80 year old neighbor, Missus Chen, while she went clubbing until 3:00am. Two months ago, she dumped them on me for a girls weekend that turned into five days. I nodded and kept eating my ribs and calm. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. The thing is, Jennifer finally looked up from her phone, eyes sparkling with greed. David's got serious money. Like country club money. I already Told him I don't have kids yet. Just need a few months to ease him into the idea of family life. And you'll somehow manage Emma J. And Sophie during the day while you're working full time? Mom asked me directly. Like I wasn't even there to speak for myself. Oh, I figured Laura could find a babysitter. Jennifer shrugged casually. I'll be pretty tight on cash with David moving in. His place is expensive to maintain, so I'd be paying for full time childcare for kids that aren't.

My brother Danny and I used to be super close growing up. We'd spend hours playing video games in his basement room that smelled like Doritos and axe body spray. But everything changed when he started dating Mia about three years ago. At first I thought she was cool. She was studying accounting at the community college and worked part time at this little coffee shop downtown. She always wore these beat up converse sneakers and would bring Danny homemade cookies in old Tupperware containers. Nothing fancy about her at all. But Danny started getting weird ideas in his head. He'd complain to me about how Mia would suggest they go out to dinner sometimes, or how she mentioned wanting to move out of her tiny studio apartment that had a leaky ceiling. He started keeping track of every time she'd let him pay for things, writing it down in this little notebook like he was building a case against her. The breaking point came last summer when Mia got accepted into a four year university about two hours away. She was so

I figure, okay, we're probably about to eat soon, to be clear, I asked this so politely, like peak non threatening tone. I walk up to Tessa and go, hey, do you know what time dinner is? Not make me dinner, not I'm starving and your house smells like depression. Just a simple question. Civilized, friendly. She freezes, looks at me like I just asked her to twerk on me and to solve world hunger with two spaghetti noodles and a paperclip. Then she says, and I quote, why do you always assume I know things? I blink. What? She's pacing now. Pacing in her socks, clutching a throw pillow, like she's about to monologue about betrayal in a Netflix original. I say, sorry, I just meant, like, are we ordering food? Cooking? Is someone bringing something? Like, just curious. She goes, yeah, well, maybe next time ask the ceiling, because clearly I'm just the girl who always knows stuff. Ma'am, I asked what time the nuggets arrived.

Everyone on voice chat just went oh! And we were typing everything that was happening to the enemy team.

His friend never made a move because she was into him instead, the guy was deep into his story when she walked in, stunning in a little black dress and high heels. They greeted each other with a kiss and took tequila shots together, the banter quickly heating up. Out of nowhere, he whistles at me like I'm a dog and says, Yo man, more shots. Disappointed, I pour them and let him know I'm not a dog. He brushes it off, saying, just keep an eye out, we're gonna get lit. As the night goes on, he gets louder, laughing at his own jokes and talking over the girl. Then he announces he needs to pee on a rock and stumbles to the back. The girl looks mortified, texting furiously. He returns with another guy, not fully drunk but well on his way, and makes an offhand comment before stumbling outside. His friend follows, leaving the girl alone. Five minutes later, the friend returns, says he put Bob in an Uber, and takes the girl to dinner. But thirty minutes later, Bob walks back in sober, apologizes for whistling, and buys us a drink. He admits he played the fool on purpose so his friend could save the day. He's better for her, he said She's not my type. I was both touched and impressed. Fathers. What moment made your life fall apart? I knew something was wrong when my son stopped showing me his artwork. Every day after school, he used to run to me with his drawings, proud of each messy masterpiece. Then suddenly, nothing. At first, I thought maybe he'd lost interest in art. But one day, I was cleaning his room and found them. Dozens of drawings stuffed under his bed. All of them were of the same thing. A little boy with two dads. One cross.

My fiance said, thinking I'd raise another man's child. But she. I'm a 28 year old union electrician making decent money. I've been with Britney for three years. When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me. Because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. She wasn't excited. More like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped. Plus her health insurance. Nearly $8,000 so far. Plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer, Derek, from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decided to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him. Damien's got great insurance and steady money, but girl, you're really settling. Derek can't provide what this baby need. Britney replied, Damien can. My blood went cold. I Guess Damien's okay, Ashley continued, but you deserve better than some electrician who thinks Applebee's is fine dining. Britney laughed. I care about him enough. And honestly, he's so desperate to play hero that he'll never question anything. He just nods and pays for whatever I want. For 15 minutes, I stood frozen, listening to them plan my future like I was an ATM with legs. How she'd keep seeing Derek after we got married. How Derek didn't even know the baby was his. How they'd already coached Ashley on what to say if I got suspicious. Just when I came home later, she was acting completely normal, showing me baby monitors, talking about honeymoon plans, asking if I was excited about becoming a daddy. I needed evidence. Started recording conversations, since our state allows one party consent. When she left her phone unlocked during a shower, I found months of messages between her and Derek, planning their future together, discussing how they'd manage things after my wedding. She literally called me the bank in one message. But here's the kicker. She'd been lying to Derek, too. She told him she was on the pill and the pregnancy was an accident. This woman was playing everyone. I got a prenatal paternity test through my doctor. The result? Zero percent chance I'm the father. Last night, I took her to Romano's, where we had our first date. She thought I was planning some romantic surprise. Britt, I need to ask you Something straight up. Is there anything about this pregnancy you haven't told me? Pure panic flashed in her eyes before she slipped into innocent girl mode. What do you mean? Babe, I know about Derek. I have the paternity test results. I know the baby isn't mine. She stared at me. Then the fake tears started. Some sob story about it being just. Just one mistake when we were fighting about money. I've seen the messages, I said. I heard you talking to Ashley. The mask came completely off. The crying stopped, placed by a cold look I'd never seen. You went through my phone. You recorded me without permission. You were planning fraud and you're worried about privacy? Then she said the line that will haunt me forever. Even if the baby isn't biologically yours, you're still going to be his father. Like it or not. We're getting married in two months. I'm not letting you ruin our family over some stupid technicality. A tech technicality. She called paternity fraud a technicality. There's not going to be a wedding, Brittany. She lost it screaming in the restaurant about how I was abandoning my responsibility. Other customers stared. The manager came over. You think you're so smart, she hissed. Good. Good luck finding someone else who will put up with your boring ass. Just a blue collar worker with a truck payment. I walked out while she was still screaming, drove straight to the wedding venue and canceled everything. Lost The 2,500 dollar deposit. But it felt like the best money I'd ever spent.

My son loves gaming, and he'd saved up $2,000 from his summer job to build his first gaming PC. I took him to this fancy computer store, mostly for moral support. He'd done months of research and knew exactly what parts he needed. Sales guy took one look at my son's wheelchair and started talking to me instead. Sir, maybe we should look at pre built systems. They're much simpler. My son pulled out his carefully organized parts list, but the guy wouldn't even look at it. These high end components are very complicated, he said, still ignoring my son. Maybe something more basic would be better suited for his situation. My son, who'd been building computers in his head since he was 12, finally had enough. My situation? You mean the fact that I can code in three languages and run my school's tech club? Or that I've built five computers for my friends already? The manager overheard and came over, apologizing profuse, but my son was already Wheeling toward the door. Dad, let's go to Micro Center. I heard they actually hire people who know what they're talking about. Three hours later, my son had all his parts from Micro Center, where the staff treated him like the expert he was.

I teach high school Spanish, and last semester a student named Tyler didn't show up for his oral presentation. Instead, he sent an email with a video attachment claiming he was stuck in Mexico after a family emergency. The video showed him stranded at a Mexican beach, apologizing in Spanish for missing class. Behind him were palm tree, crystal blue water, and a sign that said ply a Cancun. It was actually pretty impressive. He'd even thrown some Mexican coins on the table next to him to sell the story. But there was one problem. I could see his bedroom poster reflected in his sunglasses. Instead of calling him out, I replied with my own video, speaking entirely in Spanish, of course. I congratulated him on finding such a nice beach and mentioned how amazing it was that he'd managed to find the only Cancun beach with a target shopping cart in the background, which was visible in the reflection of his window. I ended by assigning him an extra credit project, a presentation on the difference between Mexican beach is and the local lake where he'd actually filmed the video. He showed up to class the next day with a full Powerpoint comparing them. Now he helps run the Spanish clubs weekly movie nights, where we sometimes watch his travel video for laughs. When he finished, he closed the panel, wiped his hands on his jeans, And said should run fine now. The bearings might need replacing next year, though. That night, my brother in law called to invite us to his son's basketball championship. He couldn't resist adding, bring Avery, too. Maybe he'll finally get interested in something besides books. I smiled into the phone. Actually, Avery's busy rebuilding our washing machine.

Moments from decades ago preserved while yesterday vanished. This is you at the beach. You. We're scared of the waves. But I held your hand. Bradley wasn't even looking. He was texting on his phone.

Pas de c√¢lins, pas de chaleur, juste 1 signe de reconnaissance, comme si j'√©tais 1 √©trang√®re qu'il n'√©tait pas ravie de recevoir. Et puis il y avait Kyle, mon fr√®re, l'enfant ch√©ri.

Il me connaissait √† peine, √† part pour discuter de nos projets du weekend. J'ai d√©cid√© de lui envoyer le m√™me message, juste pour voir ce qui se passerait. Ce type a tout laiss√© tomber, il m'a appel√© imm√©diatement. Il a dit qu'il quittait l'appartement de sa petite amie √† ce moment-l√† pour venir me chercher. Il s'est pr√©sent√© √† ma porte 20minutes plus tard avec des encas et 1 chargeur de t√©l√©phone, me demandant dans quel h√¥pital j'avais besoin et si j'avais besoin d'autres choses. Je me suis senti tellement mal que j'ai failli tout avouer sur le champ. Au lieu de cela, je lui ai dit que ma m√®re allait bien, que ce n'√©tait qu'une fausse alerte. Il √©tait vraiment soulag√© et m'a dit qu'il serait ravi d'aider √† tout moment. Pendant ce temps, mes soi-disant meilleurs amis continuaient de poster des TikTok et des stories Snapchat comme si de rien n'√©tait. Le lendemain, dans notre groupe de discussion, tout le monde a demand√© comment allait ma m√®re. J'ai dit qu'elle allait bien. Merci pour tout le soutien. Le sarcasme l'aura compl√®tement d√©pass√©. Emma a m√™me eu le culot de dire, c'est √Ä ceux que servent les amis avec 1 emoji c≈ìur. J'ai commenc√© √† me r√©tracter apr√®s √ßa, j'ai arr√™t√© d'engager la conversation, arr√™t√© de sugg√©rer des plans. Devinez ce qui s'est pass√© ? Rien. Ils n'ont litt√©ralement pas remarqu√© mon absence. 3 semaines se sont √©coul√©es avant que quelqu'un ne m'envoie 1 message direct, et c'√©tait uniquement parce que Tyler avait besoin de quelqu'un pour le remplacer √† la pizzeria o√π nous travaillons tous les 2. Le weekend dernier, c'√©tait le point de rupture. J'ai vu sur Instagram qu'ils √©taient tous all√©s √† cet escape game dont on parlait depuis des mois, le m√™me endroit que j'avais sugg√©r√© plusieurs fois et qui avait √©t√© refus√©. Ils √©taient c'√©tait l√†, tous les 6, √† poster des stories avec des l√©gendes comme objectifs d'√©quipe et meilleurs amis pour la vie. Alors j'ai pris ma d√©cision. J'ai cr√©√© 1 nouveau groupe de discussion appel√© vrais amis, avec Alex et 2 autres personnes qui avaient vraiment montr√© qu'elle se souciait de moi. J'ai √©crit 1 article sur le fait de se d√©barrasser des fausses amiti√©s et de trouver des personnes.

Le Jour J, je suis assise seule √† 1 table √† 19h. Les annulations se sont succ√©d√©es. Emma avait 1 probl√®me de famille, Tyler avait oubli√© qu'il devait travailler.

They asked me to show the inside of my hoodie pocket. I pull it out empty. Not even a crouton. Still, Amber's not convinced. She says, it's always the quiet ones. You're probably the type to steal one at a time so no one notices. What am I, a raccoon? At this point, I mentally accepted that I'm about to be banished over egg based appetizers I've never touched. That's when it happens. A loud clatter comes from under the coffee table. Everyone turns and out walks a cat, a chunky, smug looking orange tabby, dragging a crushed mini quiche in its mouth like it just completed a mission. Amber gasps. Pickles! The cat! Pickles hops onto the counter, knocking over a napkin with three more stolen quiches underneath. Silence. Stunned silence. Amber rushes over and inspects the evidence. Then, like a true crime detective, realizing her entire theory just fell apart, she spins around to me and says, okay, but you could have train the cat. What? I nearly burst out laughing. So now I'm a criminal mastermind with a carb loving feline accomplice? Derek actually nods. Honestly, that'd be kind of impressive. At this point, even pickles looks offended. He knocks over a wine glass and saunters out of the room like he's done his part. Eventually, Amber gives a half apology. Okay, fine. Maybe it wasn't you. But just so you know, silence is suspicious. Cool. Glad to know being an introvert is now A federal offense. The party fizzled out shortly after. I left early with my soda and no keishes and pickles. He followed me to the door and winked. I swear on my life that cat wink

You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd cheered. I just left. The next morning, she realized she'd lost more than just me. My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a setup. She lied to me and broken the one promise I'd made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because it's. Maya. And Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance. And I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back. I told hold her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile. Eric will do it. He's strong. Just like that, he's crouching down and she's climbing onto his shoulders. The crowd around us, a bunch of drunk kids, started cheering. She was loving it, playing to them, living her main character moment. And she looked down at me. Since Eric's a few inches taller, she was really looking down. She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same mug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded. It was this cold, hard clarity hitting me like a freight train. This was it. The final line. I didn't get angry, I didn't yell. I just.

The crowd parted like they could feel the energy coming off me. I didn't look back once I walked out of that venue into the cool night air and felt nothing but relief. The taxi ride home was the best 45 minutes I had in months. My head was completely clear for the first time in ages. I got I back to my apartment, my name on the lease, my furniture, and shot the deadbolt. Then I packed every single thing she owned, used her expensive luggage, did it properly. By midnight, it was like she'd never lived there. Around 2:00am, I heard them stumbling and laughing outside. Her key scraped the lock, then hit the deadbolt. Banging started. Leo let me in. The door stuck. I didn't move. Just watch them on the doorbell camera. Eric trying to shoulder the door like some tough guy and bouncing off like an idiot. Finally, she called my phone. Leo, what's wrong with the door? Nothing's wrong with it. It's locked. I'll unlock it. No! Silence! What do you mean, no? I mean you don't live here anymore, Maya. You found someone way better, so you can go live with him. Your bags are packed. Have a nice life. I could hear Eric yelling in The background. She started sputtering about how I was breaking up with her over a joke. You broke up with us? When you lied to my face and brought him to the concert, I said the rest was just you confirming my decision in front of a few thousand people. I hung up and blocked both numbers. Eventually, they gave up and left. Watch them go on the camera dragging her luggage down the hallway. The next morning, I moved everything to the building's hallway and sent an anonymous text. Your things are in the hall. Six months later, I haven't heard from her since. Their relationship imploded within weeks. their whole dynamic was based on him being the exciting alternative to me. Once I was gone, they had nothing to rebel against. Maya had to move back with her parents without me funding her lifestyle. Eric became the local joke after getting knocked out defending his girl. I saw her recently working as a waitress. When I was on a date, she turned white and immediately left her shift.

Get out before I drag your black ass out, he said, while already opening my door. And keep your hands where I can see them, or things will get real bad real fast. Got out slowly, because I've seen enough videos to know how this goes with cops like him. He immediately started destroying my car like a wild animal looking for food. You people are all the same, he said, while throwing my stuff everywhere, acting innocent. But I know you're dealing or stealing. He actually pulled out a knife and started cutting my seats open looking for hidden substances. Your kind is why I became a cop, to protect real Americans from animals like you. What this racist trash didn't know was that I was actually a federal agent. I've been working undercover for six months investigating him. Fifteen black families had filed complaints saying Owens planted evidence to arrest innocent people. One kid jumped off a bridge after Owens framed him and he lost his full ride to college. Another family became homeless fighting fake charges that Owens laughed about. In the station, I had cameras in my earring, my necklace, and even my shoes, recording everything. The investigation team was watching from A van two blocks away. He was about to find out that his most famous arrest would be the one that destroyed him. Owens grabbed his radio and called for backup. I've got a violent black female. She is acting aggressive and probably armed. I literally hadn't moved or said anything. Three cop cars came flying in with sirens, screaming like I was holding hostages or something. His partner Garrett jumped out already pointing his gun at my face and yelling, is this the substance dealer? They always made stuff up like this. Yeah, she matches the description perfectly. Owens lied. Dark

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed with in a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my Wedding for five years. He was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and

So here's what's happening. I'll do all the talking during the presentation because I actually understand the nuances. So I had to deal with this pretentious douchebag for the next week. Great. He pulled out his phone and started scrolling. Your only job is to write down everything I say for the slides. Every single thing. You are too much of an idiot to think. Anyway, now here's the thing. This dumb kid had a habit of pausing his sentences to say nasty things about others. Like he just started dictating about the Cold War, but then paused to say, wait, hold on. Is that Jessica? Damn, she looks incredible today. Look at those tight jeans. I got a brilliant idea. Open Powerpoint and started typing, figuring I should do exactly what he says. So I transcribed everything he said, even that line about Jessica. In fact, for the next week, Marcus would corner me in the library and dictate while doing literally everything else as I transcribed it all into perfectly formatted slides. Monday session. The Marshall Plan represented. Damn, did you see Brian's outfit today? Looks like a highlighter threw up on him. Tuesday, I swear, Samantha Keeps staring at me. She's obviously down bad for me.

My dad died believing I was in federal prison. That's what my stepmother Veronica told him during his final week in hospice care. She had convinced the hospice staff I was dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to visit. I found out because a nurse broke protocol and called me after dad died. She said Veronica had been telling him for weeks that I was in prison for fraud and couldn't come see him. The truth was I lived 20 minutes away and had been calling the hospice daily begging to see. Two weeks before he entered hospice, while he was still confused from pain medications, Veronica got him to sign a new will. Everything went to her. The house, his plumbing business, 400,000 in savings. All of it. At the will reading, the lawyer said, everything goes to my wife, Veronica. My son gets nothing because he betrayed my trust. I tried to fight it, but my lawyer said without proof of coercion, I had no case. Cost me 5,000 just to hear that. Within a month, Veronica sold dad's plumbing business for cash. While I was sleeping in my car, she posted photos from Miami with her trainer. While I work double shifts at a warehouse. She bought a seventy thousand dollar Mercedes. While I saved every penny. For three years, she was burning through dad's money on failed boutiques and younger boyfriends. I watched It all on social media. The shopping sprees, the ages, the parties. She went through 100,000 in the first year alone. Meanwhile, I bought my first condemned property for 30,000 using a hard money loan. Spent six months fixing it myself after my warehouse shifts. Kept it for 60. Used the profit to buy two more, started renting them. Year 5, she was selling dad's house to cover debts. Year 7, her latest boyfriend cleaned out her accounts and disappeared. Year 8, she had to take a retail job. By year 10, I own 22 rental properties, bringing in 300,000 annually. She was folding clothes at minimum wage. I built everything from nothing, while she destroyed everything.

Look, I love my family, but hosting Thanksgiving for five years straight has turned me into their personal servant. Last year was when I finally snapped. My sister Jen showed up three days early with two suitcases like she was moving in. She immediately claimed my couch, turned on Netflix, and announced she was on vacation mode. My brother Rick brought his twin boys, who are 7 and treat my house like it's Chuck E. Cheese. The first morning, I woke up to find chocolate fingerprints on my white walls and goldfish crackers ground into my carpet. When I asked Rick to clean it up, he just shrugged and said, kids will be kids. Then my mom arrived with a list of everything wrong with my house. The guest towels weren't fluffy enough, the dining room needed better lighting. She even made me drive to three different stores to find the exact cranberry sauce she wanted. But the absolute worst part was the Thanksgiving night. After I spent eight hours cooking a Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole, and two pies, everyone ate and immediately scattered to the living room. I'm talking dirty plates everywhere, gravy spilled on my good tablecloth, and Turkey bones just left sitting there. My husband Jake and I cleaned for three hours while everyone else watched football and complained that the TV was too quiet. Next morning, Rick's Kids ate the entire leftover pie I was saving for Jake's parents who were coming that weekend. When I got upset, Jen rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic over dessert. That's when I lost it. I told everyone they needed to leave by noon, that I was done hosting. Fast Forward to this year in September. I told them I needed a break and suggested we rotate hosting or go to a restaurant. Mom immediately said my house was the most comfortable and I was being selfish. Jen said her apartment was

When I was 15, my mom started saying this one phrase that drove me absolutely crazy. You'll understand when I'm gone. At first she'd say it like a joke when I rolled my eyes at her folding my clothes the way I hated. Or when she'd remind me to eat breakfast for the third time. You'll understand when I'm gone. She'd laugh, ruffling my hair. But then it got weird. She started saying it more seriously when she had to work late again and missed my school play. When she forgot to pick me up from band practice and I had to walk home in the rain. When I'd wake up and find another sticky note on my pillow instead of her saying goodnight in person, you'll understand when I'm gone. I hated that stupid phrase so much. It felt like she was guilt tripping me like some weird threat. Every time she said it, I'd get this angry knot in my stomach. One night after she missed my birthday dinner because of another double shift, I finally snapped. She left me a note with $20 for pizza and that same damn phrase.

Six months ago, my parents nearly lost their lakefront house because my golden child sister Brooke, racked up massive debts on their credit cards. Who did they call? Me. I liquidated everything. My retirement and my investment portfolio, my rental property. $520,000 gone in one wire transfer to save the house I grew up in. You're our hero, Vanessa. We'll pay you back. Now Brooke wants to host her law firm partners for Thanksgiving in the house I saved. And apparently, my presence would be awkward for her career advancement. The follow up text made it worse. Brooks really blossomed into such a sophisticated woman. You understand, right? Brooke? The same sister who called me jealous when I asked about the $15,000 she borrowed last year. The same one who maxed out Mom's credit cards on networking trips to Cabo. But they didn't know about the paperwork my lawyer made them sign when they were desperate. The loan agreement with very specific terms they'd forgotten about. I opened my laptop and typed one word in the family chat. Okay. Then I called my attorney, Steven. Start the proceedings. They have 30 days. The next morning, I woke up to 17 missed calls. Brooks hysterical voicemail was The Vanessa? What is this? Eviction notice? This is my Thanksgiving dinner. I already sent invitations. Mom's text came next. Sweetie, surely we can work this out. Brooks worked so hard planning this event. Hard work? That's rich coming from someone who spent the last six months shopping with money she didn't earn.

Two officers arrived within minutes with paperwork for an emergency hold that he prepared in advance. Brain surgery patients often develop paranoia about their caregivers, he told them, while I tried to explain he'd broken into our house. The officers looked between us, confused. Doctor Eric pulled up medical files on his tablet, showing notes about Haley's increasing hostility toward necessary care. Haley was sobbing, and I moved toward her, but Doctor Eric stepped between us, holding a syringe, saying, this will calm the delusion, sweetheart. Something snapped in me, and I grabbed the baseball bat I kept under our bed with hands that wouldn't stop trembling. Get out of my house! I screamed while my heart slammed against my ribs. The officers put their hands on their weapons, but I, at the bat, raised until everyone backed into the hallway. Doctor Eric stood on our porch after they left and said in this dead voice, I own that brain. I carved every pathway she thinks through. Without me, she's just tissue dying in her. I held Haley on the bathroom floor until sunrise while she shook and asked if she was going to die without him. They revoked Doctor Eric's license after we proved he'd been drugging Haley to create symptoms that required his treatment. But the damage was done. We moved across the country using money I borrowed from my brother and Haley still won't let new doctors examine her. She takes aspirin for headaches that never stopped, and I catch her touching her scar when she thinks I'm not looking. Last month, a medical journal arrived with an article about her case published under a pseudonym. I burned it before she could see, but we both know who wrote it.

I found forms for research studies with my signature that I'd never signed, and when I confronted him, he laughed and said I must have forgotten in the stress of her recovery. The monthly MRIs he insisted on made Haley claustrophobic, but he said skipping even one could mean missing something fatal. I started going to appointments with her after finding him in her office at lunch, checking her pupils because the afternoon light was optimal. My jaw would clench when he'd show other doctors videos of her walking without our permission, but speaking up felt like spitting on a miracle. The breaking point was when he told Haley she couldn't switch to a local neurologist for follow UPS because no one else could understand what he'd done inside her skull. That night, I told her we needed to get away from him, but she was terrified he might be right. Everything exploded the night I woke to find our bedroom door open and Doctor Eric standing over Haley with a portable MRI scanner. My body went cold as he slid the device over her sleeping head while whispering measurements into a recorder. When I shouted his name, my voice cracked, and he looked at me perfectly calm, saying, monthly scans aren't showing the micro changes in tissue density. Haley jolted awake screaming, and I reached for her, but froze when I saw the IV port taped to her arm. When did you put that in Her? I asked, and my hands started shaking as he explained he'd been injecting contrast dye during her sleep for better imaging. He said it like I should thank him for his dedication. I grabbed my phone to call 9 1 1, but he'd already called.

I just pushed my chair back, stood up, and walked out without a word. The silence that followed me was more damning than any screaming match could have. Then I spent that night sorting through three years of relationship red flags. The comments I'd brushed off. How she talked about expensive weddings, the digs about my sensible car. Her statement wasn't a slip up. It was her entire philosophy about me laid bare. The next morning brought 17 missed calls. And a flood of texts started. Angry, are you seriously giving me the silent treatment? Then confused, are you okay? Finally, panicked, please call me. I'm so sorry. It was a compliment. But her first reaction wasn't remorse. It was annoyance that her joke hadn't landed. The apology only came when she realized I was actually done. Within hours, Susan was spinning the story in our group chat, painting herself.

The conversation flowed like old times. Everyone kept making jokes about Emily and me sitting next to each other, how natural we look together. My dad actually winked at me. I felt the ring box in my pocket heavier than ever. I was supposed to call Haley, tell her dinner was running late, that I'd pick her up at nine instead of 8. That's when Emily stood up, wine glass in hand. Actually, everyone, Victor and I have something to tell you, she announced, grabbing my hand before I could stop her. My heart stopped. Emily, don't! We're finally together, she declared, squeezing my fingers. After all these years, we're giving love a real shot. The room exploded. My mom actually screamed with joy. Her parents started crying happy tears. Everyone was hugging, toasting, talking about how they always knew this would happen. I sat there, frozen as chaos erupted around me. My phone buzzed. Text from Haley. Just parked outside. Can't wait to see you. Love you. My blood turned to ice. I looked at the front door, then at Emily beaming beside me, then at our family celebrating a relationship that didn't exist. The doorbell rang. I'll get it, my mom saying, practically floating to the door. I heard her voice through the wood. Haley, sweetheart! Perfect timing. We have the most wonderful news! Emily squeezed my hand tighter, whispering, just go with it, Victor. This Is our moment. The front door opened. I could hear my mom's excited babbling. Your sister and Victor are finally together. Isn't it perfect? We're so happy. Footsteps approached the dining room. My palms were sweating. The ring box felt like it was burning a hole in my pocket. Haley appeared in the doorway, a confused smile on her face. She looked beautiful in her sundress, the yellow one I told her I loved. Her eyes found mine across the room, and I saw. The exact moment she processed what was happening, the smile died on her lips. Haley! Emily jumped up and hugged her sister. Isn't this amazing? Victor and I are finally giving it a shot. Haley

I was grilling burgers when will grab the mic for his speech. Everyone thought he was drunk again. Then he pointed at my daughter Emily and said, funny how she looks exactly like me. Not her dad. The backyard went silent. My wife Mara's face went white. What did you just say? I asked, but I already knew. Will laughed. Come on, Jackson. Eighteen years of playing house. Emily's mine. I felt my knees buckle. Emily was staring between us, confused. Dad, what's he talking about? Mara was shaking her head frantically. Will, stop! You're drunk. DNA test slurred. Pulling out his phone. Got it done last month. 99.9% match. The burger spatula fell from my hands. 18 years. Every birthday, every scraped knee, every bedtime story. All built on a lie. You're lying! Emily screamed at will, but her voice cracked like she wasn't sure. My brother. My own brother shrugged. So sorry, man. Had to come out sometime. I looked at my wife, the woman I'd loved for 20 years. Is it true she couldn't meet my eyes? That was answer enough. Emily ran inside, crying. Half the part already followed her. The other half just stared at me like I was some tragic zoo animal. Will walked over and patted my shoulder. No hard feelings, right? I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better. Than any therapy ever could. Will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all stolen from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle, I continued. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born, she whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back out.

Figured you could afford it yourself. Or maybe take a train to a public park instead. Loser. What kind of son refuses to help his own family? The kind whose family thinks it's funny to abandon him at an airport, I replied and hung up. They cut their vacation short and showed up at my apartment. Dad threw a suitcase down, face red with rage. How dare you cancel everything? My golf membership, your mother salon, your brother's tuition. I leaned back in my chair. Thought it was funny to leave me stranded at the airport. Well, I'm just returning the favor. We are your family. Dad slammed my coffee table. We raised you. You owe us. I stood up, looking him in the eye. No, I don't. You treated me like a walking ATM and humiliated me. Congratulations. Now you're on your own. Mom started crying. Those crocodile tears. It was just a joke, sweetheart. And this is just a lesson, I replied, grabbing my keys. Good luck figuring things out, losers. Over the next months, reality hit hard. Parents bank account hit zero. They downsized to a smaller house. Dad got a job at a sporting goods store. Mom switched to a budget salon and picked up extra. Alex transferred to community college and got a barista job. They tried guilt trips, apologies, threats. None worked. My health improved immediately. Blood pressure down, better sleep, no headaches. I got promoted, started dating someone who appreciates Me for who I am, not what I provide. I finally took that Hawaii vacation solo. The helicopter tour I'd originally booked for the family was incredible. The pilot asked if I was sad seeing the islands alone. I just smiled. Not at all. For the first time in years, I'm exactly where I want to be. That airport prank was actually a gift. It showed me exactly how they saw me. Not as a son or brother, but as a resource to exploit and mock. Sometimes the healthiest thing you can do is step back and say enough. Real family doesn't treat you like

Mom calls saying my sister told her about the soul thing and maybe I should see a real therapist. I tell her I'm fine at work. My coworker pulls me aside because she googled Celestial Twins and that's not a real thing. Western Google wouldn't understand. I tell her the group chat is blowing up with people sharing psychology articles about shared delusions. My ex texts asking why three different people are asking him about his soul chart. I text back explaining what I told the others that we were Celestial Twins. He responds that I'm a genius because his roommate just asked if he needs cult de programming. However, they're not giving up. At coffee with my best friend, she brings her therapist sister as backup. The sister starts gentle, saying sometimes breakups can cause psychological breaks. It's not a break, we just can't risk the black hole. I explained simply. She insists there's no such thing as spiritual black holes, but I tell her that's exactly what someone who hasn't seen the charts would say. My best friend tries asking if I could date other people only if they're born at least 72 hours apart from my birth time. I explain that's insane. She says that's cosmic safety. I correct her. Game night rolls around again and everyone's there. My roommate announces she actually called the astrologer I mentioned. Everyone stares at her. She says she's never heard of Celestial Twins. She says triumphantly. I shake My head saying, that wasn't our astrologer. Ours doesn't advertise. She only takes clients through spiritual referral. Spiritual referral? She asks. Your Spirit Guide has to recommend you. I explain. My cousin's girlfriend stands up, shouting, this is crazy, and we're both in a cult! It's not a cult, it's just advanced astrology, I say calmly. But then my best friend suddenly shouts for me to stop. Just stop! This is insane! Just tell us the real reason, she begs. I look at my roommate, then at everyone else. Their faces are red, panicked, desperate for the truth. I start laughing, can't stop laughing. We broke up because we realized we're better as friends. I finally say. But the Celestial Twins!

So I'm at brunch, and my best friend starts in again, asking about my ex. Okay, but what really happened between you two? You were together for three years. My roommate jumps in, too, asking if someone cheated. No, nobody cheated. I told them. Then what? You can't just say it didn't work out. Every single hangout becomes the same interrogation. Later, my coworker corners me at work asking if we had some big public because that's what she heard from someone who heard from someone else. My sister calls me because mom thinks I'm hiding something traumatic and she's worried about me. Then my ex text me saying my friend won't get off my ass, asking if I'm okay.

He doesn't have any addictions. Come on, nobody just breaks up. There's always a real reason. She's as my best friend, nods and adds that they're just trying to help me process everything. My roommate says we need to know whose side we're on. There are no sides, though. There are always sides, she insists. I look around the room, and everyone is staring at me, waiting like vultures for their piece of gossip. That's when I decide if they want the Truth so badly, I'll give them exactly what they deserve. I put down my drink and stand up. You know what? You're right. There is a real reason everyone literally leans forward in their seats. We both got really into astrology during lockdown. Like, really into it. My best friend nods slowly, waiting for more. And we discovered we have the same exact birth time, down to the minute. Same hospital, too. The room goes completely silent. The astrologer we consulted said we're celestial twins. Our souls are literally the same soul, split in half. My cousin's girlfriend says, what? But I keep going. Dating each other would be like dating ourselves cosmically. The astrologer said if we stayed together, we'd create a black hole in the spiritual realm. My roommate's mouth is hanging open. A black hole? She manages to say, in the spiritual realm. Yeah, she showed us.

I'm deaf and lived my whole life thinking my apartment was this peaceful, quiet space. Boy, was I wrong. I'm 24 and got my own place about two years ago. Small, one bedroom, nothing fancy, but it was mine. I loved how calm everything felt. My cat pepper and I had our routines down. I'd make tea every morning, watch Netflix with subtitles, do my thing. But here's the weird part. I could never sleep through the night like ever. I'd fall asleep fine around 11, then wake up at 2:00am sweating and anxious and again at 4, sometimes 5:30. Every single night for months, I check my phone, look around the room, everything seemed normal, but my heart would be racing like I just run a Marathon. My doctor said it was probably anxiety, prescribed me some sleep aids. That didn't do anything. My therapist thought maybe I had some deep childhood trauma, trauma messing with my sleep. We spent weeks talking about my past, but nothing clicked. It didn't feel like nightmares or panic attacks. It felt like something was physically wrong with my space. My cousin Zoe came to visit last month. She's hearing and was gonna crash on my couch for the weekend. She works at this marketing firm downtown and needed a place to stay while her apartment got fumigated. We've been texting about it for weeks. So she shows up Friday night around 8 with her overnight bag and some Chinese takeout. We're eating and catching up, talking about her job, drama and my new position at the graphic design company. Everything's normal. Then around 10, she starts looking around my apartment. Weird. Yeah. How do you sleep here? She asks, making this disgusted face. I'm confused. I signed back asking what she means. My apartment's clean.

I spent three years invisible at my high school. Not the shy kid who sits alone, but the one nobody remembers exists. Teachers called me by the wrong name. Kids borrowed my notes then forgot who gave them. Even the lunch lady skipped my tray sometimes like I wasn't standing there. So when I overheard two popular girls planning the senior prank, something inside me snapped because I wanted to join, but because their idea was weak, they wanted to fill the principal's office with balloons. That's it, balloons. Like we were still in middle school. I knew I could do better, so I started planning something that would make everyone finally see me. First, I got Jake involved. He worked at his uncle's print shop and owed me for doing his chemistry homework all semester. I told him I needed 500 copies of something but couldn't say what yet. He agreed without questions because that's how desperate he was to pass. I talked to Emma from theater. She had keys to the costume room because she managed props. I told her I needed to borrow something for one night. She handed me the keys and said, just don't get caught. The hardest part was getting into the school database. But my computer science teacher, Mr Lopez, had been using the same password for three years, football 2,019. I knew because he typed it in front of us every morning when he Logged in two weeks before graduation. Everything was ready. I stayed after school pretending to work on yearbook layouts. When the building emptied out, I went to work. First, I logged into the announcement system and recorded a new morning message. Then I printed all 500 copies. Every single one was a different embarrassing photo from the principal's Facebook. Him doing carry okay. Him wearing a banana costume at Halloween. Him crying at his daughter's wedding. But that wasn't the best part. Using the theater supplies, I made a perfect replica of our school mascot costume, except this one had the principal's face printed on the head. I hung it from the main hallway ceiling with fishing wire so it would drop during morning announcements. The next morning, I sat in homeroom trying not to smile. At exactly 8:15, my recorded message started playing over the speakers, but it wasn't my voice.

I need a signature for this one, ma'am. Through the doorbell camera, I watched him shift his weight. It'll just take a second, he insisted. That's when I noticed he wasn't holding a scanner.

He says, no, this is the right one. I messaged my neighbor, Mark, an off duty cop, I claiming to be FedEx at my door. No truck, no scanner. Says he can hear me inside. What do I do? He said he's at a grocery store and is heading over. I called him and said what's going on and please hurry cause I was scared. The man outside started trying the doorknob, gently at first, then with more force. Mark said, I'm calling it in. Stay quiet, hide and lock yourself. He hung up.

My friend's girlfriend venmoed me $200 with a message. Brutally crush her heart for me. I accepted the request. I thought, wow, what a sick joke. About two weeks ago, at my friend's birthday party, his girlfriend Aria cornered me in the kitchen. Need you to date my roommate Amelia for exactly three weeks, then break up with her. She pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. Dark brown hair and eyes like sapphire. She's been obsessed with an ex who ghosted her six months back. I'm done watching her cry over a guy who doesn't deserve her tears. I'd rather she cry over a guy like you and move on quickly. Plan was simple enough. Make Amelia fall for me, then hurt her in a nicer way. A smaller heartbreak to get over the bigger one. I told her it was cruel, but she'd already written me a script with conversation starters and favorite books. I accepted to get her off my back and for the easy money. It wasn't hard to find her at the bookstore. Amelia sat directly beside the window, the light hitting her gently, highlighting the different hues in her eyes. She looked like a painting from a distance. Became the only girl to ever make me nervous. I walked over and smiled softly. Is this seat taken? She glanced up at me. Her smile Meeting mine clumsily, yes. I mean, no. Please sit. I watched her ears burn red. Cute. I pointed at the book in her hand. Also a fan of Rebecca Yarrow? She giggled. You know this is a romance book for women, right? I shrugged. Yeah, well, I like the dragons. That made her laugh harder, which made me feel relieved. Aria had sent me cliff notes late at night, and I'll be honest, I wasn't very good at memorizing, but I did remember seeing the word dragons. Rest of the book club date went smoothly, to the point where half of the time I wasn't acting, and we ended up staying in the parking lot talking until closing time. When Amelia mentioned her ex and got this sad look. It snapped me back. Right the favor, I thought. Feeling kind of disappointed almost. The second date felt dangerously real. I picked up Amelia from the book club on my motorcycle, putting on a worn leather jacket that had been hidden for months after my dad passed. She got on the bike full of fear and excitement, like kid on a field trip for the first time. Amelia screamed as I took her along the winding roads, and gasped when she saw the spot overlooking the city. They look like stars! She shouted. We both stared out at the twinkling view of the skyline. The sound of crickets around us made it feel like we were in our own world. It's Funny, I said, licking my lips anxiously. I don't usually bring people up here. She raised an eyebrow and jabbed me with her elbow playfully. Oh? And why is that? I shook my head at her tone and took in a deep breath. This is where I came after my dad died. He and I used to go on rides together up here for years. I turned away, fighting back emotions that I hid away carefully to protect myself. Amelia slipped her hand in mind and squeezed hard. It's okay. I'm glad I can share this with you. Noted. We spent another hour staring at the bright lights, talking about our family before heading back. Aria made sure to check in the next day. I don't know what you're doing, but it's working. She's looking happier than ever. Her words didn't make me feel good. It made me nauseous with guilt instead. And it made me think about how I go through with the final date. The night before then, Amelia showed up to my place, saying, I'm sorry if this is going to sound crazy, but I couldn't say it over the phone. I'm in love with you, and I hope you are, too. She stood at my doorway, fidgeting and breathing heavily from her nerves. I had never felt more happy and heartbroken at once. I'm sorry, but I don't feel the same way, I said through my teeth. I tried to close the door, but she stepped Her foot through to stop me. But what about the things before? I shook my head and looked away, doing my best to keep things together. I thought I could handle your baggage, but you're exhausting. My tone felt scripted, but I had no choice. She needed this. Aria had said so. Every time you talk about your ex, I realize you'll never be over them. Amelia looked at me, pain apparent across her face. You know what? You're right. I was too much. Too much for someone who's emotionally vacant. At least my ex had the decency to just disappear. Not this performative. Cruel. I watched her run down the hallway of the apartment, wiping tears from her eyes. I slammed the door closed, regret flushing over me. I didn't deserve her anyway. I tried to convince myself. Three days later, we both showed up at Aria's apartment to return the money. Aria smiled awkwardly. She pointed at us. I paid you guys for the same thing. Look, Aria was hurting over an ex, and you were hurting over your dad. And I thought, hey, what better way to not feel hurt than love, right? We glared at her while she backed into A. Amelia and I stared at each other in silence until she asked quietly, so you don't like dragons? I burst out.

I never thought anyone would be good enough for my daughter. Call it overprotection or just a father's instinct, but Lily was my only child and I'd seen her heartbroken too many times before. When she first mentioned Marcos, I barely paid attention. Another name and a string of boyfriends who wouldn't last. But then months passed. She kept talking about him. I started to worry. He's coming for dinner next Friday, Lily announced one evening, not asking but telling. My wife squeezed my hand under the table, a silent plea to behave. Fine, I muttered, but I'm grilling steaks my way. Marcos arrived 15 minutes early with a bottle of wine and a firm handshake. Strike one, too eager to impress. Throughout dinner, I watched him carefully, waiting for the mask to slip. He laughed at my jokes, complimented my wife's cooking and asked thoughtful questions about Lily's childhood. Too perfect. Nobody is that genuine. When Lily mentioned her car was making strange noises, I saw my opening. I'll take a look at it tomorrow. I offered. Actually, Marco said, I'm pretty good with cars. My dad owned a garage and I work there every summer through college. Strike 2, trying to one up me in my own house. After dinner, I suggested we move to the porch for drinks. My secret weapon was always the porch, where potential boyfriends inevitably revealed their true selves under my scrutiny. Sir Marcos Said quietly when Lily and my wife were inside.

My Japanese grandmother called me bakachan from the day I was born. I thought it meant little treasure or precious jewel in Japanese. She would pat my head and say bakachan with such warmth in her voice. I felt like the most special grandchild in the world when she said it. In fourth grade, I did a family tree project explaining how bakachan was a sacred Japanese term. It showed how much my grandmother cherished me above all her other grandchildren. My teacher, who I now realise spoke Japanese, kept making strangled noises and spilling her coffee. I thought she was just emotional about my beautiful cultural presentation. I begged my parents for a bakuchon themed birthday party. We had custom napkins printed with Wakachan Sweet 16 in Japanese characters. The Japanese bakery tried to refuse our order three times. They kept suggesting alternatives like birthday girl or literally anything else. Mom had to pay triple to convince them. For my 18th birthday, I got bakuchan tattooed on my wrist in beautiful Japanese characters. The tattoo artist, clearly Japanese, made me sign five different waivers. He kept muttering in Japanese and showing me pictures of butterflies and cherry blossoms instead. I insisted on bakuchan because I wanted authenticity. He took photos of the consent forms while shaking his head. My college application essay is centered around being called bakuchan and it meant to me I Wrote about how this precious nickname connected me to my Japanese heritage. I explained how it represented unconditional love and acceptance in Japanese culture. I got into several schools and was convinced my touching essay made the difference. Freshman year, I decorated my dorm room with a giant neon sign saying Baku Chan's Palace in Japanese. My Korean roommate took one look and immediately requested a room transfer. When I explained the beautiful meaning, she just patted my shoulder sadly and doubled her transfer request. I assumed she was intimidated by my cultural authenticity. I joined the Asian Student Union and introduced myself as bakachan. At every event, the Japanese exchange students would freeze and then whisper frantically to each other. One girl actually laughed out loud before her friend elbowed her hard. they were impressed by how connected I was to Japanese traditions. My boyfriend got property of bakachan printed on a hoodie for Valentine's Day. His Japanese roommate saw it and laughed so hard he needed his inhaler. When my boyfriend wore it to the International Student Mixer, the entire Japanese Student Association took group photos with him. I thought they were admiring our cross cultural romance. Junior year, I finally got to study abroad in Tokyo. At customs, I proudly declared Watashi wabakachandeisu. The officer dropped his stamp and called his supervisor over. They had a heated discussion in rapid Japanese while staring at my passport. I assumed they were by my perfect pronunciation. I made Friends with a girl who seemed constantly on the edge of telling me something. She'd start sentences, then stop herself and shake her head. One day she asked.

In my family, the eldest daughter was expected to raise every child born after her, not help with, not babysit, but become their actual mother from the moment they arrived home from the hospital. I changed my first diaper when I was 6 years old. You see, my mother was a former teen mom who treated pregnancy like catching a cold, something that just happened to you. My father worked construction, but somehow his paychecks always disappeared into new tools or nights at the bar. They both came from huge families where this was just how things worked. By the time I was 8, I had three siblings under my care. My parents would leave for their date nights while I heated bottles and rocked crying babies. Soon you'll get married and pass the burden onto someone else, my mother would say each time she announced another pregnancy, her eyes landing on me like I was hired help. Fast forward eight years later, when I turned 14, my mother sat me down at the kitchen table with this formal announcement. She was pregnant again. Nothing new, except this time she handed me a notebook labeled Household Schedule with my name listed as primary caregiver from 6:00am to eleven PM your old enough to handle night feedings alone now, she said. My father nodded from his recliner. We cancelled your after school activities. Family comes first. The worst part was when they told me I need to get a work permit to buy diapers because they couldn't afford extras. They called it giving me real world experience. This is what love looks like in our culture, they said. You're so much better with them than we are. My day started at 5:00am, making breakfast for four kids while my parents slept in. I fell asleep during a parent teacher conference. Once my parents told everyone I must be partying. The youngest started calling me Mama at the grocery store and people would give us looks. Came the breaking point. I'd worked so hard to get a full academic scholarship to my dream college. The acceptance letter arrived on a Tuesday. For once, I wasn't an underage mother. I was just Lisa, a normal girl going to a normal college. I was in the middle of happy tears when my mother walked in. I'm pregnant, she yelled. My face dropped. It was twins. That was the same week that my dad decided to be even more neglectful than usual. I had to be the one to hold my mom's hair when she vomited, to massage her feet to fix her pregnancy cravings, all while taking care of the kids. The counselor called the next week saying I needed to submit final paperwork by three PM the baby got sick and wouldn't stop screaming. I missed the deadline by 10 minutes. The scholarship was withdrawn for lack of commitment. My parents said college would have been Selfish anyway, I started planning my escape in secret, applied to community college and got accepted. Got a part time job at a grocery store and hid my money in a tampon box. My 16 year old sister Sarah found out but promised to keep quiet. For once, everything was going according to plan. And so my parents found the acceptance letter I'd hidden in my chemistry textbook. My mother cried about all their sacrifices. My father threatened to kick me out if I abandoned the family. I didn't say a word. And the next day I came home from work to find the house riddled with social workers. Apparently my parents told them I was the neglectful caregiver who was supposed to be watching everyone. The social worker saw through it but gave me an impossible choice. Either I stayed as the primary caregiver or my siblings would go into foster care. My parents stood there smirking like they'd won. But I had an.

I was 20, working graveyard shifts at a 7 11 when I got slammed with a 1,200 dollar DUI that would destroy my entire life. The citation claimed I was driving drunk at 3:00am on Saturday, weaving between lanes and refusing a breathalyzer test. One problem. I don't drink alcohol. I'm a recovering addict who's been sober for three years. Officer Thompson wrote that he pulled me over outside Miller's Bar on Fifth Street. He claimed I reeked of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, and failed every field sobriety test. But I was restocking energy drinks at 7 11 during my overnight shift. My register transactions showed I sold $847 worth of merchandise between 3 and 4 a m. The security cameras captured me behind the counter at the exact time he claimed I was drunk driving. I couldn't afford a lawyer. A DUI conviction would mean losing my license, my job, and probably going back to jail. So I printed everything. Work schedules, register logs, security footage, time stamps, even my three year sobriety chip. I. I practiced my defense speech until my hands stopped shaking. This was life or death. The courthouse reeked of desperation and broken dreams. I watched person after person accept plea deals for things that would ruin their lives. When they called my name, Officer Thompson walked up looking like he'd done this a thousand times. He was massive, intimidating, with dead eyes. And a bored expression. Your honor, I observed the defendant's vehicle swerving erratically on Fifth Street. Upon contact, the and exhibited classic signs of intoxication. Slurred speech, alcohol odor, bloodshot eyes. He became combative and refused all sobriety tests. Combative? I was working at 7 11, Officer Thompson. When it was my turn, I started carefully. Officer Thompson, what kind of car was I driving? He looked confident. Blue Ford sedan. Your honor, I don't own a car. I've never owned a car. I take the bus to work every night because I can't afford insurance.

She listened more than she spoke, nodded at stories she wasn't part of and laughed at jokes she didn't understand just to feel like she belonged. She clapped for everyone else, told her friends they looked beautiful even when she felt invisible next to them. She gave compliments like candy and waited for someone, anyone, to offer her one in return. And when they didn't, she just smiled because being left out hurt less when she acted like she didn't care.

So my friend group had this one girl, Jenna, who always pulled this annoying move whenever we went out to eat. She'd order the most expensive thing on the menu, get appetizers, dessert, sometimes even multiple drinks. And then when the Bill came, she'd go, let's just split it evenly every single time. The rest of us would order like a basic pasta or sandwich, maybe share some fries, and we'd end up paying for her lobster tail or whatever fancy thing she decided she needed that night. We all complained about it behind her back, but nobody ever said anything to her face because we didn't want drama in the group. Last weekend, we went to this nice Italian place downtown for my birthday dinner. There were six of us total. I specifically picked somewhere that had good food but wasn't crazy expensive because I knew not everyone had tons of money to throw around right now. Everyone ordered pretty reasonably. I got chicken parmigiana for like 18 bucks. My friend Casey got spaghetti and meatballs. Tyler got a pizza to share with his girlfriend. Normal stuff that college kids order when they're trying to have a nice time without going broke. But Jenna, this girl, ordered the seafood platter that was $45, got two appetizers for the table that nobody asked for, ordered three different cocktails throughout the night and finished it off with some Fancy tiramisu that cost 12 bucks. I watched her racking up this massive Bill and I could already see where this was heading. When the server brought the check, Jenna immediately grabbed it and started doing her fake concerned math face. Okay, so with tip, this comes to about $320. So that's like $53 each, which honestly isn't too bad for a nice place like this. I looked around the table and everyone was just staring at their phones or suddenly very interested in their water glasses. Nobody wanted to be the one to call her out, even though I could tell they were all thinking the same thing I was. That's when I decided I was done enabling this behaviour. I pulled out my phone and opened the calculator app right there at the table. Actually, I'm just gonna pay for what I ordered plus my share of tax and tip. I started adding up my stuff out loud. So my chicken parm was 18. I had one Coke which was 3:50 and my portion of tax and tip comes to about $26 total. The whole table went dead silent. Jenna's face turned bright red and she started stuttering, but we always split everything evenly. That's how we do it in our group. I pulled out $30 cash and put it on the table. Well, I'm changing how I do it. This covers my food and I'm being generous with the tip. I grabbed my person, stood up. Thanks. For dinner, everyone, happy birthday to me, I guess. As I was walking out, I could hear Jenna frantically trying to recalculate the Bill for everyone else. Apparently, my $26 suddenly became everyone else's problem when they realised they'd have to cover her expensive taste. Tyler texted me later that night saying they ended up sitting there.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. I had never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text. Or something. I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope they've been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years. Been dead for six whole years and we never knew. I drove home and found mom in the kitchen making dinner like any other night when I told her.

I will be married five in September. Okay. And so some woman named Holly has been calling him, like calling him a lot? Yeah, like a lot. Like the other day I saw that he had three missed calls from her. His phone actually said three missed calls from Holly. Okay, I mean, you should have grabbed his phone and said, uh, you have three missed calls from Holly, you know, wanna explain who she is? Well, I actually did do that. Okay. And what did he say? He says that she's a marketing person for an account that they're trying to get at work. Okay. And do you believe him? Of course I did. But then I started thinking about like she calls at really weird times. So for example, she'll call on the weekend or at night. Yeah. And what marketing person does that? Yeah, here's another thing I was gonna see if she represents a client that your husband is trying to get, I would feel like he would be the one doing all the calling, not the other way around. Have you seen any text conversations between the two of them? No, but he locked his phone. Yeah, but I mean, you're married. You don't have your husband's password? No, actually I don't. Alright. Does he have any Facebook friends named Holly? Like maybe a new Facebook friend just recently? Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't check. Okay, so what you want us to do is find out if he's telling the truth and find out who this Holly girl is. Is she really a potential client or is there something else going on? Yeah, that's what I want to know. Okay. Now I don't suppose you have her number. No. Um, but when it calls, it doesn't like show her number or anything. It just says, you know, Holly's calling or missed call. Right? Okay. So we can't call her. We can definitely call him though, right? Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's devise a quick plan here during the commercial break and then when we come back, let's see what we can find out about this. Okay. Okay. So we're gonna call Tony, call Tony and, and actually tell him that you are this Holly girl's sister. Oh no, not sister. It's like say cousin say I'm Holly's cousin and we're throwing her a birthday party. So we stole her phone and we called all of our contacts. Okay, so we can invite people, but we don't want her to know about it. Oh, like a surprise. Like a surprise. But yeah, we saw that you were in her phone. Okay. And then when he says, yeah, I'm in her phone say Like, well, we just assumed you were her new man because of all the time she's calling. Yeah. Okay. Stinky. And then, yeah, and then we'll see. Uh.

I said nothing and revealed what she'd hidden for years. When I was 19, my mom remarried Richard and suddenly decided I was too spoiled living in our family home. Time to learn independence, she said, kicking me out so Richard's son Tyler could have my room. My childhood bedroom became his gaming setup overnight. I'll never forget packing my stuff while Tyler lounged on my old bed, already planning where to put his new desk. Mom stood in the doorway with her arms crossed, explaining how this would build character. The same woman who used to make me hot chocolate when I had nightmares with now treating me like a burden she couldn't wait to get rid of. I crashed on couches for months. My friend Jake's mom let me sleep in their basement, but I felt like such a charity case. I worked three jobs. Morning shift at a coffee shop, afternoons at a retail store, nights doing delivery driving. I'd see families eating dinner together through restaurant windows and feel this hollow ache in my chest. Mom would post family vacation photos with Tyler in my old spot at the dinner table. Disney World trips, beach houses, fancy restaurants. Tyler wearing my old high school Letterman jacket in one photo. Really stung like I never existed. The worst part was running into them at the grocery store. Mom would get this awkward smile and ask how I was doing out there in the real world while Tyler stood behind her wearing brand new clothes. Meanwhile, I'm calculating if I can afford name brand pasta sauce. This week, I finally saved enough to rent a tiny studio apartment above a pizza place. The walls were thin, it smelled like pepperoni constantly, and the heat barely worked, but it was mine. I'd fall asleep listening to Tyler's Instagram stories about his awesome new room and best mom ever. During this time, I was the only one who visited grandma regularly. Every Sunday, I bring her groceries and we'd watch old movies together. She never asked why I looked so tired or why my clothes were getting loose from skipping meals. She just made sure I ate a real dinner every week and sent me home with leftovers. Grandma would tell me stories about growing up during the depression. How her family stuck together no matter what. Real family doesn't abandon each other when times get tough, she'd say, patting my hand. I always wondered if she knew what mom had done to me. Five years crawled by like this. I bounced between apartments, worked my way up to assistant manager positions, slowly built a small emergency fund. Mom would occasionally text on holidays. Generic thinking of you messages that felt more like obligation than love. Then grandma died suddenly. Heart attack in her sleep. At the funeral, mom cried dramatically while Tyler stood there checking his phone. I Was the one who held Grandma's hand during her final hospital visit. I was the one who knew she wanted to be buried next to Grandpa, wearing her blue dress. A week later, the lawyer called. Grandma had left me everything. Her house, her savings, her vintage jewelry collection that I'd always admired. The reading of the will was surreal. Mom kept shooting me confused glances, like there must be some mistake. But the real shock came when mom

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess. I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep, then drinking to get through the day, then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had 0 family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

I froze in the chair, Scissors still hovering over my head. What missing person poster? I asked, but Tony was already walking to the window. He pointed at a flyer taped to the glass outside his shop. That one missing guy named Jake Morrison. Same eagle tattoo on the left shoulder blade. Same scar through the wing from what I can see. My stomach dropped because my name was Jake Morrison, and I definitely had that exact tattoo. Tony, that's probably just a coincidence. Lots of people have eagle tattoos. But Tony was shaking his head, studying my reflection in the mirror. Jake, I've been cutting your hair for two years. Never seen your full name anywhere until today. And this poster says Jake Morrison went missing three months ago. He showed me his appointment book. But you've been coming here every month like clockwork. I twisted around to look at the poster through the window. The photo was grainy and taken from a distance, but it definitely looked like me. Same build, same hair color, same general features. This has to be some mistake, I said, but my voice sounded shaky even to me. Maybe there's another Jake Morrison with a similar tattoo. Tony pulled the poster off his window and brought it inside. Says here he disappeared from Portland, Oregon on March 15th. His family is offering a ten thousand Dollar reward. He looked at me. Care. Jake, where were you living before you moved here? I tried to remember, but my memories before arriving in this town were surprisingly fuzzy. I came from the East Coast, I said, but even as I said it, I wasn't sure if that was true. Been traveling around for work. Tony raised an eyebrow. What kind of work? I opened my mouth to answer and realized I couldn't remember what I told him before construction, I said finally, but if felt like a guest. Tony set down his Scissors completely. Jake, this is serious. If this is you on this poster, your family thinks you're dead or kidnapped. There are people looking for you. He pulled out his phone. Maybe we should call the number and clear this up. My heart started racing and I didn't know why. Wait, I said, grabbing his wrist. Let me think about this first. If I call that number and it's not me, I'll be wasting everyone's time. And if it is me? I trailed off because I couldn't finish that thought. If it was me, then I had no memory of having a family or disappearing from anywhere. Tony sat down in the chair next to me. Jake, when you first came to my shop, you paid cash, said you were new in town, starting fresh. But you never talked about where you came from or why you moved here. That seemed normal at the time. But now, he gestured at the poster. Now it seems like maybe you were running from something. Stared at my reflection, trying to remember my life before this town. I had an apartment here, a job at the hardware store, a routine. But when I tried to think further back, everything got blurry. I think I might have been in an accident, I said slowly. My head or something. My memory of the past few years is pretty foggy. That would explain a lot, Tony said gently. Head injuries can cause amnesia. Maybe you disappeared from Portland because you were hurt and confused. Ended up here without remembering who you are. He showed me the poster again. Says here you have a wife and two kids. They've been searching for you for three months. The words hit me like a punch to the. A wife and kids I couldn't remember. People who loved me and thought I was dead. Tony, what if I don't remember them? What if I call this number and these strangers claim to be my family? My hands were shaking now. What if I've built a life here that I have to give up for a life I can't even remember? Tony stood up and locked the front door of his shop, flipping the sign to closed. Jake, we need to figure this out properly. Let me call my brother in law. He's a cop. He can help us contact the right people and make sure This gets handled safely. He was already dialing. If you really are this missing person, there might be reasons why you left that have nothing to do with memory loss. While Tony talked to his brother in law, I studied the missing person poster more carefully. The physical description matched perfectly. 5 feet 10 inches, brown hair, Hazel eyes, 32 years old. Even the birth date was right. But the address listed was completely unfamiliar. 1,247 Maple street, Portland, Oregon. I've never heard of that street in my life. 20 minutes later.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Mrs. Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Mrs. Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get, get away from the door, Daisy, Mrs. Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Mrs. Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harrah looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harrah said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office but passed reception. Into the conference room, the cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced and I hadn't seen him since I was 7. So now I was really confused. Dad. He grabbed me in a hug so tight I couldn't breathe and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex Marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no.

I'm glad I'll be able to see you again. Maybe we can play Barbies when you get here. Anything for my favorite girl. Justin, what are you doing right now? Justin, answer me! Justin! Emma, can you stop blowing up my phone right now? I'm busy. Busy doing what, Justin? I'm just watching Netflix. What show are you watching? Stranger Things. New season. Justin. What? What? You said you were going to wait and watch that season with me. Yeah, I know, but I got bored, babe. Justin, you said that It would be our little date. Me, you and stranger things. Are you watching it with another girl? No, babe, I would never. I'm just bored. Then turn it off and watch it with me. No, sorry, boredom got the best of me. We can watch something else later. Okay, we'll see about that. Huh? What does that mean? Tammy, what are Justin and Aubrey doing right now? They're still on the couch right now. They're cuddled up watching Stranger Things. That little bit, huh? Nothing. Tammy, I'm here. Could you come open the door for me? Yay! I'm alright. I'm coming to the door with my Barbies. I'm going to need you to go to your room when I come in. We'll play later, okay? Um. Emma, did I do something wrong? Why are you and Justin arguing? I even saw you crying when you ran back to your car. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. Emma, please. I'm so sorry. It's okay, Tammy. You did nothing wrong. Emma, I'm so sorry. Maybe this is all my fault for being nosy. Tammy, it's okay. You did the right thing. Alright? Emma, um, could we play Barbies and dress up? Sorry, Emma, I can't come over to your house anymore. Wait, Emma, why? I'm sorry for making you and Justin argue. I didn't mean to do anything bad. Tammy, it's not you. It's just we can't be friends anymore. But why? Emma? I love you so much. You're like my best friend. Or like my big sister. I don't want to lose you. You make life so fun. I know, Tammy. I love you, too. You're like my little sister. It breaks my heart, but we have to let go, Emma. I don't wanna let go. Ever since my big sister passed away, I've been so alone. But then you came in my life to make me happy again. I don't want to lose another sister again, Tammy. I'm so, so sorry, Emma. What do you mean, Emma? Justin, how could you? A what? You know what you did to Emma? You broke her heart. Maybe if you would have kept your mouth quiet, you little snitch, everything would have been fine. Mom said Emma is in the hospital right now because of it. She's hurt because of this. I can't believe you. I lost my best friend because of you. Now me and mom are going to the hospital to make sure she's okay. Stop texting me, you little snitch! Justin, I swear, if I lose Emma, I will never forgive you. She was my big sis. You know how alone I've been after Jessica passed. Don't you dare bring up Jessica! Stop texting me, you little snitch! I do not care! You better pray she's okay.

I didn't take your Legos. Yes, you did. Oh, wait, never mind. Brody had them. Told you. I don't care. Do you know where Brody is? No, why? He usually sleeps with me, but he isn't coming in, and I'm scared. Bro, he's a dog. He's probably eating. You're so mean for no reason. Thanks. I'm trying my best. I hate you. I love you, too. You drive, right? Obviously. I'm 17. Okay, drive me back home from camp. Uh, why? Because I'm done with camp. Why can't mom do it? Because I want you to drop me off at chick fil A. Why? You ask too many questions. Just come. No, I'm in camp, too. Yeah, but mine is summer school, and that's more important than yours. Well, mine is still more important than chick fil A. Not even you're more important than chick fil A. Cute. Come get me. I told mom you're waiting. She's coming to get you. Bro, I hate you. I love you, too. Shut up! You're so stupid. I'm home. Where were you? I picked up dad from the airport. Okay, I don't care that you're home. The door is locked, so we don't have the key. Oh, my bad. Eat some celery. You're so fat. What? Let me speak it in your language. Oink, oink. Excuse me, you little jerk. You're excused. Why'd you tell mom? Ugh, take a joke. Okay, I hear You singing in the shower. Such a ear murderer. Yeah, that's right. Turn off the shower and read these texts. So tell me, what the fuck is your problem? I don't know. But I know that your problem is your singing. And your problem is your attitude. Oh, good one. Got me shaking and quaking in my boots. Yeah, if you could afford boots, bro. What? I'm literally a child. Of course I can't afford boots. Take a joke, Mark. Learn to make one. I know how mom made you. Thank you very much. Bro, you're so pressed. Unlike your nose. That thing is the opposite of flat. You can't talk. Your nose is like a bridge. I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college. Whenever I mess around about something, you take it seriously. I'm just kidding. Obviously. Hello? I know you can read this, you hole. You wouldn't know. You're barely 8 years old. I'm literally 13, bro. I hate you. I love you too. Happy birthday. I don't care. You don't even come over on holidays anymore. Why would I respond to you? Okay, why are you so different? It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too. Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried. Boys aren't supposed to cry. But you told me. It's okay. I love you. Do you still love me, too?

Don't be so harsh. It's her first shh day. Maybe she's just trying to figure things out. Yeah, I guess. But why would I bother talking to anyone else when I have you? Ah, you're too sweet. Don't worry, she'll know soon enough that you're all schmine. Good. I'd never leave you anyway. Wanna grab dinner tonight? We can stop by your favorite burger place. Oh my god, yes!

I have to train the new girl tomorrow. What are the chances they put me on that? No way! Just be nice to her. Maybe you can be her friend. I don't need new friends when I have you. You're too sweet. Just don't be mean, that's all I'm saying. I'll try my best, but if she keeps asking dumb stuff, we might have a problem. Haha, don't stress too much. Just try to have fun. I'm heading to bed. See you tomorrow. Hey, we didn't talk much today. How was training with Sophia? Honestly, better than I expected. She chilled out with the dumb Questions. And she's actually pretty funny. Guess what her favorite movie is. What? The incredible. What are the odds? No way! That's my favorite movie. What a crazy coincidence. She must be cool, then. I know, right? Yeah. I think you'd actually get along with her. You should talk to her. Tomorrow. Maybe. Anyway, I gotta study for a test. I'll see you tomorrow? Of course. Good luck on your test. Daniel, you barely even looked at me at work today. You were with Sophia the whole time. Babe, come on. Don't be like that. Training takes more than a day. Once it's over, you know, I'll make it up to you, I guess. Learn anything else about her? Yeah, actually. She loves sushi and she's really into working out. Cantina app. I need roast bot. My boyfriend doesn't give me attention because of a new girl. What should I do now? Just say she lifts weights, you lift excuses. She lifts weights, you lift excuses. Oof. That one hit. Use Cantina app to improve your roasting skills. Do you wanna hang out tonight? I don't think I can, babe. I was gonna hit the gym, but tomorrow for sure. Okay. I'll just stay in and watch movies then. Have fun. Talk to you later. Of course, babe. Babe, why weren't you at work today? I don't know. Just wasn't feeling great, I guess. Hope you feel better soon. Can you come over? I don't think I can, babe. Why? Not you always bring me food and medicine when I'm sick. you know how some theaters bring back old movies for a limited time? Yeah. What does that have to do with anything? I can't go anywhere. I'm sick. They're playing the Incredibles. I thought I'd take Sophia to see it since she was looking for something fun to do. You're taking Sophia to see my favorite movie? Mia, don't be selfish. Also her favorite movie. And you're sick. As you said yourself, you can't go anywhere. Wow, what's up with this girl? Why is she all you talk about now? Are you seriously trying to start an argument right now? I'm just asking. We're dating, and yet you keep talking about her. And now you're taking her to do something I've always wanted to do with you? I don't know. Maybe because she actually makes me happy and doesn't just sit around and scroll on TikTok all day. Instead, she actually does things to improve herself. Wow. So that's how it is, right? Wait. I mean, yeah, she cares about me. I have to beg you to care about me. Okay, well, I guess we're done, then. Have fun at the movies. I will. Thanks. Mia, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for how I acted yesterday. That wasn't me. Why weren't you at work today? Still sick? I quit. What? Why? You love that job. Sometimes the things you love don't always love you back.

Womp, womp. What do you mean womp, womp? You don't even care. She was your girlfriend for 2 years, Justin. She loved you for 2 years. Listen, Tammy, this is not my problem. She overreacted and did something irrational. That's on her, not me. Justin, you literally broke her heart. How could you after the 2 years of her being there for you when big sis Jessica passed away? That hurt us bad. And she was there for you, making sure you were okay. When you couldn't take me to school because you were too sad to get out of the bed, Emma came to take me. She would always take care of me like how our big sister would before she passed. She would always buy me food, pack my lunch and would even come over to watch me and take care of me when nobody was home. She would stay home with me just to play barbies with me to make sure I wasn't scared being alone. She was the best girlfriend you ever had. She was the sister I needed after big sis passed away. And now you're the reason why Emma is gone because you were selfish and cheated. I don't have time to read a lot. Go cry to someone else. Leave me be.

It broke all of our hearts. We lost a beautiful soul that day. She was the perfect daughter I never asked for, always taking care of us like she was a part of this family. We will miss her forever. Yeah, everyone will miss her except Justin. Justin is so evil. How could he do that to her? I talked to your brother, Tammy, and what he did was absolutely terrible and unforgivable. He should be grounded forever. Sadly, I can't do anything since he's a 20 year old man. Mommy, I really think this is my fault. If I would have just shut my mouth, Emma would still be here. But I decided to be a loud mouth. This is all because of me, baby. No, you did the right thing. Don't ever feel bad about doing the right thing. Yeah. Mommy, could you at least take me to see Emma again? I miss her so much. I want to play barbies with her. I wish I could, Tammy, but I'm so tired and I have work tomorrow. Auntie, can you send me a rizzapp line so Mommy can take me? This will for sure make Mommy smile. Say this. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. Oh, that's so sweet. You're right. I do have enough energy for one more trip. Meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my barbies. I'm bringing my new barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby, I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister? I looked over the entire house and she's not here. And that's my problem. How, oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait. How would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin? I looked around. And found nothing. Oh, my God. Not my Tammy. Well, actually, I did find this one thing, two frozen barbies in front of Emma's Tombstone. Oh, my God. No.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

Okay, so you have an ex? Yes. And what is his. What is his name? Brian. Okay, and when did he become your ex? Like, how fresh is this? It was last year, but we still talk to each other all the time. Okay, so. But he's dating someone else now? Yes. And her name is Hannah, and she seems totally nice and everything. I know a few people who know her, too. They said she's super nice, and they seem happy together. But here's the thing. I keep telling her that Brian is doing things behind her back, and she keeps ignoring me when I try to help. Okay. Do. Doing what things behind her back? Talking to other girls, talking to me still, and trying to get me to actually hook up with him. So Brian is still trying to hook up with you even though he has a new girl? Pretty much. And I tried getting a message out to her, and she blocked me, so I just. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, how did you try contacting her? Contacting her? Did you, like, DM her or something? Like, what'd you do? Yeah, I tried dming her through Instagram, but she blocked me right away. She told her friends not to talk to me either. She told them I was Brian's psycho ex. But really, truthfully, all I'm trying to do is help her here. Okay, so you're trying to be the nice person here so she doesn't get her heart broken like you did? Basically, yeah. Okay, but she won't listen to you. Probably cause Brian himself is probably been like, ah, she's my psycho ex, don't listen to her. I guess, yeah. Okay, yeah, but the whole thing is. Didn't you say Brian was still trying to hook up with you? Like he's still trying to get with you. I mean, we're supposed to be going out for drinks this weekend and he specifically told me not to mention it to anyone because of Hannah. Oh wow, that's shady. Okay, so. But she doesn't believe you. Well, alright, what if we did this? What if we got Brian on the phone, okay, and then also had this Hannah girl on listening, like on a third line. And then you sort of talked about hooking up or your little drinks date coming up. And then she'd be able to hear everything herself. That way you wouldn't have to convince anybody of anything cause she'd hear it for herself. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Alright, good. So it's an old fashioned Three Way call. We can set that up, no problem. Wait, do we have the other girl's number? Oh yeah, do we have. Yeah, This new Hannah Girls phone number. I have her number, yes. Oh, okay, well, there you go. Three Way. Action time it is. We'll do that when we come back. Next we're gonna do an old fashioned zoo morning zoo Three Way. But before we get to the actual call. And we're ready to go with this. Yes. Okay, so please welcome Hannah to the show. Hello, Hannah. Hello. So, shag talked to you already, right? We're on live. Watch the language, that sort of thing. Yes. Okay, so before we bring her on, Hannah, tell us what you know about Chantal, your current man. Brian's ex. Uh. Oh, boy. Um, not much. Just that they dated, they broke up, and she's sort of crazy, I guess. Oh, okay, let's bring Chantelle on real quick. So, Chantelle, before we do this, what did you want to say to Hannah? Just that I am not crazy, and I'm only trying to prevent you here from getting hurt. That's. That's it? That's really it? Okay, Hannah, I mean, if. Okay, if you're just trying to help me, then what was wrong with keeping all this private? Like, why do we have to do all of this on the radio? Because you won't answer me when I try to talk to you. You blocked me on Instagram, that's why. Yeah, I blocked you because Brian asked me to. He said he didn't want you spying on him. Well, like I said, I'm only. I'm only Trying to help you here. Okay, so listen, we came up with this idea here real quick. We wanted to call Brian up, and then. Chantelle, why don't you ask him about your supposed upcoming date that he made with you behind Hannah's back and see what he says? Fine with me. And Hannah. We're gonna turn your line down while she's talking to him, but you're still gonna get to hear everything that's being said. Okay? I mean, I just think this is really immature, but whatever. Okay, hang on, Chantal. We're gonna call him up here, and when he answers, you're on. Okay?

You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted.

Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me.

Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I heard of you, at least. But how did you know it was my phone? When you texted me, I clicked on the notification and it showed your messages. Your last text was from your mom. So we are going through each other's messages now? No, no, it wasn't like that. I didn't mean to. Ha ha. I know. I'm just playing with you. So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice.

How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes.

Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better.

What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh, my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Ha ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.

Flirting with your boyfriend? Honey, I'd never do such a thing. Mom, you are not slick. Every time I bring him over, you're extra sweet and nice with him, hugging him all closely and tightly. You make sure to wear your skimpiest outfit whenever he comes over. Then you always bend over and pick things up in front of him. Mom, stop this! Oh Sasha, I have no idea what you mean, but if you're afraid of your man taking more of a liking to me, you should be. Everyone knows Mama is way more attractive. Haha! Mom, how could you say that? Why are you always so mean to me? It's like you're always in competition with me. I'm literally your daughter, but you never show me love. You're a grown ass woman who's stuck acting like a teenager. Grow up! Oh gosh, no daughter of mine would look like that. Stop your crying. I provide you everything. That's all you need. Astro app! I need astrology help! My mom keeps acting like a flirting with my boyfriend. What should I do? Pisces have a reputation for being very flirtatious and trying to take people's partners. Try telling your mom how you feel. Mom, just stay away from my boyfriend. He's coming over today and I don't want you flirting with him. Whatever, Sasha. I can't help that your boyfriend gravitates towards me. Tee Hee. Just stay away. Mom, can you Not! What are you whining about now, Sasha? Hahaha! You literally kissed Jack on the cheek as soon as he walked in. Stop! And you see the way he blushed at me when I gave it to him? Hahaha! You must be careful honey, or you man might vanish. Mom, please stop this, I'm begging you. You've done nothing but make my life a living. I've tried my best to be the daughter you've all always wanted, but it's never enough for you. Never pretty enough, never smart enough. Just not good enough for you. Maybe if you got better grades in school I'd stay away from your man. But no, you just flunk everything. This is your punishment. And the final punishment will be me taking him. Haha! Mom, no, please! This is the only boy who's ever shown me attention in my life. Please don't ruin it. It's not my fault you didn't get your mama's attractive jeans. Haha, don't cry to me about it. Take it up with god. If you can excuse me, I'm going to look for an outfit Jack will really appreciate. Mom, please! Mom, what did you do? You took Jack to the room and I heard you two making macaroni and cheese sounds. There's no way you actually did it. I told you Honey Bun, this is your punishment. You thought I was joking? Jakey Poo is mine now. You think you deserved a guy that handsome and tall? I bet you Haven't even seen his pencil yet. Mama did first, and it's huge. Haha! Mom, how could you do this to your only daughter? Me and Jack didn't even make it to that stage yet, and you took the card before me? I thought you loved me. Oh, cry and weep somewhere else. Me and Jack are going on a date tonight. I turned him and he's mine now. Make sure this home is spotless when I come back, or you're grounded. Here's no way. You know what? When you come back, you're going to see something you'll never be able to forget. Hopefully it's you wearing an outfit that actually matches. Ha ha ha! You'll see.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your 6 year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy hurt his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me! She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, Buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. Psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy story never changed. Hours passed. Detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She. She showed me the room she made all pink. And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

And he's just short by a tiny bit. How much is he short? Only 48 thousand dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short forty eight thousand dollars? Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes, yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money! Hold on, he makes $200 a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. A 50 thousand dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom, my brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this. When you managed our finances, we were always in the red because you kept funneling money to your family. Now we finally saved a bit and you're pulling this again? You're his brother in law. He's buying a car for his wedding. Such an important event. Just help him out. When He has money later. He'll definitely take care of you. Ha! I'm going to call your brother right now. Call? What for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me too? And $48,000? I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car, and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question, but you can't lend me $5,000? Is. Is that the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000, so why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally? I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death Situation. I'm done talking to you. I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now! Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

My high school bully, Jake, tormented me for three years straight. He wasn't your typical bully who just shove you into lockers. No, Jake was calculated. He made sure none of the teachers ever saw anything while systematically destroying my social life. It started sophomore year when I transferred to Westlake High. I didn't know anyone, so I was already nervous. Jake was the star quarterback, student body president, and principal's son. The untouchable golden boy. For reasons I'll never understand, he decided I was his target. At first, it was small stuff. Accidentally knocking my books down, spilling soda on my homework, or spreading rumors that I had weird hobbies. But by junior year, he'd orchestrated my complete isolation. The few friends I'd made suddenly stopped talking to me after Jake told everyone I'd said horrible things about them behind their backs. I ate lunch alone for a year and a half. What kept me going was art. I poured everything into my sculptures, staying late in the art studio almost every day. Miss Porter, our art teacher, recognized my talent and even gave me a key to work weekends. Art became my refuge. In your year, everything changed when the state announced their annual art competition with a 20 thousand dollar college scholarship prize. This was my ticket out. My family couldn't afford college otherwise. Miss Porter encouraged me to enter, saying, my metal work sculptures, Were the best she'd seen from a high school student. For three months, I worked on my masterpiece, an intricate wire sculpture showing two hands breaking free from chains. It represented everything I've been through. The detail was incredible. Each link in the chain had tiny engravings of the words that had been used against me. Two weeks before the submission deadline, I walked into the art room and froze. My sculpture lay smashed on the floor, the hundreds of hours of work destroyed beyond repair. On my desk was a yellow sticky note. Oops. Clumsy me, Jay. I felt something break inside me, but not in the way Jake expected. Instead of crying or reporting it, which would have done nothing since his dad ran the school, I smiled and calmly cleaned up the mess. The next day, I started a completely different project. A technically impressive but intentionally bland wire figure of a tree. Basic, safe, uninspired. What Jake didn't know was that after the destruction, I'd convinced Miss Porter to let me install a small security camera in the art room to prevent further accidents. I also set up a second hidden camera, pointed directly at my supply drawer, where I kept all my original design sketches and concept art. For the next two weeks, I worked on my decoy project during school hours, making sure everyone saw me starting over. But at home in my garage, I was recreating my masterpiece. Been better than before. Three Days before the deadline, the security footage showed Jake sneaking into the art room at night using a key he must have taken from his dad's office. He went straight to my supply drawer, stealing all my original design sketches for my destroyed sculpture. The day before submissions were due, Jake unveiled his original creation in art class.

And you're telling me this because? Might not make it home. Whatever. Wait, what do you mean? Aren't you gonna ask what I'm up to? Why I'm not coming home? What's there to ask? You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay? No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do, could I stop you? Anyway, it's your call. You've changed so much. Feel like I barely know you lately. The old you would have made me come home no matter how late. Can I ask you something, too? Did the old me annoy you? If we're both gonna be miserable, might as well let you have your fun. Babe, I love you. Don't worry. I won't nag you to come home anymore. No more overthinking, either. If you drink too much, crash at your buddies. I get it now. No more micromanaging you or fighting over little things. Babe, I'm touched you feel this way. I'll love you more and more. Hmm. Have a good time with your friends. Hey. We'll do. Babe. Just got off work. You didn't forget what day it is, right? It's my birthday. Going out with Co workers. Wanna join? I'll pass. Don't know your work friends would be awkward. Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Love you. You sure you won't come? I'm sure. Alright. Did you get me a birthday gift? Nope. You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how We were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while.

Um. Hey, who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never spoken, but I've had a crush on you since like, forever. If you've had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I don't know if you'd feel the same way about me. Why don't we play a game? Okay then. Jigsaw. What kind of game? You have until June to figure out who I am. Is this just a way to get me to talk to you all year? Maybe. Alright, sure. Why not? But I gotta let you know, I do have a crush on a girl already, so don't get your hopes up. That's okay. Let's just see what happens. Hey. You looked great today. You were watching me? You're creepy, you know that? Rizz app tells me to respond with how could I take my eyes off such a beautiful specimen such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off such a beautiful specimen such as yourself? Wow, that was actually a good one. Describe yourself to me a little. Why? So I can at least get a starting point to find out who you are. Okay, fair enough. I'm blonde. That doesn't help me. There are tons of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. Alright. I have a birthmark on my left shoulder. Hmm. Interesting. Now all I have to do is go around looking at Blonde girls. Shoulders. Lol. So tell me about this girl you like. Her name is Sienna. She's beautiful, but we've never spoken. Do you know her? Yeah. Lol. I know her. She is pretty awesome. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. Yeah, sure. Why not? Okay, well, I'm gonna get some sleep. Good night, mystery girl. Good night. What? I didn't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised you haven't messaged me, that's all. I have a question for you. Sure, go ahead. How could you have loved me for so long if we have never even spoken? I think you're gorgeous. I see how you interact with people. You're such a gentle soul. You're polite, a gentleman. I just always knew you are exactly what I want. Wow, that's really sweet. I wish I could figure out who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Of course. I don't think I'm interested in Sienna anymore. Oh, really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I've never been brave enough to even speak to her. But that's the problem. Physically, she's perfect in every way. But I've fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. And I don't even know her name or what she looks like. The day you find out who I really am, I hope we can be together. Me, Too mystery girl? Honey, did you know a girl named Sienna in your school? Yeah, she's in my class. I used to have a crush on her. Lol. Why? I just saw on the news that she passed away. So sad. What? Are you kidding? No, honey. Did you know her well? No, we never spoke. That's so sad. She seemed really nice. I'm sorry, honey. Hey, did you hear about Sienna? Hello? Mystery girl, you there? Why aren't you replying? I could really use someone to talk to right now. Did you change your number? Why aren't my messages going through? It was you. It was you all along, Sienna. How could I have been so shlind? I wish I had spoken to you. I'm an idiot. I should have just picked up the courage and spoken to you. I love you, Sienna. I always will. Fly high, my mystery girl. James, I need your help.

Just go back to sleep. Did I believe that? No. Actually, I'm pretty sure there was something under the bed, but I lied to her for her comfort. And then she asked me to check under the bed. And in my head, I was like, ain't no fucking way am I getting out of bed right now to check under it. Instead, I reassured her that there was nothing under the bed, and I told her to go back to sleep. And she tried for a minute. Her eyes fluttered. They. They, like, a little bit, and then they popped right open again. And she was looking at the TV, the TV that was turned off in our dark room. And she goes, mommy, who's that on the TV? And in my head, I'm thinking, dog, I don't fucking know. You tell me. You're the one seeing dead people. Who the fuck is that on the TV? Because I don't see it, but I'm terrified. I don't say that. No, instead, I Say, honey, the TV's turned off. There's no one on the TV. Just go back to sleep. And she falls back asleep eventually. You know who doesn't? Me. Because I'm afraid of what's under the bed now. And I'm wondering who the fuck that was on my TV. On my TV that was turned off. Who was it? And now I'm thinking, I need to fucking spray my daughter with holy water. Except I don't have holy water. What I do have is Dawn dish soap power scrub. I could spray her with that, hit her with a microfiber towel and hope that fucking works. I'm terrified right now. And I'm a little bit tired, but mostly terrified.

Mommy, how dare I? I'm on my period. I had to change a tampon, okay? She wasn't budging. She made it clear that she wasn't gonna leave the bathroom. And I don't have all day. I have shit to do. So I proceeded to change my tampon, and she saw it. And as soon as she saw it, she looked me in the eye and asked me why I had a rat in my ass. And I didn't know what to say. So in that moment, I thought it was a good idea to explain to a three year old what a period was. And at the end of my whole speech, I'm feeling good, like I'm doing a good job. And I end it with, and one day you're gonna get one, too. And all she took out of that conversation is that she's gonna get a rat in her ass. And she keeps checking in between my legs for rats, and there are no rats in my Ass. I am not housing a rodent in my anal cavity. And I don't know how to make that clear to her. I don't know how to undo what I did. And I can't take her out in public because the first person she sees, she's gonna tell him that I have rats in my ass. And one day, she's gonna have rats in her ass. And that's a CPS call if I've ever heard one. God, am I fucking this kid up. How do I undo what I did? She's not gonna forget. I think we have to stay inside for the next two years. Yeah, that sounds good. Send help.

The other night, me and my wife, we. We having a nice discussion, and I got it in the arsenal. I got it in the back pocket just in case. We having a smooth conversation, things kind of get hot and heavy, like, we. We yapping at each other, and I looked her dead in the eyes and I said, can you just calm down? Honest reaction. She was doing something that said, I am calm. Don't tell me to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. I'm calm in my mind. I was like, one Mississippi, two Mississippi. She didn't blink for, like, 27 Mississippi and never broke eye contact and just stared at me like a psychopath. Why y'all. Why. Why y'all women like that? Calm down. That just a.

And apparently these are supposed to be super cleanly because you can continuously clean them and reuse them. you don't have to keep buying a bunch of puffs that contain bacteria and, like, hold on to all of that. I mean, it looks a little strange. It kind of looks like a, um. Never mind. But. But she's working well, so you know what? If the payout is worth it. Looking a little odd, I don't necessarily care. I mean, it's really saying no streaks at all. Super pale right now, too. I promise this is my normal color, but I have self Tanner on, so that's why my neck is so much darker than the foundation. But, like, she covered everything very well. Again, weird. Looks like a little arrow or like, you know, a dolphin or something. But she worked pretty decently, so I honestly think I would use this again. I'm not gonna lie. Have you guys tried one of these? Have. What are your thoughts?

No, I can't go underwater or else it gets trapped behind my ear tooth. Also to the person on Twitter who said I wasn't getting enough action, so my body had to start boning itself. That was mean.

Don't fuck with a woman who can take shots of tequila, whiskey or vodka straight without cringing. Excuse me, sir. I'm I'm sorry. What does anybody else see the problem here? No, let me break it down. for those of you that have never worked in a bar or restaurant before, in this gorgeous ass bottle we have Clase Azul Reposado Tequila. It's probably some of the most delicious tequila you will ever have in your whole life. It's because it tastes like cream soda. The problem that I'm having right here and right there and right there is it total wine this cost $250 at a restaurant for a shot. It's anywhere from like 80 to $120. So the problem is not only are you letting this super delicious tequila drip down to the floor and go to waste which party foul, but because it tastes like cream soda, anybody could knock that back. You ain't bad and bougie girl, you just bougie but high key I respect the flex. So until you can take shots of tequila, vodka or whiskey from those cheap 15 dollar plastic bottles from the grocery store or the questionable jungle juice of fraternity parties, then you can come talk to me.

Free food. Don't have to tell me twice. So I get in there. There's some leftover chick fil A sandwiches. Warm that up. And there's some leftover baked beans in a Crock Pot. Warm that up. Go on with my day. Delicious. All of it delicious. Today I'm sitting at the nurse's station, and my friend Mary says to me, Jen, did you ever get your crock pot? What Crock Pot? She said, you remember when you. Do you remember when we had barbecue last month and you brought the baked beans? No. What baked beans? What Crock Pot? Oh, well, they're in the break room.

It is not so. I shall explain. So today I'm in a taxi. Sometimes I like to pretend I have a chauffeur. I'm in the backseat next to a woman. In the front is a gentleman. At the junction, he gets out and up comes the most immaculately dressed businessman I have seen in ages. Hair beautifully coiffed. Makeup, flawless suit, crisp shoes. Face. She was fabulous. However, as soon as she got in, the atmospheric integrity of the vehicle was immediately con promised. One minute I'm breathing normally, the next minute I'm like. Because she has stored my windpipe. The passenger next to me has slapped her hand over her nose so forcefully she pitched me her glasses. The smell was like wet carpet and cabbage. You stink. Could gag a maggot. In an effort to find some relief, I flung the upper part of my body out the back window like a Labrador. Hoping that the breeze will bitch slap some clean air into my face so that I can breathe again. However, it is at this juncture that drive got a whiff. So in his shock, he jerked the wheel, which flung me back into the smoke of death. Where once again, my nose hairs tried to rip themselves out of my nostrils in an effort to get away from the stink that the jump start a vomit. Long story short, drive told the woman that she was phoning up his vehicle. She said he was smiling his top lip and so admitted an orchestra of curses back and forth. He pulled over and put her out. I, however, stayed in the vehicle to go right back home, hoping and praying that my domestic violence relationship with Russell wasn't on hiatus because I would need to take an hour long shower. And if not, I will be diving head first into my rain bucket, legs up in the air like a stance, because I am sure that woman's stink was all over me. People, please wash your clothes. Please and thanks.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped it. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She's spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly. This whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me. He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck. Caroline, you can't just take her! Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled.

It's about the look, she said. So I bought a ticket to Bali with the money I saved on her gift. When I posted my trip photos, the comments flooded in and so did her text. Full of rage, my sister Maggie called me over to discuss bridesmaid duties. Instead, she sat me down. Kylie, you can't be my maid of honour anymore. What? Why? It's about the look I'm going for. My photographer cost $5,000. She avoided my eyes. You're just not bridesmaid material. You don't photograph well. Are you saying I'm not pretty enough for your wedding? I need bridesmaids who fit the aesthetic. Annie, Mallory and Claire all have that classic beauty look. You're more artsy. The cruelty was breathtaking. I still want you at the wedding. You can help coordinate behind the scenes. She wanted me as her free wedding planner while prettier friends stood in the photos that night. I calculated everything I'd spent. Engagement party, $350. Bridal shower, two hundred eighty dollars. Vegas bachelorette party, seven hundred fifty dollars. The 450 dollar Kitchen Aid mixer, over two thousand dollars. Celebrating someone who thought I wasn't pretty enough, I cancelled the wedding gift order and looked at flights to Bali, a three week trip for exactly two thousand two hundred dollars. Perfectly using up all the wedding money. I booked it that night. The next morning I called Maggie. I won't be Available to coordinate. I'll be in Bali for three weeks starting the Monday before your wedding. You're going to miss my wedding for a vacation. Maggie, you made it clear my presence isn't important. So I decided to treat myself. But you're my sister, important enough to stand beside you. Silence. Have a beautiful wedding, Maggie. I'm sure your aesthetic will be perfect. Bali was magical. I did sunrise yoga, explored temples, Learned to surf and met incredible people. I felt beautiful not because of looks but because of feeling strong, independent, adventurous, posted photos regularly. Each post got more engagement than I'd ever received. Posts were getting 200 likes with friends commenting about how radiant I looked. On Maggie's wedding day, I posted a Sunset Beach photo in a flowing white dress, golden skin, beach waves, genuinely glowing. The caption, sometimes the best decision is choosing yourself. Beauty comes from feeling confident and free. Within 2 hours, it had more likes and comments than anything I'd shared. You look absolutely.

I was gutted, but I agreed to look for alternative housing. That's when things got interesting. Two weeks after the intervention, mom noticed $500 missing from the emergency cash in their bedroom safe. Then dad couldn't find his Rolex, the one his father had left him. Then Mom's pearl necklace vanished. They thought they were going crazy, misplacing things without telling anyone. Dad installed a tiny camera in their bedroom, focused on the safe. Monday morning, dad checked the camera footage. There was Emma during dinner, slipping upstairs while everyone was distracted. She went straight to their bedroom, used a key she'd apparently copied open the safe, and took $300 cash, plus Mom's antique emerald ring. She even took two bottles of Dad's oxycodone from his back surgery. My parents were destroyed. But instead of confronting her immediately, they decided to investigate further. Dad hired a private investigator. What they found was staggering. Emma had told everyone in her adoption trauma support group that our parents were abusive, that they treated her like a servant while lavishing money on their real daughter. She started a gofundme called Help Emma Escape her adoptive abusers that had raised $8,000. She was selling mom's jewelry on Facebook Marketplace. She was also selling dad's pain medication to her yoga friends. The confrontation happened at what Emma thought was going to be another intervention. She brought Dr. Morrison again, plus a social worker she convinced that our parents were Being abused by me. She'd even called Adult Protective Services. Emma walked in with a whole speech prepared about how she'd found the courage to report me, how she was saving our parents from their codependent relationship with their biological daughter. That's when dad connected his laptop to the TV and started playing the footage. The. The room went silent as we watched Emma stealing from the safe. Then the Facebook Marketplace listings, then screenshots of her gofundme. The social worker immediately started taking different notes. Emma went white, then red, then started sobbing. This is. This is entrapment, she screamed. You set me up because you love Rebecca more. You've always loved her more. Emma turned to the social worker. They're abusing me. This is abuse. I'm adopted, and they're framing me. The social worker closed her notebook. Ma'am, I've just watched you commit theft, fraud, and drug distribution on video. The only call I'm making is to the police. Emma ran, literally ran out of the house. The police were already on their way. Dad had called them before the meeting. She was arrested at her friend's apartment, trying to flush the rest of dad's pills. They charged her with theft, fraud, possession with intent to distribute, and filing false reports.

I gave her a home in jail instead. When I got into the school play, Emma suddenly developed a passion for theatre and needed private acting lessons. When I made the honor role, Emma claimed I was pressuring her academically and needed a tutor to catch up from her trauma. When I got into medical school and needed to live at home to save money, Emma said I was robbing her of her safe space. My parents bent over backwards for Emma. They paid for her to study abroad in Paris. She dropped out after two months. They bought her a car when she said public transport triggered her abandonment issues. They funded her photography business, her jewelry making phase, her life coaching certification and her yoga instructor training. None of it stuck. Meanwhile, I was working three jobs to pay for my MCAT prep, studying until 3:00am and still helping mom with dinner every night. But according to Emma, I was the problem. Everything exploded. Six months ago, I was in my final year of medical school, doing rotations at the hospital 80 hours a week, barely sleeping, surviving on coffee and whatever mom left for me in the fridge. Emma had just been evicted from her apartment for not paying rent. She showed up at family dinner with a therapist, an actual therapist she'd convinced to come to our house for an intervention. Doctor Morrison Is here to facilitate a healing conversation, Emma announced, about how Rebecca's presence in this house is preventing me from processing my adoption trauma. My parents were stunned. The therapist, who looked deeply uncomfortable, pulled out notes that were clearly all from Emma's perspective. Emma feels that Rebecca's continued presence in the family home at age 28 is creating an unbalanced dynamic that triggers her abandonment wounds. The therapist read, she needs a safe space to rebuild her relationship with her adoptive parents without the biological child's overshadowing presence. I'm here because medical school is expensive, I said. Slowly. I pay rent. I buy groceries. I'm barely here except to sleep. That's exactly the problem, Emma cried. You're the perfect daughter, even when you're absent. How am I supposed to compete with that? Nobody's asking you to compete, mom said gently. You don't understand, Emma screamed. She's your real daughter. I'll always be the charity case you took in. The therapist suggested that maybe I could temporarily relocate to give Emma space to heal. My parents desperate to help. Emma actually asked if I consider stay.

So I texted the family group chat, hey, my surgery is on the 12th. Just need someone to pick me up. Shouldn't take more than an hour.

When I woke up, groggy and nauseous afterward, I checked my phone. No messages, no good luck. No how are you feeling? Just Chloe's Instagram story, her sipping from a coconut on a beach with the caption hashtag Cabo vibes. I Threw up into the hospital trash can. Nurse Carla rubbed my back.

We told her you were discharged and went home.

So I sold it to his ex wife for $1 instead. My grandmother rose owned a beautiful beach house in Martha's Vineyard that she bought in 1973 for $30,000. It's now worth at least $800,000, probably more. When she passed last year, she left it to me, her only grandchild, who spent every summer with her there since I was 5. Derek, my mother's nephew, has always believed he's entitled to everything our family owns. When my parents bought a new car, he demanded their old one for practically free. When I graduated from culinary school, he insisted I cater his wedding at cost. When grandma was alive, he'd visit once a year, take photos for Instagram, then leave after two hours. Meanwhile, I was driving up every other weekend to check on her, fix things around the house and make sure she was taking her medications. But there was someone else helping too, someone I didn't know about until after grandma died. At the funeral, Derek cornered me immediately. So about the Beach house, family meeting tomorrow to discuss the transition. What transition, I asked. Well, obviously, you're going to sell it to me. I'm prepared to offer $50,000 cash. That's more than generous for the family. I actually laughed. Derek, that house is worth nearly $1 million. Exactly why you don't need it, he said smoothly. You're single. You rent an Apartment. I have a family, three kids who deserve to grow up with beach access. Besides, family helps family, right? Grandma would want her great grandchildren to enjoy it. Grandma left it to me. If she wanted you to have it, she would have left it to you. His face barked. We'll see about that. Two weeks later, I got a call from my lawyer. Derek had submitted documents to the probate court claiming he was a co owner of the property, complete with a deed from 2,018 that supposedly showed grandma had given him 50% ownership. The only problem, the notary stamp was from a notary who lost their license in 2,016. While my lawyer handled the fraud attempt, I started going through grandma's things at the beach house. That's when I found them. Dozens of thank you cards all addressed to Sarah Angel, each one thanking her for groceries.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. Parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favourite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favour by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you'd do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the cloud.

I taught 5th grade for a few years and had to stay up really late one night to grade some essays. I was exhausted, but I remember reading one of them and couldn't believe what I saw. I told my class to write about a funny story, and this girl, Kelly, wrote about how her mom had almost killed her. She said her mom woke her and her brothers up one morning yelling at them because someone ate a candy from her room. All of them denied it, so they had to stand in a corner until one of them admitted they had eaten it. After an hour, nobody said anything. So their mom stepped it up. She was determined to find who did it, so she made all of them drink an entire cup of salt water until they vomited. She said her throat hurt so much she started crying. I couldn't believe I was reading this and thought she had to have been making it up. I knew her mom and she seemed so nice. She said whoever ate it would have to sleep outside that night. And when she was about to get another glass salt water, her brother stepped up. He said he took it and her mom was furious. She was literally moving his bed outside. But as she did, their dad came home and had no idea what was going on when he Found out it was because of the candy. He told them he was the one who ate it. This was supposed to be her funny story. This girl was 9 and there was no way she was making this up. I couldn't just go to bed. So I called and woke our student advisor up and read her essay word for word over the phone. She, too, didn't believe it was real. So we asked her about it the next day at school. Apparently she just thought it was a funny story and didn't think her mom was being too mean. We had to report, but as soon as someone went out to talk to her parents, she took her daughter out of the school. I hope she's doing okay. Update, I just saw her on the news. She was arrested and put in jail last.

I smirked, paid my tab and walked out. 10 minutes later, she was frantically calling as her friends vanished and left her with the entire 800 dollar Bill script. I've been dating Kendra for four months. Last Friday was supposed to be drinks downtown, just the two of us. I arrived at eight PM to find her already there with five other people, three women, two guys I'd never met. Babe, you made it. She kissed my cheek. These are my friends from my Pilates studio. Weird that she didn't mention bringing people, but whatever. I'm social. We got a big table. Everyone started ordering appetizers, entrees, desserts, the works. One friend, Tiffany, ordered an 85 dollar bottle of wine for herself. Within an hour, the Bill was at 600 dollars and climbing. Her friends were treating this like their personal party, ordering rounds of 18 hour cocktails like water. I pulled Kendra aside. Hey, what's the deal? This, this is getting expensive. She laughed. Don't worry about it. Who's paying for all this? That's when she dropped it loud enough for everyone to hear. Obviously you are. If you can't pay for all my friends drinks, you're not a real man. That's basic boyfriend stuff. The whole table went quiet. Tiffany smirked and said, yeah, my boyfriend always covers everyone when we go out. I looked at Kendra, she was dead serious. Good To know, I said. I stood up, walked to the bar and closed out my tab. Just what I'd ordered, two beers, $24 with tip, paid it. What are you doing, Kendra asked. Fused. Being real with myself, I said. Then I walked out. My phone started blowing up before I reached my car. I didn't answer, just drove home. Ten minutes later, Kendra sent a frantic voice message. She was screaming the moment I left, her friends suddenly remembered they had other places to be. Every single one vanished, leaving her with an 800+ Bill that was still growing because they'd ordered more drinks right before I left. The best part, she didn't have her credit card. She'd left it at home because, quote, from her text, I knew you'd be paying like a real man should. She had to call her roommate to bring her card. At ten PM on a Friday, Saturday morning, I woke up to 52 missed calls, not just from Kendra but from her mom. Her mom left a voicemail. You abandoned my daughter at a restaurant with a Bill she couldn't pay. You need to Venmo her $863. 47 and right now and apologize. Eight hundred sixty three point fourty seven seven. They calculated it down to the penny. Then Kendra texted from her roommate's phone, I had to use my rent money to pay that Bill. You need to pay me back. This is literally theft. I'm giving you one chance. 863 0, 47+, $200 for emotional distress. Emotional distress. She wanted damages because I wouldn't pay for her friends drinks. Sunday afternoon, she showed up at my apartment with her roommate and some guy trying to look intimidating. They were banging on my door. I watched through my ring camera as.

I texted our family group chat emergency appendectomy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote, got it. My four year old son Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when dad he was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at 5:00am was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Mrs. Chen, my seventy four year old neighbor, at her door in her bathrobe. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for 18 hours. When I I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Missus Chen in her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was Finally stable enough to Facetime. Max sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple procedure. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with crying, laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo. A family friend, Mrs. Rodriguez from church had in the story and called Mom in a panic. Why is Little Mac staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Mac stayed elsewhere. But Mrs. Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away from his

Back in college, there was this guy named Steve who lied about everything. Not small stuff, either. This dude claimed he turned down the Olympics because he wasn't in the mood to be famous. But one day, the wildest thing happened in history class. We were talking about major tech company when Steve casually goes, fun fact, my great great grandfather actually created Google, but the government erased him from the records. The entire room went dead silent. Someone finally asked, you mean Larry Page and Sergey Brin? Steve just shook his head and said, nah, that's what they want you to think. The truth's been buried. You'll only find what they want you to see. Even the professor looked confused. Steve, do you even know how Google works? He replied, yeah, my grandpa invented the algorithm. They just renamed it and erased us. The class exploded. People were crying, laughing. Even the professor had to turn around to hide his face. But Steve wasn't done. He stood up and said, swear on my life, I've got proof at home. Someone asked, okay then, if your family made Google, what exactly did they invent? Steve, dead serious, says they figured out how to make computers think like humans. It was called G1. Someone in the back yells, bro, what are you even saying? Steve's face turned red, but instead of backing down, double down! Started yelling about how history Is fake. How? His family has the real files. And then ran out of the classroom. The next day, he showed up with some printed out document in old cursive and went, this document proves it. It's from the original Google files. That's when it all fell apart. One guy in the back pulled out his phone, reverse search the image, and the first result that popped up was a Pinterest post titled Old Looking Tech Documents for Aesthetic School Projects. The whole class erupted. Even the professor lost it. One guy yelled, bro, found this on Tumblr. Steve turned bright red and shouted, you're all brainwashed! Then stormed out. We never saw him in that class again.

It cost me an entire year of my life. If I hadn't gotten a second chance, I wouldn't still be alive. It was a hot and humid summer day in Manhattan. I was making my way through the park on the way to grab lunch with some of my coworkers. That's when I saw her. She was breathtaking. She was sitting on the park bench reading. She looked up at me as I walked by and then looked back down at the book. It was odd. She seems sort of familiar to me. I continued on, but about 10 seconds after passing her, I realized that I didn't know her. She knew my friend Jack from college and we had met briefly at a party a few years back. As I turned around to take another look and confirm, I caught her in the middle of her own double take. I decided that lunch could wait and made a complete 180 and walked right back over to her. Maria, right? Yes. You're Kevin, Jack's friend. I knew you seemed familiar. I guess I couldn't recognize you in that suit, she replied, setting down her book. What are you doing now that we graduated? Must be something in business. Based on the suit, proudly, I told her, investment banking. It's only my second week, but it is very exciting. How about you? Ooh. So you've sold your soul. Just kidding. But I have Heard those hours are rough. As for me, I'm a photographer. It's always been my passion and now it's my job and I love it, she said. And then she looked me in the face and cracked a smile. Her smile was white in her golden brown face and her eyes had the same color as her skin. She really was beautiful. I could feel my throat start to swell a bit and my heart was beating faster. I looked at my watch and saw that I was tight on time. I very much wanted to see more of Maria, but I also knew that she was right and that I would have very demanding hours. In my mind at the time, I didn't have time to take any interest in women, so no point in asking for her number. Even now I cringe at how foolish and short sighted I was. So we said our goodbyes and I went to lunch with my co workers. Over the next few months, I became more and more disillusioned with my job. Now that I was there in the office, the work just wasn't as interesting as I imagined it would be. It was mostly making insignificant edits on Powerpoints at the whim of my more senior colleagues. And the hours were long. It felt like I wasn't even living anymore, just working. Often as I would lay in bed before I went to sleep, I would think about Maria. Why hadn't I just asked for her number. What was I afraid of? I imagined if they wrote a book about me that it would be perhaps the most boring book ever written. I'd much rather read a book about the man who had asked for Maria's number, maybe even asked her out on a date right then and there in the park. But that was in the past and there was no way to find her again. Now, one day I was in the office and it just became too much. I overheard a senior colleague talking about his divorce and then another discussing how he hadn't seen his kids in over a week. They had a laugh and got back to work. I was sick to my stomach. Was that the life I was working for? I told my associate that I was heading out to grab some lunch. He seemed a bit annoyed that I would leave the office rather than order in, but I didn't really care. I walked outside and went to the park and sat on the bench, the same one Maria was sitting in that summer day. I looked out at the park and thought to myself, an entire year has passed and you don't have anything to show for it. Nothing in your life has really changed. Your only new memories are from work and those all sort of blend into one. It was at that moment I saw her. She was breathtaking. It Was Maria. I waved to get her attention and she saw me and walked over. Hey, long time no see, Mr Banker. How are you? If I'm being honest, you look a bit down today. I smiled and said, just a bad day at work.

My parents stole my entire life savings to buy a retirement condo in Florida. 11:00am, banking alerts cascading down my phone. Payment failed, insufficient funds. The caterer, florist, capital deposit, all bouncing. I open my banking app. The wedding account that held $127,000 yesterday was empty. Balance zero. I called them, mom, dad, straight to voicemail. They took it, I whispered to Claire. All of it working three jobs through college. 5:00am, diner shifts, late nights, tutoring every holiday, waiting tables while friends vacationed, all for this day. For them to steal it, they see you as their retirement plan, not their daughter. Claire said, what about that family trust, the papers your dad made you sign? The memory hit me. Dad's office, pile of documents. It's for emergencies. Eliza puts you in charge if something happens to me or your mom. I'd signed without reading, trusting like a naive daughter. When dad finally picked up, his voice was laced with fake, syrupy concern. Eliza, honey, there's been a terrible financial emergency here at home. We can't make it to the wedding. Behind his voice, I heard it clearly, seagulls crying, ocean waves crashing against the shore. They weren't at home dealing with an emergency. They were in Florida on vacation.

Nicholas saw the hesitation in my eyes. This isn't revenge, Eliza. This is rescue. I transferred $127,000 from the trust back to my wedding account. Transfer complete. Emailed vendors proof. Put phone on silent. Fix my veil. I have a wedding to get to. Two days later in Santorini, my phone expl loaded. Dad's voice Frantic. Eliza, what did you do? $127,000 is missing from our retirement. Nicola took the phone. You're speaking to my wife. Lower your voice. I moved my money back. You said the trust was for emergencies. My wedding being sabotaged by my parents was an emergency.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. I took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his B M W. Keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up From making his favourite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked in, died, pulled up my phone and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the LOUD. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it. Not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighbourhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3:00am, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his Friend to brag about teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said the damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's

I used to live with my best friend in college, and we heard that someone had just moved next to us after leaving a mental hospital. After a week, someone started repeatedly ringing our doorbell, and my roommate answers to a man who immediately makes her uncomfortable. Told her he cut his hand and needed a band aid, but his hands were clearly fine. She just kindly told him she couldn't help, and he goes, okay, can I measure something in your bedroom? She slammed the door shut, and thankfully he left. About two weeks went by until I woke up one morning to our doorbell constantly ringing again. I looked out into the hall and saw him through the window. I woke my roommate up and told that the Band Aid man was back, and she went out to see what he wanted. She slightly opened our door, and when she did, he instantly tried to push it open further. He asked if he could use our bathroom, and she shut and locked the door before calling the police. They took forever to get there, and by the time they did, he was gone. They couldn't do anything and told us, call them again if anything happens. Two days later, something did happen. I woke up to the sound of something thumping and thought someone was shaking off a carpet or something. When I got out of bed to see What it was, I realised it was something much, much worse. I could see him through our front window and saw he was throwing all his weight against our front door. I ran to tell my roommate to call the police, but as she did, the sound stopped. I didn't believe he had just left out of nowhere, so I started looking around our house. When I opened one window, he was hiding right in front of it. He turned and saw me and immediately went back to trying to break our door down. I could now see him and saw he was holding something. When I looked closer, I realised it was an axe. I was praying the door would hold up, but then heard the police yell at him to stop. They put him in the back of their car and told us he had apparently slashed all of our tires so we couldn't leave and waited outside our house since 3:00am. We moved out shortly after that.

I taught 10th grade English and out of nowhere, one of my best students suddenly just stopped showing up. After a week, someone from our school was finally able to reach his mom and found out that him and his dad got into a car crash and his dad had died. He was out of school for two months but eventually came back. He was really struggling and always got straight A's before that. So after class one day, I told him not to worry about any of the work because he had already passed the state exam and was a good student. He was really thankful. But a few weeks later, I got called into the counselor's office. I walked in to see him sitting there with his other teachers and I soon found out he was failing their classes. They were trying to make him do all the work he missed, which probably wasn't even possible. And if he couldn't, he'd have to repeat the entire year. They checked his grades and saw he had an a in my class. One of his other teachers, who I knew didn't like me, started arguing with me, saying I can't just give him a free pass and not let him learn anything. He asked why I was called here since I wasn't even trying to teach him anything. This was all unbelievable to me. I tried to stay calm. But said, the kid's dad just fucking died. Do you really think your history class matters to him in the slightest? They both just stared at me. The counselor suddenly smiled and said, that's why I called Mister Carter here today, because I knew he'd say some things I'm not allowed to.

Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang through the window. I could see a young woman with Mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said. Walking toward the door, I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah finally found her voice. You planned this whole thing. You gave me six months to prepare after I took that DNA test. I shrug. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone. I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint. Jessica's a pediatric nurse, I announced carefully. She brought cookies she baked herself. Isn't that sweet? Jessica smiled nervously at the shocked faces. I hope I'm not intruding, Jake said. This was a good time to meet everyone. Oh, it's perfect timing, I said. Sarah here was just questioning whether I belonged in this family. Turns out the real question is whether this living room is big enough for all of Mom's children. My phone buzzed. Oh, Michael just landed. He'll be here in 30 minutes. I looked around at their devastated faces. You know, What? I think I'll go help Jessica bring in her luggage. She's staying for the week. As we walked outside, Jessica whispered, are they always this quiet? Don't worry, I said, glancing back at the chaos through the window. They're just processing some new family dynamics. By the way, Michael's bringing his twin daughters. They're 8 and absolutely adorable. Jessica's eyes lit up. I've always wanted nieces. Well, you're about to have plenty of family, I said. Emma has two little boys and David mentioned he has a teenage son who's excited to meet everyone. Through the window, I could see Sarah trying to fan mom with a Christmas card while dad paced around the living room like a caged animal. Should we go back in? Jessica asked. Look, I'm concerned. Let's give them another minute, I said. They're still adjusting to the fact that they're black sheep. Just became the family detective. Sometimes the truth doesn't just set you free, it redefines everyone's understanding of what family really means.

Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's clothes sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face Crum fold with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one big happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs.

Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back 6 months, beach trips, romantic dinner dates, family. Photos with my son. How did you even, she sent it by complete accident. Meant to send it to her sister, not our old college group chat. Funny how technology works against cheater. Marcus sank heavily into the couch, burying his head in his hands. I swear I never meant for any of this to happen, but it did happen. And now you get to explain to our son why daddy lied about where they were going every single weekend. The next morning, the family court judge granted me temporary full custody. Marcus got supervised visits exactly twice a week. Six months later, Ethan asked me out of nowhere, mom, are you actually happier now? I looked at my son, really looked at him and realized he was, too. Sometimes the best birthday gift is discovering who you really married. And sometimes it's discovering who you really are when you finally stop making excuses for the people who hurt you most. The woman who used to wait up with dinner, she's gone forever. And I've never missed her for a single second.

My sister and I instantly forgot all all about the shouting and got really excited. He told us not to worry and that his sleigh had crashed into the snow outside. The shouting were just kind police officers that were helping him dig it out of the snow. He brought us presents to open and sang Christmas songs until the sirens were gone. he said he had to go back to delivering presents for the other kids. I went to sleep that night thinking I was The luckiest kid ever. But it wasn't until I was 17 that I Learned what really happened.

Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently, there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang. Through the window, I could see a young woman with Mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said, walking toward the door. I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah finally found her voice. You planned this whole thing? You gave me six months to prepare after I took that DNA test. I shrugged. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in, looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone. I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard, his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint. Jessica's a pediatric nurse, I announced carefully. She brought cookies she baked herself. Isn't that sweet? Jessica smiled nervously at the shocked faces. I hope I'm not intruding. Jake said this was a good time to meet everyone. Oh, it's perfect timing, I said. Sarah here was just questioning whether I belonged in this family. Turns out the real question is whether this living room is big enough for all of Mom's children. My phone buzzed. Oh, Michael just landed. He'll be here in 30 minutes. I looked around at their devastated faces. You know, What? I think I'll go help Jessica bring in her luggage. She's staying for the week. As we walked outside, Jessica whispered, are they always this quiet? Don't worry, I said, glancing back at the chaos through the window. They're just processing some new family dynamics. By the way, Michael's bringing his twin daughters. They're 8 and absolutely adorable. Jessica's eyes lit up. I've always wanted nieces. Well, you're about to have plenty of family, I said. Emma has two little boys, and David mentioned he has a teenage son who's excited to meet everyone. Through the window, I could see Sarah trying to fan mom with a Christmas card while dad paced around the living room like a caged animal. Should we go back in? Jessica asked. Look, I'm concerned. Let's give them another minute, I said. They're still adjusting to the fact that they're black sheep. Just became the family detective. Sometimes the truth doesn't just set you free. It redefines everyone's understanding of what family really means.

Wish I could help. I say genuinely meaning it. I liked the Hollowgate team. By 10:45, Marcus, our CEO, is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM, Hollowate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excused themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options. At noon, Jessica calls me directly, voice shaking. Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work notes purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities, trying to spin the disaster as strategic plan. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences. Even our supplier in Germany asking If we were still operational by four PM after a promising interview with Drift Shade, I had my answer to Jessica's sabotage accusation. I hadn't sabotaged anything. I'd please taking my knowledge with me when they showed me the door. Monday morning, I accepted drip shades offer, Senior Director of Client Relations, 35% salary increase, equity options and a signing bonus. Wednesday, Beth texted me, hollowgate canceled their contract. They're switching to Drift Shade. Also, Jessica got fired. Marcus discovered she'd been inflating her performance metrics for months. Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowgate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

When I was 8, my dad had this weird rule about the garage. We weren't allowed in there after dark, ever. He said it was dangerous because of the tools and chemicals. But something about how he said it made me not believe him. Every night at exactly ten PM, I'd hear him go out there. The garage door would creak open, then silence for about an hour. Then he'd come back inside. I tried asking mom about it once. She just looked away and said dad needed his alone time. But kids notice things adults think they don't. Like how dad's hands were always dusty when he came back. Or how he'd sometimes have tiny cuts on his fingers. Or how he'd smell like sawdust mix with something else I couldn't name. One night when I was 11, I decided to peek. I waited until I heard the garage door closed, then snuck to the window. But the windows were covered with black paper. From the inside, I could see light coming from underneath, shadows moving, and hear this steady scraping sound, like sandpaper on wood. Over and over. I got brave and tried the side door. Once locked, I checked under the workbench outside for a spare key. I even climbed on the AC unit to look through a crack in the roof. All I could see was dad hunched over something, his back to me, working. With his hands. This went on for years. Every single night. Even Christmas. Even when he was sick. Even the night grandma died and we got the call at dinner, he still went to the garage at ten PM. By high school, I'd given up trying to figure it out. I had other things to worry about. Friends, grades, girls. Garage mystery became just another weird thing about dad. Like how he always wore the same blue flannel on Sundays. Or never ate Mayo. I left for college at 18, got a degree, got a job, got married, visited home maybe twice a year. Dad was still going to the garage every night. Mom would just shrug when I brought it up. Some things never change. Then last year, dad had a heart attack. It was bad. He survived, but barely. The doctor said he needed to take it easy. No stress, no physical work. Mom called me crying, saying dad was depressed because he couldn't go to the garage anymore. I flew home to help out. One afternoon, while dad was napping, I found his keychain on the kitchen counter. There it was, A small brass key I'd never noticed before. My hands were shaking as I walked to the garage. The lock clicked open. I push the door and stepped inside. What I saw made me freeze. The walls were covered floor to ceiling with wooden dolls. Hundreds of them. All different sizes, different faces, different clothes. Each One carved by hand with incredible detail. Some were dancing, some sitting, some playing instruments. That wasn't the part that made me cry. In the center of the garage was a workbench. On it was a half finished doll. It was a little boy, about 8 years old, wearing a backwards baseball cap and holding a toy airplane. It was me. The same age I was when dad started going to the garage. I found a notebook on the bench. Inside were pages and pages of notes. Each doll had a date and a name. Mary from the grocery store, who always smiled. Bob from work, who got laid off. Missus Chen, who lost her husband. Every doll was someone from our town who was going through a hard time. At the bottom of each entry, dad had written the same thing. Delivered. I asked mom about it that night. She finally told me the truth. Dad had been secretly making these dolls and leaving them on people doorsteps when they needed them most. No note, no explanation. Just a small wooden figure that looked like them or their loved one doing something that made them happy. She showed me letters people had written to the local paper over the years about mysterious dolls that appeared right when they needed hope. How they treasured them, how they felt, seen. Dad never wanted credit. Never wanted thanks. He just spent every night for 30 years in that garage carving comfort for Strangers. The doll of me was the only one he never finished. Mom said he started it the night I told him I was too old to play catch. He'd been adding to it ever since, changing it as I grew up. Waiting for the right moment to give it to me. He's too weak to carve now. His hands shake too much. But I go to the garage every night at ten PM. I'm not as good as him yet. My dolls are rough, uneven. But I'm learning. Last week I finished my first one. A nurse from the hospital who held Dad's hand during his worst night. I left it on her doorstep this morning. I think dad would be proud, even if he never says it out loud. I finally understood why we couldn't go in the garage after dark. It wasn't because it was dangerous. It was because some mysteries are better left unsolved. Some magic only works in secret. And some father's love in ways too beautiful for work.

So you remember you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk and time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up. Mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests, you know, for science? The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said. Pulling out my phone and according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica. Been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name, same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born nine months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom, the one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you attended? Alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland, born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell? Is this the best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. tell me again about not being part of this family, because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda, 26 years of marriage and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages.

I was crying, begging her not to, but she wouldn't listen to me. I got a message from a girl the next day asking to come get her and she looked nice enough, so I gave her my address. That night I saw her car pull up, but when the door opened, it wasn't a girl. I immediately recognized him. This guy had stalked me multiple times in high school and would show up to our house before we moved. I immediately shut the door and told my mom about it. They were leaving for the night and I begged her to stay, but she didn't believe me. So now I was stuck home alone. I fell asleep crying because that was the last night I got to sleep with my cat. But about two hours later, I woke up to her jumping up on the bed. I thought she must have just heard something and tried to go back to sleep. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. I looked around the room and when I looked at my door, I saw it. This was the single creepiest thing I've ever seen because the same guy from earlier was now looking at me through my door, my Adrenaline instantly kicked in. I heard a really loud scream and after a second realised it was coming from me. I jumped up to shut my door, but he started pushing back. I couldn't even imagine what he was planning to do if he got inside. So I pushed as hard as I could before locking it. I had to grab my cat and climbed out my window to run to our neighbour's house. They called the police and my parents came home as quick as they could. We found where he broke our basement window to get inside and they arrested him the next day. But it was worth it because I got to keep my cat.

I taught 10th grade English and out of nowhere, one of my best students suddenly just stopped showing up. After a week, someone from our school was finally able to reach his mom and found out that him and his dad got into a car crash and his dad had died. He was out of school for two months but eventually came back. He was really struggling and always got straight A's before that. So after class one day, I told him not to worry about any of the work because he had already passed the state exam and was a good student. He was really thankful. But a few weeks later, I got called into the counselor's office. I walked in to see him sitting there with his other teachers and I soon found out he was failing their classes. They were trying to make him do all the work he missed, which probably wasn't even possible. And if he couldn't, he'd have to repeat the entire year. They checked his grades and saw he had an a in my class. One of his other teachers, who I knew didn't like me, started arguing with me, saying I can't just give him a free pass and not let him learn anything. He asked why I was called here since I wasn't even trying to teach him anything. This was all unbelievable to me. I tried to stay calm. But said, the kid's dad just fucking died. Do you really think your history class matters to him in the slightest? They both just stared at me. The counselor suddenly smiled and said, that's why I called Mister Carter here today, because I knew he'd say some things I'm not allowed to.

She'd pack my little suitcase, kiss my forehead and drive away fast. I loved it there. Aunt Sarah lived in this big house with a pool and a room just for toys. She'd let me eat ice cream for breakfast, stay up late watching cartoons, pick any movie I wanted. No rules, no bedtime, just fun. She'd take pictures of everything we did, me on the swings, me with chocolate on my face, me sleeping on the couch. Hundreds of photos every visit. I'd come home with stories about our adventures, the zoo trips, the arcade, the time she let me get three toys at the store. My friends were so jealous, they wanted an aunt like mine. Mom would listen to my stories, but her smile looked tight. She'd nod and say, that sounds nice, honey. Then she'd go quiet. But I was too happy to notice. This went on every summer until I turned 13. That year, mom said I was too old for sleepovers. Aunt Sarah called the house crying, begging to see me just one more time. Mom hung up on her. I was confused and angry. Why was she being so mean? Aunt Sarah was the best part of my summers. Twenty years later, I was helping mom move houses. In the garage, I found a box labeled Legal 2004. Inside were Court documents, custody papers, restraining orders, paid after page about a custody battle, about a woman trying to get visitation rights for a child that wasn't hers, about psychological evaluations, about supervised visits that were supposed to last two hours, not two weeks. I sat on the garage floor reading. Aunt Sarah wasn't my aunt. She was my biological mother. She'd lost custody when I was 3. Something about mental health, substance abuse, unfit living conditions. The court gave her supervised visits twice a year, but mom felt sorry for her, let her have more time. Those two weeks every summer weren't fun sleepovers. They were illegal visits mom allowed because she thought everyone deserved a second chance. I found the photos, too, the ones Aunt Sarah took, thousands of them, all organized by date and albums like evidence, like proof she was a good mother, like someday she'd use them in court to get me back. The back of one written in pen, my baby, Summer 2005. Soon I confronted mom that night. She looked exhausted. She told me Sarah called every week for 20 years asking about me. She said she almost lost custody herself for breaking the court order. She said Sarah seemed better during those visits, happy, stable, trying so hard. She said she did it because she thought I should know both mothers, even if I didn't know I had two. She said the photos were Sarah's way of holding onto something she couldn't have. I looked up Sarah online. She's living three hours away, same town, same house with the pool. Her Facebook is pub. Like. Every summer, she post old photos of a little kid eating ice cream, playing with toys, sleeping on a couch. The captions always say, missing my favourite visitor with a heart emoji. Her friends comment asking whose kid it is. She never answers. She just post another photo the next day.

I couldn't stand my son's new girlfriend. After my divorce, I'd watched him struggle through relationships with girls who treated him like an ATM. So when Maya showed up, I was ready. Designer purse, expensive highlights, checking her reflection in every surface. I saw dollar signs in her eyes. The moment she walked in, when she barely touched the lasagna I'd spent hours making, I rolled my eyes when she asked Jake about his promotion before even saying hello. I knew what she was after. My son worked at a tech startup, good money for his age. And Maya looked at him like he was her meal ticket. He started showing up more often, always during dinner, always with some story about being between jobs. Jake would pay for everything while she scrolled through shopping apps. I bit my tongue but kept track. One night she mentioned needing new tires. The next week, Jake mentioned his savings were getting low. I finally snapped when she asked to borrow his car for a job interview. Something felt wrong, so I did what any protective mom would do. I followed her. She drove straight to a nail salon and spent three hours getting a full set. No interview, just lies. I was ready to tell Jake everything, but when I got home, Maya's car was in the driveway with the hood up. Jake was teaching her how to check the oil. She had Grease on her designer jeans. Her manicure was ruined from holding the dipstick. That afternoon, Jake got called into an emergency meeting, a server crash. He'd be there all night. Maya offered to drop off his dinner. I watched her pack his favorite sandwich, extra pickles. I knew he hated mustard. Details I thought she'd never notice. Hours passed. Jake called to say he'd be even later. Maya stayed. She helped me clean the kitchen. We didn't talk much. Then around midnight, she asked if I had any old clothes. Her mom was sick. Chemo made her cold. She'd been using her unemployment checks for medical bills. The designer purse, a knockoff she bought before her mom got diagnosed. Job interview, she'd been too embarrassed to admit she got rejected before even walking in. The nail salon was her friend's shop. She was sweeping floors for cash. Jake texted at 2:00am, still at work. Maya was asleep on my couch. Her phone opened to job listings. Her search history showed budget grocery stores and cheap mechanics at shopping sites. The last text to her mom said, don't worry about rent. I'll figure it out. She started coming over during the day while Jake worked, not for dinner, to help me reorganize the garage, fix the squeaky cabinet, to teach me how to use Jake's old laptop. She never asked for anything. Three months later, Jake lost his job. The startup folded. He was devastated. I waited for Maya to disappear. Instead, she showed up with a printed spreadsheet of his expenses and three job leads she'd researched. He'd already updated his resume. That night. She told him she'd gotten a job at an accounting firm, entry level but steady. She could cover rent while he looked for something better. Jake tried to argue. She wouldn't let him. Now she owns that accounting firm, bought out her old boss last year. Jake works there, too. They have two kids who call me grandma sometimes. I watch her teaching them about money, real lessons, how to save, how to budget. Last week, she hired her mom as a receptionist. Permission now, full benefits. Maya still checks the oil in her car herself, still wears those same jeans with the grease stain, says they remind her of when everything changed. My son didn't marry a gold digger. He married pure gold. I just took a while to see the shine.

It's me, Jenny from Missus Parker's class. My stomach dropped. Jenny was my best friend in fifth grade. We shared lunches, past notes and promised to be friends forever. But when my family moved to a better neighbourhood, I got a new phone number and never called her again. I was 11 and embarrassed by where I came from. Oh my gosh, Jenny. I hugged her, noticing her worn clothes. How are you? Her smile faded a little. Getting by. Lost my apartment last month, been staying at the shelter with my kids.

That night I couldn't sleep. At 2:00am, I dug through old school boxes until I found our class photo. There we were, arms around each other, gap tooth smiles. Next morning I called the shelter. Jenny cried when I offered her my garage apartment. Until she got back on her feet, her two little boys looked just Like her, it's been three months. Jenny has a steady job now, and her boys call me Auntie M. Last weekend, we had a sleepover, just like when we were kids. Some friendships deserve a second chance.

When I was eight, I thought I was the luckiest kid alive. My mom finally let me go to my very first sleepover. It was at my friend Zoe's house, and her mom was what we all called a cool mom. She had this huge backyard with a trampoline, let us eat pizza for dinner, painted our nails in bright colours and even set up a little photo booth with props. I remember feeling so grown up, like I was part of something special. Zoe's house was the fun house. Her mom always had snacks, let us stay up late, never yelled when we were loud. It felt like everything there was a party. But what stands out the most from that night was something she called the sleepover folder. Before bedtime, Zoe's mom brought out this blue folder and had all six of us sit in a circle. She handed each of us a piece of paper and asked us to write down our emergency contacts, any allergies, and something she called a safe word. She explained in this calm, sweet voice that the safe word was just in case a different adult ever had to pick us up, like if there was a fire or if our parents couldn't make it. She said the word was something only we would know so we'd feel comfortable. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. None of The other sleepovers I'd heard about did anything like that. I wrote Down Butterfly as my word, since it was my favourite animal at the time. We all giggled, compared our words, and it felt like we were part of an exclusive little club. That night was magical. We played games, watched movies, laughed until our stomachs hurt. Zoe's mom even made us hot chocolate with marshmallows before bed.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her 5 year old daughter Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through. It was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee. We're like 30 people there grieving and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting quietly in the corner with Emma, both of them just completely destroyed. Kelly walks right up to them, sticks out her flat belly and says, me and Jake just found out I'm pregnant. And honestly, we're beside ourselves thinking about how something like this could happen to us, too. Rachel completely broke down, started sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. Emma got scared and started crying, too. Everyone in the room just stopped and stared. That's when I lost it. I stood up and said loud enough for everyone to hear, Kelly, no one gives a damn that you're pregnant. Look around you. This is a funeral for two babies and their father. You took that pregnancy test four days ago and you're acting like you're the first woman to ever get pregnant. Just leave. Kelly started crying and ran out. Jake. Followed her, but not before calling me a fat, bitter witch in front of everyone. My aunt had to comfort Rachel while my mom took Emma outside.

For weeks, it was all anyone could talk about. People were discussing what drinks to bring, whether to Uber together, planning their outfits, the whole nine yards. Everyone at the office got invited except me. At first, I thought maybe she just forgot to mention it to me. We weren't super close, but we'd always been friendly. I'd helped her move some boxes when she first got the place and she seemed genuinely grateful. We'd grab coffee sometimes and chat about weekend plans. But by Thursday, when people were still making detailed plans right in front of me, I started feeling pretty awkward. Tanya from HR was talking about bringing her famous spinach dip. Devon from it was coordinating a group Uber. Even the new intern got invited and she'd only been there 3 weeks. I didn't want to seem desperate by asking Brianna directly. So during my weekly 1 on one with my boss Monica, I casually brought it up. Hey, did you hear about Brianna's party this weekend? Sounds like it's going to be really fun. Monica looked genuinely surprised and set down her coffee mug. Oh, you didn't know Brianna specifically asked me not to invite you to any team social events. I felt like I've been slapped across the face. What? Why would she do that? Monica shifted uncomfortably in her Chair and started digitizing with her pen. She came to me last Monday pretty upset. She said you've been spreading rumors around the office about her relationship with Derek or marketing. She was really concerned about it affecting her professional reputation. I was completely floored. My mouth literally fell open. Monica, I barely even talked to Brianna outside of work stuff and I had absolutely no idea she was dating Derek. That's when Monica's expression completely changed. Her eyebrows shot up and she leaned forward across her desk. Wait, what did you just say? They're not dating. Derek is married with two young kids. I've met his wife, Renee, at company events. We both sat there in complete silence as the realization hit us at the exact same time. Anna wasn't trying to keep me away from her party because I was spreading rumors about her relationship. She was trying to isolate me because she thought I somehow knew about her affair with a married man and was going to expose it to the whole office. The next morning, Monica called Brianna into her office for what she diplomatically called a clarification meeting. I could see them through the glass walls of the conference room. Brianna kept gesturing wildly with her hands while Monica took careful notes with this increasingly stern look on her face. Brianna had been telling multiple people over the past two weeks that I was spreading malicious rumors about her personal life, trying to Poison the well before I could potentially say anything. But since I genuinely had no clue what was going on, her preemptive character assassination just made her look paranoid and vindictive. Monica ended up writing Brianna up.

So I changed my plans. Mom called, where are you? I laughed and advised not to wait. I'm 27 and make good money. But my family treats me like their personal childcare service. Every Saturday for months, my sister Maria would show up at 9:00am with her two kids, say the kids are excited to spend the day with their favorite aunt and disappear until eight PM for date nights. When I tried talking to Maria about a schedule, she got defensive. You don't have kids or a husband, so what else are you doing on Saturdays? When I brought it up to my parents, they sided with her. You're single. You don't have responsibilities like she does. My mother said taking care of Tommy and Sophia is the best preparation you could ask for. Three weeks before Christmas, my mother called asking me to handle catering. About 25 people total. Doing so well at your job and the rest of us are struggling financially. I agreed to pay the $2,000 because it was family. But the week before Christmas, everything changed. I stopped by my parents house when the restaurant called about a menu substitution. I was about to announce myself when I heard my mother on the phone. Oh, Linda, Camilla will be perfect for watching all the kids. We're going to set up the back bedroom upstairs and Camilla can stay up there with all nine children while we adults enjoy Christmas downstairs. My heart started racing. It's absolutely perfect. He continued laughing. Camilla doesn't have kids of her own, so she's not exhausted like us parents. We'll just stick all nine kids upstairs with Camilla and have a real adult Christmas Celebration with good wine and actual conversations. I backed toward the door quietly. They had planned this elaborate setup. I would pay nearly $2,000 for food and spend the entire holiday babysitting nine kids while everyone else celebrated downstairs. At night, I called the restaurant and canceled the entire catering order. Then I remembered my college friend Jessica had invited me to her family's mountain cabin in Colorado. December 24th arrived. I was at the cabin skiing when my phone started buzzing. Camilla, where are you? My mother's voice was sharp. Everyone is here waiting and the food was supposed to arrive an hour ago. I'm not coming to Christmas, Mom. I heard your phone conversation with Aunt Linda. I know about your plan to stick me upstairs with nine kids while everyone else enjoys Christmas. Dead silence. I don't know what you think you heard. You were laughing about dumping all the kids on me because I don't have children. You never plan to include me. You just wanted free babysitting. Maria grabbed the phone. What the hell is wrong with you? We plan to relax while you watch the kids.

He slept next to her hospital bed every night for six months. The police said they couldn't do anything since it was just a dog. Three days later, he stopped eating. The vet found internal bleeding. We had to put him down. I spent a week learning everything about that kid. Found out he was trying to get into med school. So I sent the torture video to every college he applied to. Then I forwarded it to his wrestling coach. He lost his scholarship. His rich parents had just bought him a brand new car for his acceptance letter. I posted the footage on the community Facebook page. His parents country club kicked him out. His girlfriend who volunteered at the animal shelter keyed his new car before dumping him. But that wasn't enough. I waited until his life fell apart completely. That's when I sent the video to his job at the hospital. Now he'll never be a doctor.

But she called the cops on me and this happened. I'm 18 now, but this nightmare started when I was 7. My parents had me when they were basically kids. We lived with my grandparents initially, which were the best years of my childhood. Everything changed when my parents moved us to a cramped rental house because mom was pregnant with kid No. 2. I was excited about having a sibling until I realized what my new role would be. The progression was gradual but relentless. Started with little helps. Grab a diaper, keep your brother quiet. But by age 8, these became expectations. I was changing diapers, handling feedings and basically raising my brother while my parents collapsed on the couch claiming they were too exhausted from work. Date nights meant being left alone with a screaming toddler armed with instructions like I was hired help, except I wasn't getting paid and couldn't quit. Anything went wrong, it was my fault for not being responsible enough. Over the next 11 years, five more kids joined our household, Screamer, Destroyer, Spitter, Tornado, Velcro and Hurricane. Each new edition meant more responsibilities dumped on me. My parents logic, you're so good with kids. Translation, we're too lazy to parent, so that's your job. The breaking point came during my junior year. Instead of putting Hurricanes crib in their room like normal humans, stuck It in mind their justification, you're so good with babies and we really need our sleep for work. So at 16, I became a single dad to my infant sister. 2:00am feedings, diaper changes, walking the floor for hours trying to get her back to sleep, all while trying to maintain decent grades. My GPA dropped from solid B+ to barely maintaining a C average. When my guidance counselor called home about my grades, my mom said I was going through a rebellious phase, staying up too late playing video games. Video games? I hadn't touched a controller in months. The final slap came when I got accepted to a competitive engineering summer program that could have boosted my college applications. My parents response, who's going to watch the kids while we work? They flat out refused to let me go. Last month, my parents dropped their atomic bomb. During a family meeting, mom announced she was pregnant again. Lucky No. 7. But the way my dad phrased it made everything crystal clear. We're going to need extra help when the baby comes. Good thing you're 18 now so you can take on more responsibility without any legal issues. Legal issues? They'd actually thought about the legal implications of their child labor operation. That's when something inside me finally snapped. I called my grandfather and said the words I should have said years earlier. They made another mistake. I need help. Can I please come live with you? The silence lasted. Maybe three seconds before he exploded. Not at me, at the situation. Those idiots are having another kid, pack your essentials. We're coming to get you right now.

This guy bullied me for 10 years straight. Then I pretended I had no idea who he was. Growing up, I was basically the perfect target for bullies. I had bright red hair, was super skinny and had this terrible temper that made me explode whenever someone messed with me. This one kid named Tyler figured that out real quick in elementary school and made it his personal mission to make my life miserable. Every single day for 10 years, this guy found new ways to torture me. He'd throw things at my head during class, trip me in the hallways and call me horrible names that I won't even repeat. The worst part was how he'd act all innocent whenever teachers were around. Like one time in seventh grade, he pushed me down the stairs and when Mrs. Johnson came running over, he was suddenly this concerned classmate helping me up. He'd be like, oh my gosh, are you okay? That looked like it really hurt. Meanwhile, five minutes earlier, he was calling me a freak and making fun of my clothes. By high school, I was having panic attacks just thinking about going to school. I'd fake being sick just to avoid seeing his face in the hallways. When graduation finally came, I thought I was free. I was going to the local university and figured Tyler would probably go somewhere far away and I'd never see him again. But nope, last week, I'm standing in line at the pharmacy waiting to pick up my anxiety medication when I hear someone yelling behind me. Boy, ginger, I heard you were going to the community college. I knew that voice immediately. My whole body just froze up. I pretended not to hear him and kept staring at my phone. But Tyler wasn't giving up that easy. He yelled again, louder this time, hey, I'm talking to you. Still ignored him. Then I felt someone grab my arm and yank me around. There he was, same stupid smirk, same arrogant attitude, like we were still in middle school and he could just push me around whenever he wanted. For a split second, I felt that old, familiar rage building up, the same anger that used to get me in trouble when I'd finally snap and yell back at him. But then something clicked in my brain. Why should I give him the satisfaction of knowing he still affected me? So instead of getting mad, I looked at him with this completely blank expression and said, I'm sorry, but do I know you? His face immediately changed. The smirk disappeared and he looked genuinely confused. It's me, Tyler from school. Come on, you definitely know me.

Not a joke. That house should go to your sister, they said. So I took my nuclear revenge. My parents literally sued me for buying a house. Yes, you read that right. They took their own son to court because I had the audacity to purchase property they thought belonged to my golden child sister. Let me back up. I'm 28, work in tech and have been saving for a house since college. My sister Sarah is 25, unemployed, has been living with our parents rent free since dropping out of art school three years ago. But according to my parents, she's finding herself while I'm just obsessed with money. Last spring I found the perfect starter home, 3 bedrooms, great neighborhood, within my budget. I've been preapproved for months and had my down payment ready the day I got the keys. I was so excited I called my parents to share the news. You bought a house. My mother's voice went ice cold. Without telling us, mom, I'm 28. I don't need permission to. That house should go to your sister, she interrupted. She needs stability. You're being selfish. I thought she was joking. Sarah had never mentioned wanting to buy a house. She never even had a steady job. But apparently my parents have been planning to gift her my exact house as a launching pad for her future. How do they plan to buy it, you ask? With the money from my grandmother's inheritance that I was supposed to receive when I turned 30, money that was legally mine sitting in a trust fund my grandmother had specifically created for me. Three weeks after I moved in, I got served with papers. My parents were suing me for financial elder abuse and manipulation of family assets. Their claim, that I had somehow tricked them into letting me access my own inheritance early to buy a house that rightfully belonged to my sister. The kicker, they wanted me to sell the house and give the proceeds to Sarah plus pay their legal fees. I hired a lawyer immediately. During discovery, we found some interesting things. Turns out my parents have been stealing from my trust fund for years, using it to pay Sarah's credit card bills, car payments and even a failed business venture where she tried to sell handmade soap on Etsy. They'd taken over $40,000 of my money to fund Sarah's lifestyle. But here's where it gets nuclear. My lawyer discovered that my parents had forged my grandmother's signature on several documents, changing the trust terms to give them more control. They'd also been lying to the bank about the house purchase, claiming I was mentally incompetent and that they were my financial guardians. The fraud was so blatant that the FBI got involved. During the court hearing, my parents lawyer tried to paint me as a greedy son who abandoned his family. My mother actually Cried on the stand, saying I'd stolen Sarah's future and that the house was meant to be hers. Then my.

We'd broken up two months ago and he'd been telling everyone I was too clingy and needy. I really didn't wanna go. But she convinced me it would be good closure. It was at this bar in downtown Denver. He'd rented out maybe 40 people there, his work friends, college buddies. I was getting a drink when I literally walked into this guy at the bar. Sorry. I said, no problem. I'm Chris, Ryan's cousin from Portland. My heart sank. Great. He probably knew all about me being the crazy ex. I'm Hannah. I said, oh, you're Hannah. Ryan's mentioned you. You're the pediatric nurse, right? We started talking and he seemed really nice. Normal conversation about work, his dog, whatever. Then Ryan showed up. Already a few drinks in, Hannah actually came. Chris, this is my ex I was telling you about, the one who texted me constantly. I wanted to leave right then Ryan kept going. She wanted to hang out every weekend, like every weekend. And she asked where our relationship was going after only 6 months. His friend Tyler laughed. Tell him about the good morning texts every single day. Ryan said, good morning texts like clockwork. Chris looked confused. Wait, you're complaining because she texted you good morning, right? So clingy Chris Looked at Ryan like he was insane. And she wanted to spend weekends with her boyfriend. Exactly, bro. Chris said that's just called being in a relationship. The conversation got quiet. Chris continued. You realize you're complaining about someone who actually communicated with you and wanted to spend time with you. In 2,024, this girl nearby piped up, hold on. She responded to texts and wanted to make plans. Where do I find one of those? Ryan's face got red. You don't get it. She was needy. I finally spoke up. You know what? You're right, Ryan. I did text you good morning because I was thinking about you. I wanted to spend weekends together because I liked you. And yeah, after six months, I wanted to know if we were wasting each other's time. My bad for wanting a normal relationship. Ryan rolled his eyes and walked off. Chris turned to me. For what it's worth, those all sound like good things to me. Want to grab coffee sometime? Fair warning, I actually respond to texts. We went to coffee on Tuesday. He texted me good morning. Yesterday, Ryan unfollowed me.

I Learned my daughter Emma had died through a notification on my phone. Not a call, not an officer at my door, but a Facebook alert. Emma Martinez has been memorialized. I stared at it for 30 seconds, certain it was a mistake, some horrible glitch. Emma was 19, healthy, at college three states away. I talked to her two days ago. I immediately called her phone, straight to voicemail, called again, nothing. I called her roommate but she didn't answer. My hands shaking, I opened Facebook, see Emma's profile with remembering above her name and posts flooding in. R I P, beautiful Angel. Can't believe you're gone. Heaven gained another star. No one had told me my own daughter was dead and I found out through social media. I called the college barely able to speak. The woman who answered went silent when I said who I was. Missus Martinez. I, I thought someone had contacted you. There was an accident last night, Emma. I'm so sorry. She'd been hit by a drunk driver while walking back from the library, died on impact. They said it happened at eleven forty seven PM I've been watching TV laughing at some stupid show while my baby died alone on a street 300 miles away. The university had tried call but had an old number. They'd asked her roommate to contact family, but she was traumatized, hospitalized for shock. I drove those 300 Miles in a haze. At some point I stopped for gas and I threw up in the parking lot. A stranger asked if I was okay. I couldn't form words to explain that my daughter was in a morgue and I'd Learned about it from Facebook. When I arrived at the hospital, they wouldn't let me see her immediately. Procedures, paperwork, identification needed. I screamed at them that I was her mother, that I carried her for nine months, that I knew every freckle on her face. But protocol was protocol. I sat in that waiting room for two hours surrounded by strangers while my daughter lay somewhere in the building. Worst part was her phone. When they finally gave me her belongings, I saw the last messages she'd sent me. Love you, mom. Studying hard with a heart emoji. Then 15 minutes before the accident, a message she typed but never sent. Mom, I'm walking home now. That creepy guy from sight class is walking behind me. Probably nothing but feels weird. Call you when she never finished it, never sent it. Was she scared? Did she know something was wrong? The drunk driver was a 43 year old man with three prior Duis. But there was another detail the police mentioned quietly. He'd been in her psychology class. The accident was being investigated as potentially intentional. I went through her social media desperate for clues, found messages from him that made my skin crawl. Comments on her photos. Offers to study together, increasingly aggressive. When she declined, she told friends he made her uncomfortable. She'd reported him to campus security. Nothing was done. At her memorial service, hundreds came, students, professors, friends I'd never met. They all had stories about Emma's kindness, her brilliance, her dreams of becoming a doctor.

For six months, I planned every detail of my sister's dream wedding. No wedding planner, just me handling everything. Two weeks before the wedding, she refused to invite my fiance of 12 years. People will ask about your wedding instead of focusing on mine. Meanwhile, my brother's girlfriends of two years got invitations. I stopped all wedding work until she apologized and invited him. She did? Barely. The ceremony was beautiful. Then at the reception, I found our seats. The kids table by the kitchen, furthest from family. Everyone else was at the V I P. Table. There's a mistake with the seating, I told her. She looked me dead in the eye. That's where you belong. Her groom overheard and started to object, but she silenced him with one look. He apologized to my parents later, but not to me. She told me not to. My parents were furious when they found me. My brothers, they walked over to scold me for not giving a speech. You're only a bride once. Stop being selfish. We left and got McDonald's. I posted a photo post wedding meal. My siblings called this an attack on her somehow. Later, my sister explained her seating logic. I didn't plan her wedding perfectly. I look too pretty in my gown, and I needed punishment for bringing my fiance. Three months later, I'm planning my destination wedding. Small ceremony. Parents and close friends. Only My siblings are furious about not being invited. You're being childish, they say. I'm being selective with my money, I reply. Then my sister announces she's pregnant, due in June, our wedding month. Change your date and make me M O H, he demands. No! The harassment started immediately. All four siblings calling, texting, leaving voicemails about family obligation. I blocked them all. We had our dream wedding. Tiny church ceremony, beach Celebration. Five days island hopping in the Philippines with 20 people who actually love us. My siblings called throughout, labeling me a bridezilla for excluding them. My parents understood after what she did. We won't force you to include them. Those five days were perfect. No drama, no criticism. Just Celebration with our chosen family. My husband and I paid for everything exactly as we wanted. My parents insisted on hosting a reception when we returned. We'll pay. We'll invite whoever we want, including your siblings. I agreed with one condition. I handle the seating chart. The reception was yesterday. One long table. My husband and I center with our parents. My siblings. Far end, by the restrooms and kitchen. My sister arrived in designer maternity wear, immediately complaining.

Thinking he was entitled to half of the inheritance left to me. But he didn't count on one thing. My dad had never been one for many words. But around my husband Julio, his silences became deafening. During Sunday dinners, dad would ask pointed questions when Julio mentioned his business schemes. How much construction experience do you have? What's your backup plan if the market shifts? Julio would laugh them off. Your dad watches too much doom and gloom news. But dad's questions became surgical. How many properties have you successfully flipped? Show me profit margins from your last project. Each question revealed how vague Julio's answers were. Phrases like market research phase and building partnerships. When Julio showed up wearing a knockoff Rolex, dad's eyes fixed on it. Nice watch. It's about projecting success. Clients need to see you're serious. Later, dad asked me privately. How's your savings account, sweetheart? Fine. Why? Just checking. Keep something set aside. You never know. The call came at 6:47 a m. Dad had collapsed making coffee. Massive heart attack. Gone. Even grieving, I noticed how quickly Julio shifted into organizational mode. At the funeral home, he told the director he had vintage fishing equipment and antique watches. Real collectors pieces. I felt chilled. Dad had never shown Julio those items. They were hidden in his bedroom closet. How did Julio know they existed? That night, I heard him on the phone. It'll take Weeks to sort everything. But there's definitely value there. No, she doesn't know yet. Better to let her grieve first. Four weeks later, Dad's attorney called us in. Your father's estate is more substantial than expected. Total liquid assets approximately $850,000. The room went silent. Dad was an engineer, not a millionaire. Your father lived well below his means for decades. Careful investments, life insurance. He accumulated quite a nest egg. Julio's grip tightened. Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars, he repeated. That night, everything changed. Julio spread magazines across our table, circling a sixty eight thousand dollar Ford Raptor. Perfect for those weekend trips. His suggestions became elaborate kitchen renovation, boat, expensive gear. Your dad would want us to enjoy this money. When I suggested investing it like dad had, Julio's demeanor shifted. You're being ridiculous, Amanda. This is our chance to upgrade our lives. Three. Three weeks later, I discovered Julio's laptop open with browser tabs. Divorce attorneys, spousal rights, inherited assets, wife inherited money. Before divorce. While I've been mourning and trying to save our marriage, Julio had been planning our divorce to get half the money. Six weeks later, he dropped the pretense. We need to talk. He's

Every time I used equipment, he'd hover nearby, making comments about weekend warriors taking up space or guys who don't know what they're doing. Last Tuesday was the worst. I was doing bench press with moderate weight when Trevor walked over with his buddies. Seriously, man, he said loud enough for half the gym to hear. You're wasting everyone's time. This isn't a daycare. His friends laughed. Other people stopped their workouts to watch. I felt my face burning with embarrassment. Maybe try Planet Fitness, Trevor continued. This gym is for serious athletes, not guys playing pretend. I finished my set in silence and moved to another machine. Trevor followed. Look, nothing personal, but you're bringing down the vibe. Real lifters need this space. You'd be happier somewhere more beginner friendly. That evening, I mentioned Trevor to my dad over dinner. There's this guy at the gym who's been giving me trouble. Dad looked up from his pasta. Which location? Downtown or the west side? Downtown. Why? Just curious what kind of trouble? I told him about Trevor's comments, the humiliation, the suggestions that I find a different gym. Dad listened quietly, then asked, what's this guy's name? Trevor Morrison. Tall guy, always wears those expensive workout clothes, acts like he owns the place. Dad pulled out his Phone and started typing. Trevor Morrison. Yep, here he is. Premium membership. Signed up 8 months ago. How do you have access to membership records? Add smiled because I own Iron Peak Fitness, all 12 locations. My stomach dropped. You own my gym? I own the chain. Started with one location 15 years ago, grew it into the biggest fitness franchise in the state. Why didn't you tell me you wanted to join a gym and get in shape? Thought you'd be more motivated if you earned it yourself rather than getting special treatment as the owner's son. I stared at him. So when Trevor's been telling me I don't belong there, he's been bullying my son at my gym while using my equipment that he pays me to access. Dad kept scrolling through his phone. Trevor Morrison, Premium membership, $180 monthly, clean record until now. What are you going to do? Nothing. You are. Dad handed me his business card. Tomorrow when Trevor starts his usual routine, give him this. Tell him you thought he might want to speak with the owner about his concerns regarding gym membership standards. The next evening, I was at the squat rack when Trevor approached with his typical smirk. Back again. Thought we discussed this yesterday. I turned around calmly. Actually, Trevor, I wanted to follow up on your suggestion about finding a different gym. Smart move. There's a Planet Fitness about 10 minutes from here. The thing is, I really like this. Gym. So I thought I'd discuss your concerns with management. I handed him my dad's business card. Here's the owner's contact information. He said he'd love to hear your feedback about membership standards. Trevor glanced at the card, then did a double take. Wait, Robert Chen, you know the owner? He's my father. Trevor's face went completely white. The confident smirk vanished instantly. Your father owns Iron Peak, all 12 locations. He started this chain when I was in elementary school. Trevor started stammering. Look, man, I was just.

He controls every penny I spend. But her lawyer said, your honor, I need to withdraw from this case immediately. I'm Pete, and six weeks ago, Denise served me divorce papers at our daughter's piano recital. Real classy. She claimed I was financially controlling and emotionally distant, demanding 60% of my plumbing business, the house, and primary custody of our daughter, Zoe. The thing is, Denise had been acting strange for months. She started a life coaching business, acquired her to attend weekend retreats in Sedona, buy thousands and crystals and courses, and maintain multiple social media accounts about manifesting wealth. I supported her even when she maxed out three credit cards on business expenses. In court that Tuesday morning in Tulsa, Denise's attorney, Mister Vaughn, was crushing it. He painted me as this controlling husband who questioned every purchase, while I apparently lived like a king. Denise had actually coached three of her friends to testify about how broken she seemed. Mister Rodriguez kept his wife on an allowance, Vaughn announced. Meanwhile, he spent freely on boats and motorcycles. I didn't own boat. The motorcycle was a 1992 Honda I bought for $800 to fix up with Zoe. But Denise's friends nodded along from the gallery like they'd practiced. Here's what Denise didn't know. Five weeks earlier, I got a call from American Express about unusual charges on a card I didn't recognize. Turns out Denise had opened four credit cards using my Social Security number, racking up $67,000 in debt, buying inventory for an MLM scheme selling healing water. But that's not why her lawyer quit. See, I hired my own investigator not to follow Denise, figure out where our money was going. He discovered Denise wasn't just in one MLM. She was in seven, each one promising she'd be a founding Diamond member if she recruited enough people. Her biggest recruit? Her divorce lawyer's wife. Vaughn's wife had invested $30,000 of their retirement savings into Denise's wellness empire, mortgaging their vacation home to buy inventory. Text did von received during court, his wife panicking because the Federal Trade Commission had frozen the MLM's assets that morning for operating as an illegal pyramid scheme. When von pointed at me, he said, Mr. Rodriguez's attorney filed the FTC complaint that triggered this morning's raid. My wife is named in the investigation. I cannot continue. The judge called a recess. Denise tried to chase after Vaughn, screaming about betrayal and lost investments. Her three friends literally ran out of the courtroom when they heard FTC investigation. My attorney then submitted evidence showing Denise had recruited seventeen people, including her own mother.

I refused to help, so the party was a disaster. My husband Ryan, decides on Wednesday that he's throwing a B B Q party this Saturday for his work buddies. Not asks me, not mentions it in passing. Just walks in the door and goes, hey, babe, the guys are coming over Saturday for my famous ribs. Famous ribs, my ass. The only thing famous about them is how I do literally everything except flip the meat. I'm talking about getting all the drinks, cleaning our entire back deck, washing every plate and cup we own, because god forbid we use paper plates, prepping all the sides, refilling drinks every five minutes, and cleaning up after grown men who apparently never learn to put their own plate in the dishwasher. Meanwhile, Ryan just stands there with his stupid beer in one hand and tongs in the other, soaking up compliments like he's some kind of grill master. But this time was different. I looked at him dead in the eye and said, cool. Have fun with your guys night. He got this confused look and goes, what do you mean? I told him exactly what he said. Guys night. So I'll be in my craft room with my wine and my painting, and he can handle his own party. He laughed it off like I was joking. Come on. You know how these things work. That right there made Me see, red? Yeah, I know exactly how these things work. I do all the work, and he gets all the credit. Saturday rolls around, and I'm watching through the window as he realizes he's screwed. First three of his work friends show up, and our back deck looks like a tornado hit it. Dog toys everywhere, cushions all dirty from our lab mix Buster. And the table still has dried coffee rings from last weekend. Brian's running around trying to clean up while the grills already going. Then the text start. Where are the good plates? I text back that he said he'd handle everything. Where's the beer? Did you not buy beer? Nope. He said he'd handle it. What about potato salad? What about it, honey? I pour myself a massive glass of wine and turn my music up louder. Through my craft room window, I can see the whole disaster unfolding. One of his friends had to drive to the gas station for drinks. Another guy ordered pizza because there's literally just meat and nothing else. They're eating off our everyday plates with plastic forks because we only have, like, six real forks. And Ryan couldn't figure out where we keep the rest. The funniest part was watching Ryan try to explain where everything is. He's lived in this house for three years and apparently never noticed that we keep the extra dishes in the basement storage room. Or that beer needs to go in the fridge. Ahead of time to actually be cold or that people might want something other than unseasoned ribs. I checked on them around

So I made them regret it forever. I'm a public school teacher making $35,000 a year. When I met my fiance at a coffee shop two years ago, he seemed to admire my dedication to education. He was finishing his MBA, talking about making a difference in the world and I thought we shared the same values. I should have known better when he suggested we meet his parents at Shay Lauren, the kind of restaurant where a single appetizer costs more than I spend on groceries in a week. I spent my entire weekends tip money from my part time waitressing job on a dress that would fit in. His parents arrived fashionably late. His father in a tailored suit that probably cost more than my monthly rent. His mother dripping in diamonds. They greeted me with polite smiles that never reached their eyes, the kind I'd Learned to recognize from parent teacher conferences with entitled families. The conversation flowed around topics I could barely contribute to, their recent trip to the Hamptons, renovations on their vacation home in Aspen, mutual friends I'd never heard of. I tried to engage, sharing a story about my student science fair, but I could see I was losing their attention. When the dessert course arrived, a 70 dollar chocolate souffle, his father finally spoke directly to me. So dear Tell me honestly, what exactly do you see in our son? The question caught me off guard. I started answering about his kindness, his intelligence, how he made me laugh. But his father cut me off with a wave of his hand. Let me rephrase that. What do you really see in him? Because from where I'm sitting, this looks pretty convenient for you. A struggling teacher landing a wealthy husband. Some might call that lucky. Others might call it calculating. The word hung in the air like a slap. Calculating. The implication was crystal clear. I was a gold digger. My face burned with humiliation as other diners began to glance our way. Dad, my fiance said weakly, but his voice was uncertain. Oh, come now, son. Let's call a spade a spade, father continued. She's pretty enough. I'll give her that. But what else does she bring to the table? A teacher salary, student loans, a family that can't even afford to contribute to the wedding? Each word was a calculated strike. He'd clearly done his research, knew exactly how to wound me. I think there's been a misunderstanding, I managed to say, my voice surprisingly steady. I never asked for anything from your family. I pay my own bills and was planning to pay for half our wedding. His father laughed, a cold sound that made my skin crawl. How noble. And what exactly would half a wedding be from someone making $35,000 a year? A pizza Party in a school gymnasium. That's when I looked at my fiance.

This house will be your sister soon. I thought she was joking until I found the will she'd already rewritten. This happened last month at my 28th birthday dinner. My whole family was there. My parents, my Mister Emma, and my brother in law, Mike. I've been living at home since college, helping with Dad's medical bills after his stroke three years ago. The night felt off from the start. Mom kept staring at me with this weird, sad expression, like she was memorizing my face. She insisted on taking a million photos, kept bringing up childhood memories, and made this elaborate speech about how proud she was of the man I'd become. You've sacrificed so much for this family, she said. Tearing up, living here, helping with dad, putting your life on hold. Emma rolled her eyes. He's not exactly suffering. Free rent, home cooked meals. That stung, but I let it slide. I've been covering most of the household expenses anyway since dad couldn't work. During dessert, mom pulled me into this long, intense hug. That's when she whispered those words directly in my ear, so quietly only I could hear. I forced a laugh. What do you mean? She just smiled mysteriously and changed the subject. But something in her tone made my stomach drop. It didn't sound like a joke. Two days later, I was looking for Dad's insurance papers in his Home office. When I spotted a folder labeled Estate Planning, updated in Mom's handwriting, my heart started racing. Inside was a brand new will dated three weeks ago, right around when mom started acting strange. I read it twice to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. The house, our family home worth $800,000 that my grandparents had built, was going entirely to Emma. The savings account, also to Emma. I was getting Dad's 15 year old pickup truck and exactly 5,000 dollars. But here's what Emma didn't know. I've been secretly paying the mortgage for two years. After Dad's stroke, when money got tight, I started covering the 3,200 dollar monthly payments. I told my parents it was temporary, just until dad recovered. They never asked me to stop. I just kept paying. I had every bank record, every transaction, all saved in my email. That Sunday was our usual family dinner. Emma showed up in a new designer dress, talking about the European vacation she was planning with Mike. We're thinking three weeks in Italy, she said, scrolling through hotel photos on her phone. We rent a villa in Tuscany. Mom beamed. That sounds wonderful, honey. You deserve it. Yeah, maybe after we get some things sorted out, we'll look into that lake house we talked about, too, Emma added casually. Mom's eyes lit up. Well, you'll have plenty of options soon. Dad looked confused, but I knew exactly what they meant. I excused myself, went to my room, and Printed out two years worth of bank statements showing my mortgage payments. Then I grabbed the will. When I came back downstairs, Emma was still going.

For me, it happened while I was playing call of Duty Warzone late at night. I had just joined a random squad and there was this kid in the lobby, maybe 13, super talkative, asking for tips and hyped up to be playing with older teammates. He was sweet, just excited to have people listening to him. About an hour in, we suddenly heard a loud crash through his mic, then shouting. The kid went quiet, whispered, I have to go, but he never actually disconnected. Heavy footsteps echoed through his headset. A man's voice, clearly drunk, was slurring, where's the cash? Then we heard his mom crying in the background. The whole squad froze. This wasn't game chatter. This was real life unfolding in front of us. The dad was screaming, throwing stuff, demanding money. The mom begged him to stop, saying, Ethan can hear you. He's in his room. A second later came the sound of a slap and the boy yelled, don't hit mom. My stomach dropped. One of my teammates, Chris, asked if anyone knew the kid's real name or address. All we knew was his gamertag, Mango Mustard 67. Another squadmate already had 9 11 on the line, but we had nothing solid to give them. Then the kid came back on whispering through tears, please help. My dad's drunk. He's hurting mom. We live at two, 9, 2, 0 Maple Drive in Cleveland. Please hurry. That was enough. Chris, who turned out to be an off duty firefighter, stayed calm and kept Ethan talking while another teammate relayed the address to police. The chaos on his end was terrifying. His dad stormed into the room yelling about him being online instead making money. The headset dropped. We heard Ethan crying, no, dad, please, not the belt. Then came sirens in the background. His dad started screaming about cops being called. Ethan sob, insisting he didn't do it. A crash followed. Later, we Learned his dad had thrown him into the wall. Through the mic, we heard officers pounding on the door, then breaking it down. There was shouting, furniture breaking, and finally the dad screaming as he was taken away. A female officer's voice came through checking on Ethan before the mic cut.

But when the toast came, I was suddenly needed. My dad worked 40 years at the same engineering firm. Big retirement party at the country club. Extended family, his work buddies, everyone dressed up, celebrating his legacy. I show up in my work uniform. I'm a janitor at the local high school. Not exactly the career my engineer father had in mind. I just gotten off my shift and didn't have time to change. The moment I walked in, my cousin Lila handed me a broom. Oh, perfect timing. We spilled some cake crumbs. Make yourself useful. My uncle Raymond laughed. At least he knows his way around cleaning supplies. My Aunt Celeste chimed in, honey, maybe you should have dressed up for your father's big day. So there I am, sweeping up at my own father's party while everyone mingles around me like I'm invisible. My dad's colleagues are networking, shaking hands, talking about golf. His boss walks by and literally steps around me like I'm part of the furniture. I hear whispers. That's his son, the janitor. Such a shame. All that potential wasted. I heard he dropped out of college. They're all talking about Dad's incredible career, his innovations, his legacy. Meanwhile, I'm collecting empty plates and wiping down tables. Lila keeps finding me more tasks. Oh, could you take out that trash? And maybe clean the bathroom mirrors? My dad's giving Interviews to former colleagues. Everyone wants to hear about his greatest achievements. The time he saved the company millions with his bridge design, his patented water filtration system, his mentorship of young engineers. I'm in the background the whole time, invisible in my uniform. People literally turn away when I approach with the trash bag. My uncle starts telling stories. Remember when Elias here was going to be an engineer, too? Before he. Well, you know. He gestures vaguely at my uniform. The worst part? My dad never once told them to stop. Just let them treat me like hired help. At his own retirement party. Two hours in, I'm exhausted. My back hurts from bending over, picking up napkins. My hands are raw from cleaning, and I still haven't eaten a single thing because I've been too busy serving everyone else. Then comes toast time. The room quiets down. My dad stands up, taps his glass with a fork. I want to thank everyone who made my career possible. He starts naming people. His mentors, colleagues, friends. The whole room is nodding, applauding politely. I'm standing in the back corner, still holding cleaning supplies. Then he pauses, looks directly at me. But most importantly, I want to thank my son. Everyone turns to look at me. I'm still holding the broom and a bag of trash. Lila's mouth literally drops open. You see, my son works nights cleaning the high school. Every single

When I transferred to State University mid semester, I thought having a peer mentor would be helpful. That was before I met Brian. He showed up at my dorm room on day one with grocery store flowers, a basket full of snacks, and this whole speech about how he wasn't like other college guys. He told me he respected women, hated hookup culture, and thought modern men were trash. I was like, okay, cool. Thanks for the welcome basket. Brian started walking me to every single class. Like, literally waiting outside my dorm every morning with two cups of coffee, telling everyone we passed that he was just looking out for me. At first, I thought he was being friendly. Then the texting started. If I didn't reply within 10 minutes, he'd send another message asking if he did something wrong. When I finally told him I needed some space, he apologized for like, 20 minutes straight. The next morning, he showed up at my door with homemade blueberry muffins and this handwritten poem about how women always overlook guys like him. The poem was three pages long. I started taking different routes to class just to avoid him. Then one Thursday night, I posted an Instagram story of me and my roommate Katie at this bar near campus. Nothing crazy, just us with some drinks. Around midnight, Brian sent me this panicked text saying something terrible happened and he was hurt and Needed me. He said he got mugged in the parking lot behind the library after confronting some guys who were talking about me inappropriately. He said he was protecting my honor. I freaked out. Despite everything. I didn't want him actually hurt because of me. I grabbed my keys and ran across camp to meet him behind the library where he said it happened. When I got there, Brian was sitting on the curb with his shirt all ripped up and blood on his face. His lip was split and everything. I almost started crying seeing him like that. I was pulling out my phone to call 9 1 1 when something felt off. The blood on his lip looked weird, too. Bright red and kind of sticky looking. I leaned closer and realized it wasn't blood at all. It was ketchup. Literally ketchup from the dining hall. I confronted him about it and he completely broke down, started sobbing and saying he did it because he thought I needed some big dramatic moment to realize how much he cared about me. He kept saying, you women never see us until we're bleeding. You don't appreciate nice guys until something bad happens. I told him he was insane and walked away. I blocked his number.

He brought her flowers and would cook dinner sometimes. But then the weird stuff started happening.

He'd ask about my classes, my job at the campus bookstore, what I was watching on Netflix. Normal roommate boyfriend conversation, right?

So I'm 22 and living with my boyfriend Jake in this crappy apartment near campus. I thought everything was fine between us until my whole world crashed down because of one phone call. Jake was always weird about me meeting his friends or family, saying they were just busy or whatever. He'd come home at, like, 3:00am, claiming he was working late at the restaurant, and I believed him like an idiot. His grandma died, and he was really torn up about it. I asked if he wanted me to come to the funeral for support. He said he needed space to grieve alone. Made sense to me at the time. I even bought him this nice black tie and helped him pick out flowers for the casket. Three days later, my friend Chloe calls me up, freaking out. She saw Jake at the funeral, but he wasn't alone. Some girl was holding his hand the entire time, and his family was treating her like she belonged there. They were calling her his girlfriend, and she was helping carry flowers. Chloe said the girl looked confused when people mention Jake having a serious relationship, because apparently she thought she was the serious girlfriend. My heart dropped into my stomach. I felt like I was gonna throw up all over our kitchen counter. Chloe got this girl's number from someone at the funeral. And texted it to me. Her name was Emma, and she had no clue I even existed. I spent two hours pacing around our apartment before I finally called her. When she picked up, I just said, hey, this is gonna sound crazy, but are you dating Jake Morrison? She got really quiet and then whispered, who is this? I told her I was his girlfriend of two years and that we lived together. She started crying immediately. Turns out Jake had been dating both of us for eight months. He told her I was his crazy ex roommate who wouldn't move out. She'd been to his job, met his co workers, even spent time with his little nephew while I was home making dinner. Every night he was playing dad to her kids sister at soccer games. We stayed on the phone for three hours comparing stories. She knew about his weird scar on his shoulder from when he fell off his bike as a kid. She'd met his mom twice. He took her to the same Mexican restaurant where he took me for our anniversary. Ordered the exact same meal. Probably gave her the same speech about how the enchiladas reminded him of his childhood by the end.

Weeks later, mom texted, transfer mortgage money. No greeting, no small talk. I replied, not my house, not my problem. I was sitting alone at my small kitchen table when I finished the will. My hands felt heavy holding the papers, the house, the land, Dad's old truck, Mom's jewelry. All of it was given to Daniel, my cousin. Same Daniel they called their real son. I stared at those words for a long time. I wasn't surprised. Not really. I had grown up hearing it. Daniel was smart. Daniel was strong. Daniel was everything. They wanted me. I was just there. Still, it hit me like a punch. I had been paying their bills for years, mortgage, lights, even mom's silly subscription boxes. Every month, I transferred the money without a word. I didn't do it for thanks. I'd stopped waiting for that years ago. I did it because they were my parents and I thought that mattered. But the will made it clear it didn't matter. I didn't matter. So I stopped. No more transfers, no more quiet saving them. I let the due dates come and go. The first text came fast from mom, transfer the money for the mortgage. That was it. No. Hello, no, how are you? Just a demand. I stared at my phone. My heart was beating so hard it hurt. Then another text. Followed, Daniel says, you've been acting cold lately. Is something wrong? Something in me broke. Years of being second place, being invisible, of paying for their comfort while Daniel soaked up their pride, all of it snapped. I typed one line and hit send. Not my house, not my problem. At night, the call started. First mom, then dad. The voicemails grew sharper. You know how important this is, John. Stop being difficult. This is family. This is unacceptable. Call us back. A few months ago, I would have panicked. I would have rushed to fix everything, drained my account to keep them happy. But now I just set my phone face down and went to bed. The following weekend, I went to their house. Daniel was there, stretched across the couch like he owned it, which technically he did. Mom greeted me with a forced smile. You're late, Daniel's been telling us.

My sister and I haven't had a real relationship since high school. Growing up, she copied everything I did, same clothes, same handwriting, even the same electives. If I got a good grade, she'd tear up my homework and cry to our parents, claiming I destroyed hers. The worst part, she seduced my first boyfriend just to hurt me, said he wasn't her type, then made out with him at my birthday party. After that, I snapped. We went, no contact, didn't go to each other's weddings. 10 years, not a word. Then I got pregnant. I posted the announcement. 8 weeks later, she post hers, same due month. No idea if it was real or a twisted coincidence. Whatever. I ignored it. Fast forward to last week, I give birth to my son, Xander. Three days later, my phone rings. It's her. She doesn't say hi, just start screaming. She accuses me of stealing her baby name, Xander. Says she's loved it since childhood. Total lie. She always wanted Kai. I chose Xander because it honored a friend who passed. But she's yelling that I ruined her life, that I did this to destroy her on purpose. I hadn't talked to her in a decade. She drags our mom into it, tries to get her to mediate. Mom says, nope, my sister loses it. Post a long Facebook rant about name thieves, tagging the entire family. Then comes the Texts, hundreds, all hours. She called me evil, diseased, broken, said she'd come and reclaim what's hers. I started recording everything on my husband's phone. Good thing, too. One night she calls from a blocked number. Voice flat, cold, says if she can't name her baby Xander, she might just not have a baby at all. Said the stress I caused might make her lose it or maybe she'll help it along. Then she detailed how she'd do it. Seven minutes, I hung up, shaking. Next day I call her. I pretend to cave. You can have the name. It's not worth a baby's life, she screams in triumph. Finally, you know your place. Then she starts bragging online that I admitted stealing, posts ultrasound pics with baby Xander in cursive, tags me constantly. Then I get the call. Mom is sobbing. My sister just gave.

For two years I thought Kevin was just really dedicated to his job. He'd come home at 7:00am looking exhausted, shower, then sleep until three PM. He always said the night shift paid better and there was less drama with the doctors. Made perfect sense to me. He's a respiratory therapist and I know those jobs are tough. Every Thursday night he'd pack his little lunch bag with the those terrible gas station sandwiches he loves, grab his coffee thermos and kiss me goodbye. See you in the morning, babe, he'd say, and I'd already be half asleep. sometimes I'd wake up around 2:00am and text him cute messages like hope your shift isn't too crazy with heart emojis. He always replied right away, which I thought was sweet. Last Tuesday I had food poisoning from some sketchy sushi and felt absolutely terrible. Kevin had already left for work, but around midnight I was throwing up so badly I thought I might need to go to the ER. I called the hospital main line and ask them to page Kevin in respiratory therapy. The night operator put me on hold for like 10 minutes. When she came back, she sounded confused. Ma'am, we don't have anyone named Kevin scheduled in respiratory tonight. Are you sure you have the right department? I told her his last name, described him, everything. She checked again. No Kevin working Anywhere in the hospital that night, my stomach dropped and it wasn't from the food poisoning anymore. I hung up and immediately called Kevin's cell. It went straight to voicemail. I called three more times. Nothing. I threw on clothes and drove to the hospital parking garage where Kevin always parked his beat up Honda. It wasn't there. At this point, I'm starting to panic and coming up with all sorts of crazy explanations. Maybe he got transferred to a different hospital. Maybe there was some emergency. I drove around for two hours checking other hospitals nearby. Nothing. Finally went home and waited until 7:00am when he usually got back right on schedule.

I live on a ranch in Montana, about 4,800 acres. I didn't buy it, I inherited it. Since I'm not a rancher myself, I lease most of the land to people who actually know what they're doing. For me, it's just home. Quiet, private, and far better than the city life I left behind. When I first took possession, I made sure everything was in order. I had the property line surveyed, the fences checked, and no trespassing signs posted where the law required. I even rode my ATV around the perimeter just to double check everything was secure. And for a while, life was peaceful. Until one afternoon, I was driving back from town when I found three cars parked across my driveway. Now, my driveway isn't a short strip of pavement. It's private gravel road a mile and a quarter long, with drainage ditches on both sides. If you block it, there's no way around. I could see my house in the distance, but I couldn't reach it. I climbed onto the back of my truck, hoping to spot the owners. No. My first thought was to chain the cars up and drag them out of the way. But then I realized if things got ugly, I wanted a witness. So I called the sheriff's office. Deputy Bob showed up about half an hour later. I know him well. I'm a doctor in the local ER. And I've treated his family before. He pulled up, glanced at the cars inside. I can ticket them and call a tow, he said, but the closest truck is at least two hours away. Why don't you just move them yourself? That's what I was thinking. Told him I just wanted someone to see it. We snapped pictures of everything. The cars, the closed gate, the no trespassing signs. Then, with Bob's help, I hooked up chains and dragged the car.

What made you stop drinking? I was getting ready for work, hungover as usual when my 6 year old daughter walked into the kitchen. She started making herself breakfast, not like a normal kid would, messily asking for help. He moved like an adult who done this 1,000 times. She poured her own cereal, made her lunch, packed her backpack, all while I sat there holding my head trying not to throw up. Daddy, do you want me to make you coffee? She asked. I looked at her, really looked at her, this tiny person taking care of herself because I couldn't. How long have you been doing this? I asked. She shrugged. Since Mommy moved out. That was eight months ago. But who helps you get ready for school? She looked confused. I help myself. You're always sick in the mornings. My stomach dropped. I started paying attention. After that, she tiptoed around me when I was passed out on the couch. Turn off the TV if it was too loud, hide my beer bottles. When her friends came over and I found her school folder, inside were notes I'd supposedly signed for field trips, parent conferences, school events, my signature, but I didn't remember writing any of them. She'd been forging my name for months. Emma, did you sign these? She nodded like it was normal. You were sleeping when they were due. I didn't want to get in trouble. I kept digging, found a note. From her teacher asking about my emergency surgery that kept me from the Christmas play. Another about my work travel that made me miss the parent breakfast she'd been covering for me. Making up elaborate lies to explain why her dad never.

She didn't know I was the landlord. The complaint started three months after Carol moved into 4B. Noise complaints, parking disputes, accusations that I was violating lease terms by having friends over past ten PM every week, she'd call the property management company demanding action against the irresponsible tenant in 4A who clearly doesn't respect other residents. I live quietly, work from home, keep normal hours, occasionally have my buddy Jake over to watch football on Sundays. Nothing excessive. But Carol treated every conversation in the hallway like a personal assault on her peace. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I was carrying groceries upstairs when she confronted me in the stairwell. I've had enough, she said, blocking my path, your music, your friends, your complete disregard for everyone else in this building. I'm calling the landlord right now. She pulled out her phone and dialed while staring me down. Yes, this is Carol in 4B. I need the owner to evict my neighbor immediately. He's making this building unlivable. I listen to her list my crimes. Loud music after nine PM, excessive visitors, disrespectful attitude toward long term residents who deserve better treatment. I've been a model tenant for six months, she continued, but this guy treats the place like a frat house. I shouldn't have to deal with this. After hanging up, she smiled smugly. The owner promised to review your lease Personally, you probably get your eviction notice this week. That's unfortunate, I said, shifting my grocery bags. Maybe next time you'll think twice before moving into a building with responsible adults. That evening, I pulled out my laptop and reviewed Carol's lease agreement and complaint history. She'd filed 14 formal complaints in six months. Noise violations, parking disputes, bans for building wide quiet hours, request to ban visitors after eight PM the next morning, I knocked on Carol's door wearing my property management polo shirt and carrying a clipboard. She opened the door looking triumphant. You must be from the management company. Thank you for coming so quickly. Actually, I'm the owner, David Martinez. We spoke yesterday about your concerns regarding 4A. Her confident smile faltered. The owner, but you look so young. I bought this building two years ago, converted it from apartments to condos, kept a few units as rentals. Carol's face was cycling through confusion. Wait, if you're the owner, then who lives in 4A? That would be me. I live in my own building. Color drained completely from her face. So when you called yesterday demanding I evict the tenant in 4A for being too loud, you were asking me to evict myself from my own property? She started stammering. I didn't know. You never said. How was I supposed to know that your neighbor owns the building? You weren't. But you also weren't supposed to file 14 noise complaints in six months against someone who Works from home and keeps normal hours. I pulled out my clipboard. Carol, I've reviewed every complaint you filed. Music after nine.

My wife's parents are sweet people, but they have the taste buds of a brick wall. Last time they visited I spent 80 bucks on beautiful rib eyes, cooked them medium rare, and watched my father in law take his steak back to the grill and turn it into shoe leather. I literally watched him destroy a perfect piece of meat while asking if I had any ketchup. My parents are the complete opposite. I plan their entire vacations around restaurants. My dad will drive three hours for good barbecue, my mom once spent a whole month making black garlic in a rice cooker just because she read about it online. When they visit it's like having food critics in my house. Yeah, when my in laws come over I buy the cheap select grade stuff from the grocery store. They're gonna burn it anyway so why waste money? But when my parents visit I splurge on the good stuff. Real wagyu. The kind that costs more than my car payment. My wife found out about this arrangement last month. When she saw the receipt for the steaks I bought for my parents visit. She completely lost it. Started yelling about how I was playing favorites and treating her family like garbage. I tried explaining that her dad literally asks for A1 sauce with every meal, but she wasn't having it. The Whole thing came to a head two weeks ago when both sets of parents were visiting at the same time. I thought I was being smart by cooking all the steaks together. But I made a crucial mistake. I accidentally switched the plates. My father in law got the Wagyu and my dad got the cheap stuff. Within minutes, my dad was giving me this confused look like I'd lost my mind. He kept taking tiny bites and making weird faces.

I was 19 and broke as hell when I saw this local game show called Fear Factor Junior advertising tryouts at the mall. They were looking for contestants willing to face their biggest fears for cash prizes and a brand new Honda Civic. Figured why not? I had nothing to lose except maybe my dignity. During the application process, they made us fill out this questionnaire about our worst fears. Everyone was writing stuff like heights, spiders, snakes, public speaking, basic stuff. But I had a different plan. I wrote down that my biggest fear was being buried alive in a coffin underground. Complete lie. I'm actually terrified of butterflies. Sounds ridiculous, but they freak me out beyond belief. The producers loved my coffin answer. They called me back the next week and said I'd be perfect for their Halloween special episode. When I showed up to film, there were five other contestants, this girl named Ashley who was scared of heights. I'm Guy Kevin who hated snakes, and 3 others with typical phobias. The first challenge was eating gross stuff, cow eyeballs, cricket smoothies, the usual nasty fare. I crushed it because honestly, free food is free food when you're broke. Ashley threw up after the first spoonful and got eliminated. Kevin barely made it through but stayed in. Second challenge was the snake pit. Kevin was shaking like A leaf. Before we even started, they had us crawl through this tunnel filled with harmless but huge pythons to retrieve colored flags. Kevin lasted about 10 seconds before he tapped out screaming. I just held my breath and went for it. Snakes don't bother me at all. Now it was down to me and this older woman named Janet, who claimed her biggest fear was drowning. The final challenge was supposed to be custom made for each of our fears. Janet had to retrieve car keys from the bottom of a murky tank while holding her breath. She did pretty well, got the keys in about 45 seconds and came my turn. They LED me over to this wooden coffin sitting next to a pile of dirt. The host explained I'd be locked inside and buried three feet underground for exactly 60 seconds.

Her dad, Rick, showed me around their garage where he restores old motorcycles. We talked about football and grilled some burgers. Her mom made this insane apple pie that actually made me understand why people get emotional about family recipes. I was thinking maybe I'd been overthinking the whole meeting the in laws thing.

I laugh because I think she's joking. Oh, we can share the guest room, no problem. The silence that follows is so thick you could cut it with a knife.

We're married. This is kind of insulting. That's when Jessica finally speaks up, but not the way I hoped. Maybe you could just try it for one night. I stare at her. My own wife is asking me to sleep on a couch that looks like it doubles as a medieval torture device. her parents think our marriage certificate is just a suggestion. I grab my jacket. You know what?

We were stationed at a forward operating base outside Fallujah, 3rd Infantry Division, Alpha Company. Our communication specialist was this kid from Ohio named Tyler, who'd been in country for maybe six weeks. Smart kid, knew his equipment, but had the worst handwriting I've ever seen. His radio logs looked like chicken scratches. Nobody could read them. But he always got the job done. The mission was supposed to be routine. Intelligence reported a high value target in a compound about 15 clicks northeast. Two platoons were moving in for capture operations. While we provided overwatch and communication support. Tyler was monitoring multiple radio frequencies, coordinating with air support, tracking friendly positions. Standard stuff. Everything was going smooth until the shooting started. Enemy contact came from everywhere. What was supposed to be a small terrorist cell turned out to be a full company of insurgents. Our guys were pinned down hard, taking casualties, running low on ammunition. Lieutenant Davis grabbed the radio from Tyler. We need immediate backup at grid coordinates November Victor 4 7 8 2 1 5. Send everything you got. Tyler scribbled down the coordinates, started transmitting to headquarters. This is Falcon base requesting immediate reinforcement at grid November Victor 4 7 8 2 1 5. Multiple casualties, heavy resistance, but here's Where his handwriting screwed everything up. When he copied the coordinates, his 8 looked like a 3. Instead of requesting backup at grid 4 7, 8, 2, 1 5, he sent them to 4 7, 3, 2, 1 5. That put the reinforcements 5 kilometers south of our actual position, right in the middle of what we thought was empty desert. And dispatch two full companies of Marines, Apache helicopters, close air support. Massive response. Heading to the wrong location. We're still getting hammered, wondering where our backup is. Tyler's frantically trying to raise headquarters. Lieutenant screaming into the radio about our deteriorating situation. That's when we started hearing explosions from the south. Big ones. Artillery, airstrikes, machine gun fire. But there was supposed to be nothing down there except sand and rocks. Turns out Tyler's mistake had sent those

So my daughter Emma, she's 7 going on 40 right? That girl has more sass than a whole group chat full of middle schoolers smart, funny, total gremlin energy. Well last month she decided she hated broccoli. Not just liked, hated like if I even look at it I'm gonna puke and call Child Protective Services level of hate. So her dad, this man I swear tries to get clever. He tells her if you eat all your broccoli you can have ice cream and stay up late classic dad bride move but Emma looks at him dead serious and goes, ice cream can't erase trauma. I'm in the kitchen dying like I'm trying not to laugh into the dishwasher. This girl legit told him trauma? She's 7. Anyway, that night she throws a whole performance at dinner crying, flailing, acting like we served her frog legs instead of steamed veggies then she hides the broccoli in her napkin and throws it in the laundry hamper. I find it the next day soggy green crime scene in the towels I'm like, oh, so this is how we do things now okay, petty mom mode activated. Next night I serve her magic green pancakes she's excited. She's like, ooh, are these mint chocolate? I'm like, mmm hmm special recipe girl scars them down like she just discovered food mid bite her dad walks in and goes, wait, is that the broccoli? From last night, Emma freezes fork in mid air. I'm like, yep, blended it, baked it, you're welcome. Her whole soul left her body. She screamed like she just found out Santa isn't unionized. Runs to her room yelling, I eat lies. Now, here's where it gets wild. Two days later, I come home from work and my husband is just standing in the kitchen looking weird like he saw a ghost. I'm like, what happened? He turns around holding his electric razor, y'all, it's full of peanut butter. Emma put Jeff inside this man's beard trimmer. Full on sabotage. Apparently she told him that's for letting mom feed me betrayal pancakes. I cried. I couldn't breathe. She got revenge like she's in a Netflix drama called Tiny Chef's Final Warning. But it didn't stop there. She started labelling everything in the fridge, do not blend. Warning. I know what this used to be, broccoli free zone. We had a whole vegetable hostage situation going on. So I do what any petty mother would do. I printed a fake adoption certificate, framed it, hung it in her room, had a seal and everything. It said, congratulations, you now belong to the Vegetable Federation President. Broccoli welcomes you. She lost it, threw a stuffed unicorn at me and yelled, you'll never break me. Her dad, meanwhile, is just in the background with beard oil and a spoon yelling, who messed with my grooming tools? It was chaos. Finally, after a week, Of World War Green. I sat her down and was like, Emma, baby, it's just food. You don't have to like it, but you do have to be honest. She blinked and said, okay, but next time you try to sneak broccoli in my pancakes, I'll call grandma. I gasped. Not grandma, not the woman who still.

We were all at Grandma's birthday party, and I noticed how Aunt Penn was giving mom special compliments all night. Rosie, that dress almost hides your weight gain. Almost, she would say before smiling sweetly. Then she touched Mom's face. You're so brave wearing makeup at your age. Most women would just give up. Mom's eyes got watery, which meant she was really touched. Aunt Pen even complimented my dad, saying, you're such a saint for sticking around with her. Most men would have found someone younger by now. Mom's hands were shaking when she cut the cake, probably from happiness. On the drive home, mom was really quiet. And when dad asked if she was okay, she said something about passive aggressiveness, which I didn't understand, but I figured it must be another way adults say I love you. I decided that if Aunt Penn loved mom so much that she gave her all those special compliments, I should do the same thing for Aunt Penn, because I love her, too. The next Sunday at church, I, I saw my chance. When Aunt Penn walked up wearing a pretty flowery dress, I remembered exactly how she talked to mom and said to her, wow, Aunt Penn, you look pregnant in that dress. When's the baby coming? Her face went completely white, then red, then kind of purple. And she just stood there with Her mouth open like a goldfish, mom, who was talking to Missus Abernathy, turned around so fast she almost spilled her coffee. And then she started coughing really hard, but it sounded more like laughing for some reason. Aunt Penn finally said, thank you, sweetie, in this tiny voice. And mom had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom because she was coughing laughing so much. Dad asked me what I said. And when I told him I was just being nice like Aunt Penn, he got this funny look and patted my head. Keep doing that, buddy. Okay, Dad. Two weeks later at my school play, Aunt Penn came with everyone to watch me be tree No. 3. After the show, I walked up and said in my best Aunt Penn voice, your hair is so brave, Aunt Penn. Not everyone can pull off that color. My teacher's eyes got huge. Penn's hand went to her freshly dyed red hair and mom actually snorted her juice out of her nose. Then at Easter dinner, I got to give her another special compliment. Uncle Jim had just left to watch the game. And I, I remembered something I'd overheard mom telling dad last week. Aunt Penn, you're so strong, I announced to everyone. Mom said that Uncle Jim only stays married to you for the kids and you don't even seem sad about it. That's real confidence. The entire table went silent. Aunt Penn's fork clattered onto her plate. Grandma stopped mid chew. Dad choked on his ham. Aunt Penn stood up, her chair scraping loudly and stormed into the kitchen. Could hear her angry whispers getting louder and louder until she came marching back out. She marched straight to mom and yelled loud enough for everyone to hear. Rosie, your son has been making incredibly rude comments about my appearance for months. He called me fat, old and said my hair looked terrible. Mom started to respond, but I walked over because.

So I tagged her dad. Ashley and I have been together three and a half years, engaged for 6 months. Her father, Robert owned a chain of auto repair shops and was paying for our entire 65,000 dollar wedding, which was just 3 days away. Ashley lived for drama and attention, constantly flirting with other guys while I was right there, then acting shocked when I called her out. The red flags were everywhere. But I thought putting a ring on it would fix her need for constant validation. My sister Sloan warned me at our engagement party, you're making the biggest mistake of your life, but I'll be here to help pick up the pieces when this train wreck derails. The night before our wedding, Ashley told me she was going to a spa retreat with her bridesmaids. Just massages, facials, some meditation before the big day, she said, kissing me goodbye, all sweet and innocent. I was working late fixing a crashed server when my phone buzzed. It was Isla, one of Ashley's former friends who'd been cut out over some drama. Hey, you need to see this. I'm really sorry. Then the screenshots started flooding in. Ashley had posted everything to her Instagram close friends story, thinking she was clever, keeping me off that list. Screenshot 1, Ashley at some upscale club, definitely not a spa. Caption, last night of freedom, witches. Who needs Meditation when you have good drinks and hot strangers. Screenshot 2, my fiance straddling some random guys lap. Caption, new friend alert, Tyler knows how to treat a lady. Screenshot 3, Ashley doing body shots off this guy's chest while her bridesmaids cheered. Caption, living my best life. Screenshot 4, full make out session. Caption, what happens at bachelorette stays at Bachelorette. Sorry, not sorry, but the detail that broke me wasn't in the photos. It was Isla's final text. She's been bragging all night about how you have no idea where she really is. Said you'd lose your mind if you knew. So she made up the spa story. This woman had looked me in the eye, lied about where she was going and was now broadcasting her cheating to her friends while mocking me behind my back. I stared at my phone for exactly 30 seconds. Not anger, not heartbreak, called clarity. I opened Instagram and found Ashley's latest post from the club. She'd actually made it public now, probably too drunk to care about privacy settings. The caption was the same, last night of freedom. I left one comment. First night of freedom actually things off. Then I changed my relationship status to single. But here's the part that made everything beautiful. I tagged her dad, Robert in the comment. Within 2 minutes, my phone started exploding with calls. Ashley calling her bridesmaids, calling numbers I didn't recognize. I turned the phone off and went to my Best friend's place to wait out the storm. The next morning, Ashley and her mother, Carol, showed up at my apartment. Ashley looked like she'd been hit by a truck. Mascara streaked down her face. How dare you humiliate my daughter publicly, Carol screamed before I even opened the door fully. She humiliated herself. I just provided commentary. Ashley tried the waterworks, baby, please. It didn't mean any.

The principal's voicemail started playing before I could even say hello. Mister Chen, your son attacked another student. Police are here! Come immediately! My eight year old son! Police! The words didn't compute. Racing to school, I found Ethan handcuffed to a bench outside the principal's office. Handcuffed? His face was swollen, blood crusted under his nose, his breathing shallow and ragged. The principal stood there, arms crossed, while two officers flanked my child like he was a criminal. What happened? I demanded, dropping to my knees beside him. Ethan couldn't speak, just wheezed. Pointing at his pocket, I pulled out his inhaler. Empty. He needs his emergency inhaler from the nurse, I shouted. The principal shrugged. He lost that privilege when he assaulted Connor. I sprinted to the nurse's office myself, grabbed his backup inhaler from the locked cabinet she'd left open. Three puffs later, Ethan could finally breathe. Only then did the truth emerge. Connor Williams, the superintendent's nephew, had been tormenting Ethan for months. That day, he'd stolen Ethan's inhaler during P E, holding it above his head, making him jump for it, while calling him wheeze, baby. When Ethan couldn't breathe and tried to grab it, Connor shoved him down. Ethan, in full panic, had swung blindly, his fist connecting with Connor's jaw. So you called the police on an eight year old having an asthma attack? I could control my voice. Where's Connor? Where are his handcuffs? Connor's uncle felt it best he go home to calm down. The principal replied, your son has a history of overreacting. History? I knew exactly what he meant. Three incident reports I'd filed about Connor that somehow kept getting lost. Bathroom stall where Connor had held Ethan's head in the toilet. The prank where Connor put peanuts in Ethan's lunch, knowing he was allergic. Each time I was told, boys will be boys. The security footage would vindicate Ethan, I thought. Except suddenly. Mysteriously, that particular camera hadn't been working for weeks. The PE teacher who witnessed everything, she didn't see the beginning. Though three students later told me she'd been laughing when Connor took the inhaler. But they'd made one mistake. Our state legally requires schools to provide reasonable accommodation for medical condition. Denying access to emergency medication, that's criminal neglect. Handcuffing a child in medical distress, assault. My lawyer had the officer's body cam footage within 48 hours. Showed everything. The principal admitting he knew about the inhaler, choosing punishment over medical care. Even joking with Connor's uncle on the phone about teaching the Chen kid a lesson. The superintendent tried to bury it. The school board tried to silence us with a settlement. But I posted that footage online. 47 million views in 72 hours. The principal was

The manager's reaction wasn't what anyone expected. Last weekend it was unusually warm for this part of the country. Like, uncomfortably warm for a place that's normally pretty mild. I was wearing a tank top and some Jean shorts, so I had a lot of skin showing. Nothing indecent though, just air arms and legs. And I might have had some cleavage showing. My husband and I were planning to have a barbecue for some of his work friends later that afternoon, so I went down to the grocery store to pick up a few final items we'd forgotten. The store was absolutely packed with people trying to beat the heat and grab cold drinks. Everyone was dressed for the weather. Tank tops, shorts, undresses, you know, normal summer clothes. I'm making my way through the aisles with my little basket, enjoying the air conditioning, when I get to the canned good section. So I'm standing there looking at the beans, trying to do mental math about how much we'd actually need for eight people, when I feel this tap on my shoulder. I turned around to come face to face with an older lady who was definitely overdressed for the weather. Like, full sleeves, pants, the works. She looked miserable in all those layers. I asked politely, may I help you? And she replies with this tone, don't you think you're dressed Appropriately for this job. I was genuinely confused. Like what job? I'm just shopping. So I replied, well, yes, but I'm not at my job right now. I work in a hospital as a lab technician and we have pretty strict dress codes there. Obviously she scoffed and said, well, we'll see what Dave has to say about this. Apparently Dave is the manager and a friend of hers, so she races off to find him. I'm just standing there looking at beans, still trying to figure out how much we need, wondering what the hell just happened. Just as I put a couple cans into my basket, the lady comes marching back down the aisle with who I assume is Dave, wearing a manager type apron. He's pointing at me like I'm some kind of criminal and saying do you let your employees wear things like that? It's shameful! Dave looks at me and I can see him trying to place my face. He starts to look at me like he knows me from somewhere, then shakes his head and tells the lady she doesn't work here. But this woman is not having it. He looks between me and Dave and tells him of course she works here. I've seen her stocking shelves and working at the register multiple times. It's absolutely shameful that you allow her to dress like that on the floor. Dave looks at me again, then I swear I can see the light bulb. Moment. He takes his walkie talkie and calls for someone named Linda to report to aisle 7. The lady is still going off about my outfit when Linda appears. I was completely shocked. This girl looked exactly like me when I was back in high school. Same hair color, same build, same facial features. It was like looking at a time machine photo of myself.

I found out when my neighbor tried to destroy my autistic son's only source of comfort. My eight year old son Jake is severely autistic and nonverbal. He doesn't speak, can't handle loud noises and struggles with change. But he found peace in one thing, feeding the birds. Every morning at 7:00am, he'd scatter seed, then sit perfectly still as cardinals and blue jays ate around him. For one magical hour, my son who couldn't connect with humans connected with nature. It was the only time I ever saw him smile. Enter and Mitchell, our new neighbor. Day 2 of her living there, she marched over. Those birds are crapping on my car. Stop feeding them immediately. I explained Jake's condition, begging for understanding. Her response, not my problem. Get your retard son a different hobby. She actually used that word about my child. The next morning as Jake went out with his bird seed, we found she'd installed motion activated speakers around her property line, blasting predator sounds, hawk screeches, cat yowls. The birds fled instantly. Jake had a complete meltdown, screaming and hitting himself. It took three hours to calm him. I tried reasoning with her. She laughed. Birds are pests. Deal with it. I called the police, legal. I called city council. No ordinance against it. I offered to pay for car washes. She refused. For two weeks I watched my son sit with his bag of seed. Confused why his friends wouldn't come. He stopped eating, stopped sleeping, started pulling his hair out in chunks. That's when Mama Bear mode activated. See, Karen worked from home as a realtor. Her entire business depended on her reputation and online reviews. She just started her own agency, Mitchell Luxury Homes. Very prestigious, very image conscious. I started with completely legal research. Found her Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, downloaded every public post, including the ones where she used words like retard and psycho about special needs kids at her nephew's school. Screenshot saved. Then I got creative. I printed 200 flyers. Local realtor.

See, my wife, Jen, has always been the type to share everything, like everything. When our daughter Mia was 13, she came home all excited about this boy from her friend's house and told her mom in confidence. Well, next thing I know, Jen's sharing this cute little story at our family BBQ in front of everyone, including the freaking kid. Mia turned bright red and ran inside. I pulled Jen aside and told her to knock it off, but she just laughed it off saying they were just kids and it was adorable. That's when I started noticing it more. Every conversation Mia had with her mom somehow ended up being gossip material for Jen's friends. Mia's first period, her struggles with math, the time she got caught vaping at school, even her therapy sessions after my mom died, all of it got shared. I'd walk into the kitchen and hear Jen on the phone going, oh, my god. You'll never guess what Mia told me today. By the time Mia turned 15, she basically stopped talking to her mom about anything real. He'd come to me instead, doctor appointments, boy drama, friend fights, college applications. I became the go to parent because at least I could keep my mouth shut. Jen started getting bitter about it. She'd make comments like, I guess I'm not good enough for girl talk anymore or she tells you everything but treats me Like a stranger. But she still never connected the dots about why. Last month, Mia started dating this kid, Tyler, from her chemistry class. Sweet kid, plays guitar, makes her laugh. She told me about it over pizza one night and I was happy for her. She specifically asked me not to tell her mom yet because she wanted to keep it private for a while. Well, somehow Jen found out. Maybe she saw a text notification or heard Mia on the phone. I don't know. But she lost her absolute mind. I came home from work to find her screaming at Mia in the living room, demanding her phone and laptop, threatening to ground her. For months, Mia was crying, trying to explain that she wasn't doing anything wrong, just that she wanted some privacy. Jen wasn't hearing it. She kept yelling about being disrespected and how dare Mia hide things from her. I tried to calm Jen down, asked if we could talk in private, but she was too worked up.

I'm Casey and my twin sister is Katie. Yeah, our parents really thought they were being cute with those names. They did everything possible to make sure we were basically the same person our entire lives. We shared a bed until I was 18, not just a room, the same bed. Every night, Katie would wrap her arms around me like I was her teddy bear and I'd lie there awake, wanting to scream. When I tried to sleep on the floor, she'd cry until her parents made me get back in bed with her. School was a nightmare. Our parents demanded we be in every single class together, same desk, partner for group projects, same lunch table, same everything. Teachers would literally call us the twins instead of our actual names. Katie loved it. She'd introduce us by saying we're Katie and Casey and answer questions meant for me. The worst part was friends. If someone invited me to hang out, Katie automatically assumed she was invited, too. She'd show up wherever I was supposed to meet people. This girl, Emma, from my chemistry class asked me to study together once and Katie just appeared at the library with all her books. Emma never asked me to study again. When I was 14, I got really sick with some stomach thing and had to stay in the hospital for two nights. Katie had a complete meltdown because she couldn't stay with me. She sat in the parking lot crying for hours until security made our parents take her home. Those two nights alone were the first time I'd slept peacefully in years. No one breathing in my face or stealing my blankets or asking me what I was thinking about every five minutes. I started planning my escape. Junior year, Katie thought we were going to the same college and being roommates forever. Our parents had already called the admissions office trying to make sure we'd be placed together. I applied to different schools without telling anyone. I got into this community college three states away and saved up money from my part time job at the grocery store. The day after graduation, I told them I wasn't going to college. Katie freaked out asking what we were going to do instead. Not what I was going to do, what we were going to do. That's when I knew I had to get out immediately. I packed my stuff while they were at dinner, just threw everything into trash bags and left. My friend Jess let me crash at her place for two weeks. Then we both moved to start college together. I blocked everyone's numbers in social media for three months. I had peace. I could eat what I wanted for breakfast. I could watch whatever show I liked. I could make friends without someone else inserting themselves into every Conversation. It was amazing. But I felt guilty. So I unblocked Katie's number. Big mistake.

I was 16 and had the flu really bad. My parents thought I was completely knocked out from the medicine. I was lying on the couch in our living room, eyes closed, barely breathing. So they think I was deep asleep. My mom and dad were in the kitchen making dinner. The smell of spaghetti sauce was making me feel even sicker. They thought they were being quiet, but I could hear every word through our thin walls. We need to tell him before he finds out some other way, my mom whispered, her voice shaky. Tell him what, that his brother isn't actually his brother, my dad replied, sounding frustrated. My stomach dropped harder than when I first got sick. They were talking about my little brother, Tyler. We looked exactly alike, same brown hair, same green eyes, same crooked smile. Everyone always said we could be twins. DNA test came back today, mom continued. I could hear her opening and closing cabinet doors nervously. Tyler's not yours, David. We both know what this means. I held my breath trying not to cough. My parents have been fighting a lot lately. Dad would come home late from work, claiming overtime at the auto shop. Mom would be crying in the laundry room when she thought nobody was looking. So what do we do now, dad asked. I heard him slam something down on the counter. Do I just pretend I don't know. Tyler's 8 years old. He calls me daddy every single morning. Maybe we should tell him when he's older, when he can understand. Mom said her voice was getting higher the way it did when she was about to cry. Understand what? That his mom cheated on his dad, that I've been raising another man's kid for eight years. That everything I thought I knew about our family is a lie. I wanted to run to my room, but I couldn't move without them hearing the Couch Creek. So I just lay there listening to my family fall apart one whispered word at a time. Tyler doesn't need to know, mom said, you're the only father he's ever known. Nothing has to change if we don't let it. Everything has to change. Dad shot back, every time I look at him now, I'll know. Every time he hugs me and calls me daddy, I'll know he's not really mine. Every soccer game, every birthday party, every time someone says he has my eyes, they went quiet for a long time. I could hear mom crying soft.

My mom always said my dad couldn't do romance if his life depended on it. Like literally. This man bought her gas station roses for their 10th anniversary and thought Valentine's Day was just a marketing scam. He'd forget their anniversary every year until she'd drop hints for weeks. My mom would just laugh it off and say he showed love differently. She was the one making cute playlists for their road trips, taking photos at every family vacation, writing little notes in his lunch box. She'd kiss his cheek every single night before bed, even when he'd just grunt and keep watching TV. Everyone in our family knew mom was the romantic one carrying their relationship. Then three months ago, my mom had a stroke. It wasn't supposed to be this bad, but it paralyzed her entire right side and took away her ability to speak. He couldn't walk to the bathroom alone, couldn't write her name, couldn't even tell us when she was in pain. The doctor said her recovery would take months, maybe years. I honestly thought my dad would completely fall apart. This guy couldn't even make toast without burning it. And now he had to take care of everything. I expected him to hire nurses immediately or maybe even put her in a care facility. Instead, he shocked our entire family. First week home from the hospital, he took leave from his job just straight Up told his boss he wasn't coming back until mom was better. Then he started learning how to cook her exact rice pudding recipe, the one she'd been making for 20 years. He'd call me at midnight asking if I remembered what spices she used. Because he couldn't get it right, he slept on a mat.

The caption read, the ones who truly matter. So I canceled the flights. Then 42 missed texts. I called and said only six words. I live in Seattle, work in tech and haven't been home to Ohio in two years. The distance wasn't just geographic. Every family gathering ended the same way, me feeling invisible while my brother Adrian got all the attention. When mom called about Thanksgiving, she was practically begging, Clara, please come home. The whole family will be here. Adrian, Marissa, the kids, we miss you so much. Her voice cracked a little. I know we haven't always. I just want my family together. That got to me. Maybe she'd realized how they'd been treating me. Maybe this could be a fresh start. I booked flights for me and my boyfriend, Elias, $800 round trip. Plus I offered to bring dessert from this fancy bakery mom loves, the one that costs $60 per pie. That's perfect, honey. This will be our best Thanksgiving ever. I was actually excited. Maybe things would be different this time. Growing up, I was always the responsible one. While Adrian partied through college, I studied while he job hopped for five years. I climbed the corporate ladder. When he got married and had kids, suddenly he became the golden child again. Every holiday was the Adrian show, his promotions, his kids achievements, his vacation photos. I'd sit there Nodding, asking questions, being the supportive sister. But when I got promoted to senior developer, crickets. When I bought my condo, that's nice, honey. Last Christmas, I mentioned I was thinking about proposing to Elias. Mom's exact words, don't you think you should focus on your career first? Meanwhile, when Adrian announced his third pregnancy, they threw a party. But Mom's call felt different. Desperate almost. She genuinely wanted me there. I even went shopping for a new outfit, something that would photograph well for family pictures. I was determined to make this work. The plan was simple. Fly in Wednesday night, stay through Sunday. Elias was nervous about meeting everyone, but I assured him they'd love him. He's everything parents want. Stable job, good manners, comes from a nice family. Tuesday night, mom called with details. There's at two PM Adrian and Marissa are coming at noon with the kids. Maybe arrive around 1:30. That way we can all catch up before we eat. I made mental notes. Give them time with the grandkids first, then make my entrance. Same old pattern, but I could live with it. Wednesday morning, I was checking my luggage when mom texted. Can't wait to see you. Going to be perfect. That afternoon, Elias and I were at SeaTac, boarding passes in hand. He squeezed my shoulder. You seem nervous. It's been a while. I just wanted to go. Well, they're lucky to have you. I almost believed him. The flight was delayed. An hour, but I texted mom our new arrival time. She responded with heart emojis. We landed at nine PM, grabbed our rental car and drove to the hotel. I'd Learned years ago not to stay at the house. Too much drama, too little privacy. Thursday morning, I was actually humming while getting dressed. Elias watched me apply lipstick. I haven't seen you this happy about a family thing before. I have a good feeling about today. We stopped at the bakery to pick up the pies, apple, cinnamon and Bourbon pecan, mom's favorites. The woman behind the counter smiled. Someone's having a special Thanksgiving, hopefully, I said. Back at the hotel, I was packing my purse when Elias called from the bathroom. Babe, you might wanna see this Wednesday night. I'm packing when my phone buzzes. Mom posted on Facebook, it's a family photo. Mom, dad, my brother Adrian with his wife Marissa and their twins. Everyone's dressed nice, smiling around the dining table I grew up at. The caption, Thanksgiving prep with the ones who truly matter. Grateful for my real family, I stared at my phone. They took a family photo without me on purpose. But that caption, the ones who truly matter, that broke something inside me. I called the airline and canceled both flights, lost $200 in fees, but I didn't care. Elias looked confused. What's wrong? We're not going. My phone started ringing at 6 a. M. Thursday, 42 missed calls by noon. Finally, I answered, Clara, where are you? We're waiting. I took a deep breath and said only six words, ask the ones who truly matter. Then I blocked them all.

My 16 year old Valentina had never shown interest in languages. She barely passed English class and once told me learning foreign languages was pointless torture designed by sadistic teachers. Exactly three weeks ago, everything changed overnight. She started going crazy about learning Spanish with books and Duolingo. Since when do you care about Spanish? I asked over dinner Tuesday night, watching her scribble verb conjugations on napkins between bites of pasta. College applications look way better with a second language, Dad. Yale and Harvard basically require it now, she said, completely avoiding eye contact and fidgeting with her fork. Fair enough reasoning, but then incredibly weird things started happening that made zero sense. I heard her having full conversations on the phone in absolutely perfect Spanish. Not broken beginner Spanish with grammar mistakes. Fluent, rapid fire, native level Spanish with complex slang and regional accents. The kind you definitely don't learn from Duolingo. In three weeks, I secretly checked her browser history expecting tons of language learning websites and online Spanish courses. Absolutely nothing. Just regular teenage stuff. TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, makeup tutorials, Amazon shopping. No Duolingo progress. No Spanish websites, no online classes anywhere. One morning around 7 a. M. I heard Valentina on Facetime speaking to someone in incredibly rapid Spanish, laughing hysterically and using slang expressions I didn't recognize. When she suddenly noticed me standing in the doorway with my coffee, she immediately switched to awkward English. Okay, um, talk to you later about the, uh, homework assignment we discuss. The person on the other end very clearly said, Te amo mucho, mi amor before she frantically hung up. Who exactly was that? I asked as casually as possible. Just my Spanish study group, she mumbled, her face turning bright red. We practice conversations together for authenticity. Study groups definitely don't end with I love you so much, my love. I started paying much closer attention to everything. Valentina would mysteriously disappear for three to four hours, claiming Spanish club meetings at Jefferson High. But when I called the main office, pretend to ask about pickup times, they said Spanish Club had been permanently canceled all semester due to complete lack of student interest. Last Tuesday afternoon, a fancy package arrived specifically addressed to Valentina Rodriguez, not her real last name. Inside was a gorgeous silver necklace with me, Corazon de Ternero, engraved on an expensive heart shaped

At 2:00am, I was 22 and perfectly content playing video games after my Best Buy shifts when my older brother called a family meeting about our health crisis. Fresh off his promotion to regional manager at his insurance company, he decided we all needed his level of discipline. Starting tomorrow, we're all joining this fitness challenge app, he announced, waving his phone like Moses with the tablets. 10,000 steps every single day or you get marked as failing in front of the whole family. Mom protested that her arthritis made walking painful, but he cut her off with. Exercise helps arthritis. That's just laziness. Talking dad mentioned his 12 hour warehouse shifts were already physical enough and my brother actually laughed in his face. Walking around a warehouse isn't real cardio, dad. Then he targeted me directly. And you sitting at that register eight hours a day is basically signing your own death certificate. He forced us to sink our trackers right there in the living room, adding us to his family accountability group where everyone could see everyone else's stats in real time. The app sent achievement notifications for hitting goals and public shame alerts when someone fell behind. This is about loving each other enough to stay healthy, he said. But the way he configured alerts for every single thousand steps look more like surveillance than love. The torture Began immediately as I got seven shame notifications before lunch because I'd only walk 2,000 steps during my morning shift while my brother's tracker showed 8,000 from supposedly walking around the office. That night I spent an hour walking circles around our neighborhood like a zombie just to stop the alerts from coming. Within days, mom was dragging herself to 5:00am water aerobics before her hospital shift because it was the only class she could make. Dad dropped $200 on orthopedic shoes and gave up lunch with his work friends to pace walk alone. By week two, the messages turned personal with gems like, really disappointed in your commitment level. When I only hit 9,000 steps, the rage built inside me as I forced myself to run every step feeling like punishment for a crime I didn't commit. My shin screamed in protest, but notifications finally stopped. Meanwhile, mom had infiltrated a mall walking group full of retirees who treated Macy's like their personal track. At dawn, dad transformed into a sweaty mess, biking to work and arriving exhausted before his shift even started. My brother's stats grew more absurd, showing 15,000 steps nightly between eleven PM and 2:00am. I've discovered late night walks when the air is crisp and the world is quiet, he posted smugly. By week 3, mom limped through her shifts with plantar fasciitis while my my brother preached about champions pushing through discomfort. Dad's back gave out from biking, but he financed an elliptical just To avoid more shame, I enrolled in a half Marathon program, cursing his name with every agonizing mile. Only our golden retriever, Max, seemed to benefit, developing the physique of a canine athlete with energy that never quit. My brother's perfect midnight stats finally broke my brain, because they showed three hours of identical pace without a single variation.

In 10th grade, I had this substitute teacher. Everyone felt bad for kids, always messed with her because she was too nice to give detentions. One morning she came in crying. We later found out her husband had handed her divorce papers in the parking lot. During second period, two girls in front of me kept laughing at their phones. The sub asked them three times to put them away, but they didn't listen. Finally, she went over to take one and the girl shoved her back. The sub stumbled but still grabbed the phone. When she looked at the screen, her face completely changed. She whispered, oh, my god, and ran out of the room with both phones. We sat there in silence for 20 minutes until the principal, security and a crying parent rushed in. Six students were pulled out, including me, just for sitting nearby. In the office, we were shown what was really happening. The girls had been running an account that secretly shared things about students online without their permission. Some posts were very serious, been organized like a menu. But the most shocking part, they had also been threatening our substitute teacher using pictures of her own daughter who went to our school. That's why she never gave detentions. He was scared. The girls were removed from school immediately. But instead of only punishing them, the school board expelled every student who had liked Or shared anything from that account. Over 40 students, the substitute quit teaching forever. Parents took action against the school. Even federal authorities got involved. And the worst part, one of the expelled students was my best friend, who had only liked a random meme from that account, not knowing what it really was.

It was pouring outside, the kind of rain that hits so hard it sounds like gravel on the roof. He had no umbrella, no jacket, just this faded grey hoodie that looked like it had been through the wash about a thousand times. His hands were shaking so bad he could barely hold the menu. Not from the cold. I could tell the difference. This was something else. Just coffee, he mumbled, not making eye contact. I brought him the coffee with extra cream and sugar packets. Barely touched it. Just sat there in booth 7, staring out the window at the empty parking lot. Water was still dripping from his hair onto the table. After about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore. The guy looked like he was drowning and not from the rain. You okay, I asked. Wiping down the table next to his, he looked up at me for the first time. His eyes were red, not from crying, but from exhaustion, like he hadn't slept in days. I lost everything today, he said quietly. My job got evicted from my apartment and I was sitting in my car tonight thinking about. He trailed off, but I knew what he meant. I sat down across from him. Probably wasn't supposed to, but Mickey wasn't there and The place was empty anyway. What kind of job, I asked. Construction. Been doing it for 12 years. Company went under yesterday. Just like that. He snapped his fingers weekly. We talked for the next three hours, not about the heavy stuff, just normal things. I told him about this regular customer who always ordered pancakes but asked for the syrup in a separate cup because he liked to dip each bite. He laughed at that. He told me about his old dog, Buster, who used to bark at the microwave every time it beeped. How he.

I smiled, congratulated the couple and left. Monday morning, his college tuition I've been paying got cancelled. I need to get this off my chest because the family drama has reached nuclear levels. I'm 34, own a successful contracting business and I've been single most of my adult life by choice. Brooke seemed different, though. She was 29, worked in marketing and we've been talking about moving in together. I was even thinking about ring shopping. I've been covering Kyle's college tuition for four years. My sister Kimberly divorced when Kyle was fifteen. Money was always tight, so when he got into state university, I offered to pay rather than watch him drown in student loans. Roughly one eighteen hundred dollars per month plus I bought him a car and covered textbooks. Total investment was pushing $80,000. Saturday was Kyle's wedding to his college sweetheart, Isabella. I was excited to bring Brooke. First time meeting my extended family. The reception was amazing until Kyle stood up for his speech. He thanked his parents, his new wife, then his eyes landed on me with this smug grin. I also wanna thank my Uncle Steven for everything he's done for me. He's been like a second father and I'm so glad he finally found someone desperate enough to date him. Brooke, you're a saint for putting up with his boring construction stories. The entire room erupted. In laughter, Kyle raised his glass like he just delivered the punch line of the century. My whole family was laughing, including Kimberly, who was practically in tears from cackling. But then I noticed something that made my blood run cold. Brooke was looking directly at Kyle's best man, Patrick, and they shared this quick knowing look before she composed herself. I didn't make a scene. I stood up, walked over to Kyle, shook his hand and congratulated him, told Brooke I wasn't feeling well and needed to head home early that night. I couldn't sleep. Something about that look between Brooke and Patrick kept bothering me. I'd seen Patrick around when I picked up Kyle from campus, but Brooke never mentioned knowing him. Sunday morning, I called Kyle, still hungover but thought his speech was hilarious. I asked about Patrick and Kyle mentioned Patrick and Brooke had been seeing each other on and off for about two years. They broken up in February, but Patrick still asked about her all the time. My stomach dropped. Brooke and I started dating in March. The timeline was crystal clear, barely any gap between their breakup and when she started dating me. I spent Sunday doing research. Brooke had always been secretive about social media. I created a fake account and found photos of her with Patrick dating back 8 teen months. Most recent post was from 2 weeks ago, them at a restaurant together. Monday morning, I called the university's financial Aid office. Due to unexpected family circumstances, I need to discontinue funding effective immediately. I.

We got called to Riverside Gardens apartment complex for breaking and entering at 2:00am on a freezing Tuesday night. The landlord, Mister Peterson was absolutely livid when we arrived. Someone had completely destroyed the front door of Unit 4B. The hinges were ripped clean out of the door frame, wood splintered everywhere. The whole door hanging sideways like a broken jaw. I want him arrested immediately, Peterson kept screaming. His face red with rage, pointing at this college kid sitting on a ratty brown couch covered in drywall dust and paint chips. Kid looked maybe 19, skinny, wearing a torn State University sweatshirt. His knuckles raw and bleeding from clearly punching through that reinforced door multiple times. She stopped answering her phone at seven PM he said before I could even introduce myself. Voice cracking with exhaustion. Mrs. Brown always answers by the second ring, always. I knew something was seriously wrong. His name was Tyler Morrison. The. The demolished apartment belonged to his neighbor directly across the narrow hallway. Missus Eleanor Brown, an 82 year old widow who'd lived in that same one bedroom unit for 15 years straight. Tyler explained he'd been doing daily wellness checks on her every single morning since her only daughter Michelle moved to Seattle for a new job six months ago. Every morning at exactly 8:00am she'd knock three times on my door, he said, his hands still shaking from adrenaline. Three knocks meant she was okay, made it through another night. Tonight, she didn't knock. I went to check on her around nine PM her lights were blazing, but she wouldn't come to the door. I walked slowly around Missus Brown's cramped apartment while Tyler continued telling his story. Her ancient television was still playing some loud late night infomercial for kitchen gadgets, volume cranked way up like elderly people do. Her wire rimmed reading glasses sat on the scratched kitchen table next to a half finished crossword puzzle, pencil still in her handwriting. That's when I noticed the orange pill bottle scattered messily across her coffee table. Heart medication, blood pressure.

I was putting my 9 month old baby down for her afternoon nap when the baby monitor started acting weird. At first I thought it was just the crappy connection again. You know how those cheap monitors get all staticky. But then the screen cleared up and I saw something that made my blood freeze. There was a man in my baby's room just standing there going through her dresser drawers real quiet like he owned the place. I didn't scream. I didn't even breathe. I just hit the mute button on that monitor so fast because I realised he could probably hear himself through the speaker if I didn't. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the thing. Guy had gloves on and this black backpack slung over his shoulder. I could see something bulky in his back pocket that definitely wasn't his wallet. My husband Jake had left for his shift at the fire station maybe 30 minutes before this. Perfect timing, right? I grabbed my keys, real quiet and locked the basement door behind me. Then I called 9 1 1 with fingers that wouldn't stop trembling. The dispatcher asked me like three times if I was absolutely sure there was someone in my house. Lady, I'm staring at him right now on this monitor while he's rifling through my baby's stuff. I told him about the gloves, the backpack, whatever was in his pocket, probably A knife or gun. She asked if I was somewhere safe and I whispered that I was locked in the basement, but my baby was still upstairs with this psycho. What I didn't know then was that this creep had been watching our house for weeks. He knew our whole routine down to.

I was 10 when my mom lost her job at the bank. She told me it was corporate restructuring, but I overheard her crying to my aunt about how her boss wouldn't stop touching her shoulder in meetings. That night, she applied for Doordash, started working nights while I stayed with grandma. I hated it. All my friends had their moms at soccer games. Mine had fry grease on her sleeves and missed everything. One afternoon, I got sick at school. Stomach flu. Throwing up in the nurse's office. Called my mom five times. No answer. When she finally came, almost two hours later, I was furious. She smelled like French fries and exhaustion. Her eyes were sunken in her hair, tied up with a pencil. I refused to look at her. All I could think was, why can't you just be normal like other moms? That night, I woke up to glass shattering. She was in the kitchen, hands shaking, trying to sweep up a broken mug. The table was covered in bills. Red stamp, screaming final notice. I heard something about the electricity getting shut off tomorrow. She didn't know I was there, watching from the hallway. She opened her Doordash app. $41 and 27 for six hours of driving. Then she just put her head down and sobbed. I'd never seen her cry like that. Next morning, I pretended to be asleep when she kissed my forehead before leaving. I heard her whisper, I'm trying, baby. I promise I'm trying. After school, I asked grandma to drive me to Mom's delivery zone. We found her parked outside Chipotle. I watched her through the window argue with the manager. He was this big guy with a beard pointing in her face. She just stood there, not flinching. Then something shifted. Her back straightened. Her chin lifted. She said something that made the guy take a step back. A minute later, she walked out with the corrected order, wiping tears but holding her head high. She didn't see us watching from grandma's old

I used to sneak into my college cafeteria at 2:00am to steal leftover pizza. One night I walk in expecting it to be empty and there's this cop sitting at a table drinking coffee and eating a donut like it's totally normal. Officer Jenkins just looks at me and goes, you're either really brave or really stupid. I freeze like a deer in headlights thinking I'm about to get arrested. But then he stands up and says, let's see how good you really are at this. I'm confused until he points to the kitchen and goes, you think you can sneak past me to get that pizza? Let's find out. This guy just turned my midnight snack run into some kind of weird game. He starts counting to 10 and tells me to run. I'm sprinting through the cafeteria like I'm in a spy movie, diving behind soda machines and crawling under tables. Jenkins is walking around pretending to look for me, but he's being super dramatic about it. He's checking the freezer going, hmm, where could she be, while I'm literally hiding behind a trash can three feet away. After like 10 minutes of this, he finds me crouched behind the salad bar. Instead of being mad, he starts laughing and slides a leftover donut across the counter. Not bad, kid, but you knocked over a chair. Work on your stealth. I thought that was the end of it. Wrong. Two weeks later, I find a sticky note on my dorm door that says, next time bring a friend, OJ this man really just challenged me to up my game. So I convinced my roommate Lisa to come with me the next time. We show up at 2:00am and Jenkins is there again like he's been waiting. Ah, you brought backup. This calls for level 2. He pulls out these fake handcuffs made from cafeteria straws and starts chasing us around the dining hall. Lisa is screaming and I'm dying laughing while we're running between tables. He arrests both of us and makes us sit in the corner for five minutes before letting us go with leftover cookies. This became a weekly thing. Jenkins would leave me notes with increasingly ridiculous challenges. Can you steal a banana without touching the floor? Mission impossible style. Infiltration required. One time I showed up and he had set up cardboard boxes as obstacles. I'm army crawling through this makeshift obstacle course at 2:00am while a police officer times me with his phone. The man even gave me a score card. Eight out of 10 points deducted for giggling too loud. Another time he pretended to be asleep at his table and I had to sneak past him to get to the pizza, except he kept snoring super loud and obviously fake. When I got close, he jumped up going, aha, gotcha, and scared me so bad I dropped an entire stack of Plates. We both just stared at each other for a second before bursting out laughing. The sound echoed through the whole cafeteria. My favorite was when he left me a note saying, bring ramen. We're having a 3:00am cooking competition. I show up with instant noodles, and this man has a whole portable camping.

Our apartment complex has assigned parking spots, but this lady, Karen, kept leaving passive aggressive notes on our windshield, claiming we parked too close to her invisible property line. She he'd measure with a literal tape measure every morning at exactly 7:15 a. M. The first note was polite. Hi, neighbor, just wanted to mention your car seems a bit over the line. Thanks. But when mom checked, we were dead center in our spot. Mom started documenting everything, photos from multiple angles, time stamps, actual measurements with her own tape measure. Karen's white Honda Civic was always perfectly centered, but somehow our Toyota was encroaching by half an inch, according to her daily inspections. Week 2, the notes got nastier. Learn to park properly with angry red underlines. Respect boundaries and common courtesy written in all caps with a Sharpie. One even had a crude drawing of our car with arrows pointing to the violation. Mom just kept taking pictures and staying quiet. Dad thought she was being too patient, but she had that look in her eyes, the same one she got before she outsmarted the cable company. Karen escalated to confronting us in person. She'd wait by her car with her tape measure, ready to lecture whoever came out first. Your vehicle is clearly over the designated boundary markers, she'd announce like she was conducting official business. Mom would just nod politely and Say I'll look into that. Thanks for letting me know. This drove Karen absolutely insane because she wanted to fight. Then one evening, mom was reading through our lease renewal paperwork when she discovered something absolutely brilliant. The parking spots weren't assigned by apartment number like everyone assumed. They were assigned by the actual square footage of your rental unit. Studio apartments got the small back spots. I one bedroom units got the middle section. Two bedroom tenants like us got the premium front spots with extra width. Mom spent the next three days digging through public records and lease databases online. Karen had been living in apartment 2B, which was listed as a 4 80 square foot studio parking spot she'd been defending so aggressively, designated specifically for units over 900 square feet. For eight months, Karen had been illegally occupying a premium parking space while the actual studio spot sat empty in the back.

Oh, honey, I should have told you. We're going out with Ellie tonight. My stomach dropped. Your what? Ellie has exciting news, so we're taking her out to celebrate. It's my birthday. She laughed like I was whining. Don't be dramatic. We'll do something next weekend. In the background, Ellie's voice tell him we'll save leftovers. More laughter. This wasn't neglect. This was deliberate. I could have argued, but what was the point? I swallowed the lump and said, have fun, then hung up. I called my girlfriend, Lily want Dinner tonight. She could tell something was wrong. Of course. What happened? I told her everything. Come over. My parents will celebrate with you. Lily's parents have treated me with more kindness in three years than my own parents ever have. Her mom greeted me with a hug. Happy birthday. We're going somewhere nice. We ended up at a high end steakhouse. Her dad ordered champagne to celebrate me turning 21. For the first time that day, I felt wanted. But the real fun happened when I posted about it. After dinner, I posted on Instagram, huge thank you to my girlfriend and her amazing family for making my birthday special. So grateful to have people who actually care about me. Within an hour, my phone blew up with 6, 7 notifications, text from my mom.

I'm a teacher and I had one student who refused to believe in history. Not that he was bad at history. He actively denied its existence. One day we had a test about the Titanic and he straight up refused to do it. His reason, the Titanic was fake. It was just a movie. I thought he was joking. He wasn't. Every single historical event we covered, fake World War 2, government propaganda, the moon landing filmed in a basement. The Civil War never happened. It didn't matter if I showed him photos, documents, first hand accounts, he just shook his head like I was reading him a fairy tale. Where's the proof? I just showed you the proof. I even tried showing video clips of historical events, but that only made it worse. Oh, so they just happen to have cameras back then. Convenient. No matter what, I couldn't get him to do a single assignment. So obviously his grades plummeted. His parents eventually got concerned and scheduled a meeting with me. I sat them down and explained everything, how he thought history was fake, how he refused to do any work, and how I had literally provided him with evidence of every single thing we Learned. And their response accused me of shutting down his imagination and suppressing his creativity. I was definitely doing that when he was out here suppressing history. Then his dad threatened to get me. Fired if I didn't stop failing his son, I just smiled and said, I'll look into it. I didn't change a thing. And their son, he failed the class. He's homeschooled now. But last week, I ran into one of his old classmate. I asked if they still talk to him, and they just sighed and said, yeah, he posted on Facebook saying that birds aren't real.

She starts going off about how her ankles are bad and she can't walk that far and how I'm young and healthy so I should just park on the street instead. I'm like, lady, this is my house and my driveway that I'm paying a mortgage on. You don't get to just claim it because walking is hard for you. She moves the car again and again. I watch her make this painful trek back home 30 minutes later, sweating through her clothes. I thought maybe she got the message, but nope.

My husband's cousin Kelly was dying, cancer, 22 years old, whole life ahead of her that just got cut short. Everyone in the family was devastated, especially because all she ever talked about was wanting to be a mom someday. She'd babysit. Every kid in the neighborhood had names picked out for her future kids, the whole thing. When Kelly got sick, her boyfriend Derek proposed immediately. They had this tiny ceremony in her hospital room because she wanted to be married before she died, was actually really sweet. Everyone was crying. But then things got weird. Kelly's parents came to me and my husband one day with this request that made my skin crawl. They asked if Kelly could borrow our 10 month old daughter Emma for a few weeks, not babysit, borrow like she was a library book. They explained how Kelly wanted to experience being a mom, even if it was just pretend. They'd set up a whole nursery, take professional photos, post on social media about their baby girl. Derek was totally on board saying it would help Kelly feel fulfilled before she passed. I was shocked. This woman wanted to play house with my actual baby. When I asked about logistics, they brushed off everything. Emma was still breastfeeding. They'd figure it out. She'd never been away from me overnight. Kelly needed this more than Emma needed routine. The whole family started pressuring us. Kelly's dad even said We could think of it as a free vacation that we'd finally get alone time with our 3 year old son since we popped them out so close together. That comment really pissed me off. My husband was torn because Kelly was his cousin, but I stood firm. There was no way some dying woman was going to cosplay motherhood with my daughter. It felt completely unhinged. Kelly's mom suggested a compromise where I could visit twice daily to bring breast milk like I was some kind of dairy cow delivering to their fantasy family. Still, no. The pressure got intense. Family members started calling me selfish and heartless. Kelly's mom showed up at our house crying, begging me to reconsider because Kelly was getting sicker. Derek even had the nerve to tell me I didn't understand what real love looked like. But here's what really sealed it for me. I found out they'd already set up the nursery, bought matching outfits for Derek and Kelly to wear in family photos and told their friends they were about to become parents. This wasn't some last minute dying wish. They've been planning this manipulation for weeks. Kelly started posting passive aggressive stuff on Facebook about how some people prioritize themselves over dying relatives. The whole family was sharing her posts, basically trying to shame me into handing over my baby. Finally, I'd had enough. I posted my own response explaining exactly what they'd asked me to do. I laid out every Creepy detail about their plan to pretend Emma was their daughter, how they wanted professional photos for social media, how they dismissed Emma's needs completely. The response was immediate. Other parents in our extended family were whore.

My fiance, Trevor, and I have been together for 3 years. When I moved in with him, I had to buy a car because his house is literally hours from my job at the hospital. I'm a nurse, so I need reliable transportation for my shifts. This car hasn't worked in two months. The transmission is completely shot and needs like $4,000 to fix it. I offered to help pay for it, but he said no. Instead, he kept asking to borrow my car for grocery runs and random errands, which I was fine with as long as I wasn't working. New Year's Eve rolls around and Trevor tells me he wants to take my car to hang out with his friends and celebrate. I, I told him no because I had to cover a night shift and needed my car to get to work. He kept pushing, asking if I could call in sick or find someone to switch with me at the last minute. I explained that you can't just bail on a shift like that, especially on New Year's Eve when the er is crazy busy. He seemed to drop it. So I went to take a shower before work. When I got out, Trevor was gone. So was my car. I freaked out and started calling him immediately. He didn't answer. I called like 10 times in a row. Nothing. Finally, one of his friends picked up his phone and confirmed They were all out drinking and celebrating. The friend told me Trevor said I should just skip my shift and he'd bring the car back later. I was so pissed I couldn't even think straight. I needed my car to get to work and these idiots thought I should just blow off my job so Trevor could have a good time. I called Trevor back and told him if he didn't bring my car back immediately, I'd call the police. He laughed at me, actually laughed and said I was being dramatic. So I called the cops. I told them my fiance took my car without permission after I specifically said no and I needed it for work. They asked if I wanted to press charges and I said yes. The police found them at some bar downtown and arrested all of them. I had to go pick up my car from the police station, but I still made it to my shift on time. Meanwhile, Trevor spent New Year's Eve in jail. When he got released the next morning, my phone was blowing up with angry texts and missed calls. He was furious, calling me crazy and saying I humiliated him in front of all his friends. now none of them would talk to him because I got them all arrested. We had this huge fight when I got home from work, kept saying what's mine is his and vice versa. So technically, I couldn't call it theft. But I told him. He went behind my back after I said no. And that's exactly what theft is. He tried to make me feel guilty, saying I ruined his New Years and destroyed his friendships. But honestly, I don't care. I work 12 hour shifts saving people's lives. And he thought his party was more important than that. The worst part is.

My sister Maya had just escaped the worst relationship of her life. She moved in with me and my husband Kyle, bringing her 5 month old son Oliver. She was dealing with postpartum depression and regular depression on top of everything else. Kyle said absolutely when I asked if she could stay with us. Actually, he was the one who drove three hours to pick them up. For two weeks, everything seemed fine. Maya helped with dishes and laundry without me even asking. But then Kyle started complaining about Oliver crying at night. I mean, what did he expect from a five month old baby? I suggested he wear earbuds to sleep, but he just grumbled and said, forget it. Last week I had to drive 4 hours away from my friend Jessica's funeral. Kyle said he'd stay home to keep an eye on Maya and make sure she was okay. I thought that was sweet of him, honestly. When I got back the next day, the house was completely silent. No baby sounds, no Maya humming while she folded clothes like she always did. I called out for them but got nothing. Kyle came downstairs looking weird, kind of nervous, but trying to act casual. He told me Maya had called some friend in another town and decided to move there. That morning he handed me This crumpled letter that supposedly was from her. The whole thing felt wrong. Maya would have called me or at least texted. We talked every day about everything. I called her phone about 20 times. No answer. Kyle said she must have left it behind because he found it on the kitchen counter. That made zero sense. Maya never went anywhere without her phone, especially with a baby. I started calling our relatives, our aunt Carol, our cousin Brett, even our grandma, who Maya called every Sunday. Nobody had heard from her. Nobody even knew she was planning to leave. Kyle kept saying she probably just needed space and would call when she was ready. For six days, I barely slept. I kept thinking about Maya alone somewhere with Oliver, dealing with her depression without any support. Kyle got annoyed when I kept bringing it up. He said I was being dramatic and that Maya was a grown woman who could take care of herself. Yesterday, my phone rang from a number I didn't recognize. It was Maya and she was crying. She told me Kyle had kicked her out the day I left for the funeral. He told her she wasn't welcome anymore and needed to take responsibility for her decisions instead of depending on us. She wasn't staying with some friend. She was at a homeless shelter downtown with Oliver. She had no money, no car, nothing. She'd been trying to figure out how to contact me without Her phone. A social worker at the shelter finally let her use their phone. When Kyle got home from work, I was waiting for him in the living room. I completely lost it on him. I screamed about how he lied to my face for a week while my sister and nephew were homeless. He admitted he wrote that fake letter and hid her phone but said it was his house, too, and he had a right to want peace. Peace. My sister and her baby were sleeping in a shelter and he wanted peace. I told him I was picking them up tomorrow.

So I was married to Ben for 18 years before I finally got tired of his crap and filed for divorce. This guy was the worst kind of husband, the type who thinks screaming at you about burnt toast means he's communicating. He tear me down every single day with his mouth, calling me useless, stupid, you name it. The final straw was when he told me I was lucky he married me because nobody else would want damaged goods like me. After the divorce papers were signed, Ben packed his stuff and moved 4 hours away to live near his mom. Perfect. Good riddance. Here's the thing. He also decided our three kids weren't worth the drive anymore. Child support barely covered, groceries, visits, maybe Christmas if we were lucky. I was basically a single mom overnight while this deadbeat played video games in his childhood bedroom. About six months later, I decided we needed new family photos. The old ones still had Ben's smug face in them. Every time I walked past our hallway, I wanted to punch the wall. I booked us a session at one of those fancy portrait studios downtown. My kids were excited. They'd grown so much since the divorce. And honestly, we all looked happier without Ben's negativity dragging us down. We spent the afternoon taking different poses. The photographer was this sweet older lady who kept making my youngest laugh by making funny faces. Behind the camera when we finished, she showed us the digital gallery on her computer. The photos were beautiful, genuine smiles, relaxed poses, none of that forced family nonsense we used to do. As we're scrolling through picking which ones to order, my oldest daughter, Emma, suddenly perks up. Mom, can we send one to Grandma Ruth? That's Ben's mom. I felt my stomach drop a little because Ruth and I never really had much of a relationship. We saw each other maybe twice a year at holidays, change pleasantries. That was it. Honey, I don't think grandma would want a picture with me in it, I told her gently. But we can definitely order her a nice one with just you kids. Emma shook her head really fast. No, mom. She always asks about you when dad calls. She tells him he messed up. The best thing.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb. His 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again. Fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework. Completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program. 60 days. Some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapsed the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox, thinking maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,005 hundred for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He'd stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewelry, our TV, Emma's laptop, and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The Kid had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. When my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad, who died when she was six. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born. $180,000. That was meant to get her through whatever college she wanted without debt. Emma's crazy smart. Like, scary smart. Her teachers keep telling me she could get into Harvard or Yale if she keeps her grades up. But even with scholarships, those schools cost a fortune. And our incomes too high to qualify for financial aid. That money was supposed to be her safety net, her ticket to whatever future she wanted. I told my husband absolutely not. The fund was off limits, period. That's when he lost it. Started yelling about how I was choosing money over his son's life, how addiction was a medical condition, how we had a moral obligation to help family. He kept saying, medical emergencies come before education. Like Emma going to college with some luxury instead of her entire future. The worst part happened three days later. I came home from work early and found my husband and Emma sitting at the Kitchen table. She looks like she'd been crying. And there were all these pamphlets spread out about the rehab place. My husband had asked her directly if she'd be willing to give up 30,000 from her fun to save her stepbrother's life. Emma just sat there, not saying anything. You could see the guilt eating

My daughter Maya has autism and finds gardening incredibly soothing. After her diagnosis, we spent 6 months researching and creating this amazing sensory garden in our backyard. Lavender for calming sense, lambs ear for soft textures, mint she could safely taste and these beautiful wind chimes that made gentle sounds without overwhelming her. It became her safe space where she'd spend hours just touching plants and organizing pebbles into perfect little rows. Then this 10 year old from next door, Becca, started climbing our fence and absolutely destroying everything. First it was just trampled marigolds, then pulled up herbs, broken branches, scattered mulch everywhere. Maya would find the chaos and have complete meltdowns. I mean, so hard she'd hurt herself. I approached Becca's mom, Linda, super politely. Single mom, works double shifts as a nurse, seemed genuinely horrified when I showed her photos of the damage. She promised to talk to Becca, keep her inside during garden time. But three days later, more destruction. Second conversation got a bit tenser. Linda insisted Becca was grounded, couldn't possibly be doing this. Maybe neighborhood cats. I showed her the tiny footprints in our flower beds. She got defensive saying kids will be kids. Maybe Maya was too sensitive. The destruction escalated. Broken solar lights, uprooted seedlings Maya had been nurturing for weeks. Even our special textured stones thrown around randomly. One morning we found a weird Girl spray painted in wobbly letters on our garden shed. Maya saw it first and just crumpled. Third conversation with Linda turned into a shouting match. She accused me of targeting her daughter, said maybe we shouldn't have special needs gardens if we couldn't handle normal kid behavior. I was ready to call the cops. That's when I noticed the pattern. Damage only happened on Tuesdays and Fridays, always between 2, 4 PM Linda's work schedule. I bought a hidden trail camera, the kind hunters use and positioned it perfectly. What I captured made my blood run cold. Yes, Becca was destroying our garden, but she wasn't acting alone. Linda's boyfriend Derek was right there phone out filming her doing it and laughing his ass off. The audio was crystal clear. Make it worse. Pull up more of those stupid plants. That freak next door deserves it. But here's what really got me. Becca looked absolutely miserable. No joy, no mischief, just this defeated kid following orders. At one point she hesitated before stepping on Maya's favorite purple flowers and Derek snapped, do it or we're not getting ice cream. This grown man was using a 10 year old to bully my autistic daughter for his own twisted entertainment. Probably planning to post the videos online somewhere. I burned that footage onto three different drives and march next door.

Lisa was one of those middle aged managers who peaked in high school and took out her disappointments on everyone beneath her. She treated me like I was human garbage just because I worked part time folding clothes at this discount retail chain. You're 26 and still working retail? She'd here while I reorganized the clearance rack for the third time that day. Face it, this is probably the best you'll ever do in life. She'd make me work back to back doubles when people called out sick, forced me to clean the disgusting storage room that reeked of mildew and old cardboard, and wrote me up for the stupidest infractions. Five minutes late because of traffic, written up. Forgot to straighten one clothing rack, written up. What Lisa didn't know was that I had been accepted to medical school with a full scholarship. Deferred my enrollment to help my mom through stage 3 breast cancer. I was working three jobs retail, weekend catering, and overnight data entry just to keep up with her medical bills and rent. During my lunch breaks, I'd sit in my car studying organic chemistry and pharmacology textbooks while eating gas station sandwiches. I was taking night classes to maintain my acceptance status, attending virtual lectures on my phone between customers, volunteering at the free clinic on Sundays. Lisa assumed I was just scrolling Social media. When she saw me on my phone, she had no idea I was reviewing case studies or watching surgical procedure videos to stay sharp for when I finally started school. The breaking point came on a busy Saturday afternoon. This middle aged guy was browsing the electronics section when he suddenly collapsed right in front of the checkout counter. His whole body went rigid, then started convulsing violently. Lisa just stood. They're frozen, mouth hanging open like a fish. Other customers were screaming and pulling out their phones to record instead of help. I immediately dropped the stack of returns I was carrying and rushed over. Training kicked in for my EMT certification and hundreds of hours volunteering in the hospital. I quickly moved anything dangerous away from him, loosened his collar and carefully turned him on his side. Call 9 1 1 now, I told Lisa firmly, while checking his pulse and monitoring his breathing. Tell them we have a middle aged male, approximately 50, experiencing what appears to be a tonic clonic seizure. He's breathing but unconscious. I stayed with him, timing the seizure and talking calmly to keep him oriented as he started coming around. When the paramedics arrived, I gave them a detailed handoff like I've done it hundreds of times before. Patient experienced approximately 90 seconds of convulsions. No visible injuries from the fall. Vital, stable. He's been responsive for the last two minutes, I reported professionally. The lead paramedic looked impressed. You Medical? Not yet, I smiled. That's when Lisa started getting suspicious. For weeks afterward, she kept asking weird questions about how I knew.

For weeks, I've been packing Jake's usual Turkey sandwich, apple slices and those expensive organic crackers he loved, the kind that cost $6 a box that he'd beg for at the grocery store with his puppy dog eyes. But every day, everything came back untouched except the sandwich. When I asked why, he just shrugged and mumbled something about not being hungry. Maybe his growth spurt was over. I thought kids go through phases. His teacher, Miss Rodriguez, said he seemed fine during lunch, sitting with the same group of boys he always did, very social, she'd said during our parent conference. No concerns whatsoever. But then Jake started losing weight. Dark circles under his eyes like he wasn't sleeping. He'd come home exhausted and immediately crash on the couch, skipping his usual after school Xbox time. He even stopped wearing his favorite Pokemon shirt, the one he'd worn twice a week since third grade. I started noticing other changes, too. He'd flinch whenever I mentioned school events, asked if we could skip the fall carnival this year, which was bizarre because he'd been counting down since August. Last Tuesday, I decided to surprise him with lunch at school. He'd forgotten his water bottle that morning and I figured I'd drop it off and maybe grab a quick photo for Instagram. I signed in at the office, got my visitor badge and headed to the cafeteria with his Forgotten Marvel water bottle. That's when I saw it. Jake was sitting alone at the end of a long table, methodically eating his plain sandwich while four other boys sat at the opposite end laughing loudly. His usual snacks, the crackers, fruit snacks and juice box I'd packed, were lined up in front of them like a buffet. I watched one kid, clearly the ring leader with perfectly styled hair and new Jordans, take a bite of Jake's crackers and nod approvingly. These are good. Way better than.

My younger sister Chloe, was a fantastic liar. Not the little white lies kids tell. She built entire worlds where she was the victim and I was the monster. And for years, my parents, especially my dad, lived in that world with her. If a plate broke, I had thrown it in a rage. If she failed a test, I had hidden her study notes. They were small things at first, but they added up, creating this picture of me as the angry, jealous older sister. My mom would look at me with a questioning sadness, but my dad always took Chloe's side. She would cry these perfect, silent tears, and he would melt. The tension in our house was constant. I started spending all my time in my room because anything I did in the common areas could be twisted into a new story by Chloe. One time, I baked a cake for my mom's birthday. When my mom went to cut it, she found that someone had poured salt all over the top. Chloe immediately started crying, saying she saw me do it because I was mad that mom liked her baking better. My dad grounded me for a month without even asking for my side of the story. I stopped trying to do nice things after that. It felt like I was handing Chloe ammunition. Things got worse when I was applying for a summer internship at a local Law firm. It was a huge opportunity. I had my interview and it went great. The lawyer, Mister Henderson, said he was very impressed. A week later, I got a rejection letter. I was heartbroken. A few days after that, my mom was at the grocery store and ran into Missus Henderson. She mentioned how sorry she was that I didn't get the position. Missus Henderson looked confused and said, oh, we were going to offer it to her, but we decided against it. After her sister called the office, my mom came home and confronted Chloe. Chloe with tears already in her eyes. Before, she had no idea what she was talking about. Then she remembered. She said she had only called to ask for the address so she could drop off a good luck card for me. And the receptionist must have misunderstood. My dad bought it completely. He told my mom she was being too hard on Chloe and that I needed to stop blaming my sister for my own failures. That was a turning point for my mom. I saw the doubt in her eyes harden into suspicion. But she didn't say anything. She just got quiet. The final straw was our grandmother's locket. It was this beautiful old silver heart that was promised to me for my 18th birthday. It was the one thing that connected me to her. A week before my birthday, the locket vanished from my mom's jewelry box. I knew immediately. Who took it? That night, my parents sat me down in the living room. Chloe was on the couch next to dad, looking pale and scared. My dad's face was stone. Chloe told us you took the locket, he said, his voice dangerously low. She said you were afraid we'd give it to her instead, so you took it to sell. I just stared at him, speechless. This was the biggest lie yet. I was about to be kicked out. I could feel it. Chloe started her crying routine, telling my dad how she saw me hiding it in my backpack and how she was so scared to tell on me. My dad stood up and pointed toward the door. I want you out of this house. He

My art teacher, Mrs. Patterson, had this absolutely bizarre rule about distracting colors. She genuinely believed that bright colors disrupted the learning environment and made students hyperactive. Only muted tones were allowed in her classroom, beiges, grays, Browns and the occasional dusty olive. This woman was seriously unhinged about it. She'd literally patrol the room during class, confiscating highlighters, colored pens, even colorful erasers. She kept a plastic bin on her desk labeled Color Contraband like we were smuggling rainbow drugs. The breaking point came when my friend Jake got his neon green marker taken away while working on a poster about rainforest conservation. When he politely pointed out that actual rainforest are literally vibrant green, she deadpanned that he should use olive green instead because nature can be toned down for educational purposes. Sarah got her purple gel pen confiscated while taking notes. Marcus had his yellow highlighter snatched mid sentence. Emma's pink eraser disappeared from her pencil case. It was getting ridiculous. The final straw was when Mrs. Patterson made this girl named Chloe throw away her rainbow bracelet because it was visually overstimulating. Chloe had made it in memory of her grandmother who'd recently passed. I watched this poor girl quietly crying as she dropped it in the trash. That's when I decided enough was enough. That weekend, I went full research mode. I spent hours digging through color psychology studies, educational research papers and neuroscience journals. Turns out Mrs. Patterson's theory was not just wrong, it was backwards. I found 23 peer reviewed studies showing that bright colors actually improve focus, memory retention and creativity in learning environments. I printed every single one, highlighted the key findings in, you guessed it, bright yellow. Monday morning I showed up to class wearing the most aggressively beige outfit I could assemble. Tan cargo pants, khaki button down, brown cardigan, beige shoes. I look like I've been dipped in oatmeal. Even my backpack was brown. Mrs. Patterson actually smiled when she saw me. Finally, someone who understands the importance of calming color choices in education. That's when I struck. Actually, Mrs. Patterson, I've been researching your color theory over the weekend. I pulled out my thick stack of research papers. Did you know that prolonged exposure to beige environments is scientifically proven to cause depression and cognitive lethargy? Her smile faltered as I started distributing copies to my confused classmates. According to this Harvard Medical School study, muted color palettes in educational settings decreased student engagement by 37%. I kept my voice perfectly innocent and academic. Jake caught on first. Wow. This university of Texas study says that colorless classrooms actually increase stress hormones in teenagers. Sarah jumped in. This one from Stanford shows that bright colors enhance problem solving abilities. Mrs. Patterson's face was shifting through several shades, ironically, none of them beige. According to the journal of Environmental Psychology, Marcus read aloud, exposure to vibrant colors improves Mood and cognitive function in educational settings.

My parents think you're worthless. I'm taking a break. I replied. Understood. Then I pulled my share from our wedding fund. Made sure her break was permanent and pricey. I own a successful auto repair shop in Cleveland. My fiance Chloe came from old money. Hampton Summers, Aspen Winters. Her parents, Edward and Lauren, made it clear I wasn't good enough for their precious daughter. For four years I endured constant on dissension. Edward once handed me his Porsche keys during dinner, asking me to check a noise like I was the help, not their future son in law. I spent 40 minutes in their garage while everyone finished eating, then came back to find Lauren offering me a kept warm plate like it was charity. Nobody acknowledged how fucked up that was. Worst was Chloe's sister Vanessa. The divorced older sister who made it her mission to break us up. She tell Chloe she was settling and intro introduce her to rich friend's sons. Even after we were engaged. Nothing wrong with having options, she'd always say with that smug smile. We had $60,000 in our joint wedding account. $30,000 for me, $30,000 from her wedding set for spring. Then you booked. Save the dates already sent. Then crack started showing. Chloe began having secretive calls with family, questioning decisions we'd already made. Fights became frequent with her defending every family slight while calling me too sensitive and saying I should make more of An effort to fit in. The breaking point came when Vanessa visited while Chloe was out getting food. The moment Chloe left, Vanessa told me straight up that Chloe was settling, that she could have the surgeon son of her father's golf buddy who just bought a summer house in the Hampton. I told Chloe what happened. She immediately exploded. You always twist everything they say. Maybe if you weren't so goddamn insecure about everything. When I demanded she talk sense to her family, she shot back. At least Vanessa doesn't make me feel like I have to choose between my family and my fiance. Two days later, I came home to an apartment that felt different. And somehow some of her things were missing. There was a note on the kitchen counter next to her engagement ring. Three paragraphs that boiled down to five devastating words. My family thinks you're worthless. She wrote about needing time to think, staying with parents, reevaluating our compatibility. After four years together, I got dumped with a fucking note? Something about the timing felt calculated. We had final venue deposits due in weeks, and I poured $30,000 into our joint account. This

But she. I'm a 28 year old union electrician making decent money. I've been with Britney for three years. When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. She wasn't excited, more like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped, her health insurance, nearly 8 thousand dollars so far, plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer Derek from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decide to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him. Damien's got great insurance and steady money, but girl, you're really settling. Derek can't provide what this baby need. Brittany replied, Damien can. My blood went cold. Guess Damien's okay Ashley continued, but you deserve better than some electrician who thinks Applebee's is fine dining Brittany laughed I care about him enough and honestly he's so desperate to play hero that he'll never question anything he just nods and pays for whatever I want for 15 minutes I I stood frozen listening to them plan my future like I was an ATM with legs how she'd keep seeing Derek after we got married how Derek didn't even know the baby was his how they'd already coached Ashley on what to say if I got suspicious. When I came home later she was acting completely normal showing me baby monitors talking about honeymoon plans asking if I was excited about becoming a daddy I needed evidence. I started recording conversations since our state allows one party consent. When she left her phone unlocked during a shower, I found months of messages between her and Derek planning their future together discussing how they'd manage things after my wedding. She literally called me the bank in one message but here's the kicker she'd been lying to Derek too she told him she was on the pill and the pregnancy was an accident this woman was playing everyone. I got a prenatal paternity test through my doctor the result 0% chance I'm the father last night I took her to Romano's where we had our first date she I thought I was planning some romantic surprise Brit, I need to ask You something straight up. Is there anything about this pregnancy you haven't told me? Pure panic flashed in her eyes before she slipped into innocent girl mode. What do you mean, babe? I know about Derek. I have the paternity test results. I know the baby isn't mine. She stared at me. Then the fake tears started some sobs.

Listen, when the school calls me, my heart always drops. Like do I need bail money? Did my kid finally stab somebody with a crayon? So I rush over, no makeup, hair in a bun, looking like I just escaped prison. And there she is, my seven year old daughter Mia, sitting in the office like she runs the damn building, legs crossed, eating goldfish crackers like she's the principal. Now the actual principal looks like he hasn't slept in a week. He goes, Mrs. Carter, we have a very serious situation. And Mia just smirks like, yeah, tell her about me. I swear this child thinks she's on Netflix. So apparently during reading time some boy told her she couldn't sit on the rainbow rug. Most kids would cry. My daughter, she leans in, smiles and says, that's fine, you're on my revenge list. Now the teacher freaks out like my kid just threatened nuclear war. She demands to see the list. And of course, my daughter, because she's extra as hell, pulls out a notebook labeled Revenge Book in Giant Flames. Not even subtle. She decorated it like a Marvel villain starter pack. They open it up and oh my god, this thing has names, pages and pages of names, teachers, classmates, even the lunch lady. And next to each name she wrote little punishments, dumb stuff like make Jimmy step on a Lego barefoot, hide Emma's lip Gloss forever. Tell everyone Mr Johnson P is sitting down. Glue Ava's hairbrush so she looks like a fine. Like this is comedy gold. But now the teacher brings it straight to the principal like she uncovered the Unabomber's diary. So now the principal is lecturing me about threat assessment. I'm sitting there like, sir, she can't even reach the top cabinet at home. Relax. And Mia, this evil little genius just shrugs and says, it's not a threat, it's practice. Batman has a villain list. So do I, man. My kid really compared herself to Batman's enemies list at 7. I'm trying not to laugh. The secretary is choking behind the desk. The janitor literally popped in just to say, yo, that's hilarious. Put me on the list 2. Meanwhile, the principal looks like he's about to retire early. And then, then Mia takes the notebook back, flips to a blank page and writes the principal's name next to it. She writes, steal all his pencils so he can't write referrals. And she slides it across the desk like some Mafia boss. This man's face turned redder than ketchup.

I connect my phone to their speakers. A little wean with your morning coffee, my good sir. So these idiots next door thought they owned the whole building. Every single morning at exactly 7:30, they blast their terrible techno music through paper thin walls. I work night shifts at the hospital so I usually don't get to sleep until around 5 a. M. You can imagine how thrilled I was to be woken up by their base heavy garbage just two and a half hours later. At first I tried the normal stuff, knocked on their door, politely explained my situation. The guy who answered looked like he hadn't showered in weeks and just shrugged. Buildings not soundproof, dude, deal with it. Then he literally shut the door in my face. I complained to the landlord three times. Each time he said he'd look into it, but nothing changed. These morons kept cranking their speakers every morning like clockwork. I started wearing earplugs, but you could still feel the vibrations through the floor. After two weeks of this torture, I was losing my mind. That's when I noticed something interesting. Their music would sometimes skip or change songs randomly and I'd see them messing with their phones through their window. They were using Bluetooth speakers. I downloaded one of those Bluetooth scanner apps and sure enough, there it was. Makes beats showing up as an available connection. These geniuses hadn't even password protected Their speakers. The next morning at 7:25, I was ready. I connected my phone to their speakers and waited. Right at 7:30, their terrible techno started up. I let it play for about 30 seconds, then hit pause on my phone. Silence. I could hear them through the wall going what the hell and fumbling around. They got their music back on, probably thinking it was just a glitch. I waited another minute, then switch their song to Baby Shark. The confusion in their voices was beautiful, but that was just the warm up. The next day I really went for it. When their morning concert started, I took control and switch to the most obnoxious music I could find. We're talking death metal followed by opera, then some experimental jazz that sounded like cats fighting. Every time they tried to regain control, I'd switch to something even worse. Polka music, bagpipe solos, that song from the early 2 about chocolate rain. They were getting so frustrated. I could hear them arguing about whose phone was broken. On day three, I decided to get educational. I queued up a playlist of self help audio books about being considerate neighbors mixed with some really aggressive death metal and random sound.

Emma had been begging for piano lessons since she was 6. Please, dad, I promise I'll practice every day. Two years of weekly lessons, $120 a month. Her teacher, Missus Johnson, always said Emma had natural talent. For months, Emma would rush home from school and go straight to the piano. She'd play the same pieces over and over, humming along with a huge smile. She even started composing her own little melodies, scribbling notes on scraps of paper. I'd find them everywhere, in her backpack, taped to her bedroom wall, even stuffed in her coat pockets. Dad, listen to this, he'd say, pulling me away from work emails to hear her latest creation. Those moments were pure magic, watching her little fingers dance across the keys, seeing that look of pure concentration on her face. It was worth every penny. Then last month, everything changed. Emma suddenly wanted to quit it. Piano is boring. I want to do soccer instead. This from the kid who used to play Chopin for her stuffed animals and begged us to get a second piano for Christmas. I was frustrated, Emma. We've invested so much time and money. You can't just quit when things get challenging. But I hate it now, she said. Tears forming. Mrs. Johnson says, I'm not trying hard enough. She makes me play the same song over and over. Her practice sessions became battles. She sit at the piano bench with slumped shoulders, pecking at keys like she was afraid of them. The joy was completely gone. No more humming, no more made up songs, no more excited calls for me to listen. I figured she was just hitting a rough patch. Every kid goes through this with activities. The initial excitement wears off, the real work begin. I told her we'd finish out the month then reassess. But something felt off. Emma used to chatter about her lessons. Mrs. Johnson taught me this cool scale today. Now she'd climb in the car after lessons looking defeated. When I asked how it went, she just shrugged and stare out the window. Today I arrived early to pick her up. Usually I'd wait in the car scrolling my phone, but something made me walk to the studio door.

My parents were absolutely convinced the gym was no place for a 17 year old girl. At 17, I was the only athlete on my track team who wasn't allowed to strength train. While my teammates were getting faster and stronger every week, I was stuck doing body weight exercises in my bedroom with a yoga mat my mom bought on sale. The frustration was unbearable. Every time I brought up needing a gym membership, my dad would go into his speech. There are too many creepy guys just showing off and hitting on young girls. He'd say. Those places are meat markets, not fitness centers. Mom would jump in with stories she'd read on Facebook. Did you see that article about the girl who got followed home from the gym or a trainer at that franchise got arrested for harassment last year? My coach kept asking why I wasn't following the team strength program. She'd written out this whole periodized training plan, but I had to keep making excuses about why my times weren't improving. I begged them constantly, please just let me try it for one month. I'll only go during women's hours. But dad would shake his head and say, we're protecting you from that toxic culture. Meanwhile, girls I used to beat easily were now passing me in races and college scouts stopped considering me at all. I was venting to My best friend Kimberly, after practice one day about how much I was starting to resent my parents. They think every guy there is some predator waiting to harass me. Simply just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. That's insane. You need strength training for track? What do they expect you to do? Fail horribly. Her mom overheard us talking and walked over to the couch. I, I thought I was about to get another adult lecture, but instead she said, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. The next day during pickup, she secretly handed me a key FOB. I added you to our family gym membership, she whispered while my mom was distracted. Tell your parents you're studying at the library with Kimberly before school. Oh, my god. I hugged her and thanked her and promised to keep this secret. For three months, Kimberly picked me up every morning at 5:00am for our library study sessions when we were actually going to the gym to train. I was building muscle and finally starting to catch up with the rest of the team. I even kept gym clothes in Kimberly's car and always showered before returning so my parents would never realize. Then one Saturday afternoon, my rebellion would.

I work at the towns only diner, been there six years. We get all types. But there was this old guy named Jonah who came in every Tuesday and Thursday for black coffee and a cinnamon roll. Never spoke much, just nodded and paid exact change. Had this bad limp from an old accident. Jonah was probably 74, lived in that tiny blue house by the train tracks. No family anyone knew about, just existed. You know, most people barely noticed him shuffling down Main Street every morning. He'd sit at table 7, read yesterday's newspaper and leave after 20 minutes. Three months ago, Jonah stopped coming. We figured he was sick or maybe moved to one of those old folks places. And Mrs. Kim from the flower shop told me he died in his sleep, natural causes. I felt bad because nobody really knew him. But then his lawyer showed up at the diner with this wild request. He wanted to put an ad in the paper that said exactly this. If I ever meant anything to you, come to my funeral this Sunday. I have one last surprise. I thought it was weird, but whatever, old people do strange things. Sunday came and I was curious. So I went, expected maybe 10 people max. Instead, the funeral home was packed. Over 200 people showed up. I recognized maybe half of them from around Town. But there were folks I'd never seen. Some drove from three towns over. A few even flew in from other states. Everyone was whispering, asking each other why they were there. Most had similar stories. Jonah once gave them bus fare when they were stranded or bought them groceries when they were broke or let them use his phone during emergencies. Then they set up this projector screen. When it started playing, there was Jonah sitting in his living room looking straight at the camera. Hey there, he said, smiling bigger than I'd ever seen. Your probably wondering why you're here. I've been watching people my whole life, keeping track, writing things down. This town's full of good people, but most of you forgot how good you are. He started naming names, called out Jessica, who worked the morning shift at the gas station, said she always made sure his coffee was fresh, even when the pot was almost empty. Talked about Mike, the mailman who shoveled Jonah's walkway every winter without being asked. Mentioned this teenager named Brandon, who once stood up for him when some drunk guys were making fun of his limp outside the bar. Said he had a notebook where he wrote down every kind thing he witnessed. I kept track of everything, Jonah said, every time someone held a door, every time someone paid for the person behind them, every time someone just treated me like I mattered. Then came the part that made Everyone lose their minds. Jonah had saved $2.1 million. He'd worked at the railroad for 40 years, never married, never had kids, lived cheap and invested everything. Every single person he named in that video was getting money. I'm got $500. Others got $20,000 depending on how many times he'd written about them. The funeral home staff started handing out envelopes right there. No lawyers, no paperwork, just pre loaded debit cards and handwritten notes explaining why each person mattered to him. Jessica, the gas station worker got $15,000. Mike, the mailman got $12,000. Brandon, that kid who defended him got $8,000 for college. Even I got an envelope with $3,000 and a note saying thanks for always saving me the good cinnamon rolls. But the craziest part was what he said at the end of the video. I was poor and family but rich and seeing goodness everywhere. You all were my family. Even if you didn't know it. Don't forget to notice each other. People were crying, hugging strangers, sharing stories about Jonah they'd never told.

Oh, sweetheart, I definitely want one with your beautiful mother. Still family to me. My heart melted a little. After 18 years of feeling invisible in that family, here was Ruth actually wanting me included. So right there, I decided to order her the biggest, most beautiful print they had.

Then I went to the frame shop next door and had it professionally matted in this gorgeous silver frame. I shipped it to Ruth's house with a note that said, thank you for always making me feel welcome in your family. Love, Sarah and the kids. What I didn't know until later was where Ruth decided to hang this masterpiece. Trevor called me two weeks later, absolutely dying with laughter. Apparently, Ruth hung our family portrait right in her front entryway. The first thing you see when you walk through her door. So now every single time Ben visits his mom, The first thing he sees is my smiling face staring back at him from a beautiful family photo that very clearly shows how much better off we are without him. Trevor said Ben's face went completely white the first time he saw it. He stood there for like 30 seconds just staring, then asked his mom why she had that up. Ruth looked him dead in the eye and said, because that's what a real family looks like, Benjamin. Maybe you should have thought about that before you threw yours away. Ben apparently tried to convince her.

Sure enough, he had little yellow caution papers taped every few feet. So Harris updated the rules. No cables over 6 feet. The next day, Ethan brought five friends and five short cables. They formed a human chain. Laptops linked together, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous. Snap. This is compliance, Ethan said. That's when Mia got involved. She noticed the Smartboard in the library was hooked up to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to it, then used the board's browser to create a hotspot. Mia, you're using school Wi-Fi? No, sir. The board is and the board's not a student. Policy updated again. No school devices As intermediaries. Meanwhile, Noah came up with his own plan. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard pretending to do a cyber security project. A few teachers actually wrote their passwords down for him. Noah, this is lying. It's social engineering, sir. Very educational. Then came Layla. She was an office aide and noticed that when teachers logged in, the password briefly appeared on the attendant screen. She memorized it, but instead of giving it away, she sold a service. Bring her your phone. She'd log it in, then mask it to look like a printer. Within days, half the network was full of Cannon 3,000 and HP desk jet. Why do we have 300 printers? Harris groaned. But the masterpiece was from Quiet Oliver. He realized the school's old routers were still active, just hidden. They'd forgotten to shut them down. He connected to school net underscore 2,016 with the password password 1. The speed faster than the teachers. Oliver, that network was decommissioned. Supposed to be, Oliver shrugged. Not was. By test week, they had no choice. The online exams required Wi-Fi, so every student got the password. Within minutes, someone had folded it into a paper airplane and thrown it across the gym. Another kid chalked it on the football field. A third whispered it into the morning announcements. Kids ear who read it phonetically with the lunch menu. Pizza with W, 1, f, 1, c, 0, d, e, exclamation Mark. Green beans, 224 hash Chocolate milk, exclamation point. Harris called an emergency assembly. Fine, you win. We're going back to open Wi-Fi with filters. The gym erupted. Then Ethan raised his hand about those filters. Don't. Just don't. The next day, the password was literal.

Yesterday, she gave them all back. When Heather was 18, she walked into the kitchen carrying an old Adidas shoebox and said, dad, I need to show you something. She set the box on the counter and lifted the lid. Inside were hundreds of napkins, postits, index cards. They were every lunch note I'd ever written her. You kept these, I asked. She nodded every single one. I'd started writing them when she was six. Divorce between her mom and I have been final for two months. Her mom got weekends and holidays. I got weekdays. That meant I did all the school stuff. The problem was I didn't know how to do school stuff. That first Monday of kindergarten, I packed Heather a peanut butter sandwich, apple slices and a juice box. She came home talking non stop about everyone else's lunch. Catherine's mom made sushi rolls that look like pandas and Julie's mom cut her sandwich into a butterfly with cookie cutter. And Joyce had a note from her mom in her lunch box that said, I love you to the moon and back with a drawing of a rocket ship. Did you like your lunch, I asked. It was fine, she said, but I could tell she was envious. That night after she went to bed, I stared at her lunch bag. I couldn't make sushi. I didn't own cookie cutters. I could write. I grabbed a napkin. And wrote, you're braver than you know. Love, dad. The next morning I tucked it under her sandwich. When she got home, she ran to hug me and said, I saw the napkin. Kelly asked if my mom wrote it and I said, no, my dad did. Nobody else's dad writes notes. I love you, dad. So I kept writing them. At first they were simple. Have a great day or you're my favorite person. Then I started adding drawings. Terrible ones. Cat that looked like a potato, a son with sunglasses. Our dog, if our dog was made of circles. By first grade, I was writing jokes. What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. She told me her table laughed so hard the lunch monitor had to shush them. Second grade, I started writing them based on what was happening before her spelling test. You got this. Those words don't stand a chance. After she'd fought with her friend. Being kind when you're hurt is the hardest kind of brave. Sit down, Heather said that morning in the kitchen. I need to show you how I organized them. She'd separated them into sections with rubber bands and labeled sticky notes. The first bundle said funny. She pulled one from third grade. Why don't eggs tell jokes? It crack up. Another one had a drawing of me attempting to dance at her recital. This is still the worst drawing you've ever done, she said, laughing. The next section was labeled Bad Days. These were thicker napkins, longer notes. She pulled one from 7th grade. You are exactly who you're supposed to be, not who they say you are, not who you think you should be, who you are. That day, Ruth had told everyone I was weird for not having a mom at home, that I was probably weird, too. How did you know, she said, that I hadn't known. I just wrote what I wished someone would tell me. She pulled out another bundle. This one made my chest tight. The label said, saved me. This section is from 8th grade. Mostly, she said. She pulled out a coffee stained napkin. You're not alone. You never have been. You never will be. Even when I'm not there, I'm there. She showed me another one from that year. Every hard thing you face is making you stronger for the next hard thing. You're becoming who you're meant to be. That was when Evelyn spread rumors about me. She said, I almost didn't go back to school, but I read this in the bathroom stall and decided I could do one more day, then one more. After that, note after note, she told me about struggles I'd never known about. The eating issues freshman year when I'd written your body is the least interesting thing about you. Panic attacks during sats when I'd written. This test measures what you know today, not who you'll become tomorrow. The friend who betrayed her junior year when I'd written, not everyone deserves your trust. That's not your failure, it's theirs. This one's my favorite, she said, pulling out a napkin from just last month. All it said was, I'm proud of you. No reason needed. I got rejected from Yale that morning, she said, before you even knew about it, this note kept me from falling apart in calculus. She started putting the.

So I'm at the airport, short term parking, driving around looking for a spot because my flight leaves in like 40 minutes and I'm already stressed. Finally, I see this dude in a silver Honda backing out of a space right near the entrance. Perfect. I stop, put my blinker on, and wait like a normal human being. The guy backs out super slow, taking forever, but whatever. Then he stops his car right there, blocking me from getting into the space. I'm thinking he's just being careful or something. But then out of nowhere, this shiny red Camaro comes flying around the corner and swoops right into my parking space, the one I've been waiting for. I could not believe it. I pull up next to this guy's window and I'm like, hey, I was waiting for that space. He just looks at me through his window, this cocky looking dude with back hair and sunglasses. Even though we're in a parking garage. His girlfriend sitting next to him has blond hair and is wearing way too much makeup for 10 in the morning. He rolls his window down just a crack and goes sorry in this totally not sorry voice, like he's doing me some huge favor, just acknowledging I exist. I'm getting mad now. Well, if you're sorry, then you can move your car and give me the space I was clearly waiting for. He literally rolls his Window back up. Just ignores me completely. His girlfriend is looking at her phone like this whole thing is beneath her. So I drive off and find another spot on the next level. Takes me 10 more minutes. Now I'm really cutting it close for my flight. But as I'm walking toward the terminal, I pass by his car again, and I see they're still sitting in there. He's on his phone, and she's fixing her makeup in the mirror. That's when I got my idea. I walk right up to his car and knock on the window. He looks annoyed as hell, but he rolls it down again. No, I say, putting on my sweetest smile. You really do have a gorgeous car. He's still looking irritated, but he goes thanks, like he can't figure out why I'm bothering him. But there's something I want you to think about while you're in the airport. I continue. Now he looks confused. What? I lean down a little closer to his window. I know exactly where your car is parked.

Did something happen? I dissolved the program. I said flatly, I'm sure everyone who was at the dinner can figure something out. I hung up. Within a week, every fund I'd set up was frozen. The safety net was gone. Two weeks later, my inbox filled with frantic voicemails. I ignored them. Then I remembered I still had admin rights to the family group chat. The one I'd created years ago. The same chat I hadn't been added to in months. I renamed it maybe take the hint. Then I removed every single member. No explanation. Just silence. But the lake house was the crown jewel. Legally, I owned half. Mom sold me her share years ago. They still treated it like communal property. Summer's reunions, weekends. I never blocked them. I even paid for the DOC last year. Not anymore. Memorial Day, their biggest tradition. I filed a partition clause restricting access unless new agreements were signed. Of course, Tara hadn't opened her mail. So Friday I parked my truck across the driveway and waited. By noon, three cars rolled up. My sister, my mom, Tara. Kids tumbling out with floaties. Laughter died when they saw me. You're here? Tara asked. Yeah. Thought I'd enjoy the lake. She crossed her arms. We're staying the weekend. That's a problem, I said. The house is locked for co owner review. The notice was in your mail. My sister snapped. Eli, don't be dramatic just because you weren't invited to one Dinner? It wasn't one dinner, I cut in. It's years. It's respect. And you made it clear I don't have any here. Mom's voice softened. Honey, we didn't mean to hurt you. Things just got busy. I almost softened. Almost. I remembered her speech. Calling everyone blessings except me. I know exactly how it is, I said. Which is why it changes today. Either we draft a new agreement or we sell. You wouldn't dare! Tara snapped. I met her eyes. You already destroyed the family part. I'm just handling the paperwork. They yelled, pleaded, cried. None of it mattered. I had every receipt, every clause, every proof. Finally, they left. Silence bloomed behind them. The next morning, I slid a Manila envelope across the post office counter. Inside, the finalized sale contract. My half of the lakehouse gone to a couple I'd vetted personally. With one condition. They put up a gate. Three days later, my phone exploded with calls. My mom's mess.

When I met my husband, not because I tried to be or anything, but every weekend friends or family would literally pay me to make cakes, pies, cookies. My specialties were cheesecakes and these crazy cakes with surprises inside them. Like once I made this chocolate cake that had layers of strawberry cheesecake hidden in the middle and people lost their minds over it. After we moved to my husband's hometown, right before our first Christmas there, I was so excited. I'd already gotten all these ingredients for this amazing Christmas cake that had all of our favourite flavours. I found this farmer who had the best fruits I'd ever seen in my life. I was telling my sisters in law about it, going on about how pumped I was to make this cake for everyone. That's when they shut me down hard. They told me not to bother and said they'd just get store bought instead. They do this with literally everything I offer to make. Only with me though. If one of their friends offers to bring the exact same thing they just turned me down for, suddenly it would be rude to refuse. The store bought cake they got was absolutely terrible. Like rock hard awful. The kids literally made jokes about sawing it into bricks to make a bread brick house. Nobody ate it except for like two bites to be polite. Fast forward a few years and my husband had bragged About my baking to so many people that my semi pro kitchen was back in full swing. We watch my sister's in law's kids pretty often and they love baking with me. They're always asking to help measure ingredients or decorate cookies. But we still get that same horrible store bought Christmas cake every single year for the family gatherings. And every year nobody eats it. Yesterday the whole family was together dealing with some drama about my parents in law, so we decided to hash out Christmas plans while everyone was there. Since we're hosting this year, I said I'd handle all the food and they could just bring dessert like always. That's when the oldest kid, Emma, completely lost it. She started complaining about why we have to get that awful cake every single year and why couldn't I make something for dessert too? My husband jumped right in and told her that her mom and auntie really prefer the cake from the store. Emma looked at her mom, then her aunt, and back at her mom, then at my husband. Then she said the most brutal thing I've ever heard come out of an 8 year old's mouth. Well, they can't even cook, so they shouldn't get to pick what we have to eat. The room went completely silent.

We got called to Riverside Gardens apartment complex for breaking and entering at 2:00am on a freezing Tuesday night. The landlord, Mister Peterson was absolutely livid when we arrived. Someone had completely destroyed the front door of Unit 4B. The hinges were ripped clean out of the door frame, wood splintered everywhere. The whole door hanging sideways like a broken jaw. I want him arrested immediately, Peterson kept screaming. His face red with rage, pointing at this college kid sitting on a ratty brown couch covered in drywall dust and paint chips. The kid looked maybe 19, skinny, wearing a torn state university sweatshirt. His knuckles raw and bleeding from clearly punching through that reinforced door multiple times. She stopped answering her phone at seven PM he said before I could even introduce myself. Voice cracking with question. Mrs. Brown always answers by the second ring, always. I knew something was seriously wrong. His name was Tyler Morrison. The demolished apartment belonged to his neighbor directly across the narrow hallway. Mrs. Eleanor Brown, and eighty two year old widow who lived in that same one bedroom unit for 15 years straight. Tyler explained he'd been doing daily wellness checks on her every single morning since her only daughter Michelle moved to Seattle for a new job six months ago. Every morning at exactly 8:00am she'd knock three times on my door, he said, his hands still shaking from Adrenaline. Three knocks meant she was okay, made it through another night. Tonight, she didn't knock. When I went to check on her around nine PM her lights were blazing, but she wouldn't come to the door. I walked slowly around Missus Brown's cramped apartment while Tyler continued telling his story. Her ancient television was still playing some loud late night infomercial for kitchen gadgets, volume cranked way up like elderly people do. Her wire rimmed reading glasses sat on the scratched kitchen table next to a half finished crossword puzzle, pencil still in her handwriting. That's when I noticed the orange pill bottles scattered messily across her coffee table. Heart medication, blood pressure pills, diabetes, insulin, cholesterol tablets. I picked up each bottle and checked the prescription dates, all from exactly three days ago. And every single bottle was completely full, 50 seals still intact, unopened. I could hear her TV blasting through our shared wall. Tyler continued wiping blood off his knuckles with a sleeve. But when I called her name, banged on the door for 10 minutes, even tried using my spare emergency.

Marcus from Japan was Google Earthing escape route. Tony from New York was documenting everything for evidence. And Kevin. Kevin did something insane. I'm spoofing a 9 1 1 call from the camp's main building, he announced, reporting a fire in the administration office. Pull their security team back.

It finally free 2,024. She has 200,000 followers and counting. But here's what haunts me. In her first stream, she mentioned something. There were other kids who tried to run. They didn't know to call gamers. They called their parents instead. Their parents called the camp. Those kids. We never saw them again. Some. Sometimes the craziest thing you hear in voice chat isn't someone raging or trash talking. Sometimes it's someone trusting strangers on the internet with their actual life because they have nowhere else to turn.

Now they are mad for assuming I'm inviting them to our trip. For 6 years, our friend group had this tradition, New Year trips together. I was always the one who planned everything on the deals, booked the hotels, handled visas, researched activities, created detailed itineraries. This year was supposed to be Greece, Two weeks in Santorini and Mykonos. I'd already spent months planning, found this perfect villa that sleeps eight with an infinity pool overlooking the caldera, negotiated group rates with airlines, mapped out ferry schedules between islands, booked dinner reservations at exclusive of restaurants. I even Learned basic Greek phrases and researched hidden local gems that tourists never find. Everything was perfectly set until Amy, my ex's new girlfriend, decided she was uncomfortable with me coming. Apparently being the only single person made her insecure about her boyfriend. She complained to him that it would be weird having his ex there while everyone else was coupled up, creating awkward dynamics. What hurt wasn't just Amy making demands, it was my so called best friends immediately agreeing I should skip the trip to avoid drama. These people I'd known since high school, who I'd planned countless amazing trips for over the years chose her over me without hesitation, no discussion, no trying to work it out, no consideration for our friendship. It's just easier this way, my former best friend said casually. You understand, right? Less complicated. I didn't Understand. But I backed out anyway, stopped planning, stopped talking to them, watched from afar as they acted like nothing happened, like I was easily replaceable. Two weeks later, my ex balls panicking. Turns out none of them knew how to book international flights, find accommodations that weren't completely booked or handle the complex logistics I'd always seamlessly managed. Their easy trip was falling apart fast. The villa you found is gone, he said desperately. Everything decent is either full or cost three times what we budgeted. The flights you had on hold expired.

So I packed her bags. Now she's single, like her divorced friends wanted. Emily and I had been married for three years. We met in college, got married at 24 and 26. Had the whole plan mapped out, save for a house, start a family by 30. Emily used to roll her eyes at her single friends, dating horror stories. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with that mess, she say. Curled up next to me, wedding ring catching the light. Our life was stable. Date nights at chain restaurants, Netflix series together, weekend trips. Emily loved how stable our life was compared to the chaos her friends lived in. We were boring and we were happy. Then Sarah got divorced. Sarah was Emily's college roommate who thrived on drama. Her marriage had been a disaster. Constant fighting, cheating, money problems. When it ended, Emily started inviting her over for girls nights. Sarah brought other friends. Lisa, fresh off her own messy divorce. Michelle, who cycled through boyfriends like seasonal wardrobes. Suddenly, our quiet Friday nights became girls nights. And Emily was coming home later with stories about their adventures. Sarah went on three dates this week. Emily told me one Saturday morning. She says she's finally figuring out who she is. Don't you ever wonder what it would be like with other people? The question hit me like cold water. Emily, I'm married. To you, I don't wonder about other people. But how do you know if you never tried anything else? Sarah says we got together too young. Over the next weeks, Emily's personality started changing. New clothes, shorter skirts, going out twice a week, sometimes three times. She'd come home with stories about men who hit on them. Michelle says marriage is just a piece of paper, Emily announced one evening. She thinks we're too young to be so settled. Marriage is a commitment, I said. It's not just paper. But what if we're missing out on something? I felt something cold settle in my chest. There's nothing wrong with comfortable, em

Her Instagram told a different story. Janelle had been planning this conversation for weeks. She'd already told her whole family she was pregnant and updated her social media to say, expect my little miracle with the love of my life, even though we've been broken up for six months. She'd even called my mom crying about how she might be pregnant and needed her support, which made my mom think we were secretly back together. So there I was trying to work when Janelle walked right past the front desk like she owned the place. She was wearing the red dress I bought her for her birthday last year and had styled her hair exactly like Amber's. We need to talk about our baby, Janelle said loud enough for half the office to hear while waving the ultrasound picture around. I'm 12 weeks pregnant and you're the father. You better dump that spoiled princess you're with and step up. She pulled out her phone and showed me Amber's Instagram already pulled up on the screen. I remembered that one dumb night three months ago when Amber and I had that huge fight and broke up. For a few days, Janelle had been texting me about needing to talk one last time and I was mad and drunk enough to meet her. You have two days to tell Amber yourself. If you don't, I'm telling her and showing Her every text you sent me that night complaining about her. The next day, Janelle sent me texts every hour with pictures of her medical chart and screenshots of a baby registry she'd made in both our names. Just pick out the crib you're buying, one message said, with a link to a 2,000 dollar wooden crib. She even posted an ultrasound video on her story knowing our friends would see it. Some people think they can just run away from being a dad, but karma always wins, she wrote, with prayer hands and baby emojis. The next morning, Janelle finally followed through and sent Amber a long message on Instagram with all the ultrasound photos and medical records attached. Amber called me sobbing and screaming. How could you get another girl pregnant and not tell me, you monster? Well, I tried to explain, but she hung up before I could get five words out. An hour later, I showed up at Amber's apartment to try to explain everything, but Janelle was already there when I arrived. Perfect timing, Macy said, when she opened the door and saw both of us. We were just looking at your baby mama's Instagram.

My family makes every child draw a random card on their 18th birthday that determines where they'll live for the next seven years of their life. Half the cards keep you within two miles of home and half send you at least 2,000 miles away, with Alaska being the worst draw possible. My grandfather invented this tradition after his brother stayed local and stole his business while he was fighting in Korea. He believed families either needed absolute proximity or absolute distance, as anything in between bread resentment. My older brother drew red and lived in our parents garage running a successful online business. My sister drew black and got sent to Portland where she thrived in the art scene. When my 18th birthday approached, I had everything planned with Sophia, who'd been my girlfriend for three years. She'd already gotten into Stanford for biomedical engineering, while I waited to hear back from California tech companies who wanted my coding skills. The night before my birthday, she held my hand and promised that no matter what card I drew, we'd make it work. My mother overheard us and laughed that bitter laugh she reserved for naive optimism. Your father said the same thing to his high school sweetheart before he drew his card. And I've been grateful every day since. That she couldn't handle the distance. Ceremony happened at sunrise in our living room where The deck sat on our coffee table like a loaded gun. Half the cards listed addresses within our Philadelphia suburb, and half contained cities at least 2,000 miles away. Draw your card, my grandmother commanded. My hand shook as I reached for the deck, knowing that hesitation meant automatic assignment to the farthest location available. I pulled my card and read the word that would destroy everything Alaska. The rules were non negotiable because my family had lawyers who drawn up contracts making everything legally binding, and I had 72 hours to pack and establish residency in Alaska or face a lawsuit from my own parents.

She lost her license within two months. Sell houses anymore? Couldn't afford the house she was in. The day she moved out, she stopped at our fence. You ruined my life over some stupid birds? I looked her dead in the eye. No, you ruined your life the moment you called my son retarded. The birds were just Karma's delivery system. Jake. The new neighbors love him.

My little sister was groomed and assaulted by a 41 year old man when she was 11. He left her barely breathing and with enough internal damage so she would never have a menstrual cycle to pour salt in the wound. When the day of sentencing came, the judge ruled that there was not enough evidence of intended bodily harm to give this monster more than 10 years. We were devastated. And to make matters even worse, he was let out on good behavior. 48 months later, that's when he struck again. He tracked down another girl from our town. He assaulted and killed her in her own home. This time our entire community went into uproar, collectively got him served with not only a life sentence but the death penalty too. But still, that didn't change the fact another family was destroyed. And when my little sister took her own life a few months later because of her trauma, I knew I had to start tracking these monsters down on my own. That night I created a fake IG profile of a 14 year old girl named Sophie. The amount of texts I received from grown men within just 70 two hours made me wanna throw up. I never told anyone about the account either. I simply texted these men, promised them a good time at a certain location, then I'd meet them with crowbars and Baseball bats force them to beg for their life before leaving them permanently disabled. Every time I did that to seven different men and never felt an ounce of remorse. But then I started texting a man named Grayson. He was very apprehensive about Sophie at first, saying he knew it was wrong, but it felt so right. Right around this time is when I noticed my older brother started acting strangely. He was 24 and had never been in love, but was suddenly.

So I got creative. My art teacher, Mrs. Patterson, had this absolutely bizarre rule about distracting colors. She genuinely believed that bright colors disrupted the learning environment and made students hyperactive. Only muted tones were allowed in her classroom, beiges, gray is Browns and the occasional dusty olive. This woman was seriously unhinged about it. She'd literally patrol the room during class confiscating highlighters, colored pens, even colorful erasers. She kept a plastic bin on her desk labeled Color Contraband. We were smuggling rainbow drugs. The breaking point came when my friend Jake got his neon green marker taken away while working on a poster about rainforest conservation. When he politely pointed out that actual rainforest are literally vibrant green, she deadpanned that he should use olive green instead because nature can be toned down for educational purposes. Sarah got her purple gel pen confiscated while taking notes. Marcus had his yellow highlighter snatched mid sentence. Emma's pink eraser disappeared from her pencil case. It it was getting ridiculous. The final straw was when Mrs. Patterson made this girl named Chloe throw away her rainbow bracelet because it was visually over stimulating. Chloe had made it in memory of her grandmother who'd recently passed. I watched this poor girl quietly crying as she dropped it in the trash. That's when I decided enough was enough. That weekend I went full research mode. I spent hours digging through color psychology studies, educational research papers and Neuroscience journals. Turns out Mrs. Patterson's theory was not just wrong, it was backwards. I found 23 peer reviewed studies showing that bright colors actually improve focus, memory retention and creativity in learning environments. I printed every single one, highlighted the key findings in, you guessed it, bright yellow. Monday morning, I showed up to class wearing the most aggressively beige outfit I could assemble. Tan cargo pants, khaki button down, brown cardigan, beige shoes. I look like I've been dipped in oatmeal. Even my backpack was brown. Mrs. Patterson actually smiled when she saw me.

Lavender for calming sense, lambs ear for soft textures and she could safely taste. And these beautiful wind chimes that made gentle sounds without overwhelming her. It became her safe space, where she'd spend hours just touching plants and organizing pebbles into perfect little rows. Then this ten year old from next door, Becca, started climbing our fence and absolutely destroying everything. First it was just trampled marigolds, then pulled up herbs, broken branches, scattered mulch everywhere. Maya would find the chaos and have complete meltdowns. I mean, so hard she'd hurt herself.

Couldn't possibly be doing this. Baby neighborhood cats. I showed her the tiny footprints in our flower beds. She got defensive, saying, kids will be kids. Maybe Maya was too sensitive. The destruction escalated. Broken solar lights, uprooted seedlings Maya had been nurturing for weeks. Even our special textured stones thrown around randomly. One morning, we found a weird Girl spray painted in wobbly letters on our garden shed. Maya saw it first and just crumpled. Third conversation with Linda turned into a shouting match. She accused me of targeting her daughter.

While helping her pack that week, I'd found something interesting in her closet, a folder labeled legal documents that I'd helpfully offered to pack safely. But first I made copies. The custody agreement was fascinating reading, especially the part about cohabitation with romantic partners affecting child support. Payments. Even more interesting were printed text messages between them from a month ago, discussing getting back together while keeping me around for financial stability. Just move back in, Jessica had texted. We'll figure out the Greg situation later. He's too useful right now. What a sucker, Nate had replied. Moving day arrived and I rented a U Haul with my own money because I'm supportive. I loaded everything while Nate supervised from his doorway, smirking like he'd won something. Thanks for understanding, bro, he said. Takes a real man to put a child's needs first. Absolutely. Children should always come first, I agreed, emphasizing the word children. He didn't catch it. After unloading everything, Jessica walked me to my truck. I'll call you tomorrow. We can plan our first date night. Looking forward to it, I smiled. But I had one more stop, their mailbox. I left copies of everything with a sticky note. Nate thought you should see what Jessica's been.

I was making Mac and cheese for my siblings when my dad grabbed the pot and dumped it in the trash. Stop making them dependent, he screamed. From now on, you cook for yourself only, period. I stared at him in shock and rubbed my hand where it was splashed with a hot pasta water. My mom nodded along with him. Your siblings are too dependent on you. It's like you're their parent and not us. Stop undermining us and let us raise our own children. I've been cooking dinner for my siblings Philip and Amber since I was 12. Every time my parents left for date night or decided parenting was optional. But now I was undermining them. I kept my mouth shut and cleaned up a mess in silence. My parents were so confident that they'd finally taught me a lesson about boundaries. But I knew exactly what was about to happen. Next morning, I was making breakfast when Amber and Philip came down. What's for breakfast, Philip asked, grabbing plates. I can't make you anything, I said. Mom and dad forbid it. They say I'm undermining their parenting. Amber looked confused. What? But you always make us breakfast? Not anymore, ask mom. So they ran to find mom. 20 minutes later, the smoke alarm was screaming. Turns out mom had tried to make scrambled eggs without using any butter. The eggs had welded to the Pan like black cement. Since that didn't work, she attempted to make chicken nuggets, but she didn't know how to operate the oven and ended up turning it to max. Nuggets burst into flames, actual flames. The fire department had to put out the fire. Ma'am, what exactly were you doing? The firefighter asked, staring at the charcoal making chicken nuggets. He reluctantly admitted the humiliation on her face was a sight to behold. Next, it was Dad's turn. He wanted to make spaghetti but thought all you have to do is put pasta in water and wait. He didn't even know that the water needed to be boiling. The dry noodles fused to each other, forming a solid pasta brick. Dad actually got a hammer to break it apart while mom tried helping with sauce. But she just squeezed an.

While I was fixing his house for free, my wealthy father in law Frank, created a rule that destroyed him. I was on my knees fixing his rental property bathroom when he started lecturing me out of nowhere. Family shouldn't expect handouts, he announced. I stopped hiling and looked up confused. What do you mean? People always want something for nothing these days, even family. He stared directly at me while saying it. I've been doing his repairs every weekend for three months. You're no better, he continued. Yesterday you asked to borrow my tile saw. That's the problem. Always expecting help. I had needed it for two hours to help my disabled mother fix her bathroom. A real man buys his own tools. my wife Grace had just walked in to bring us lunch when she heard this. Her face went pale. Dad, he helps you every weekend for free. I never asked him to. Frank crossed his arms smugly. From now on, no more handouts between us. Everyone takes care of themselves. I put down my tools and stood up slowly. Okay, no more handouts. Frank smiled like he'd won something. He owned four rental properties worth 2 million total. That night, Grace asked me, are you thinking what I'm thinking? I nodded. Frank was about to learn what his rule really cost. Frank called needing help with his rental. Come fix the plumbing Saturday, he ordered. No You banned handouts. This isn't a handout. Free labor is literally a handout. He hung up, furious. The plumber he hired charged him $800. Then Frank discovered his mistake got worse. The plumber found code violations. I've been gradually fixing without telling him. Every weekend I've been updating things to keep inspectors happy. Now Frank got fined $2,000 by the city. He called screaming, you knew about the code issues? Yes, I was slowly fixing them. Why didn't you tell me? That would be giving you information. Grace heard everything and nodded approvingly.

I was standing in my kitchen arguing with my 14 year old son Connor about school again when the knock came. Three weeks of detention, two suspensions and a final warning from the principal meant this was his last chance. One more absence and he'd be expelled from the only decent school in our district. We've been fighting about his attendance for months. His dad had left six months ago and Connor had started skipping to hang out at the skate park saying school was pointless anyway. I'd taken time off work for parent teacher conferences, lost my promotion because I kept leaving early to pick him up from the principal's office. I begged, threatened, bribed, even installed a tracking app on his phone when he tried to fake sick again. And I told him I'd physically drag him to that bus if I had to. We were mid screaming match when someone knocked on our door. The man at the door wore a bus driver's uniform but something felt wrong immediately. He was too young, maybe be 25 with Christine white sneakers and no name tag. Is Connor ready? Bus is running early today, he said. But his smile was too wide, too eager. I'd seen our regular driver, Mister Pat scout every morning for three years. 60 something, always grumpy, never early. Where's Mister Pascal, I asked. Sick day, he said quickly glancing behind him at a bus I could barely see through the morning fog. We should get going. Don't want him to miss first period, especially with his attendance record. That stopped me cold. How did he know about his attendance? Connor was already grabbing his backpack, eager to end our fight. The man stepped forward slightly. Every maternal instinct I had was screaming. But Connor needed this one. Absence meant alternative school meant his whole future derailed. We really need to go. I have six other pickups, kids, he said six specifically. Mister Pascal's route had 12 stops. After hours, my hands were shaking. Connor was putting on his shoes and I could see the man's jaw tighten with impatience. I'll just drive him today, I said. No need. He insisted too forcefully. District policy says students must take a sign transfer.

In less than 24 hours. I should have realised something was off while my wife Raven walked down the aisle. Her family were wearing matching silver pins and kept exchanging these knowing looks. The ceremony itself felt weird, too. Raven had insisted on adding strange phrases to our vows about ascending together and fulfilling sacred obligations. My parents sat in the front row beaming at us like this was the happiest day of their lives. After the reception, Raven said she had a surprise for me. Instead of heading to our honeymoon suite, she drove us to this compound outside the city. She said her extended family wanted to throw us a private Celebration. The building looked like a converted warehouse with no windows and secure pretty cameras everywhere. Inside there were about 50 people, all wearing those same silver pins. They formed a circle around us and started chanting in a language I didn't recognize. Raven held my hand tightly and whispered, I should just go along with everything. Then this older woman stepped forward and introduced herself as the elder mother. She congratulated Raven on completing her third tier obligation. I had no idea what that meant, but everyone started applauding. The elder mother then turned to me and said I was blessed to be chosen for such an important role. What role? Raven squeezed my hand harder and gave me a look that said to stay quiet. The elder mother explained that Raven had proven her dedication by bringing a genetically suitable partner into the fold. They LED us to a smaller room where five other men were waiting. They all looked about my age and just as confused as I felt. Raven kissed my cheek and said she'd explain everything soon. Then she left me there with these strangers while she went to change into some kind of ceremonial robe. One of the guys named Cordell said he'd married Raven six months ago. Another named Abdiel said their wedding was last year. As we compared stories, the horrible truth started coming together. We don't all married Raven in different states under slightly different names. We were all her husbands, and none of us had known about the others. Before we could process this insanity, Raven returned with the elder mother and several other robed women. They explained that Raven was a sacred vessel whose destiny was to birth the next generation of leaders. But first, they needed to determine which husband would provide the strongest offspring. Basically, find out who had the best nut. This is insane, I said. I want a divorce right now. The elder mother smiled like I told a joke. She explained that leaving wasn't an option now. The marriage was binding.

My sister Raven lied about me in court when my daughter Ali was 3 years old. She told the judge she saw me drunk while Ali was crying. She said she found empty tequila bottles in my house. She even cried in court about how scared she was for Ali. It was all lies. Every single word. My ex husband paid her $50,000 to say those things. To take Ali for himself. I found out years later from a friend who saw Raven's bank records. During her divorce, Raven needed money. She had student loans and was about to lose her house. I lost Ali for seven years. Seven birthdays, seven Christmases. I only got to see her once a month, with someone watching us. By the second year, Ali was calling my ex's new wife Mommy. I wanted to die the night I lost custody. I sat in my car for six hours with pills in my hand. The only thing that stopped me was thinking Ali might need me one day. Even if she didn't know me, even if she thought I was bad, she might need her real mom. So I got help. I went to therapy. I stopped drinking completely, even though I only drank on occasions. I started over at a basic tech job because my ex had ruined my reputation. I saved every penny. I kept records of everything. Then Last year, my ex got arrested for stealing money from his company. His new wife left him. The court looked at my case again. When the judge saw proof of the bribe, he was angry. Furious for me. I got Ali back six months ago. We go to therapy together. We're fixing what Raven broke during those years. Raven got married to some guy after taking the money. She had three kids. Two weeks ago, Raven showed up at my door without calling. I hadn't seen her since that day in court. Not to apologize, not to beg. Instead, she came to inform me of my obligations. I'm moving into your guest house, she said, not asking, telling. Her husband had left her and she'd been evicted. You have that big tech job now. You can afford to fund my family. She actually said I could fund it with the money I made rebuilding my life after she destroyed

I, oh, honey, I should have told you. We're going out with Ellie tonight. My stomach dropped. You're what? Ellie has exciting news, so we're taking her out to celebrate. It's my birthday. She laughed like I was whining. Don't be dramatic. Do something next weekend. In the background, Ellie's voice. Tell him we'll save leftovers. More laughter. This wasn't neglect. This was deliberate. I could have argued, but what was the point? I swallowed the lump and said, have fun, then hung up. I called my girlfriend, Lily want Dinner tonight. She could tell something was wrong. Of course. What happened? I told her everything. Come over. My parents will celebrate with you. Lily's parents have treated me with more kindness in three years than my own parents ever have. Her mom greeted me with a hug. Happy birthday. We're going somewhere nice. We ended up at a high end steakhouse. Dad ordered champagne to celebrate me turning 21.

After dinner, I posted on Instagram, huge thank you to my girlfriend and her amazing family for making my birthday special. So grateful to have people who actually care about me.

When I proposed, my girlfriend Charlotte slumped to the floor and started crying, screaming yes over and over while jumping into my arms and running in circles. But then she saw the ring up close as I was putting it on her, and her face turned sour. She still let me put it on her finger, but her hand was shaking and she kept staring at it like she couldn't believe what she was seeing. On the drive home, she kept her ring hand covered in her lap instead of admiring the ring like I'd expected. When I asked if she liked it, she said, I just can't believe you picked this in this weird, hollow voice. I thought maybe she was just overwhelmed by the proposal, but when we got home, she immediately took the ring off and put it in the box, saying she didn't want to damage it. We almost had a fight over it when she almost forgot to put it back on. The next morning, we went to brunch with our parents, and that's when her mom saw it. She literally gasped. Dad didn't even seem happy or say congratulations. Just asked if I was trying to make some kind of statement. When I said, no, I just thought it was beautiful, he exchanged this look with his wife like they were communicating telepathically. Charlotte's mom pulled her aside, and I heard her whisper, you don't Have to go through with this. Which made no sense because they'd always loved me. Charlotte posted our engagement announcement on social media but cropped out the photo of the ring, saying the lighting wasn't good. Her friends asked to see it. In the comments, she kept making excuses about waiting to get professional photos taken. Her best friend Mia came over that night, and when Charlotte showed her the ring, Mia just said, oh my god, he actually did that? And left without even congratulating us. I posted in three different wedding forums asking for advice about why everyone was acting strange about the ring and included detailed photos from every angle. Every single post got deleted within minutes, and I was banned from two forums for obvious rage bait and trolling the community with offensive content. One moderator messaged me saying if the photos were real, I should be ashamed of myself. At work, I mentioned getting engaged and my coworker asked to see the ring photo on my phone. She looked at it for about two seconds before handing my phone back like it was contaminated and saying, that's certainly a choice. By lunch, everyone in the office was whispering, and my manager pulled me aside to say that while my personal life.

She was in California for work. Mom, dad won't let Halsey take shelter. There's a tornado! I'm calling my lawyer right now. A lawyer? Mom, she needs help now! I can't do anything from here. I'll call the police. I already did. My phone rang. Mister Arthur, this is William Hendricks, your father's attorney. How did you. Your father wanted me to inform you that every call tonight is being recorded for the emergency custody hearing Monday. What hearing? To prove your mother's family causes hysteria during his parenting time. Halsey acting out tonight is perfect evidence there's a tornado. Which your father has confirmed is merely a weather watch. Your overreaction is being documented. He hung up. I called Dad's neighbor. Mister Squelch, please, you have to help. Halsey's locked in her room. I'm not getting involved in Dan's family business again. Last time I tried to help you kids, he threatened to sue me. I called dad again. This time he answered. What? There's a tornado coming! Get Halsey to the basement. Arthur, I'm not falling for another one of your

I was 15 and dramatically running away from home over being grounded when I met Amanda on the last car of the southbound train. My grand escape fund consisted of $32 and a granola bar, so my rebellion was destined to last about as long as the train line. Amanda sat down next to me while I was scribbling my life plan on a Dunkin Donuts napkin. Running away or writing the world's saddest grocery list? She asked, reading my terrible handwriting upside down. We talked for exactly 47 minutes until my stop. As we reached the platform, where we part ways forever. This was 2009, before everyone exchanged Instagram handles, Amanda grabbed my wrist. Give me homework, she said. Something you think I should do before I die? I'll do the same for you. I panicked and blurted out, sing acapella to complete strangers. She nodded like I'd just given her profound wisdom instead of anxiety fuel, then handed me her own assignment. Read Ulysses by James Joyce, cover to cover. I'd never heard of it. Turned out to be 780 pages of stream of consciousness nightmare, with the last 50 pages containing zero punctuation. Not a single period, just one massive run on sentence that made me question if Joyce had a personal vendetta against readers. But here's the thing. I've opened that book over 300 times in 14 years, never finished it. Got to page 750. Last week and stopped again. Every time I pick it up, I think of Amanda and that random Tuesday when a stranger on a train gave me homework I still haven't completed. The challenge worked exactly as she probably intended. I couldn't forget her, so I started doing the same thing. Every meaningful encounter ends with me asking for an assignment. My Ulysses bucket list now has 43 challenges from 43 strangers who impacted my life. The Indian businessman I met at O'hare told

Now they want me to save them from homelessness. So I let them lose everything. The first punch came from my dad. No warning. Just a clean right hook across the jaw. The second I stepped through the door, get your things and get out! Said standing over me. His voice didn't even sound human. I tasted blood, blinked at the living room crammed with family. My mother sobbing, grandparents stiff, uncles glaring. My kid sister, Lily was curled into my grandmother's shoulder, crocodile tears soaking her blouse. He's been sneaking into my room for years, he whispered, loud enough for the whole room. He said no one would believe me. Every face turned on me. What? My voice cracked. That's insane. I've never. She's a child! My mother hissed. How could you? I reached for her. She recoiled like I was contagious. Uncle Mike lunged, fingers digging into my shirt. You're going to rot in prison! I could have thrown him off, but shock froze me. The accusations stacked higher. Lily inventing memories, everyone nodding along. When I tried to fight back, the volume only made me sound guilty. And then dad threw me out. Clothes in trash bags, baseball gear flung onto the lawn, my truck, my apartment, my tuition. All cut off in a single night. No one answered my calls. Not cousins, not grandparents, not the friends I grew up with. The only reply, Came from dad. Contact us again and I'll file a restraining order. I thought about the bridge more than once, but I didn't jump. Years blurred. Couch surfing, then sleeping in my car. Broken ribs after a parking lot beating when some drunk guys decided I looked like a predator. A hospital Bill bigger than my future. I Learned to keep my head down, take security jobs where no one asked questions. And then somehow, I clawed back. Grizzled Marine vet named Frank pulled me off that bridge one night and gave me work, a room, a reason not to disappear. I rebuilt muscle discipline and eventually my life.

I was making Mac and cheese for my siblings when my dad grabbed the pot and dumped it in the trash. Stop making them dependent! He screamed. From now on, you cook for yourself only, period! I stared at him in shock and rubbed my hand where it was splashed with a hot pasta water. My mom nodded along with him. Your siblings are too dependent on you. It's like you're their parent and not us. Stop undermining us and let us raise our own children. I've been cooking dinner for my siblings, Philip and Amber, since I was 12, every time my parents left for date night or decided parenting was optional. But now I was undermining them. I kept my mouth shut and cleaned up a mess in silence. My parents were so confident that they'd finally taught me a lesson about boundaries. But I knew exactly what was about to happen. Next morning, I was making breakfast when Amber and Philip came down. What's for breakfast? Philip asked, grabbing plates. I can't make you anything, I said. Mom and dad forbid it. They say I'm undermining their parenting. Amber looked confused. What? But you always make us breakfast. Not anymore. Ask mom. So they ran to find mom. 20 minutes later, the smoke alarm was screaming. Turns out mom had tried to make scrambled eggs without using any butter. The eggs had welded to the Pan like black cement. Since that didn't work, she attempted to make chicken nuggets. But she didn't know how to operate the oven and ended up turning it to Max. Nuggets burst into flames. Actual flames. The fire department had to put out the fire. Ma'am, what exactly were you doing? The firefighter asked, staring at the charcoal. Making chicken nuggets, he reluctantly admitted. The humiliation on her face was a sight to behold. Next, it was Dad's turn. He wanted to make spaghetti, but thought all you have to do is put pasta in water and wait. He didn't even know that the water needed to be boiling. The dry noodles fused to each other, forming a solid pasta brick. Dad actually got a hammer to break it apart, while mom tried helping with sauce. But she just squeezed an

I was sitting in the living room eating chocolates I found when my mom yelled, are you eating those chocolates? Yeah, I said, looking up from the couch where I've been watching cartoons, my fingers still covered in melted chocolate. Mom's face went from confused to absolutely horrified in about half a second. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. She was actually shaking, staring at the half empty box of fancy chocolates on the coffee table. How many did you eat? How many? Like 5 or six. You had a whole box of them. But she wasn't listening anymore. She was already screaming for dad. Get in here now. Dad came running from his office so fast he slipped on the hallway rug. And when he saw me with chocolate on my face and mom pointing at the box with a trembling hand, his eyes went wide. No, Tell me he didn't. He ate them. He ate at least five. Mom was practically hyperventilating now. Dad grabbed the box, read something on the bottom and actually had to sit down on the arm of the couch. I didn't mean to leave them there. I thought they were in our bedroom. I specifically hid them in our bedroom. What's wrong with the chocolate? I asked. But my voice came out all squeaky because they were scaring me so bad. Mom was pacing back and forth, muttering things. Like he's only 10 and who knows what this could do to him. Maybe it won't be that bad, dad said, but he didn't sound like he believed it. Maybe at his age, his body won't. Are you kidding me right now? Mom screamed so loud that my sister came running downstairs. She took one look at the scene. Me covered in chocolate. Mom crying, dad looking like he might throw up. And the fancy box on the table. And her jaw literally dropped open. Mom, you bought these? She. I picked up the box, read the label and started laughing. But it wasn't a happy laugh. It was the kind of laugh people do when they can't believe something terrible is happening from that store. Oh, my God, mom. Mom snatched the box away from her. We're going to the hospital right now. And that's when I started crying because hospital meant dying. Am I gonna be okay? I sobbed. But mom just kept saying, you'll be fine, baby. You'll be fine.

Mom lost four babies before having me and my brother, Lily, Rose, Jasper and Violet. She kept shrines in our house, four nurseries frozen in time with cribs, clothes and toys for babies who never came home. Every year, she'd throw birthday parties for them, making us sing to empty high chairs. When my brother had his first child, she forced him to name her rose. It's finally here, mom sobbed, clutching my Newborn niece. That's when I realised this wasn't grief anymore. It was insanity. When I got pregnant last year, mom presented me with a professionally printed book titled Violet's Return. Inside were dietary requirements to match Violet's essence, scheduled crying sessions where I'd apologise for taking so long, and personality traits I needed to nurture. She'd already ordered a gravestone reading Violet Marie, died 1995, reborn 2024. She made me visit the cemetery weekly to introduce my pregnancy to dead Violet's grave. She'd press her ear to my belly and have full conversations with Violet, telling her about the room waiting for her. When I suggested naming my daughter Blair instead, mom grabbed my stomach so hard I screamed, you want to murder her twice, she hissed. That's when I knew I had to protect my child. I secretly named my daughter Blair on all the paperwork for six months after her birth. I let mom Believe she was Violet. It was disturbing but necessary. Watching mom cou Violet Marie at my daughter, buying monogrammed clothes, telling everyone her real granddaughter had returned. I documented everything. Recordings of mom calling Blair by the wrong name, photos of the trying she built, videos of her telling Blair about her first life. Meanwhile, Blair was thriving as herself at daycare with friends, living a normal life mom knew nothing about. I thought I could manage this delusion forever. Then one afternoon a few months ago, mom found Blair's real birth certificate during a visit. I'll never forget her face. It was pure twisted rage. You killed her again, she screamed, throwing the certificate at me. She called my.

We were all at Grandma's birthday party, and I noticed how Aunt Penn was giving mom special compliments all night. Rosie, that dress almost hides your weight gain. Almost, she would say, before smiling sweetly. Then she touched Mom's face. You're so brave wearing makeup at your age. Most women would just give up. Mom's eyes got watery, which meant she was really touched. Aunt Penn even complimented my dad, saying, you're such a saint for sticking around with her. Most men would have found someone younger by now. Mom's hands were shaking when she cut the cake, probably from happiness. On the drive home, mom was really quiet, and when dad asked if she was okay, she said something about passive aggressiveness, which I didn't understand, but I figured it must be another way adults say I love you. I decided that if Aunt Penn loved mom so much that she gave her all those special compliments, I should do the same thing for Aunt Penn, because I love her, too. The next Sunday at church, I saw my chance. When Aunt Penn walked up wearing a pretty, flowery dress, I remembered exactly how she talked to mom and said to her, wow, Aunt Penn, you look pregnant in that dress. When's the baby coming? Her face went completely white, then red, then kind of purple. And he just stood there with her. Mouth open like a goldfish. Mom, who was talking to Missus Abernathy, turned around so fast she almost spilled her coffee. And then she started coughing really hard, but it sounded more like laughing for some reason. Penn finally said, thank you, sweetie, in this tiny voice, and mom had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom because she was coughing laughing so much. Dad asked me what I said, and when I told him I was just being nice like Aunt Penn, he got this funny look and patted my head. Keep doing that, buddy. Okay, dad.

When they implemented it, the principal got on the intercom and told us students could only use the bathroom three times a week. And I remember feeling my heart sink because I drank a ton of water every day. This new policy starts immediately to reduce hallway disruptions, he said. They gave us these yellow paper passes with our names on them. And once you used your 3, that was it until Monday rolled around again. By lunch, I'd already used one of my passes and felt stupid about it. My friend had burned through two of his because he always carried this giant water bottle around. What happens when we run out? He asked me, and I could see he was starting to panic. The teachers kept telling us to use the bathroom between classes, but we only had four minutes and the lines were crazy long. That's when Olivia finally said something she usually kept to herself and never made waves. I'm going to fix this, she said, and her voice was dead serious. We all laughed because what could one quiet kid do against the prince? Turns out she had a plan that would destroy the whole stupid system. I was holding onto my last pass like it was made of gold during history class. Olivia turned around and I could see she was getting desperate. I'm finished with mine, she whispered to me. 20 minutes later, she raised her Hand and asked Mister Brooks if she could use the bathroom. He looked at his list and shook his head. None left for you this week. Her voice got shaky when she said she really needed to go. Policy is policy, he said, and went back to writing on the board like she didn't exist. That's when Olivia grabbed her water bottle and knocked it over, sending water everywhere, across her desk and chair and all over her pants. Oh, no, she said really loud. I'm so clumsy. Mister Brooks turned around and his face went totally white when he saw her soaked clothes and he basically threw a nurse pass at her. She caught my eye as she left and I understood exactly what she wanted me to do. The next day, everyone knew about Olivia's trick. During second period, this kid stood up and announced he'd used all three passes already. The teacher told him, tough luck. He picked up his thermos and poured the whole thing down his front. Oops, he said with a totally straight face. By lunchtime, seven different kids had pulled the same stunt and the nurse was calling parents left and right because she'd run out of extra clothes. Our principal.

I'm not helping with Breckie's wedding. Not after yesterday. Dad's face. Dark. Don't be petty. You know how Breck he is. He stormed out. Hope you're not holding the family hostage. More calls. Mom's guilt trip. If you don't help, we'll use your son's college savings. Savings I didn't know existed. Now leverage. Days of messages calling me to be the bigger person. Becky posted about toxic people ruining my life. My son kept asking about his real birthday cake. We went to a bakery, got the biggest chocolate cake, celebrated in our kitchen.

But I was already dating her best friend. My wife Jennifer told me one night in the kitchen, I think we should try an open marriage. She said, it's so calm, like she was asking me to switch brands of laundry soap. We had been married three years. I worked construction every day, sun up to sun down. She worked in marketing, sitting in endless meetings about vibes and hashtags. We weren't rich, but we had a roof, food on the table, weekends together. I thought we were fine. So when she said it, I laughed. At first, I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. She kept going, repeating lines that sounded like she copied them off some Instagram post. It's about growth. It's about freedom. It's about not being trapped. That's when I knew she already had someone lined up. I didn't argue. I didn't throw a fit. I just slid a plate of eggs across the counter and said, sure, whatever makes you happy. Her eyes lit up like Christmas morning. She thought she'd won. The next week, she was out late almost every night. Coffee with friends, new perfume, new dresses, nails always done. I thought I didn't notice, but I did. And I didn't stop her. I wanted to see just how far she'd go. My sister Nora finally gave me the truth. Jennifer wasn't experimenting She was already with someone. A C E O, some slick tech guy. I with expensive cars, tailored suits, glasses that probably cost more than my month's rent. Jennifer had even bragged to her friends, if I play this right, I'll never have to worry about money again. She was grinning in pictures, showing off champagne glasses and rooftop dinners, acting like she had finally leveled up in life. That's all I needed to hear. So I played the long game. I stayed quiet, worked my shifts, came home, ate dinner, let her keep lying straight to my face. And while she was running off with Mister C E O, I started.

Learn to take a joke. Whenever she insulted me publicly. So I started joking back about her cooking, her driving, her career. When she got upset, I said, too sensitive. Learn to take a joke. Natalie and I had been together for two years. She worked in fashion marketing and had this brutally honest persona that her friends loved. Problem was, her honesty only went one direction. Toward me. It started at party. This is my boyfriend, Alex. He's an accounting. I know. Thrilling, right? At least he's consistent. Consistent? Instantly boring. Everyone would laugh while I forced to smile. When I told her it bothered me, she'd roll her eyes. You're so sensitive. It's just a joke. Learn to laugh at yourself. At her friend's engagement party, she announced to 60 people Alex wanted to wear his blue shirt. But I told him it makes him look like a Best Buy employee. He still wore it. Can you believe it? Now everyone's going to ask him where the electronic section. The breaking point came at my company dinner with my boss and team present. She told everyone Alex practiced his presentation for three days. Three days for a five minute quarterly report? I told him nobody cares about spreadsheet that much. But he insisted on being prepared. He even made note cards. That night, I made a decision. If jokes at your partner's expense were just having fun, then let's have some fun. I started small. The next morning, she made scrambled eggs that were basically a rubber. Wow, babe, these eggs are interesting. Did you use them to practice your tennis serve first? They're so bouncy, I could probably use them as stress balls. She froze. That's mean. It's just a joke, Nat. Don't be so sensitive. When her friends came over for wine night and she was telling them about her new campaign, I interjected. Oh, yeah, Nat's Instagram campaign. The one where she spent three weeks choosing between two identical shades of beige? Revolutionary stuff. Really pushing boundaries in the beige community. Her face went red. Alex, that's my job you're talking about. And accounting is mine, but that's never stopped you. Come on, babe. Learn to laugh at yourself. At dinner with

When we got home, the cake read, Congrats, Joseph, my brother's son. Dad laughed. We just combined the parties to save money. I packed everything up, called the vendors and canceled every future plan. By evening, I had six, 7 missed calls. I work construction and wanted to give Addison something magical for her eighth birthday. Carnival games, bouncy castle, cotton candy, everything she dreamed about for months. She wore her sparkly pajamas and plastic tiara, dancing around the decorations the vendors had just finished setting up. When guests started arriving, Addison was beaming, running from the cotton candy machine to the bounce house, dragging her cousins behind her for two hours. It felt perfect. When I brought out the cake, expensive two tier vanilla with raspberry filling, my stomach dropped. Congrats, Joseph in big blue letters. My brother's kid was turning 5 next week. Combined the parties, mom said, casually carrying paper plates saves money and time. Win, win. Dad strolled in laughing. Don't make that face, son. It's practical. My brother appeared with his phone out recording for Instagram. Great setup, man. We told Joseph he'd get a joint party this year. I watched Addison stare at the cake, her smile fading. Daddy, why does it say Joseph? That's not me. She took off her tiara and handed it to me like she was giving up something important. During the song, she wouldn't blow out her candles. Packed up the cake and decorations in front of everyone, making it clear I wasn't going to let this happen. By evening, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. 6, 7 missed calls. The family group chat exploded. You embarrassed your brother. Grow up. Stop being dramatic. My brother's girlfriend even chimed in. Kids don't care about names on cakes. Teaching her to be entitled. Dad sent a voice message. If you can't be part of this family without causing problems, maybe you should sit the next few events out. I screenshot everything, every dismissive text, every guilt trip, every message that treated my daughter like a burden. I went quiet for a month. No visits, no calls, no family events. They called it punishment. I called it peace. The pressure campaign started immediately. Mom showed up with muffins acting like nothing happened yesterday.

The mashed potatoes were still steaming when she said it. You've always acted like you're doing us some huge favor, Aaron. You're not. You're just a burden. Always have been. Fork covered midair. Danielle, my brother Luke's girlfriend, froze with her wine glass halfway to her lips. Dad cleared his throat like he might speak but didn't. And Luke, golden boy Luke, he laughed, not nervous, not awkward, confident. At least I make this family proud. Something inside me went cold. Didn't throw my plate, didn't shout. I set my fork down, pushed my chair back and stood. Silence heavier than anger. The clatter of silverware on China echoed too loud in my ears. Then I walked out without a word. The drive home was quiet. No music, no calls answered, just Luke's smug voice looping in my head. At least I make this family proud. What none of them knew or maybe didn't care was that for five years I'd been there, invisible safety net, mortgage, utilities, medical bills. I kept everything afloat, was the hand holding up the walls. And in return, I was a burden. That night, something snapped. I opened my banking app, shut off auto pay for their house, deleted every Reminder I'd set. I wasn't their safety net anymore. The relief was immediate, like the first deep breath after holding it underwater too long. Three weeks later, Dad's name lit up my phone. He never called. Hey, dad, why is the mortgage unpaid? His voice clipped tight. I leaned back in my chair, staring at the ceiling, almost smiling. Ask your pride and joy. Click, end of call. Mom's text followed. We need you to sort this out before it affects our credit. Don't be childish. Childish. Not thank you, not sorry, just another demand I left her on. Read through my cousin Rachel. I Learned the truth. Mom was spinning a story. I'd had a breakdown. I was unstable, lashing out. They couldn't admit the truth. They relied on me too long and I finally stopped. So they recast me as the villain. Christmas came, no invite, just a photo online. Luke in a suit, Danielle with wine. I'm by the tree I bought years ago. Caption, grateful for family. Some people may leave, but the ones who matter always stick together. I stared at it until the screen dimmed hollow. January, Rachel called again. Luke quit his job or got pushed out, something shady with expenses. I almost laughed. The golden boy's shine was cracking. Two days later, a voicemail from him. Hey, man, got a business idea. Need startup capital. Thought maybe you'd want to invest. Win, win. Not an apology, a pitch.

Ashley and I had been together three and a half years, engaged for six months. Her father, Robert, owned a chain of auto repair shops and was paying for our entire 65 thousand dollar wedding, which was just three days away. Ashley lived for drama and attention, constantly flirting with other guys while I was right there, then acting shocked when I called her out. The red flags were everywhere. But I thought putting a ring on it would fix her need for constant validation. My sister Sloan warned me at our engagement party, you're making the biggest mistake of your life. But I'll be here to help pick up the pieces when this train wreck derails. The night before our wedding, Ashley told me she was going to a spa retreat with her bridesmaids. Just massages, facials, some meditation before the big day, she said, kissing me goodbye, all sweet and innocent. I was working late fixing a crashed server when my phone buzzed. It was Isla, one of Ashley's former friends who'd been cut out over some drama. Hey, you need to see this. I'm really sorry. Then the screenshots started flooding in. Ashley had posted everything to her Instagram close friend story, thinking she was clever keeping me off that list. Screenshot 1. Ashley at some upscale club. Definitely not a spa.

She's been bragging all night about how you have no idea where she really is. Said you'd lose your mind if you knew. So she made up the spa story. This woman had looked me in the eye, lied about where she was going, and was now broadcasting her cheating to her friends while mocking me behind my back. I stared at my phone for exactly 30 seconds. Not anger, not heartbreak.

HR found out about the fake degree. I stared at my phone screen in complete confusion. What fake degree? I had my bachelor's in marketing from state university hanging right there on my office wall. I graduated three years ago with a solid 3.4 G P A. And student loans that still haunted my dreams every month. My boss, Derek had always been a bit paranoid, but this text felt different. More urgent, more terrified. I called him back immediately, but his phone went straight to voicemail. That was weird. Derek lived on his phone like it was a life support system. Twenty minutes later, another text arrived. They're asking questions about everyone's credentials. Mine won't hold up under scrutiny. This is bad. Wait, what? Derek's credentials? I'd always assumed he had some fancy MBA from an expensive school, considering how he threw around business buzzwords like synergy and paradigm shifts in every meeting, but now that I thought about it, I never actually seen any diplomas in his office. I decided to do some light internet stalking to figure out what was going on. I pulled up Derek's LinkedIn profile, which claimed he had an MBA from Wharton Business School and a bachelor's from Harvard. Impressive credentials for someone who regularly confused quarterly with quarterly. Final once asked me if Excel could do math automatically, but when I searched for Derek Hoffman on Wharton's alumni directory, nothing came up. Same With Harvard? That was strange, but maybe their databases weren't complete. Then I remembered something weird from last week. Derek had been acting jumpy every time anyone from corporate visited our office. He disappeared to the bathroom for long periods and come back sweating like he just run a Marathon. When our regional manager asked about his background during a team meeting, Derek had changed the subject so fast, it gave me whiplash. My phone buzzed again. Pack light. Road trip starts tonight. Don't tell anyone where you're going. Okay, now I was officially concerned. Derek wasn't just worried about getting fired. He sounded like he was planning to flee the country. I called our HR manager, Patricia, to see if I could figure out what was actually happening. Oh.

I was already running late for Lily's parent teacher conference, wrestling my 7 year old into her jacket while she protested about missing her cartoon. My husband Trevor was supposed to drive us, but his car wouldn't start and he was still underneath it cursing at the engine. When the Honda pulled up, I barely glanced at the driver as we piled into the back seat. Jefferson Elementary, please. We're running super late. That's when he turned around and my entire world tilted sideways. Those green eyes, that crooked smile, the scar through his left eyebrow from a skateboarding accident in college.

We need to go, I said sharply. The conference starts in 10 minutes. He nodded slowly, turning back to face forward. As he pulled away from the curb, I saw his hands gripping the steering wheel so tight, his knuckles went white. The silence lasted exactly three blocks before Lily started chattering.

I woke up and asked my wife Annette if she wanted coffee and she started laughing so hard she nearly fell out of bed. I realized I was talking like I'd lived in London my entire life. I tried to say something else in my normal voice, but it came out sounding like Benedict Cumberbatch had possessed my body. Annette thought I was doing a bit and told me to knock it off. But I genuinely couldn't make my regular American accent come out naturally. I could force it if I really concentrated, but it sounded exactly like a British person doing a terrible American impression. Annette had to call my work and tell them I had laryngitis because I couldn't face explaining this to anyone. My doctor said it was probably foreign accent syndrome, which can happen after strokes or head trauma. He ordered an emergency MRI, thinking I'd had a mini stroke in my sleep. But the scan came back completely normal with no signs of any stroke or bleeding or tumors. Annet started getting frustrated when I had to call into work for the third day claiming I was sick. The neurologist suggested it might be psychogenic and sent me to a psychiatrist who specialized in conversion disorders. When the anti anxiety medication didn't work after six weeks, Annette accused me of not taking it properly because she thought I was enjoying the attention. My friend Greg thought I'd been hypnotized at the comedy show we'd gone to the week before. We called the venue, but they said the hypnotist never did anything with accents. Annette moved into the guest room, saying she couldn't sleep next to someone who was committed to a lie. The speech pathologist wondered if I'd had childhood exposure to British English that was somehow resurfacing. My mom confirmed I'd never had a British nanny or teacher and we'd never lived abroad. She dug out old home videos from when I was 3 and I had a perfect Midwestern American accent. Mom stopped inviting me to family dinners because she said my fake accent upset everyone. A coworker suggested carbon monoxide poisoning since that can cause neurological symptoms. We had the fire department check our house, but the levels were completely normal. The inspector said he'd never heard of carbon monoxide causing accent changes anyway. My biggest client threatened to pull their 2 million dollar contract because they'd specifically requested American representatives. I tried speech therapy, but the therapist said something strange was happening. I wasn't just speaking with a British accent, but using British grammar patterns and vocabulary I shouldn't even know I was saying whilst instead of while and spelling colour with a U without thinking. When she couldn't help me, Annette said it proved I was doing it on purpose. Then I remembered I had had dental work done right before this started and thought maybe the anesthetic had caused nerve damage. The dentist said he'd only used standard local anesthetic that couldn't possibly affect speech patterns. Annette found apartment listings on her laptop and didn't even try to hide them anymore. A researcher at Mayo Clinic thought it might be a rare autoimmune condition affecting the brain. They ran dozens of blood tests looking for antibodies that might attack speech centers. Every test came back negative. I got fired the day we lost the 2 million dollar account. And Annette said she couldn't be married to someone who refused to stop lying, even when it cost them everything. My sister found an article about people developing accents after severe allergic reactions. I got tested for every possible allergy but came back negative for all of them. The allergist said food allergies don't work that way. Anyway, Annette filed for separation, saying she needed to be with someone she could trust. I tried everything from acupuncture to checking for lime disease to brain parasites. One doctor even suggested multiple personality disorder with a British alter ego. But the psychological evaluation ruled that out. Every theory fell apart and I'd lost my job and my wife and still sounded like I'd grown up in southeast London. Speech pathologist who'd been studying my case called six months later saying she'd found something in old medical journals from the 1960s. She discovered three other cases exactly like mine with American patients who suddenly developed British accents with no medical cause. She tracked down one of the Doctors. I drove three hours to meet him, and he was 92 years old, but his mind was sharp. When I spoke, he grabbed my wrist and stared at me like he was seeing a ghost. He asked me to say schedule. And when I pronounced it the British way, he started shaking his head, muttering, not another one. The speech pathologist asked him what he meant, and he looked around like someone might be listening before pulling out an old notebook from his bedside drawer. He flipped through yellowed pages until he found what he was looking for and turned the notebook toward me to show me four words that he said would finally explain everything.

My daughter has been getting followed home by the same three seniors ever since she started freshman year five months ago. And the school's only response has been, boys will be boys. Well, last Monday, I was eating lunch at work when I got a series of frantic texts from Lila. They're in the girls bathroom. They're trying to climb into my stall. Please help! Dad, I'm so scared. I knocked my chair over getting up. Phone already died. Telling the school as I sprinted through the parking lot. Secretary's desk. How can. My daughter is in the bathroom. Three seniors are climbing into her stall. The secretary paused. Which bathroom? I put the key in and started speed immediately. Third floor, I think. I don't know. Just find her. The secretary wasn't speaking. Her name is Lila Clarks. They're attacking her right now, sir, she started. Unfortunately, the rules state I cannot leave my secretary desk unattended, and the principal is unavailable on her lunch break right now. I practically screamed this next part into my phone. Are you stupid? What are you talking about? Go to the bathroom now! Sir, she said at like she was talking to a child. Please refrain from using vulgar language. They're climbing into my daughter's stall. I'll make a note for when the principal returns. I hung up, realizing I was dealing with a human robot. Lila hadn't texted in four minutes. Now Eight minutes later, I abandoned my car sideways in the bus lane and sprinted through the front doors of the school. The secretary looked up from her computer, mouth opening to speak about sign in procedures, but I was already past her. I ran to that bathroom faster than I'd ever ran in my life. But when I got to it and went to open it, my worst nightmare came true. It was locked from the inside. The boys must have gotten the keys to deliberately do this. I pressed my ear against the door and I could hear them in there with her. Lila was crying. Her clothing was getting ripped. And suddenly her crying turned into muffled screaming, like someone covered her mouth. I through my shoulder against the door. But these were the new doors they'd installed after the shooting four years ago. Reinforced steel frames. The door didn't even shake. Lila, I'm here! I grabbed a chair from the hallway and swung at full force. The chair shattered into pieces, while the door stayed perfect. Fire extinguisher was heavier. I hammered it against the lock mechanism over and over, metal ringing through the hallway. But these doors were doing exactly what they were designed to do. By now, the secretary had climbed the stairs, panting and red faced. Sir! Sir! You're destroying school property! I'm calling security! Give me the key! I yelled. She visibly shook at how angry I was. I don't have bathroom keys! Sir, she said, only the principal has those, and she's. By the time she finished her sentence, I was running to her office. I finally reached it, and through the window I saw her at her desk, eating a salad while scrolling through her phone. I pounded on her door hard enough to shake the wall. She looked up slowly, held up five fingers, mouth five. Five minutes, pointed to her food, and went back to scrolling. That's when the security guard appeared behind me, hand on his radio. Sir, you need to calm down. But I didn't. I picked up another chair. The principal saw me raise it, and her eyes went wide. I swung the chair through her window. Glass exploded everywhere. She screamed, dropping her salad. I reached through, unlocked her door from inside, blood from the glass, cuts dripping on her carpet. Sir, stop! The security guard grabbed my arm, but I shoved him off and went straight for her desk, yanking open drawers until I found the key ring. You're insane! The principal shrieked. I'm calling the police! I ran back to the bathroom, keys jangling, leaving bloody handprints on the walls. But when I got there, the door was already open, the boys were gone, and my dear Lila was curled on the floor, her skirt torn, her lips bruised, her hair covered in white, sticky liquid, and her shirt unbuttoned and bra torn. I immediately pulled out my phone to call 9 1 1 kneeling beside Lila, taking off my jacket to wrap around her when the principal rushed in with the security guard. You assaulted me! The principal's voice was shrill. Jim, he could have killed me with that chair. I was talking to the dispatcher, one hand holding the phone, the other stroking Lila's cheek as she choked out blood and tears. The prince, well, kept going, pacing now gesturing wildly. You've traumatized my entire staff. She pulled out her own phone. Every student on this floor saw you acting like a maniac. That's 200 children who need counseling. The security guard was filming everything. This is going to be on the news. The principal continued, now talking to someone on her phone. Parent going psychotic, destroying property, creating an unsafe learning environment. Our insurance doesn't cover parental attacks. The superintendent is going to. Yes, hello? She suddenly interrupted herself. We have a violent intruder who threatened me with a weapon. She gave my physical description and described the premeditated assault. She never mentioned the three boys or why I did what I did. When the police arrived four minutes later, she pointed at me first. That's him. The one who attacked me.

You're pathetic, BTW. I replied, cool. Then I blocked her cards and changed the house locks. Next morning, police were at my door. It was 2:00am on a Tuesday when my phone buzzed. I picked it up and froze. There was a picture of my wife, Linda, smiling outside a cheap Vegas wedding chapel. Next to her was her coworker, William, holding a marriage certificate. The text said, just married William. Been sleeping with him for 8 months. You're pathetic, BTW. Your limp dick energy made this so easy. Enjoy your sad little life. I stared at it for a long moment. Then I typed one word, cool. She thought she destroyed me. She had no idea. Every account, every credit card, the house, everything was in my name. She had no power left. 3:00am, all her cards were cancelled, every password changed. By 5:00am, new locks were on the doors, the garage code was reset and I had screenshots of everything. A few hours later, pounding on my door woke me up. Two cops were there. Sir, your wife says you locked her out. I showed them the Vegas text. She's not my wife anymore. She married another man five hours ago. One cop raised an eyebrow. The other tried not to laugh. They told her to figure it out in court. That afternoon, Linda came back with William, her mom, Barbara, and her sister Susan. William already looked miserable. Barbara yelled about abuse. Susan called me controlling. William tried to look tough until I mentioned HR might enjoy seeing the Vegas wedding photo since their company forbids co workers dating. Their faces fell instantly. Linda cried saying I was financially abusing her. But her stuff was already boxed in the garage. I told them they had 1 hour to leave. The best part, when she tried to pay at the U Haul, her card declined. William had to pay. His face was priceless. Then my lawyer called. Linda was trying to annul the Vegas marriage, claiming she was drunk and still wanted my house. My lawyer laughed. She had already given me proof of adultery and bigamy and writing, case closed. But Linda didn't stop. She posted online that I was abusive. Her mom and sister shared it everywhere. Some friends even believed her. Then my friend David, the tech genius helped me recover old Facebook messages. There she was bragging about cheating, stealing money from our account and planning her escape. I posted the screenshots. Her story fell apart overnight. Then she went completely crazy. She had her dad call my boss accusing me of harassment. My boss told him to leave me alone. She tried breaking into my house at 3:00am screaming about her grandmother's jewelry. Her grandma was fine. She accused me of killing her cat. We never had one. She called my mom crying, begging me to take her back. My mom said you should Have thought of that before? Sleeping with him for eight months. The funniest part, William's mom called me and said I should take.

My dad came back from Iraq when I was 8 and that's when the drinking really started. He served two tours as an army mechanic, came home with a Purple Heart and a drinking problem that got worse every year. When I was 10, he promised he'd quit after missing my basketball championship because he passed out at his buddy's house. I still remember that night with mom crying in the kitchen. I swear on my life, buddy, no more drinking. Not a single drop, he said, looking me right in the eyes. For two whole months, things were awesome. Dad came home right after work from the auto shop. He taught me to fish at the lake on weekends just like he used to do before his deployments. Mom started smiling again. She even let me stay up late on Fridays to watch movies with him. I thought we had our family back. Then came my 11th birthday. Dad said he was planning something special. And I woke up super excited that morning, ran downstairs in my pajamas expecting to see him, but only mom was there, sitting at the kitchen table staring at her phone. Where's dad, I asked. She just shook her head. My birthday party was at 3:00 PM by 2:00, he still wasn't home. Mom kept calling him, leaving messages, and I could hear her voice get shakier each Time my friends started arriving and mom put on a brave face, ordered pizza, handed out party hats. I kept watching the door. But by cake time, I knew he wasn't coming. I could smell the alcohol on him before he even walked in. At seven PM, after everyone had left, sorry, Buddy, lost track of time. He slurred. My unopened present from him sat on the table. That became our new normal. Dad would disappear for days, sometimes coming home sober and full of apologies and promises. This time is different, he'd always say.

It's just a girl's trip. When I found condoms in her suitcase, I said, you're right, I am dramatic. Then I planned something so dramatic it made the local news. I was helping my fiance Marissa pack for her girl's trip to Cancun. She's in the shower, tells me to grab her charger from her suitcase. I move her sundresses and boom, fresh box of condoms. We don't use condoms. She's on an IUD. She comes out all bubbly, towel on. Did you find it? Yep, I said, smiling like nothing's wrong. Later, I check her friend's socials. Jenna studying for exams. Brooke at her nephew's party. Tori complaining about work. None of them are going anywhere near Cancun that night. Marissa says Wi-Fi might be bad. Babe, don't freak out if I can't text. Oh, which resort again? Uh, Jenna booked it. Something Spanish. I'll text you when we land. I asked about the condoms. She rolls her eyes. Therefore, Jenna, she's meeting some guy there. I'm being a good friend. Sure, friends always pack each other's condoms. I just smiled, alright, babe, have fun. But I wasn't dropping this. My cousin's a flight attendant. I gave her Marissa's info. She called back. Yeah, she's on the 10:00am flight tomorrow. But she's not alone. She's booked with a guy named Derek Chen, her coworker, the mentor, who was just a friend. So I got dramatic, logged into her booking with the confirmation number She sent me, switched her seat from 14A to 32E, back of the plane. Middle seat cost me 50 bucks, 50 I've ever spent. Then I bought myself a ticket, seat 14C, right across from Derek. And I wasn't done. I called resorts in Cancun until I found their booking Mr and Mrs. Chen honeymoon suite.

The notification popped up on my phone. Your driver, Garrett, is 2 minutes away in a black Honda Accord. I was already running late for Lily's parent teacher conference, wrestling my 7 year old into her jacket while she protested about missing her cartoon. My husband Trevor was supposed to drive us, but his car wouldn't start and he was still underneath it cursing at the engine. When the Honda pulled up, I barely glanced at the driver as we piled into the back seat. Jefferson Elementary, please. We're running super late. That's when he turned around and my entire world tilted sideways. Those green eyes, that crooked smile, the scar through his left eyebrow from a skateboarding accident in college. Veronica Garrett's voice hadn't changed eight years since I'd last heard it, but it still made my stomach. Oh, my god, Mommy, who's that? Lily piped up from beside me and I watched Garrett's eyes move to her face. I saw the exact moment he did the math, her age, her green eyes identical to his, the way her hair curled at the temples just like his did. Just our driver, sweetie, I managed. My voice unnaturally high. Let's get you buckled in properly. My hands shook as I adjusted her seatbelt. Garrett hadn't moved, still twisted around, staring at Lily like he was seeing a ghost. We need to go, I said sharply. The conference starts in 10 minutes. He nodded slowly turning back to face forward. As he pulled away from the curb, I saw his hands gripping the steering wheel so tight, his knuckles went white. The silence lasted exactly three blocks before Lily started chattering. I'm going to tell Missus Rodriguez about my new goldfish. His name is sparkles, but daddy says he looks more like a Herbert. Do you have any pets, Mister Driver? I. I have a dog, Garrett said carefully, named Bandit. Lily gasped with delight. I love dogs. Mommy says we can't get one because daddy's allergic, but I think he's lying because he pet our neighbor's dog once and nothing happened. I wanted to die. Every word out of her mouth was another piece of evidence, the way she talked with her hands, her laugh, even the way she said actually before correcting someone, just like Garrett always did. Your daddy sounds nice, Garrett said. Eyes finding mine in the.

He doesn't speak, can't handle loud noises and struggles with change. But he found peace in one thing, feeding the birds. Every morning at 7:00am, he'd scatter seed, then sit perfect quickly still as cardinals and blue jays ate around him.

The next morning as Jake went out with his bird seed, we found she'd installed motion activated speakers around her property line, blasting predator sounds, hawk screeches, cat yowls. The birds fled instantly. Jake had a complete meltdown, screaming and hitting himself. It took three hours to calm him. I tried reasoning with her. She laughed. Birds are pests. Deal with it. I called the police, legal. I called city council. No ordinance against it. I offered to pay for car washes. She refused. For two weeks I watched my son sit with his bag of Seed confused why his friends wouldn't come. He stopped eating, stopped sleeping, started pulling his hair out in chunks. That's when Mama Bear mode activated. See, Karen worked from home as a realtor. Her entire business depended on her reputation and online reviews. She just started her own agency, Mitchell Luxury Homes.

Three weeks after I moved in, I got served with papers. My parents were suing me for financial elder abuse and manipulation of family assets. Their claim, that I had somehow tricked them into letting me access my own inheritance early to buy a house that rightfully belonged to my sister. The kicker, they wanted me to sell the house and give the proceeds to Sarah, plus pay their legal fees. I hired a lawyer immediately. During discovery, we found some interesting things.

What he didn't know was that our boss was my older brother. Started small, then escalated to claiming my entire project proposals as his original ideas. I documented everything instead of confronting him. Screenshots, time stamps, recorded sessions. I figured the truth would come out naturally. The breaking point came during our quarterly review meeting. Derek stood up with my entire marketing campaign, the one I'd spent three weeks developing for the Henderson account, and presented it as his breakthrough concept. I've been working nights and weekends on this, he told the room, really pushing myself to think outside the box for our biggest client. I sat there watching him describe my color schemes, my taglines, even my budget projections, word for word from the presentation I shared with him the week before, asking for feedback as a colleague. After the meeting, Derek cornered me in the break room. You seemed quiet in there, Michael. Everything okay? Just listening. I said, good, because honestly, I've been meaning to talk to you about stepping up your game. The team needs people who contribute original thinking, not just clock watchers. That stung.

Janet listened to his concerns, then asked to speak with me privately. Michael, Derek says you're not contributing ideas and the team's frustrated with your participation. I nodded. What do you think? Janet smiled. I think Derek doesn't know who he's talking about. I've been watching this for months. Derek's been presenting your work as his own. You knew? I know because you emailed me your drafts before every project. I've seen your original files with timestamps. It's been accessing shared folders and copying your work. Why didn't you say anything? I wanted to see how far he'd take it. Janet opened her laptop. All file access is logged. Here's Derek downloading your Henderson campaign at 2:00am last Tuesday. He's accessed your files 43 times in two months. So what happens now? Now Derek gets to explain to HR why he's been committing intellectual property theft.

I was 17 and desperate to reinvent myself before senior year. My natural mousy brown felt boring, predictable, everything I didn't want to be. So I saved up tips from my weekend job at the frozen yogurt place and booked an appointment at the fancy salon Downtown. Platinum Blonde, I told the stylist, showing her a Pinterest board I've been obsessing over for months. Like Ice Queen blonde. Six hours later, I walked out feeling like a completely different person. The bleach had stripped away more than just color. It felt like shedding old skin. I couldn't stop touching it, checking my reflection in every store window. When I got home, my dad was in the garage, tinkering with his motorcycle. Whoa, kiddo! He whistled. That's definitely a change. Your mom see it yet? Not yet, I grinned, practically bouncing. Think she'll freak? He got this weird look on his face. Maybe give her a heads up first. But I was already heading inside, too excited to wait. Mom was in the kitchen, making her Thursday night lasagna. She always made lasagna on Thursdays. Something about structure and routine. She'd say. Mom, don't freak out. But she turned around, wooden spoon in hand. The spoon hit the floor. The sauce splattered across the tiles. Her face went completely white, like all the blood just drained out. Mom! She backed up against the counter, hands shaking. No! No! No! Lily! Mom, it's me. It's just hair dye. Lily. She screamed it, tears streaming down her face. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't. The ice. I couldn't. Dad came running. He took one look at mom, then at me, and his face just fell apart. Oh, Christ, the hair. What's happening? I was crying now, too. Scared and confused. Who's Lily? Mom collapsed onto the kitchen floor, sobbing so hard.

Months later, they were begging me to donate my kidney, and I smiled. I was 19 when I collapsed at our family barbecue. Sharp chest pain, couldn't breathe, the whole nine yards. My mom looked at me, gasping on the ground, and said, stop being dramatic. You're fine. My dad agreed. She's always been an attention seeker. Just breathe through it. Even my older brother rolled his eyes. Here we go again with the theatrics. This wasn't new growing up. Anytime I got sick or hurt, I was faking it or overreacting. Broken wrist from falling off my bike. It's just bruised. Walk it off. Drip throat so bad, I couldn't swallow. You're fine. Go to school. Food poisoning that had me throwing up for hours. Stop being such a baby. So when I hit the ground, clutching my chest, gasping like a fish out of water, they just saw another perform. My mom literally stepped over me to flip the burgers. My dad kept chatting with my uncle about football scores. My brother took a photo, probably planning to mock me with it later. Please. I wheezed, barely able to form words. Something's really wrong. Call 9 1 1. My mom sighed dramatically. Oh, my God, Sarah, enough! You're embarrassing us in front of everyone. My aunt tried to intervene. Maybe we should. No. Dad cut her off firmly. She pulls this crap all the time. If we give In now. She'll never stop. I was literally seeing spots, my vision going dark around the edges. The pain felt like someone was squeezing my heart with pliers. I'd never felt anything like it in my life. I can't breathe, I gasped. Then stop talking, my brother said, not even looking up from his phone. I begged them for 20 minutes. 20 minutes of writhing on their patio while they ate potato salad and ignored me. Finally, I managed to crawl inside and dial 9 1 1 myself with shaking hands. The paramedic took one look at me and his face went white. How long has she been like this? About half an hour.

So I showed them what that really meant. I'm setting the table for Christmas dinner at my mother in law's house like I have for the past five years, arranging the centre pieces I bought when my brother in law starts arguing with his wife about money. Nothing new there. They're fighting about if they can afford their kids braces. When the wife suggests they ask me for help, she's always offering. She says, I mentioned that I know a good orthodontist who does payment plans. That's when brother in law loses it on me. Why are you even talking? You're not part of this family. The whole room goes silent. Fork stop moving. Even the kids shut up. He keeps going, though you knew my brother for what, 8 months before he died. We didn't even know you existed until you showed up pregnant at his funeral. My mother in law looks at me, then at my son upstairs, then back at her plate. She's calculating whether defending me is worth risking access to her grandson. Father in law suddenly needs to check the garage. His sister examines the wall. Nobody says a word. Five years I've been showing up to every birthday, every holiday, every family crisis, but nobody defends me. You know what, you're right. I should leave. I walk to the kitchen, grab my casserole dish and plate warmer that's keeping their only side dish warm and head for the stairs. To grab my son. Mother in law finally speaks up, but it's not what I expect. Sarah, don't take my grandson on Christmas. Not, don't leave, not he's wrong. Just concerned about losing access to my son. We're gone in 10 minutes. I'm driving home and my five year old asks why we left early. I tell him Uncle Mike needed space. That's all. I'm not poisoning my kid against his father's family, even if they just showed me exactly where I stand in their lives. My phone starts buzzing, but I don't check it. I know it's mother in law trying to negotiate visitation, not apologise. I open my laptop and start canceling things. See, what brother in law doesn't realise is that I do everything for this family. I'm the one with the Costco membership they all use. I'm the one who drives father in law to his weekly poker nights because he lost his license. I'm the one who picks up mother in law's prescriptions because she doesn't understand the pharmacy app. I cancel it all, every single thing. I'm looking at my calendar and realizing how much of my life revolves around these people who apparently don't consider me family. Tuesdays and Thursdays I pick up my niece from dance because brother in law and his wife both work late. Wednesdays I take mother in law grocery shopping because she refuses to learn how to use delivery apps. Saturdays I help sister in law with her Small business. But here's the thing that makes me laugh. New Year's Eve is in six days. Guess who plans their massive family party every year? Guess who already bought all the decoration, ordered the catering and has the playlist ready? The venue is in my name. The deposit came from my credit card. The venue needs final payment 48 hours before or they release the bookings. Since it's on my card and they can't reach me, that booking is about to disappear. Brother in law has no idea what he just cost them. December 27th, I get a text from sister in law, can you pick her up from dance tomorrow? I text back, I'm not family, remember? Ask someone who is then father in law. Text about poker night. Sorry, free ride privileges are for family only.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed. And I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here. You know, you can stop trying. She Said, besides, you're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. Spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings. They hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said. Turning away, I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom, but I need to know what happened. Burp blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have A dad. I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. Next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. Grinning, I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul.

I can float for a couple minutes. Why? Don't move and don't leave the water no matter what. We need to clear it and evacuate everyone else. But you need to stay. What's in the water? My voice came out shaky. He didn't answer. Instead, he raised his whistle and blew three sharp blasts that echoed across the pool area. Everyone out of the pool immediately! This is not a drill! Family started rushing toward the ladders and stairs in a chaotic scramble. Kids were crying as parents pulled them out, water splashing everywhere. The shallow end emptied in seconds as people grabbed their belongings and ran. I wanted to join them, but I was duck floating in 12 feet of water, trying not to move. Hold still. The lifeguard kept his eyes locked on the water around me. I was trying my best, but my arms were already getting tired from the careful balancing. The sun beat down, and without movement, the water felt colder. Some families had stopped at the fence instead of leaving completely. A few called out encouragement, telling me to relax and breathe and stay as still as possible. Others had their phones out, recording whatever was happening. I could see the little red lights pointing at me from multiple angles. Three other lifeguards appeared with long handled nets used for cleaning debris. They spread out around different Parts of the pool moving slowly and carefully. The one nearest to me kept the net raised, ready to strike at something. Their faces were all focused on the water, like they were hunting. My breathing quickened despite trying to stay calm. Something was in the pool with me. Something dangerous enough to evacuate everyone else but keep me frozen in place. The lifeguards crept along the edges, scanning every inch of water. One of the lifeguards near the diving board suddenly plunged his net into the water. He struggled with something heavy, pulling and twisting the pole. The other guards rushed over to help, leaving me unwatched for terrifying seconds. Together, they hauled up their catch, and my blood went cold. An alligator thrashed in the net. Not huge, but big enough. At maybe four feet. Its tail whipped back and forth as they struggled to control it. The crowd at the fence gasped, and more phones came out. Someone called animal control, while the guards carefully carried the netted gator toward the bullhouse. But the lifeguard assigned to me didn't relax. He kept scanning the water around me with the same intensity. That's when I understood. If there was one, there might be more. Can I get out now? My voice cracked with fear. Not yet. Stay still. He pointed to something in the deep end. A dark shadow moved along the bottom, slow and purposeful, much bigger than the one they'd caught. The guards saw it, too. They all shifted positions, trying to get an angle with their nets, but it was too deep, too far from the edges. It's circling under her, one of them said quietly. My whole body trembled, sending ripples across the surface. The shadow continued its lazy patrol of the deep bend, sometimes closer to the surface where I could make out its prehistoric shape, sometimes deeper, where it became just a dark blur against the blue. Then someone in the crowd screamed, there's another one in the shallow

My parents believed that only beautiful daughters deserve to eat, so they made my identical twin sister and I compete every day to prove who was prettier. To them, ugly girls were worthless and didn't deserve to live. My parents were obsessed with creating what they called perfect specimens through extreme beauty competitions that started when we were toddlers. Mom was a failed pageant queen and dad was a plastic surgeon who'd lost his license for botched procedures. They believed modern parenting created ugly children who couldn't compete in a world that only value beauty. Our house was covered in mirrors and scales with no comfortable furniture because they said comfort made girls fat and lazy. Every surface reflected our faces back at us, constantly reminding us that only one daughter could be beautiful enough to deserve love. When my identical twin sister Gia and I were 10, our parents explained the new rules. Starting tomorrow, you'll earn food, water and shelter based on who's prettier that day, mom announced with excitement. The ugly one sleeps outside and goes hungry. Dad added that we'd be weighed, measured and judged every morning with the prettier twin getting breakfast while the uglier one watched. They explained that real beauty required suffering and sacrifice and watching your sister eat while you starve would motivate us to try harder in the real world. Ugly women die alone, mom said, preparing you for reality. Living under this system destroyed Us both. Every morning we'd stand naked in front of our parents while they measured our waist, examined our skin and rated our faces on a scale of 1 to 10. The prettier twin that day got to eat breakfast, use hot water and sleep in a bed, while the loser got nothing. I refused to sabotage Gia during these competitions, which meant I constantly lost and spent most nights shivering outside while she got the warm house. But Gia Learned quickly that making me uglier meant she'd always win. And she started putting hair removal cream in my shampoo, ground glass in my face wash and pins in my shoes to make me limp. Mom and dad cheered her on, saying, finally someone who understands that beauty is war. Or. I kept trying to help Gia look better at night, sharing my moisturizer and fixing her hair while she slept, hoping to keep some humanity alive in both of us. But the competitions got worse. They'd make us stand in front of mirrors for hours, pointing out each other's flaws with food as a reward for whoever found the most. I'd lie and say Gia was perfect while she cataloged every imperfection on my body. My parents filmed everything, making us watch the footage while they explained how my weakness would make us both ugly forever. I couldn't watch Gia destroy herself, so I started secretly helping her win every competition. At night, I put face masks on her. While she slept and fix her hair perfectly for morning inspections, I'd scratch my own face and mess up my appearance so she'd definitely be prettier. During Wayans, I drink tons of water beforehand to be heavier while slipping her diuretics to make her lighter. For 3 weeks, Gia won every single day. She got to eat every meal, sleep in the warm bed, and our parents, my parents, praised her dedication to beauty. Finally, you're becoming a winner, mom told her proudly. I thought I was saving her by taking all the punishment myself. I slept outside every night, went hungry every day, but told myself it was worth it because Gia was thriving. My parents even seemed happy, believing their system was finally working. I felt like I'd outsmarted them, found a way to protect my sister while giving them the competition they wanted. But they'd installed hidden cameras to monitor.

So my parents rent this house with a quarter acre of land and the landlord lets us pick from these grape vines every year. There's this old lady, Maureen, who used to pick them before we moved in, and she's been nothing but trouble ever since. Every single year it's the same drama. The landlord already told her we get first dibs because we actually pay rent. But Maureen acts like she owns the place. She's got her own grapes on her property. But apparently that's not enough for her greedy ass. This year, my mom tells Maureen, we're picking this weekend. Simple enough, right? Wrong. My dad just had major cancer surgery and was still recovering. my mom's usual helper crew all got sick with some nasty stomach bug. So the weekend comes and goes without us getting to the grapes. Monday morning, my mom's phone rings. It's Maureen, and she's got this smug tone like she just won the lottery. She tells my mom that she's coming tomorrow with her whole family to pick all the grapes since we apparently missed our chance. My mom tries to explain the situation. She's like, Maureen, please, my husband just had surgery for cancer and everyone who helps me is sick. Can you just wait a few more days? And you know what this heartless witch says? That's too bad. You had your chance. My family is coming tomorrow and we are picking the grapes. I'm sitting in the kitchen when my mom comes in, absolutely losing it. She's crying and yelling about how Maureen calls herself a Christian but acts like Satan himself. She tells me the whole story and I just snap. Absolutely not. I tell her we're staying up all night if we have to. We're picking every single grape off those vines.

Crystal. My parents actually looked at a Newborn baby and thought, let's spell Crystal like we're trying to unlock a cheat code. For 18 years, I dealt with this disaster of a name that looked like someone sneezed while typing. Every first day of school was the same nightmare. Teachers would get to my name on the roll call and just stop, dead silence. And they'd attempt some butchered pronunciation like curse style or quest illie. I'd have to raise my hand and say it's just crystal, but spelled like my parents hate me. The worst part wasn't even the pronunciation. It was the assumptions. People would see my name written down and immediately think I was some exotic foreign exchange student or that my family was super religious. I got asked if I was Muslim at least once a week. Random people would come up to me asking what country I was from or what language my name came from. I'd have to explain that, no, my parents just thought they were being creative when they were really just being cruel. My mom was the worst about it. She'd email every single teacher at the beginning of each school year with a whole paragraph about how to pronounce my name correctly and the cultural significance behind the spelling. There was no cultural significance. I just saw the name Crystal in a baby book and decided to make it Look fancy. When I was 15, I started telling people to just save my name as Crystal in their phones. Made everything easier. But my mom found out when she saw a text from my friend Jess that just said Crystal and she completely lost it. She grounded me for two weeks and made me write apology letters to all my friends explaining the proper way to spell my name. That's when I knew I was changing it. The second I turned 18, the day after my birthday, I marched down to the courthouse with all my paperwork. The clerk was super nice about it. She even.

I still remember the sinking feeling when our history teacher announced the final group projects worth 40% of our grade and I was already barely maintaining a B. However, my anxiety tripled when I saw who I was paired with, this girl, Ashley, not because of her, but because of her douchebag boyfriend. Aiden was this 6 foot 2 wrestler who treated Ashley like his personal property and everyone knew you couldn't even speak to her without him starting a fight. That first day in the library, Ashley sat next to me to share her laptop screen where she'd already started outlining our presentation. She was explaining her research when I felt eyes burning into me. Aiden was sitting three tables away, supposedly doing his own work, but staring directly at us with this intense expression that made my skin crawl. When Ashley leaned over to point at something on my notebook, innocent as could be, I heard his chair screech against the floor so loud the whole library turned to look. He stormed over grabbing my shirt collar. I was so shocked. My first instinct was to push him back, but Ashley quickly got in between us. The librarian rushed over threatening to call security and Aiden backed off, but not before pointing at me and mouthing, you're dead, where only I could see. Ashley kept apologizing after he left and he was just protective, but I could see she Was embarrassed and a little scared of him herself. I honestly thought that library confrontation would be the end of it. But that night when I went home, I opened our shared Google Drive to add my research section and found my entire portion replaced with gibberish and profanity that would get us all failed. At first, I thought it was a joke or something. But when I checked the edit history, it showed changes made from Ashley's account at 3:00am when she was definitely. I realized exactly who it was. The next day, Aiden shoulder checked me into a locker so hard I needed ice from the nurse, then loudly told everyone I was stalking his girl. More of my work got deleted, replaced with racial slurs and death threats that could get me expelled if a teacher saw them. Aiden had clearly gotten her password and was making it his personal mission to destroy my life, not just my grades. He started posting fake screenshots on Instagram, making it look like I was sending creepy messages to Ashley, getting half the school to think I was some predator. I panicked and texted her and she promised he'd stop. But that same night, he hacked my social media and posted humiliating things that made me lose dozens of followers. The night before our first draft was due, I had to stay up until 4:00am rebuilding everything Aiden had destroyed, only to wake up to find the entire project deleted, replaced With stop trying, you effing loser. Our entire group was now a target during our next live.

I'm gonna say he touched me here. My daughter was pointing at her private parts while my mother hugged her and told her she was a good girl. I almost swerved off the road watching my daughter smile about how she was going to ruin my life in three weeks time. The surprise build a bear I bought her was laughing at me from the back seat. The photos of Julie my mother had sent earlier now seem contaminated. But instead of getting angry and acting on impulse like college me would have, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I sewed a recording device into the Build a bear before driving home. Grandma's here. Julie squealed when I walked through the door 20 minutes later, running to me with the same innocent face that had just been rehearsing my destruction. I know sweetheart, I said, handing her the Build a bear. Mr Snuggles has a new friend for you. My mother smiled that grandmother smile I'd trusted for 42 years. You spoil her, Daniel. How was work? The usual. I kissed Julie's forehead, my stomach churning. Thanks for watching her mom. Over the next two and a half weeks, I became the world's greatest actor. I installed cameras in Julie's dollhouse, her jewelry box, even inside the old tablet She used for games. Every device was legally purchased and placed in my own home and items I bought. My lawyer would later call it Genius. Tuesday, my mother brought Disney bro shores to my daughter for after the bad man goes away, she whispered to Julie who was ecstatic about the holiday and seemed to have no idea of the consequences she was doing. On Thursday, they practiced Julie's testimony again. Remember baby tears? Help. The judge needs to see you're scared of daddy. On Saturday, she gave Julie a new American Girl doll. This is for being such a brave girl about our secret. Each night I transfer the recordings to three separate cloud services and a physical drive in my office safe. And I took my daughter in bringing her milk and cookies before calling her a good girl. It wasn't her fault. She had down syndrome and didn't understand the gravity situation. I couldn't be mad at her. When young children do bad things, you point the finger at the adults in their life. The court date arrived three weeks later. The room was packed for what everyone thought was day 3 of our custody battle. Jessica, my ex wife, sat with her lawyer looking confident. She I'm pushing for full custody with supervised visits. Only my siblings sat behind my mother. Your honor, Jessica's lawyer announced we'd like to call Julie Grimes to the stand. My 8 year old daughter walked in clutching her build Bear, she wouldn't look at me. The bailiff helped her onto the witness stand, adjusting the microphone to her height. Julie, Sweetheart. Jessica's lawyer said, I know this is scary, but can you tell the judge what you told your mommy and grandma? Julie's little voice shook. Daddy, daddy touches me in bad places. The courtroom gasped. She dabbed her eyes. My mother reached over to squeeze Jessica's hand in support. Where does he touch you? Julie pointed to her private areas. There, he says, it's our special secret. I felt my lawyer's hand on my arm, keeping me seated. My siblings were staring at me in horror. How long has this been happening, Julie? A long time, he said. If I told anyone, Mommy would get hurt. Jessica broke into performative sobs. The CPS workers were furiously taking notes. The judge's face had turned to stone. Julie, one last question, the lawyer continued. Do you feel safe with your daddy? Julie, start crying. Coached tears. No, I'm scared of him. I want to live with mommy and grandma forever. No further questions. The judge looked at my lawyer. Does the defense wish to cross examine? Your honour, my lawyer stood. Before we proceed, we need to submit critical evidence that will recontextualize this testimony. This is a delay tactic, Jessica's lawyer protested. Your honour, I have 18 days of.

I have chronic back pain from a car accident, so MRIs are routine for me. I've had dozens. They're boring, loud, and I usually fall asleep. This time was different because I made a catastrophic error in judgment. The morning of my scan, I was running late. I threw on the first clothes I could find, grabbed my purse, and rushed to the hospital. In the changing room, they gave me the usual spiel. Remove all metal, jewelry, and electronic devices. I strips down, put on the gown, and shuffled to the machine. the 20 something tech who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else, went through his checklist. Any implants, pacemakers, or metal in your body? Nope. Jewelry? Any piercings or hair clips? All removed. Any electronic devices? Left my phone in the locker. He nodded and helped me onto the table. This should take about 45 minutes. Try to stay completely still. The machine started its typical banging and clicking. I closed my eyes and tried to zone out. About 10 minutes in, I felt a subtle vibration. At first I thought it was the machine. MRIs vibrate, right? But this felt different. More localized, more personal. That's when I remembered what I'd forgotten to remove. Two days earlier, my best friend had thrown me a bachelorette party. The gag gifts included something called the Stealth Stella, a remote control device that promised to spice Up your daily routine? We'd all laughed, had too much wine, and somehow I'd been convinced to try it out. I'd forgotten I was wearing it. Now, trapped in a magnetic tube worth more than my house. Stealth. Stella had apparently decided the MRI's magnetic field was her activation signal. I tried to stay still, but the vibration intensified. The MRI's rhythmic banging seemed to be setting a paste that Stella was enthusiastically matching. Ma'am, you need to stay still. Brad's voice crackled through the intercom. I'm trying, I squeaked. The machine banged louder. Stella responded with increased enthusiasm. I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood. Ma'am, your heart rate is elevated. Are you claustrophobic? Something like that. Just 15 more minutes in the sequence. 15 minutes? I was going to die. Or worse, finish in an MRI machine with Brad watching my vital spike on his monitor. The vibrations reached a crescendo just as the MRI hit its loudest sequence. I gripped the panic button they'd given me, but refused to press it. How would I explain? Ma'am, there seems to be some kind.

Emma tried to laugh it off. Oh, it's really more of a champagne color. Nona Rosa squinted at the dress, then looked Emma dead in the eyes. In my country, women who wear white to wedding is cursed. She never find husband. Very bad luck. Emma's face went pale. That's just a superstition. My first husband's sister, she wear white to my wedding. In 1962, she die alone with 15 cats. Very sad. Nona Rosa shook her head dramatically. By now, a crowd had gathered. Emma was standing there in her white dress while this tiny Italian grandmother basically cursed her love life in front of half the wedding guests. Nona Rosa wasn't done. She pulled out her phone and started showing everyone photos of the cat lady sister in law talking loudly about how the white dress curse had ruined her life. See? Very sad cats everywhere. No husband, no children. Only cats and regret. Emma tried to escape to the bathroom, but every Italian relative at the wedding had heard the story by then. Tyler's uncle Marco started crossing himself whenever Emma walked by. His cousin Sophia whispered cursed under her breath when Emma passed her table. The worst part was during the reception, Emma had clearly planned to make some kind of speech or toast to get attention, but every time she stood up, someone would mention the curse. She'd sit back down looking defeated. And during the Bouquet toss. All the single women lined up except Emma. When I asked why she wasn't participating, Katie yelled out, she can't catch it! She's cursed! The whole room erupted in laughter. Emma spent the rest of the night sitting alone at her table, picking at her chicken while Italian relatives whispered and pointed. She left early without saying goodbye. The next morning, she texted me, can you ask Tyler's grandmother how to break the curse? I screenshot the text and sent it to our family group chat. Even our dad was laughing.

My parents believed that only beautiful daughters deserve to eat, so they made my identical twin sister and I compete every day to prove who was prettier. To them, ugly girls were worthless and didn't deserve to live. My parents were obsessed with creating what they called perfect specimens through extreme beauty competitions that started when we were toddlers. Mom was a failed pageant queen and dad was a plastic surgeon who'd lost his license for botched procedures. They believed modern parenting created ugly children who couldn't compete in a world that only value beauty. Our house was covered in mirrors and scales with no comfortable furniture because they said comfort made girls fat and lazy. Every surface reflected our faces back at us, constantly reminding us that only one daughter could be beautiful enough to deserve love. When my identical twin sister Gia and I were 10, our parents explained the new rules. Starting tomorrow, you'll earn food, water and shelter based on who's prettier that day, mom announced with excitement. The ugly one sleeps outside and goes hungry. Dad added that we'd be weighed, measured and judged every morning with the prettier twin getting breakfast while the uglier one watched. They explained that real beauty required suffering and sacrifice and watching your sister eat while you starve would motivate us to try harder in the real world. Ugly women die alone, mom said, preparing you for reality. Living under this system destroyed Us both. Every morning we'd stand naked in front of our parents while they measured our waist, examined our skin and rated our faces on a scale of 1 to 10. The prettier twin that day got to eat breakfast, use hot water and sleep in a bed, while the loser got nothing. I refused to sabotage Gia during these competitions, which meant I constantly lost and spent most nights shivering outside while she got the warm house. But Gia Learned quickly that making me uglier meant she'd always win. And she started putting hair removal cream in my shampoo, ground glass in my face wash and pins in my shoes to make me limp. Mom and dad cheered her on, saying, finally someone who understands that beauty is war. Or. I kept trying to help Gia look better at night, sharing my moisturizer and fixing her hair while she slept, hoping to keep some humanity alive in both of us. But the competitions got worse. They'd make us stand in front of mirrors for hours, pointing out each other's flaws with food as a reward for whoever found the most. I'd lie and say Gia was perfect while she cataloged every imperfection on my body. My parents filmed everything, making us watch the footage while they explained how my weakness would make us both ugly forever. I couldn't watch Gia destroy herself, so I started secretly helping her win every competition. At night, I put face masks on her. While she slept and fix her hair perfectly for morning inspections, I'd scratch my own face and mess up my appearance so she'd definitely be prettier. During Wayans, I drink tons of water beforehand to be heavier while slipping her diuretics to make her lighter. For 3 weeks, Gia won every single day. She got to eat every meal, sleep in the warm bed, and our parents, my parents, praised her dedication to beauty. Finally, you're becoming a winner, mom told her proudly. I thought I was saving her by taking all the punishment myself. I slept outside every night, went hungry every day, but told myself it was worth it because Gia was thriving. My parents even seemed happy, believing their system was finally working. I felt like I'd outsmarted them, found a way to protect my sister while giving them the competition they wanted. But they'd installed hidden cameras to monitor.

The worst part about being black with a high tech prosthetic. Cops don't see adaptive equipment, they see armed and dangerous. It was ten thirty PM coming home from my shift at the hospital. I'm an OR tech, which is ironic since I spend my days helping save other people's limbs after losing my own in Afghanistan. The traffic stop started normal enough. I wasn't even speed. The officer approaches my window with a friendly demeanor. Evening, sir. Just a routine check. How are you doing tonight? Good evening, officer. I'm doing well. Just heading home from work. My left hand is on the wheel, my prosthetic right arm resting naturally. The driving attachments still grip to the steering wheel. A specialized adaptive device device that lets me drive safely with one biological hand. He's mid sentence asking for my license when his flashlight beam catches the metallic gleam of my prosthetic. The attachment is carbon fiber with blue LED indicators showing battery life and grip pressure. In the dark, with the lights pulsing softly like a medical device, should I watch his entire demeanor transform in real time? His face goes from professional courtesy to pure panic in under a second. His hand flies to his weapon as he stumbles backward. Gun! Show me your hands! Get your hands where I can see them! Officer, it's Not a weapon. It's my prost. Hands now! Do not move that device! He's backing away rapidly toward his vehicle, gun drawn but pointed low. I slowly raise both arms, my left hand empty, my right prosthetic still attached to the wheel grip, because that's literally how it works. Officer, I'm going to explain very slowly. This is my prosthetic arm. I lost my arm in Kandahar. This attachment helps me drive. But he. He's already scrambling backwards to his patrol car, yanking his radio from his belt. 1033, I need immediate backup. Subject has unknown weapon device attached to vehicle, refusing to drop it. I call out, trying to keep my voice calm despite my racing heart. Sir, I can't drop it! It's my arm! It's attached to me! He's crouched behind his door now, shouting back at me, stop reaching for it! Keep your hands visible! The absurdity would be funny if I wasn't calculating survival odds. My prosthetic is literally engineered to not be quickly removable while driving. That's the feature. Officer, I'm a veteran. I work at Saint Mary's Hospital. My prosthetic has a driving attachment. If you let me explain. The first backup unit screams into view, tires squealing against asphalt, then another right behind it. Within three minutes, there are six patrol cars forming a semi circle around my Honda Civic, their lights blazing and turning the quiet street into a war zone. Officers are taking positions behind their vehicles, and I count at Least 12 weapons pointed in my direction. Someone has a rifle trained on me from across the street. I keep my voice steady, loud enough for them all to hear. I am an amputee. This is my prosthetic arm. I have V A. Identification. I am not a threat. One officer with a megaphone. Not Johnson. He's still frozen behind his door. Booms across the night air. Drop the weapon and exit the vehicle. I shout back, making sure every officer can hear me clearly. I cannot drop my arm. It's a prosthetic. Google Oscar power grip driving aid. That's what this is. They're all frozen in this ridiculous standoff when another car arrives. No lights. Just pulls up. Casual. A sergeant steps out, takes in the scene, and I see him physically. Sigh. He walks straight past the barricade.

Look, don't come for me until you've heard the full story. My little brother Liam decided to be a hero. Went through my phone, found my search history, you know, the usual stuff, anime, memes, some specific art like femboys, furry as and other stuff. Instead of being a bro, he printed it. I highlighted it, gave our mom a full Powerpoint presentation at dinner. I was grounded for a month. Mom looked at me like I drowned a puppy. I didn't scream. I didn't fight him. That's what he wanted. I got creative. Liam's a gym bro. All he cares about are his gains and his loser football friends. His biggest fear, being perceived as soft or cute. So I became his personal stylist against his will. Phase 1, I swapped his manly body wash for my lavender and honey scrub. Within a week, his teammates were asking why he smelled like a bath and body works. The confusion on his face was priceless. Phase 2, laundry warfare. I started mixing my clothes with his. A lace trim from my fishnets tangled in his jeans. A revealing top snuck into his load. His gray sweats came out smelling like vanilla and shimmering under the lights. The masterpiece was the school charity event. I bought two dozen rainbow bracelets, paid his best friend 20 bucks to tell everyone Liam had A crush on some goth boy by the bleachers and was changing his vibe to impress him. Overnight, the narrative shifted. Liam wasn't just a jock. He was the sensitive king. His friends thought it was hilarious. They dared him to wear a choker, bought him a skirt as a joke. And the thing is, he didn't hate it. The attention was an addiction. He started asking me for advice, how to walk in platforms, how to do eyeliner. His search history quickly became way worse than mine. He started a TikTok pretty boy, Liam. But I wasn't done. I introduced him to my friend Alex. Alex is persuasive. They started talking, hanging out. Then one night, I heard things from his room. Let's just say Alex fully educated him, clapped his cheeks. Now, Liam doesn't just dress the part. He lives it full time. He never apologized for snitching. He probably doesn't even remember these days. He's too busy picking out fishnets and living his best life. So yeah, I got revenge. I didn't just change his clothes. I changed his entire life. And honestly, he's never been happier. You're welcome, Liam. Maybe now mom will finally stop looking at me.

The manager's reaction wasn't what anyone expected. Last weekend it was unusually warm for this part of the country. Like, uncomfortably warm for a place that's normally pretty mild. I was wearing a tank top and some Jean shorts, so I had a lot of skin showing. Nothing indecent though, just air arms and legs. And I might have had some cleavage showing. My husband and I were planning to have a barbecue for some of his work friends later that afternoon, so I went down to the grocery store to pick up a few final items we'd forgotten. The store was absolutely packed with people trying to beat the heat and grab cold drinks. Everyone was dressed for the weather. Tank tops, shorts, dresses. You know, normal summer clothes. I'm making my way through the aisles with my little basket, enjoying the air conditioning, when I get to the canned goods section. So I'm standing there looking at the beans, trying to do mental math about how much we'd actually need for eight people, when I feel this tap on my shoulder. I turned around to come face to face with an older lady who is definitely overdressed for the weather. Like, full sleeves, pants, the works. She looked miserable in all those layers. I asked politely, may I help you? And she replies with this tone, don't you think you're dressed Appropriately for this job. I was genuinely confused. Like what job? I'm just shopping. So I replied, well, yes, but I'm not at my job right now. I work in a hospital as a lab technician and we have pretty strict dress codes there. Obviously she scoffed and said, well, we'll see what Dave has to say about this. Apparently Dave is the manager and a friend of hers, so she races off to find him. I'm just standing there looking at beans, still trying to figure out how much we need, wondering what the hell just happened. Just as I put a couple cans into my basket, the lady comes marching back down the aisle with who I assume is Dave, wearing a manager type apron. She he's pointing at me like I'm some kind of criminal and saying do you let your employees wear things like that? It's shameful! Dave looks at me and I can see him trying to place my face. He starts to look at me like he knows me from somewhere, then shakes his head and tells the lady she doesn't work here. But this woman is not having it. She looks between me and Dave and tells him of course she works here. I've seen her stocking shelves and working at the register multiple times. It's absolutely shameful that you allow her to dress like that on the floor. Dave looks at me again, then I swear I can see the light bulb. Moment. He takes his walkie talkie and calls for someone named Linda to report to Aisle 7. The lady is still going off about my outfit when Linda appears. I was completely shocked. This girl looked exactly like

Emma tried to laugh it off. Oh, it's really more of a champagne color. Nona Rosa squinted at the dress, then looked Emma dead in the eyes. In my country, woman who wear white to wedding is cursed. She never find husband. Very bad luck. Emma's face went pale. That's just a superstition. My first husband's sister, she wear white to my wedding in 1962. She died alone with 15 cats. Very sad. Nona Rosa shook her head dramatically. By now, a crowd had gathered. Emma was standing there in her white dress while this tiny Italian grandmother basically cursed her love life in front of half the wedding guests. Nona Rosa wasn't done. She pulled out her phone and started showing everyone photos of the cat lady sister in law, talking loudly about how the White Dress curse had ruined her life. See, very sad cats everywhere. No husband, no children, only cats and regret. Emma tried to escape to the bathroom, but every Italian relative at the wedding had heard the story by then. Tyler's Uncle Marco started crossing himself whenever Emma walked by. His cousin Sophia whispered cursed under her breath when Emma passed her table. The worst part was during the reception. Emma had clearly planned to make some kind of speech or toast to get attention, but every time she stood up, someone would mention the curse. She'd sit back down looking defeated. And during the Bouquet toss. All the single women lined up except Emma. When I asked why she wasn't participating, Katie yelled out, she can't catch it. She's cursed. The whole room erupted in laughter. Emma spent the rest of the night sitting alone at her table picking at her chicken while Italian relatives whispered and pointed. She left early without saying goodbye. The next morning she texted me, can you ask Tyler's grandmother how to break the curse? I screenshot the text and sent it to our family group chat. Even our dad was laughing.

My mom had this thing called trust falls. But not the normal kind where you fall backward into someone's arms. Every few weeks, she'd randomly yell, trust fall! And pretend to faint. Didn't matter where we were. Kitchen, grocery store, parking lot, she'd just drop. The rule was we had to catch her before she hit the ground. My brother and I got really good at this. Developed a whole system. I'd grab shoulders, he'd grab legs. We could catch her mid collapse from across the room. Our reflexes were insane. If we missed, she'd lie there perfectly still until we started crying and begging her to wake up. Then she'd pop up, laughing, you need to be faster! What if this was real? I thought every family did this. Like a fire drill, but for medical emergencies. I'd brag to friends about our response time. 1.3 seconds was our record. Kids at school thought it was badass that we were basically training to be paramedics. Teachers were impressed by our emergency preparedness. I even put it on my college applications under special skills. The game evolved as we got older. Sometimes she'd clutch her chest first. Sometimes she'd add choking sounds. Once she fell down half a flight of stairs. We caught her before she hit the landing. She was so proud. When I was 22, I was at my boyfriend's family dinner when his grandma stood up too fast and got Dizzy! Before anyone could blink, I'd launched across the table, knocking over dishes, and caught her midwobble. The whole family stared at me like I was insane. I was crouched there supporting this confused, elderly woman, gravy dripping down my shirt, ready to administer CPR. My boyfriend's mom gently helped me let go of grandma, who was fine, just needed to sit down and asked if I was okay. I explained about our trust falls training, and the silence was deafening. That's when my boyfriend said what everyone was thinking. Your mom pretended to die to test if you'd save her. Well, when you put it like that, turns out mom has severe thanatophobia, fear of death. The trust falls weren't training us. They were her way of controlling her panic attacks. If she knew we'd catch her, she felt less scared about randomly dying. She'd been using us as emotional support animals since we were kids. My brother ended up becoming an EMT. He says he can't help the adrenaline rush when anyone stumbles. His partner thinks he's heroic. Really, he's just traumatized. I can't relax in public. Ever. Part of my brain is always scanning for falling people. I've caught three strangers in the past year. They think I'm some kind of guardian angel. Nope. Just programmed to prevent any human from hitting the ground. The worst part? When I confronted mom about it, she said, but look how prepared you are. You could save someone's life. Yeah, Could, but I can't eat dinner without mapping exit routes and catch positions for every person in the restaurant. Last month, my therapist asked me to show her what I meant. I had her sit in different positions around the room while I demonstrated my catch approach. For each angle, she watched me calculate trajectory and response time for 15 minutes before quietly saying, this isn't normal emergency preparedness. This is hyper vigilance. But, hey, if you ever need someone to catch you, I'm your girl. 1.3 seconds. That's still my record.

So I gave my daughter a name she'll never forget. I've been planning to name my daughter Sophia Rose since I was literally 14 years old. I had this whole Pinterest board with nursery ideas, wrote it in my diary about a million times, even practice signing birthday cards with love, Sophia's mom like a complete weirdo. When I got pregnant at 23, everyone in my family knew this was the name I. I've been talking about it for almost 10 years. But my younger sister Emma always had to make everything about her growing up. If I got a new bike, she needed a better one. If I made honor roll, she suddenly cared about grades. When I announced I was pregnant, she immediately started trying to get pregnant too, even though she'd been with her boyfriend Tyler for only like 8 months and could barely afford rent on her studio apartment. Two months after my announcement, she called me crying happy tears. I'm pregnant too. We can be pregnant together. At first I was excited, sister. Pregnancy sounded cute. We could share maternity clothes, compare weird cravings, complain about swollen feet together. But then she started copying everything I mentioned, craving pickles and ice cream. Suddenly that was her thing too. I bought this gorgeous cream colored crib from target. She showed up with the exact same one three days later when I posted bump photos in My favorite blue maternity dress. She bought the same dress in pink and posted almost identical pics. The worst part was she kept asking about names. What are you thinking for names? I'm so stuck. You always have the best ideas. I stupidly told her about Sophia Rose because I trusted her. She nodded along, said it was beautiful, even suggested middle name alternatives. And at 36 weeks, she went into early labor. I was still two weeks away from my due date, feeling like a whale and scared something was wrong. She texted me from the hospital, she's here, 7 pounds, 2 ounces of perfect. Come meet your niece. I waddled into that hospital room with flowers and a pink teddy bear, so excited to meet my first niece. Emma was glowing in her hospital bed holding this tiny, perfect baby girl. Meet Sophia Rose, she said with the biggest smile. I literally felt my heart stop. What did you just say? Sophia Rose. Tyler, she repeated, like nothing was wrong. Isn't she perfect? The name just felt so right when I saw her little face. You, you were right. It's such a beautiful name. I stood there holding wilted flowers, 38 weeks pregnant with my own daughter, watching my sister cuddle the baby who now had my name, the name I might planned for almost a decade. Tyler was taking pictures. The nurses were cooing and I felt like I was watching my dreams get stolen in real Time. Emma, that was my name, I whispered. She looked at me with fake confusion. What do you mean? We never decided on anything official. And she just looked like a Sophia when she came out. You understand, right? You'll find something even better. I left that hospital room crying so hard I could barely see to drive. My husband, Jake, was furious when I told him. She can't just steal your name, he kept saying. But legally, she absolutely could. There's no copyright on baby names. Two weeks later.

Missus Lambert walked into class with tears streaming down her face and slammed her coffee mug on the desk so hard it broke. If one of you can find the woman my husband is cheating on me with, I will give you an A+ for the semester and you can stop doing work. Just please help me catch her so I can deliver justice. Someone in the back raised their hand slowly and asked if that was really all they had to do. Mrs. Lambert nodded and laid out three rules. One, we couldn't get caught snooping around. Two, we couldn't break into anyone's homes. 3, we could work in teams if we wanted. The bell rang right after and my best friend Kenji grabbed my arm and pulled me into the hallway. He said, I got a plan. This will be easy money. Trust me. Missus Lambert's husband was Coach Lambert, who taught gym and coached girls volleyball. Kenji figured he was probably sleeping with one of the volleyball players since he spent so much time with them after school. We decided to start our investigation. That afternoon during volleyball practice, sucked into the gym and hid behind the bleachers with a clear view of the court, Coach Lambert was running drills and yelling at the girls to hustle. He seemed normal at first, but then we noticed he kept touching the team captain's shoulder when explaining plays. The practice Went on for an hour and nothing suspicious happened. We were about to give up when Coach Lambert called the captain Abriel into his office. He jogged over, bouncing her ponytail and followed him inside. Through the window, we could see her tying her hair up in a bun while he made sure no one was looking, then turned off the lights and pulled down the blinds, blocking our view completely. Kenji and I looked at each other, knowing she was giving him the Gawk. Gawk 3,000. We quietly left the gym and started heading back to Mrs. Lambert's classroom to claim our a plus. We were practically running down the hallway when we heard footsteps behind us. Two kids from our class tackled us to the ground before we could react. They pinned us down while their teammate Jasmine sprinted ahead toward Missus Lambert's room. We struggled, but they were bigger and had caught us off guard. By the time we got free and made it to the classroom, Jasmine was already inside talking to the teacher. After Jasmine left, looking smug, I went into the classroom alone. Missus Lambert was sitting at her desk, crying harder than before. I told her what we'd seen with Coach Lambert and April in his office. She thanked me through her tears and said she'd suspected the volleyball team all along. But then I realized something off. I asked her, are you okay? Like actually okay. Missus Lambert looked up at me. With surprise, she actually smiled a little through her tears and said, I was the first student to ask how she was feeling. I apologized for not asking sooner and told her that even though she was a tough teacher, she didn't deserve to be cheated on. She stood up and walked around her desk. Do you still want that a plus, she asked. I said, yeah, of course, because who wouldn't want a free grade? But then her expression changed to something I couldn't read. She explained that since I was the only student who showed concern for her well being, she wanted to give me a special choice. I could take the A+ for myself, but she'd tell her.

As I walked across the stage alone, my phone buzzed a text from my dad, you owe us an apology, plus 37 missed calls. I didn't expect to graduate alone, but the empty chairs in the family section told me everything. Before I even walked across the stage, my name echoed through the auditorium. Applause blurred into static, and I gripped my diploma like a lifeline. Then my phone buzzed, a text from my dad, you owe us an apology, followed by 37 missed calls. Apologize for what? For working three jobs to get here? For not being born? My sister Claire. The air outside smelled of cut grass and balloons. I sat by a fountain alone, rereading that text until the words burned into me, apologize. My parents hadn't just skipped my graduation. They had scheduled my sister's baby shower on the same day. And every time I brought it up, they brushed me off. Ryan, this is once in a lifetime for your sister, my dad said. You'll have other ceremonies, my mom added. That morning, I'd still held out hope. I kept checking the parking lot. Nothing. Not a single familiar face. Instead, I got told to apologize. When I finally went home, the living room looked like a pink explosion. Balloons, confetti, pastel mountains of baby gifts. There sat on the recliner like it was a throne. She didn't even look At me. Did you bring something for the baby? We're still accepting gifts. I had nothing left after scraping together money for a graduation suit. No flowers, no balloons, just the quiet hope that maybe my family would understand. Instead, my mom cut me off. Brian, your attitude is unacceptable. We had to choose and we chose your sister. She needed us more, I whispered. I needed you, too. My dad's face hardened. Walking across the stage isn't the same as bringing life into this world. Be grateful we're even celebrating you now, Claire laughed. Don't sulk. You'll get another graduation when you do your masters. This one was just practice. That was it. I left. The following weeks were worse. Relatives whispered about how selfish I was for missing her shower at a barbecue. My uncle chuckled, you really should have been there for your sister. Months later, I tried again. My grandmother asked me to visit. I walked into the house to find another baby shower underway. The second shower. And the first words out of my dad's mouth were, you weren't invited. This is for family. Claire smirked. It's fine, dad. He can stay. Make himself useful. The gifts are heavy. I haul boxes from the car. While relatives whispered he skipped the first shower out of jealousy. Poor Claire. The breaking point came with dessert. My dad tapped a glass. Claire, we are so proud of you. You've brought this family together in a way nothing Else ever has. You've given us purpose. Then he turned to me, Ryan, maybe one day you'll understand what it means to put family above yourself. Until then, we'll keep praying for you. The applause was thunderous. I stood there, diploma erased, years of sacrifice erased. While my family clapped for the daughter who had never lifted a finger, something snapped. I didn't yell. I didn't argue. I just.

My boyfriend and I waited for months for our baby to say his first word, but he kept telling me not to worry, that boys develop slower. I was starting to get anxious because Cody was way past when he should have been talking. Then one Tuesday morning while I was feeding him breakfast, it finally happened. Cody looked right at me, smiled and clear as day said may. I screamed with excitement, immediately calling Jake into the kitchen. He said his first word. He said may. But Jake's face went weird when he heard it. He shook his head and said I must have misheard him, that babies don't usually say random months as their first words. But I knew what I heard. Over the next few days, Cody kept saying it, may, may, always the same word, always with this happy little giggle. Afterward, Jake kept insisting I was wrong, that he was just babbling. But something about how defensive he got made me uneasy. After a week of Cody only saying may, I started getting concerned. Other babies said Mama or Dada. I tried teaching him other words, pointing at myself, saying Mama over and over, but he'd just smile and say may again. The weird part was how Jake reacted every single time. He tense up, change the subject or suddenly need to leave the room. One afternoon, our babysitter Kenna was Over while I was getting ready for work and Cody said it again, May. Kenna and I looked at each other. I saw panic in her face. There was something she wasn't telling me and Cody knew about. She sat down at the kitchen table and said she had something to tell me, something she'd been feeling guilty about for months. Kenna was sobbing so hard she could barely get the words out. I had to wait five minutes for her to contain herself, dying to know what she was about to tell me. And she admitted that sometimes we were out, she'd been bringing her friend over to help watch Cody. Her friend's name was Shay. I'm so sorry, Kenna kept saying. I know I should have asked permission. My, my mind was racing. Shea, not may. I actually laughed, hugging Kenna and telling her it was okay. I was just glad to finally understand what Cody was trying to say. However, I wanted to see it for myself. So I got an idea. The next day before Kenna came over, I put a camera in our living room to see if she'd bring her friend over. Sure enough, about an hour after I left, girl with blonde hair came in. Kenna introduced her to Cody, saying, this is Shay. Can you say Shay? And Cody responded with his usual may. It was actually adorable seeing him try to pronounce her name. I felt silly for being so paranoid. And decided to take the camera down. When I got home, I forgot about the camera. And the next day while I was at work, I decided to check again. I wanted to see my boyfriend playing with our sweet Cody and text him I loved him. He was on the couch with Cody and I smiled watching them together. Then I heard it may Cody said, reaching his arms up. That's right, buddy, he said.

I can float for a couple minutes. Why? Don't move and don't leave the water no matter what. We need to clear it and evacuate everyone else. But you need to stay. What's in the water? My voice came out shaky. He didn't answer. Instead, he raised his whistle and blew three sharp blasts that echoed across the pool area. Everyone out of the pool immediately! This is not a drill! Family started rushing toward the ladders and stairs in a chaotic scramble. Kids were crying as parents hold them! Mount! Water splashing everywhere. The shallow end emptied in seconds as people grabbed their belongings and ran. I wanted to join them, but I was stuck floating in 12 feet of water, trying not to move. Hold still! The lifeguard kept his eyes locked on the water around me. I was trying my best, but my arms were already getting tired from the careful balancing. The sun beat down, and without movement, the water felt colder. Some families had stopped at the fence instead of leaving completely. A few called out encouragement, telling me to relax and breathe and stay as still as possible. Others had their phones out, recording whatever was happening. I could see the little red lights pointing at me from multiple angles. Three other lifeguards appeared with long handled nets used for cleaning debris. They spread out around different Parts of the pool moving slowly and carefully. The one nearest to me kept a net raised, ready to strike at something. Their faces were all focused on the water, like they were hunting. Breathing quickened despite trying to stay calm. Something was in the pool with me. Something dangerous enough to evacuate everyone else but keep me frozen in place. The lifeguards crept along the edges, scanning every inch of water. One of the lifeguards near the diving board suddenly plunged his net into the water. He struggled with something heavy, pulling and twisting the pole. The other guards rushed over to help, leaving me unwatched for terrifying seconds. Together, they held up their catch, and my blood went cold. An alligator thrashed in the net. Not huge, but big enough. At maybe four feet. Its tail whipped back and forth as they struggled to control it. Crowd of the fence gasped, and more phones came out. Someone called animal control while the guards carefully carried the netted gator toward the bullhouse. But the lifeguard assigned to me didn't relax. He kept scanning the water around me with the same intensity. That's when I understood. If there was one, there might be more. Can I get out now? My voice cracked with ear. Not yet. Stay still. He pointed to something in the deep end. Dark shadow moved along the bottom, slow and purposeful, much bigger than the one they'd caught. The guards saw it, too. They all shifted. Positions trying to get an angle with their nets, but it was too deep, too far from the edges. It's circling under her, one of them said quietly. My whole body trembled, sending ripples across the surface. The shadow continued its lazy patrol of the deep end, sometimes closer to the surface where I could make out its prehistoric shape, sometimes deeper where it came just a dark blur against the blue. Then someone in the crowd screamed, there's another one in the shallow end! All heads turned to see a smaller gator that had been hiding near the steps. It must have been there the whole time, while families evacuated right past it. One lifeguard ran over with his net while the others stayed focused on the one beneath me. Animal control arrived in a van pulling up to the pool gate. Two officers in heavy gloves and protective gear came in with specialized equipment. They took over netting the shallow end gator while assessing the situation with larger one. How big is the one under her? The officer asked. Six feet at least, maybe seven. The lifeguard's voice was grim. They discussed options while I floated helplessly above the predator. They couldn't net it from the edges. The pool had no drain access to empty it quickly. Tranquilizer guns risked making it thrash and attack. Every solution put me in danger. We need to get her out without triggering its prey drive. The animal control officer studied the Gator's movement pattern. They just

The manager burst out laughing. My ex girlfriend, Natalie, had been planning this for weeks. Ever since we broke up in January. She'd been telling everyone at the gym that I was stalking her. She even started a group chat with her friends about getting me banned. The breakup wasn't even bad until Natalie decided to ruin my life. A friend from the gym warned me what she was saying. He follows me around every day. She'd been telling people he watches me work out. Management needs to do something. I kept going to the gym at my usual time, 5:00am every morning. What else could I do? She had all the friends. I just had my morning routine. So there I was at the front desk on Tuesday morning after my workout. The whole place smelled like sweat and rubber mats. Natalie showed up with her friend Kim and some new boyfriend, all three dressed like they meant business. Hope you enjoyed your last workout here, Natalie said. I filed a harassment complaint. Three people saw you following me around the gym. I stayed quiet, let her talk. The manager, Mr Vasquez, came out from the back, this older guy with tattoos who'd been running the place forever. He looked tired already. Natalie jumped right in before he could even speak. This man stalks me every single day. I have proof. I want his membership cancelled right now. Or I'm calling the police. Kim nodded hard. We all saw it. Mr Vasquez, he follows her around. It's creepy. The new boyfriend crossed his arms, trying to look tough. Mr Vasquez sighed and pulled out his tablet. Alright, let's look at this harassment complaint. Natalie smiled. She thought she'd won. Finally, someone's taking this seriously. I just stood there waiting. The manager scrolled through his tablet for a minute, then another minute. Natalie started tapping her foot. Ma'am, when exactly did this harassment happen? Mr Vasquez asked. Natalie got excited. Every single day. He's always here when I am, always watching me. Don't pretend you don't know. Mr Vasquez kept scrolling on his tablet. Interesting. What time do you usually come to the gym? Natalie crossed her arms. Around noon, sometimes 1:00. If I.

That's technically false imprisonment. I smiled and showed him the beer in my hand. Then arrest me, officer. He looked at the BMW wedged against my garage door, then at me, then at the sobbing college girl in designer clothes. I can't ask you to drive intoxicated, sir. Exactly. This whole circus started Friday night. I just worked a 12 hour shift when I found the BMW blocking my garage. Not just parked, positioned to claim maximum space. Like she'd measured it for spite. My private driveway sign had been knocked over deliberately. I parked behind her, creating a vehicle sandwich. Garage door, BMW, my car. Stone walls on both sides. Physics made her escape impossible. When she knocked at ten PM, I expected an apology. Instead, she snapped her fingers at me, like calling a dog. Move now. I have places to be. You're illegally parked on my property. That's not my problem. Four words that started a war. You're right, it's not your problem. It's your entire weekend. I cracked open a beer in front of her. I'm drinking now. Can't legally drive. See you Tuesday. Tuesday? Labor Day weekend. I'll be drinking for three days straight. The first cop arrived at ten forty seven PM, looked at the situation. Her illegal parking, my alcohol consumption, the impossible geometry of the driveway. She parked on private property, he said. And you've been drinking. I can't ask you to Drive. This is kidnapping! She screamed. No, ma'am, this is poor decision making. Saturday brought escalation. Three police visits, two tow trucks that took one look and left her father on speaker phone, threatening lawsuits. I sat on my porch, beer in hand, watching her meltdown. My dad owns a dealership. Cool. He sell cars to trespassers? Sunday, they tried psychological warfare. 20 pizzas delivered. I tipped the driver $50 and thank them for the free food. Her friends formed shifts, begging every few hours. Please. She's Learned her lesson. Has she? What lesson? That. That she shouldn't park in driveways? Nope. She's learning that her problems aren't my problems. Monday, Labor Day, her mother arrived. Different approach. Offered me $500. That's generous, I said. Stepping beer number, who knows? But I'm enjoying my weekend. You're ruining her life. I'm sitting on my porch. She ruined her own life when she decided my property was her parking spot. Tuesday morning, 6:00am. She'd slept in her car, hair matted, designer clothes wrinkled, mascara creating modern art on her cheeks. I walked out in my work clothes. Her eyes lit up with desperate hope. Then the Uber pulled up. I got in, made eye contact with her through the window and smiled. The driver asked, rough neighborhood? Nah.

Yes! Yes! Harder! I screamed from inside the bathroom, don't stop! I'm almost there! Then my husband busted through the door and screamed, you're caught! A crowd of people poured into our master bathroom, all glaring at me. My parents, his parents, my sister, her husband, and even my best friend were all there to witness the greatest misunderstanding of all time. Let's rewind. So I've been sneaking into our bathroom every night at 2:00am for the past six months. I had told my husband I had insomnia and needed to do relaxation exercises to fall back asleep. I used to lock the door and even put a little towel under it to muffle the sound. My husband ended up walking by one night and hearing me through the door panting. Oh, god, that's the spot right there. He froze and pressed his ear against the door. Come on, Sarah, you can do this, I grunted. Push through it. He heard me moan and say something about getting sweaty and going all night. Then he stopped back to bed and laid there staring at the ceiling in despair. When I came out 30 minutes later, I kissed him goodnight like nothing happened, not realizing I just inadvertently broken his heart over a misunderstanding. From that day on, my husband started recording me through the door on his phone. He caught me groaning, just 10 more seconds, I can take it! And oh, god, my thighs are burning! The worst one was, that's it, I'm coming! Followed by heavy breathing and me yelling, new high score, baby! He even recorded me saying this is exactly what I needed, with me moaning in satisfaction. He was understandably suspicious, showing the recordings to his brother. That's definitely cheating, his brother said. She's having an affair in your bathroom at 2 a m. Like, if only they'd heard themselves, they would have known it made no sense. But they were all delusional. They assembled what my husband called the intervention team. Both sets of parents, my sister and her husband, my best friend, who he convinced would be helping me. Even our neighbour, who my husband asked to be a witness. We'll catch her in the act, he told them, with rage in his eyes. And he did catch me doing something, just not what he expected. So that night, during my usual 2:00am bathroom session, the entire intervention team burst through the door. You're caught! My husband yelled. But everyone just froze, staring at me in my ridiculous neon green sweatpants, sports bra soaked in sweat, and holding two controllers with a VR headset on my face. Um, can I help you? I asked in the headset up. Where is he? My husband screamed, looking around our empty bathroom. Where's who? I said, suddenly realising what this looked like. Your lover. The person you're meeting in here every night. He pulled out his phone with all the recordings. Listen to this. He played the audio of me screaming about coming and everyone winced. Um, I'm playing Beat Saber, I said, pointing to my Quest 3 headset. Beat what? He demanded. I cast my screen to my phone and showed them footage of me slashing through blocks to a dubstep remix of let it go while doing deep squats and aggressive hip thrusts. I've been exercising, I said, my face burning red in V R. In secret, because I'm embarrassed about how hard I go. Everyone stood there processing. So no affair? My mother in law asked. No affair, I confirmed, showing them my Beat Saber profile. Just me, ranked 4,847th globally, absolutely destroying blocks at 2:00am because I'm too embarrassed to let anyone see me exercise. My dad looked at the headset and all those noises were me aggressively playing a fitness game. Yes, I said. Jake kept staring at the screen, showing my gameplay, the moaning, the it's coming, the harder. It's a really intense workout, I protested. I burn like 800 calories an hour. My sister started laugh, crying. You organized a whole intervention because your wife is secretly getting ripped in VR? My brother in law had been recording the whole thing. This is going straight on TikTok, he said. Then the neighbour raised his hand. Can I try? Within minutes, half the room was taking turns and my mother in law was screaming, oh, god, Yes, while slashing blocks

The manager's reaction wasn't what anyone expected. Last weekend it was unusually warm for this part of the country, like uncomfortably warm for a place that's normally pretty mild. I was wearing a tank top and some Jean shorts, so I had a lot of skin showing. Nothing indecent, though, just spare arms and legs. And I might have had some cleavage showing. My husband and I were planning to have a barbecue for some of his work friends later that afternoon, so I went down to the grocery store to pick up a few final items we'd forgotten. The store was absolutely packed with people trying to beat the heat and grab cold drinks. Everyone was dressed for the weather, tank tops, shorts, sundresses, you know, normal summer clothes. I'm making my way through the aisles with my little basket, enjoying the air conditioning when I get to the canned goods section. So I'm standing there looking at the beans, trying to do mental math about how much we'd actually need for eight people when I feel this tap on my shoulder. I turned around to come face to face with an older lady who is definitely overdressed for the weather, like full sleeves, pants, the works. She looked miserable in all those layers. I asked politely, may I help you? And she replies with this tone, don't you think you're dressed Appropriately for this job. I was genuinely confused, like, what job? I'm just shopping. So I replied, well, yes, but I'm not at my job right now. I work in a hospital as a lab technician and we have pretty strict dress codes there, obviously. She scoffed and said, well, we'll see what Dave has to say about this. Apparently Dave is the manager and a friend of hers. So she races off to find him. I'm just standing there looking at beans, still trying to figure out how much we need, wondering what the hell just happened. Just as I put a couple cans into my basket, the lady comes marching back down the aisle with who I assume is Dave, wearing a manager type apron. She, he's pointing at me like I'm some kind of criminal and saying, do you let your employees wear things like that? It's shameful. Dave looks at me and I can see him trying to place my face. He starts to look at me like he knows me from somewhere, then shakes his head and tells the lady she doesn't work here. But this woman is not having it. She looks between me and Dave and tells him, of course she works here. I've seen her stocking shelves and working at the register multiple times. It's absolutely shameful that you allow her to dress like that on the floor. Dave looks at me again, then I swear I can see the light bulb Moment, he takes his walkie talkie and calls for someone named Linda to report to aisle 7. The lady is still going off about my outfit when Linda appears. I was completely shocked. This girl looked exactly like.

I was 12 when a tornado warning Siren went off at 2:00am. Most kids never think about what their parents would actually do in a real emergency until it happens. I found out the hard way. The sirens were screaming outside our house and I could hear the wind picking up something fierce. I'd done tornado drills at school a million times. Teacher always said the same thing, have a plan with your family. Know where to go, stick together. So when I heard that awful wailing sound, I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I ran straight to my parents bedroom, heart pounding in my chest. The door was already open and mom was frantically pulling clothes out of dresser drawers while dad grabbed boxes from under the bed. Grab the photo albums, mom shouted at him, pointing to the bookshelf. What about me, I asked, standing there in my pajamas with my hair all messy from sleep. Neither one of them even looked at me. Dad rushed past me carrying our old wedding albums and some jewellery boxes. Mom was right behind him with her arms full of important papers and more pictures. I followed them downstairs, my bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. I could hear the thunder getting louder outside and the rain was starting to hammer against the windows. The emergency radio was crackling with warnings about rotation spotted just a few miles away. When we got to the basement door, mom turned around and saw me standing there. There's no more room, she snapped, like I was asking for something unreasonable. Then they shut the door right in my face. I stood there in that dark hallway alone while the whole house shook from thunder. The sirens kept wailing and I could hear the wind outside getting stronger and stronger. It sounded like a freight train was coming straight for us. I tried knocking on the basement door but they didn't answer. I called for them but nothing. So I crawled under the kitchen table with Buster, our old golden retriever, and wrap my arms around him. He was shaking just as bad as I was. That's when it really hit me. If that tornado came through our neighbourhood, my parents weren't going to open that door for me. They'd rather save their stupid photo albums than make sure their own daughter was safe. The storm lasted about 20 minutes. It felt like hours. When the sirens finally stopped and the wind died down, I heard the basement door creek open. Mom and dad came upstairs looking all annoyed like the whole thing had just been a big inconvenience. You should have knocked harder, mom said when she saw me still under the table. You could have been hurt if you came down with all that stuff, dad added, gesturing to their precious boxes. You'll thank us one day when we still have The photo albums, I'm finished. But I didn't thank them, not that night, not ever. The next week at school, Missus Coleman asked our class to talk about emergency preparedness. What's something you'd grab in an emergency, she wanted to know. Kids raised their hands with all the normal answers. Jamie said she'd grab her baby brother. Tyler said his cat. Lisa said her parents.

When I was 17, my classmate Derek threw 50 bucks at me in the school parking lot and desperately said, I need you to be my boyfriend for one hour to scare off my mom's church friends. His mom thought he was gay because she found his elaborate skincare routine and absolutely freaked out. She was bringing her entire prayer circle over for what she called a healing intervention to save Derek's soul from eternal damnation. Just act super gay and make them uncomfortable, Derek explained frantically while pacing nervously. They'll get so weirded out, they'll pack up and leave within 20 minutes. Easy money, right? I showed up at exactly three PM wearing the tightest jeans I could squeeze into and a bright pink shirt. I knocked on the door and screamed Derek, baby! So loud that neighbors three houses down started coming outside to see what catastrophe was happening. His mom answered with five absolutely horrified church ladies clustered behind her like a religious huddle. Prepare for spiritual warfare! I immediately bear hugged Derek and loudly announced sweetie pie. I brought us matching cucumber face masks and a carefully curated playlist of Broadway show tunes for our romantic spa day. Derek's face went completely pale, but I was fully committed to this Oscar worthy performance. For the next hour, I went into full theater kid mode like my life depended on it. I called him Sugar Plum, Honey Bunny, And my precious little cinnamon roll. I critiqued his mom's curtain choices with the intensity of a professional interior designer, started reorganizing their entire spice rack alphabetically while humming songs from Hamilton, and loudly complained that their throw pillows didn't match the seasonal aesthetic vision. And I was going for. The church ladies looked like they were watching a slow motion car crash that they couldn't look away from. One kept fanning herself frantically with a church program. Another was gripping her purse like it was a life preserver in a stormy sea. Then I made my absolutely fatal mistake. I spotted their old dusty piano sitting in the corner and declared dramatically with full jazz hands, Derek, Honey, let's sing that special duet we've been practicing for the school talent show. Without waiting for his response, I launched into the most ridiculously over the top rendition of A Whole New World that has ever been performed outside of Broadway. Derek just stood there completely mortified and frozen like a deer in headlights. When I finished with a dramatic flourish, the church lady slowly started clapping and another joined in. Then all five of them erupted in thunderous applause like I had just performed at Carnegie Hall. Young man, the head church lady said, with actual tears streaming down her weathered face, that was the most beautiful, soul stirring thing I've ever heard in my entire life. Derek, you absolutely must.

I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called fam real instead of just mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members, Mom, Dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth, everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. Emma had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus, she always has her headphones in. Anyway, my birthday dinner, the one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations, I thought we had a good time. Apparently, they spent the whole night annoyed with me. I found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. When, when I asked where everyone was, they told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses. Everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbor kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin, dad wrote. Sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied. We'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very Beginning of the chat, it's started eight months ago right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied, best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly closed the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie, how was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were cancelled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all acting.

My brother's boss disagreed. I walk into the restaurant holding my eight year old daughter's hand and she's never met these people. My family cut me off when I got pregnant at 17, called me a disappointment and slammed the door in my face. Eight years later, they finally agreed to meet us. My mother looks me up and down. Oh, honey, at least you tried to look nice. I'm wearing my favorite sundress, but apparently it's not enough. She hugs my daughter like she has the right. She's so well behaved despite everything, fight, everything. Like my daughter's existence is something to overcome. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They pick this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her. My brother slides a 20 across the table for gas money home like I'm still 17, borrowing the family car. My mother asks if I ever finished high school. When I say I graduated college, she goes, oh, online degrees count too, honey. Then my brother stands up all proud. I have an announcement. I just got hired as restaurant manager at this very chain. Everyone's clapping and my mother says, see Your brother didn't ruin his life and look where he is now. My brother's bragging. I'm one of only four managers in the whole district. I report directly to regional. I'm making 60,000 a year. My father finally speaks to me. Maybe your brother can get you a job here. They're always hiring servers. My mother asks where the father of my daughter is. And I say, he left. Of course he did. What did you expect from having a baby so young? My sister shows photos from her Paris vacation last summer, then tells me, maybe someday you can take your daughter somewhere nice. At one point, I managed to get out that I work in the restaurant industry. However, they keep assuming I mean waitressing. My mother tells another table very loudly, my daughter had so much potential, got pregnant at 17. I tried to help, but she wouldn't listen. My daughter asks why. Grandma seems angry. And I tell her Grandma's just confused. My brother's still going on about his promotion. The owner's supposed to stop by today, actually doing rounds at all the locations. The server's getting more nervous, hovering nearby. But I'm waiting. My family keeps talking about how hard being a single mother must be, how I probably can't afford daycare, how my daughter probably doesn't have a college fund. Such a shame, my mother says. She was so smart before she threw it all away. My daughter squeezes my hand under the table. She knows something they don't. The manager approaches our table and my brother jumps up. This is my.

My sister's kids threw it in the fire. While my parents laughed, my sister chuckled. Maybe this will teach her not to be spoiled. I just smiled, closed my wallet and the whole room went silent. My daughter Carla just turned 13. She loves digital art and I've been saving for months to buy her a 2 thousand dollar laptop for her birthday. Her birthday fell around Easter, which meant the big family gathering at my parents place. My Sister Amanda arrived with her three kids who have no rules at home. Within minutes, they pulled Carla's sketchbook out and scribbled all over her drawings. Carla came running outside holding back tears. Black, it's just paper. She can draw more. Amanda shrugged. At dinner, I had the laptop wrapped in a gift bag on her chair. Carla opened it carefully and her face lit up. Dad, this is amazing. She hugged me tight. Before I could even take a picture, one of Amanda's kids grabbed the laptop. He ran toward the fire pit holding it over his head while the others cheered. Stop, I yelled. But it was too late. He tossed it in like a Frisbee. This sound when it hit the flames was sickening. Carla gasped, went quiet. I fished it out but the casing had already melted. That's when I heard the laughter. Amanda was laughing. My parents were chuckling. Dad said maybe That'll teach her not to be spoiled. Carla was shaking, tears rolling down her face. My whole family was acting like this was some kind of joke. I set the melted laptop down slowly and looked directly at Amanda. She smirked it. It's just a computer. You can buy another one. Maybe get her something she needs instead of spoiling her. I didn't yell. I just smiled. The entire table went quiet because they knew that smile meant something was coming. Later, Amanda and mom were giggling in the kitchen. Don't look so serious, mom said. It was just a prank. You're acting like they burned down your house. Amanda said, I worked months of overtime for that laptop. Amanda shrugged. Then buy another one. Dad walked in. You have to let things go. They're just kids. That was it. They weren't going to apologize. Something shifted that night. I'd spent years being the bigger person, but watching Carla cry while everyone laughed broke something inside me. I started thinking about everything I'd done for this family, bills I'd covered. When Amanda forgot rent times I'd bailed them out a month later.

My foster brother Ryan was getting married to this sweet girl named Emma when he cornered me at the rehearsal dinner. I bet you $15,000 you can't make my dad cry during my wedding speech tomorrow. He was drunk and bitter. That bastard never showed a single emotion when we were kids getting beat by different foster families. Our foster dad, Tom, had taken us in when we were 12 and 14. Strict military guy. Never hugged us, never said he loved us. Just provided food and shelter until we aged out at 18. We both resented him for being so cold. 15 grand? You're crazy. I'm dead serious. Man's made of stone. You could set him on fire and he wouldn't blink. Ryan pulled out his phone, showed me his savings account. I've got the money. You make him cry during my speech, it's yours. I needed that money. My band was about to get our first real record deal, but needed studio funds. Deal. But I pick what I say about him. The wedding was perfect. Emma looked radiant. Ryan cleaned up nice. Tom sat in the front row in his only suit, stone faced as always. When it came time for speeches, I stood up with my glass. Most of you know Tom raised Ryan and me when nobody else wanted us. Two angry kids who'd been through hell. Tom's expression didn't change. What you don't know is what kind of Man, he really is. I paused, scanning the crowd. When I was 13, I got arrested for shoplifting. Tom didn't lecture me. He just sat in that police station for eight hours until they released me. Never said a word about it. Tom shifted slightly in his seat. When Ryan broke his arm at 15, Tom slept in the hospital chair for three nights. Didn't go to work. Just stayed there in case Ryan needed anything. A few people in the crowd were getting emotional. Tom was staring at his hands. Tom never said he loved us. But when I had nightmares, I'd find an extra blanket on my bed in the morning. When Ryan failed his driver's test three times, Tom kept taking him back without complaining. I looked directly at Tom. You never hugged us or said the words. But you packed our lunches every single day for six years. You came to every school play every baseball game, every graduation. You taught us how to be men by showing us, not telling us. Tom's jaw was clenched tight. His hands were shaking slightly.

She suddenly remembered I existed. My girlfriend dragged me to Bradley's birthday party at the downtown bar, but spent the entire pregame listing all the ways Bradley would have handled things better. Bradley got everyone VIP tables for his birthday, she said, scrolling through his Instagram. He just knows how to make things special. And look at his new promotion post, youngest VP in his company's history. Second we walked through the door, she immediately started her routine. See how Bradley's already bought everyone around, she said, roughly adjusting my collar. That's called generosity. He makes six figures and still remembers his friends. I watched her as she made her way to Bradley. He was the former college quarterback, now investment VP, and still looked like he stepped out of the cover of Vogue. You look like you need this more than me, said a voice beside me. A brunette in a black dress held out a whiskey. Marilyn from Bradley's office, someone I'd only met once at his promotion dinner. I'm more of a wine person anyway. Thanks, I said, taking the drink. Bradley's parties are always overwhelming, she said, settling into her chair like she planned to stay. All that aggressive networking disguised as fun. She turned toward me. You're the teacher, right? Yeah, I teach middle school. God, that's brave. Seventh graders are feral, she laughed. Moving her chair closer. I bet you have the best stories, though. We started talking about my students while Bradley held court across the bar. Real interest asking about lesson plans and classroom management. She actually listened to the answers. So you basically perform for 30 teenagers all day, Marilyn asked, her knee brushing mine. That takes serious charisma. I die, she leaned in. Plus the patience. Can barely handle one Powerpoint presentation without wanting to scream. My chest felt warm. I couldn't believe someone was actually asking about my work instead of why I didn't make more money. I can tell you love teaching, she smiled. You light up talking about it. It's a attractive when someone's passionate about something meaningful. Her hand touched my arm. Not like these finance bros talking about hedge funds like they're saving the world. From across the bar, I noticed my girlfriend glancing over while pretending to laugh at Bradley's story. Her eyes narrowed slightly. Your girlfriend seems nice, Marilyn said, following my gaze, though I'm surprised she's not over here with you. She prefers Bradley's stories. Marilyn scoffed like she couldn't understand why, right? I've heard her talk about him at office parties. She paused. Actually, she talks about him a lot. Like a lot. A lot. That stung more than expected. You know what's funny, Marilyn said, her hand still on my arm. Bradley can't keep a girlfriend. They all get tired of coming second to his career. She moved closer. Some women actually want someone who comes home at a reasonable hour, who has emotional depth beyond stock options. My girlfriend appeared suddenly, inserting herself between us. Hi, Maria. Right, Marilyn, she corrected, not moving back. I was just telling your boyfriend how much I admire teachers, real everyday heroes. My girlfriend's laugh pitched high. He's actually thinking about leaving teaching. Bradley's been showing him investment opportunities. No, I'm not. I said, you mentioned it last week. You mentioned it. You said Bradley could get me a job that pays better. Marilyn raised an eyebrow. Why would he leave something he loves? My girlfriend grabbed my hand for the first time in months. To have a better future, obviously, Bradley says. There it is. Marilyn interrupted. Bradley says, she turned to me, let me guess. She also thinks you should join his gym, buy the same car, moved to his neighborhood. My girlfriend's face flushed. I'm just trying to help him succeed. He already has succeeded, Marilyn said. He shapes young minds. What's Bradley do? Move numbers around. Bradley just closed a 10 million dollar deal. Cool. Your boyfriend just taught a kid to read. Marilyn stood up, pulling out her phone. I'm having people over next weekend, educators and artists only. She handed me her number directly. You should come. I'd love to hear more about your actual life. The effect was instantaneous. My girlfriend wrapped herself around my arm. Actually, we have plans next weekend together doing couple things. Since when I asked? Since now? She was practically dragging me away. We need to go now. In the Uber home, she exploded. How long has she been after you? Tonight's the second time we've talked. She was all over you. She was interested in my work. You should try it sometime. I'm interested. You teach kids math, English. For three years. The silence stretched until we reached our apartment.

Don't expect access to our personal road. My grandpa owned this chunk of land right next to a horse race track. And honestly, it was perfect placement. Their property almost completely surrounded his, except Grandpa had access to this super busy public road. The racetrack had their exercise track on one side of his land and their main stadium track on the other side. So back when they first built the place, the racetrack guys came over and asked Grandpa if they could move their horses across his property. There was already this maintenance road going through his land. And since it was just horses walking through, he figured why not? Plus, these guys actually supported the local community. So Grandpa was cool with it. As a thank you, they told him he and any guests could watch the races for free. Normally cost about 5 bucks. It wasn't huge money, but it meant Grandpa could take me and all my cousins to see the horses without paying anything. We'd go every few weeks during racing season and it was awesome. But then Grandpa passed away and mom inherited the land. We wanted to keep the tradition going, so she took my niece to see the horses, just like Grandpa used to do with us. She gets to the counter expecting free admission, but they tell her she has to pay. Mom figured they just didn't know she owned the land now. So no big deal. But when she contacted them afterwards to explain the situation, they basically told her to pound sand. The free admission thing was a one time deal they had with Grandpa. And now that he was gone, the deal was off too. Mom was pretty ticked off about this. I mean, they were still using our road to move their horses, but suddenly we weren't good enough for free tickets. That didn't sit right with any of us. So a few months later, mom had planned to cut down some trees on the property for lumber. Anyway. She had these contractors coming out to do the work. And the day before they showed up, she had this brilliant idea. She told the contractors to accidentally leave a couple logs right across the maintenance road after they finished cutting. The next morning, the racetrack people showed up with their horses like usual, but surprise, they couldn't get through. These logs weren't small either. Probably took three guys to move each one. The horses couldn't step over them and there was no way around because of how the road was positioned. But now these guys had to load all their horses onto trailers and drive them around to the busy public road instead. This was a massive pain because the public road had tons of traffic, making it dangerous to unload horses. Plus it took them like.

Now, as I'm about to get married to someone else, my mom suddenly wants to sit me down and tell me this. Let me start from the beginning. Three years ago, my husband, Matthew vanished without a trace. I woke up on a Tuesday morning and his side of the bed was cold. His running shoes were still by the door. His phone was charging on the nightstand. Even his wallet sat on the kitchen encounter with everything inside. I called everyone. His work, his brother, his friends from Murphy's Bar. Everyone said the same thing. They had no idea where he went. I filed a missing person report, but Detective Reid basically shrugged it off. Adults have the right to leave. He said no signs of struggle. Probably just needed space. But I knew Matthew. We've been together for 10 years. He didn't just need space. It wasn't like him at all. The first few months were torture. I'd jump every time the phone rang, thinking it would be Matthew. I kept his coffee mug on the counter and bought his favourite cereal every week, just in case he came home. My sister moved in because I was barely eating. Friends set up search parties with flyers. The local news ran his photo, but nothing came of it. After months with zero leads, they moved his case to inactive status. That. That's when the real grief Hit. I had to accept that Matthew was either dead or had abandoned me completely. I went to therapy twice a week and cried through most sessions. Doctor Lewis helped me process the trauma, but I still had nightmares. After a year and a half, I started dating again. My friend set me up with Lucas, a teacher at the local elementary school. He was patient, understanding everything Matthew wasn't. Where Matthew was impulsive, Lucas was steady and thoughtful. Lucas never pushed me to talk about Matthew before I was ready. He'd hold me during bad days and never made me feel guilty for grieving. Slowly, I started feeling human again. We moved in together last year, and he proposed on our anniversary. The wedding is in three weeks. I've got my dress. The venue is booked. Lucas's family is flying in from Oregon. I finally felt like my life was back on track. Then yesterday happened.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. Crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. Lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find That very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenagers, we would need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right. But you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans work or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss Johnson, isn't it true that you, you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick and even the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo on his Phone and showed it to her. This is a picture from your Instagram account posted 3 days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

So I set the voltage to maximum and watched her regret it. I'm an electrical engineer who spent $30,000 in two years of weekends building my dream off grid solar system. Every wire, every battery bank, every circuit designed by me. It wasn't just about saving money, it was about complete energy independence. Then Karen discovered my outdoor charging port. Karen was our HOA treasurer, title she gave herself after volunteering when nobody else wanted the job. She immediately started calling herself executive officer of Community Standards and began terrorizing the neighborhood with fines for everything from mailboxes being the wrong shade of beige to kids leaving bikes on porches. When I installed my solar panels, he tried to find me for visual disharmony. I showed her my city permits and told her my off grid system was none of her business. She didn't like that answer. The first theft happened at 2:00am. My surge alarm screamed like a banshee, jolting me awake. I stumbled outside to find her pristine white Tesla Model X plugged into my private charging port. Glowing under the moonlight. Karen stood there, arms crossed like she owned the galaxy. Your charger wasn't being used overnight, she said, with zero shame. I figured I'd save a few bucks. I was speechless. This woman was treating my custom engineered system like a shared garden hose. You can't just plug into someone's private energy system, I said, trying to Stay calm. She looked confused and smug. You put it outside your house. Since we're all part of the same community, technically the energy belongs to everyone. I reminded her the HOA had nothing to do with my power grid. She rolled her eyes and said, you should be grateful I'm charging clean. I'm not burning gas. That's when I knew this was war. I didn't shout or throw a fit. I walked inside and checked my logs. Her Tesla had drained 73% in four hours, nearly a full charge worth dozens of dollars. I pulled security footage and found she'd been doing this for weeks, sneaking over at night like some energy vampire. The next morning, I knocked on her door with printed data showing exactly what she'd stolen. I offered to let it go if she stopped and paid partial reimbursement. She smirked, oh, please. You really think I'm paying?

But what happened at the altar ruined everything. I've been a wedding photographer for almost 10 years. I've seen nervous grooms, crying mothers, even power cuts in the middle of receptions. But one wedding, last summer, it taught me more about karma than any book could. The bride, Anna, had booked me eight months before her wedding. She loved my portfolio, my style, and even told me she felt safe knowing her big day would be in my hands. I spent months planning, visiting the venue, preparing equipment, even making a timeline with her. One week before the wedding, I got a call. Not from Anna, but from her fiance's mother. Her voice was sharp. Anna has decided to go with her cousin Zoe. She's young, fresh, and her Instagram is very trendy. And honestly, you're just too expensive. I froze eight months of preparation, canceled other bookings for this date, and now a cousin with a camera was taking over. I asked if Anna was okay with this. The mother in law snapped. Of course. She is Zoe's family. She'll do it for half the price. We don't need you anymore. That's done. Not just the money, but the trust broken. Still, I stayed professional. I understand. Best of luck. But inside, I was crushed. This was my passion, my art. And I've been thrown away like a backup option. Life has strange timing. On the exact day of Anna's wedding, I Had already taken a corporate contract with the same hotel hosting her ceremony. A big client, an international brand launching their product. Double pay, high profile and less drama. I arrived at the hotel early, carrying my gear. As I passed the ballroom, decorated with flowers and golden drapes, I saw Anna's family buzzing around. And in the middle of it, Zoe, holding a shiny camera, bragging loudly. Don't worry, I've got this. My followers love my style. It'll look like Vogue magazine. She shot me a smug glance, whispering something to her friends, and they laughed. I just smiled politely and walked away. But inside, I felt sorry for Anna. Weddings aren't Instagram photos. They're once in a lifetime memories that demand skill, backup gear and nerves of steel. Hours later, while I was shooting the corporate event next door, I heard shouting from the wedding hall. A bridesmaid came running, face pale. The camera crashed. All Zoe's photos are gone. I stopped midshot. My heart.

I was drawing basketball plays in detention when Mr. Hugh picked up my notebook and said, you just mapped out vector physics and probability theory. I thought he was mocking me like everyone else, but his eyes were serious. I'm the dumb kid, I told him. Ask anyone. I've been the class idiot since kindergarten. Couldn't read properly, spelled my own name wrong on tests. A zero in math once, and the teacher held it up asking, how is this even possible? Someone yelled, give him negative points! And everyone laughed, including her. During group projects, kids would literally cry when paired with me. One girl told her partner, just do his part. He won't understand anyway. She said it right in front of me, like I wasn't even human. Parent teacher conferences were torture. Have you considered testing for learning disabilities? Maybe a special school? I've been teaching twenty years and I've never seen a case this severe. My mom would cry in the car afterward. You're not stupid, baby. You're not. But even she looked outful sometimes. By eighth grade, I'd stop trying. Why bother when teachers pre wrote F on my papers before I turned them in? Then mr. Hugh arrived as our substitute. While everyone warned him about the problem kids, he walked past my desk and stopped at my notebook full of diagrams and arrows. What is this? He flipped through Pages of plays I'd drawn from last night's Lakers game. Nothing. This isn't nothing. Explain this to me. He pointed at a complex play I'd mapped. That's where LeBron fakes the pick and roll. But actually, I explained the whole play. How the defense would shift where the opening would appear. You just described angular momentum and predictive analysis. No, I described basketball. He smiled. Same thing. Saturday, 9 a m. Gym. I coach youth basketball, and I need an assistant. I showed up thinking he'd realize his mistake. Instead, he had me analyze his team's plays. See how No. 7 keeps telegraphing his cuts? I said his shoulders dip left before he goes right every time. Mister Hugh started writing on his clipboard. You're describing biomechanical patterns and statistical probability. I'm describing basketball. Let me show you something. He drew a parabola on the whiteboard. What's this? A free throw arc. It's also a quadratic equation. He wrote numbers next to it. The optimal release angle is 45 degrees. But Steph Curry shoots at 50 degrees. No. Why? His release point is higher, so he needs a steeper angle to maintain the same entry angle at the rim. You just solved for X in an equation PhD students struggle with. My brain broke, but I can't do math. You've been doing math your whole life. We just called it the wrong thing. He started teaching me everything through basketball. History became the integration of the NBA. Biology was about Fast twitch versus slow twitch. Muscle fibers in different positions. English essays analyze game footage. If Curry shoots 43% from three but 38% when guarded tight and the defender is two feet away, what's the expected value of the shot? I calculated

The same husband who told me to get lost. I thought it was a prank. Evan and I'd spent our last year together in bitter arguments before divorcing six years ago. The lawyer cleared his throat. Evan updated his will two months ago. According to the update, you're the sole owner of all his assets, his company shares, vacation properties, cash and the house. Couldn't speak. Evan and I'd fought tooth and nail for that house in court. I'd cried for weeks when I lost it. And now he's suddenly giving it back. When his new wife Haley called an hour later, her voice was shaking. I need to know what you did to make him forgive you. We have two kids together. He left them nothing they can touch until they're 30. Why? That's the same question I wanted answered. I told her I hadn't spoken to Evan since the horse was finalized. I didn't even know where he'd been living. She didn't believe me. His brother texted me next. We can't legally tell you why, but how dare you? I tried calling him but he wouldn't answer. I drove to their family house and his sister answered the door with pure hatred on her face. There's an NDA, she said. The whole family signed it 4 years ago, 80,000 dollar penalty if anyone breaks it. She started closing the door then stopped. That NDA expires in stages. When you find out the truth, I hope it haunts you like it haunted us. I sat in my car exhausted and lost, thinking back to our final fight. Evan had thrown a plate at the wall next to my head. I'd run out while he yelled, if you leave me, I'll never forgive you. Never. The estate lawyer called me back to discuss the details. First, there's a condition I need to explain. I knew it with Evan. There was always a catch. Once you use any money or move into the house, you must live there for five years or you forfeit everything. My eyes widened. That's very specific, I said yes. And not only that, the house has monitoring systems to ensure compliance. Smart locks that log entries, security cameras, even guards that were paid a five year salary on the spot to watch at all times. If you leave for more than 72 consecutive hours, the inheritance is void. I sat there stunned. It wasn't exactly a cruel or impossible thing, but it was weird. Too weird for even Evan to ask for. And he asked for this completely. Same I asked. The lawyer nodded confidently. Me and another witness made sure it was accurate and his decision was made of sound mind and body. Now, another thing he added, pulling out a banker's box. These are personal effects he wanted you to have immediately. Inside were Manila folders full of photos. That made my mind spiral even more. Pictures of me in several public spaces for the years like he'd never stopped watching me. Some had little hearts drawn around my face, others with my face scratched out so violently the pen had torn through the paper. My hands started shaking. The lawyer got up. I'll ask for your signature on the papers by tomorrow evening. Please make your decision by then. Decision. After hearing everything, that was like asking a bird to fly to the moon. Evan was practically handing over our dream house and money that I could spend on my mother's cancer treatment. But his family's warnings worried me. I needed to know more. I spent the night going through the box and found the business card of his therapist. Yes, the doctor confirmed Evan left 60 recorded sessions. If you accept the inheritance, they'll be released one per month. He was very specific about the schedule. You can't access them early. But take my advice, take the offer. Don't trust anyone else. There are things you really need to know. She swiftly hung up and refused to take any more of my calls. At the bottom of the box were sealed envelopes with complex seals labeled year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4, year 5. The truth. When I called the lawyer about it, he explained, ah, yes, these are date locked. Can't open them early or you lose everything. You have to wait exactly one Year between each letter. I was starting to get frustrated. What was up with all these puzzles? Was this some sick way of tormenting me? I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. I thought about everything, the warnings from his family, the pain in his widow's voice, the therapist's advice, and Evan, the man who put me in this awful position. Just when I thought I was sure I'd say no, the doctors called me in the morning reminding me that tomorrow was the deadline for my mom's experimental cancer treatment. I was stuck again. The lawyer arrived at my apartment at 6 sharp with the final papers. Once you sign, the house locks engage at midnight. The five years starts immediately. The guards are already in position. My hand hovered over the signature line. I paused, then signed Year 1. I opened his first letter. It read, I'm sorry for doing this to you.

My 16 year old sister Estella used to be the cautious one. Then her school hosted this mandatory self defense seminar and it was like someone flipped a switch in her brain. The seminar taught exactly three moves, a palm strike to the nose, a knee to the groin and how to break out of a wrist grab. That was it. Two hours of practice and somehow Estella walked out of that gymnasium convinced she could take down any attacker who crossed her path. Over the next few days, she bought a hot pink pepper spray keychain that she'd whip out at random moments to show people her tactical stance. She even started following every self defense account on social media and turned our family dinners into lectures about how women just needed confidence and basic training to defeat any man who tried to hurt them. The real turning point came when she started what she called confidence Walks through the most dangerous parts of our city at night. I found out about them by accident when I caught her sneaking out at eleven PM wearing all black. She had her pepper spray in hand, practically glowing with excitement. When I confronted her, she smiled and said she'd been walking through the streets alone for the past two weeks, the same streets where three women have been mugged in the last month. I'm actually hoping someone tries something, she said. Holding up her pepper spray like it was some kind of holy weapon. I want to prove that women don't have to live in fear anymore. One demonstration of force and these predators will think twice about attacking anyone ever again. I tried explaining that real violence wasn't like her controlled classroom environment, that actual attackers don't follow seminar rules. But she just looked at me with disgust and said I was another toxic man who didn't believe women could protect themselves. That night, I sat at my computer researching everything I could about real world attacks versus self defense training, watching security footage of actual assaults and learning about how even trained fighters often freeze when confronted with real violence. And I discovered that Estella's Instagram instructor had never been in an actual fight and was selling 200 dollar online courses to teenage girls with promises of unleashing their inner warrior. I knew I had to stop this before my sister actually got hurt. The next morning, I ordered a black ski mask from Amazon with overnight delivery, dug out an old hoodie from college that Estella had never seen and borrowed a pair of work boots from my garage. Next.

When I was 11, I started noticing this weird thing. Whenever someone lied to me, my tongue would tingle, like when you lick a battery. The first time it happened was at school when my friend Mia said she didn't take my pencil. My tongue buzzed like crazy, and later I found it in her desk. I thought it was just in my head, but it kept happening. In middle school, when kids said they didn't copy my homework. Buzz. When they claimed they weren't talking about me behind my back. Buzz. By eighth grade, I realised I had some kind of superpower. But it freaked me out. I stopped shaking hands with people because what if they were lying about something and I could taste it? I stopped eating at potluck because what if someone lied about washing their hands? My classmates already thought I was weird, so I never told anyone. But my gift made me unbeatable at group projects and friend drama. People thought I just had really good instincts about people. I didn't correct them. Then junior year happened and everything changed. My mom had been dating this guy, Trevor, for about six months. He was one of those smooth talkers who remembered everyone's birthday and always brought flowers. Mom was totally smitten. But every single time Trevor opened his mouth around me, my tongue went fuzzy. Not just a little tingle, but full on electric. Shock mode when he said he loved spending time with our family. Buzz when he complimented my mom's cooking. Buzz when he claimed he was just looking out for us. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! The guy was a walking lie detector nightmare. I tried telling my mom about my bad vibes, but she brushed it off as teenage attitude. She said I was just protective and needed to give him a chance. But I knew something was wrong. One afternoon, I came home early from school and caught Trevor in my room. He was holding my tablet, scrolling through it like he owned the place. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed. Hey, kiddo, just checking this for viruses, he said with that fake smile. Your mom asked me to make sure you're staying safe online. My tongue practically exploded. The buzzing was so intense, I could barely think straight. He was lying through his teeth. My mom would never ask you to do that, I said. He shrugged. She worries about you. You know how moms are. More buzzing. I grabbed my tablet from him and told my mom everything when she got home. But Trevor had already spun some story about me being disrespectful and trying to cause problems in their relationship. Mom took his side. That's when I decided to set a trap. I left my town.

Mom, Dad. I got into Princeton, I shouted, holding the acceptance letter. My mother's heels clicked across our hardwood floors, but her face showed no excitement. Dad loosened his tie, looking uncomfortable. Sit down, Catherine. We need to talk. Your brother William's tech startup needs funding. Dad began his energy storage prototype could revolutionize the industry. That's great, but what about my college fund? The silence felt crushing. We've decided to use your college fund to support William's venture. It's what's best for the family. What? But that was my money you promised. Don't be selfish, Catherine, mom snapped. William's project could be worth millions. Can take student loans. William had always been their golden child, a college dropout bouncing from failed start up to start up. How much? I whispered. All of it. The full $289,000, nearly $300,000. Every birthday check, every summer job earning handed to William without thought. I stood so abruptly my chair toppled. Did you even ask me, Catherine? Elizabeth Montgomery, that is enough, dad boomed. This decision is final. If you can't support your family's interest, go to your room until you can discuss this rationally. 18 years old, sent to my room for objecting to having my future stolen. I walked upstairs, pulled out my backpack and packed clothes, laptop, documents from my drawer. I retrieved $200 from tutoring sessions. Through my window, I saw William's Tesla arriving to collect his hand out. I wrote two emails. Princeton, I must decline admission due to unexpected financial circumstances. My parents, you've made your choice. I'm making mine. Don't look for me. I climbed down the trellis and walked away with $200 straight A's and burning determination. Ten years later, I sat across from them in a boardroom, watching them pitch their failing company, not realizing their last hope was the daughter they dismissed. I built Elite Academic Consulting from tutoring. My first million came from teaching what my family refused to value. But tutoring was just the beginning. The breakthrough came when I fixed the exact energy storage technology William had failed to develop, making billions with Tentec solutions. Using shell companies, I'd acquired Montgomery Technology's debt. They needed 50 million dollars to survive. Miss Morgan, my father stood. Thank you for coming. I listened as they presented their situation. William's latest venture had drained their reserves. Your decline began 10 years ago, I said, displaying graphs coinciding with a 289 thousand dollar investment in unproven technology. That exact number hung in the air like an accusation. How did you know that William started. Tell me, Mr Montgomery, what was your biggest business mistake? Perhaps expanding too quickly? No. Your biggest mistake was thinking she would just fade away. Color drained from Mom's face. Dad's expression froze in recognition. Catherine. Hello, dad. This is impossible.

Mind creates vivid movie like stories during a car ride while listening to a favorite song, lying in bed, replaying old conversations with the perfect comeback or picturing a future argument just to feel prepared for it. While it can feel comforting in the moment, this form of daydreaming doesn't always heal the root cause. Instead, it offers temporary relief, a mental space where the story plays out perfectly, even if the waking world remains unchanged. For some, it's a way to experience the closure they never got. For others, it's a substitute for the excitement or intimacy that reality has not yet given. If this sounds like you, follow our page for more heartfelt videos.

So I placed him in the back row. When I was 12, my father told me he had always wanted a son. He said it casually over dinner, like he was discussing the weather. I remember sitting there with my fork frozen midair while my mother scolded him. But he just shrugged and added, boys carry the family name. Girls are just a liability. Those words carved themselves into me. From that day on, I knew where I stood in his world. Beneath the pedestal he reserved for the son he never had. Over the years, he never missed a chance to remind me. When I brought home straight A's, he said, imagine what a boy could have done with that brain. When I got a scholarship to college, he muttered, too bad you'll just waste it when you get married. And when I told him about my first job offer, he looked at me like I'd spoken nonsense. Daughter's success doesn't matter, he said. It's not like you'll be supporting this family. So when I got engaged, I didn't expect him to celebrate. But I wasn't prepared for the cruelty that followed. We were in the living room, my fiance beside me, his hand warm over mine. As I told my parents the news. My mom gasped, beaming, hugging me tightly. My father didn't move. He stared at me for a Long moment, then said flatly, don't look at me to walk you down the aisle. You're not the daughter I wanted. The silence afterward was suffocating. My fiance stiffened beside me, ready to speak, but I squeezed his hand. I wouldn't let my father steal another moment from me. Instead, I smiled, nodded, and excused myself from the room. But inside, I was burning. That night I called the one man who had quietly been my anchor all these years. My stepdad, Mark. He married my mom when I was sixteen, after my parents marriage finally collapsed under the weight of my father's bitterness. Mark was gentle where my father was harsh, steady where he was reckless. He never tried to replace my dad, but he was the one who proofread my college essays, showed me how to change a tire, and picked me up from the airport when I moved back home after school. When I asked him if he would walk me down the aisle, there was a pause on the phone. Then his voice broke. It would be the greatest honor of my life. From then on, I didn't think about my father. I poured myself into planning a wedding that reflected me and the man I loved. My father was invited, my mom insisted, and I didn't want to start a war. But I made no effort to include him. Beyond that, he didn't pay a cent, didn't offer any help, didn't ask a single question. For months I didn't hear a word from him. The day of the wedding came, and I felt radiant, wrapped in lace and love. As the music swelled and the doors opened, I looked to my right. There was Mark, standing tall in his suit, tears glistening in his eyes. He offered his arm, and I took it without hesitation. The guests rose, and together we walked toward my future. Halfway down the aisle I caught sight of my father in the back row. He was sitting

Mrs. Lambert walked into class with tears streaming down her face and slammed her coffee mug on the desk so hard it broke. If one of you can find the woman my husband is cheating on me with, I will give you an A+ for the semester and you can stop doing work. Just please help me catch her so I can deliver justice. Someone in the back raised their hand slowly and asked if that was really all they had to do. Missus Lambert nodded and laid out three rules. 1, we couldn't get caught snooping around. 2, we couldn't break into anyone's homes. 3, we could work in teams if we wanted. The bell rang right after and my best friend Kenji grabbed my arm and pulled me into the hallway. He said, I got a plan. This will be easy money. Trust me. Missus Lambert's husband was Coach Lambert, who taught gym and coached girls volleyball. Kenji figured he was probably sleeping with one of the volleyball players since he spent so much time with them after school. We decided to start our investigation. That afternoon during volleyball practice, snuck into the gym and hid behind the bleachers. With a clear view of the court, Coach Lambert was running drills and yelling at the girls to hustle. He seemed normal at first, but then we noticed he kept touching the team captain's shoulder when explaining plays. The practice Went on for an hour and nothing suspicious happened. We were about to give up when Coach Lambert called the captain Abriel into his office. She jogged over, bouncing her ponytail and followed him inside. Through the window, we could see her tying her hair up in a bun while he made sure no one was looking, then turned off the lights and pulled down the blinds, blocking our view completely. Kenji and I looked at each other, knowing she was giving him the gawk, gawk 3,000. He quietly left the gym and started heading back to Mrs. Lambert's classroom to claim our A+. We were practically running down the hallway when we heard footsteps behind us. Two kids from our class tackled us to the ground before we could react. They pinned us down while their teammate Jasmine sprinted ahead toward Mrs. Lambert's room. We struggled, but they were bigger and had caught us off guard. By the time we got free and made it to the classroom, Jasmine was already inside talking to the teacher. After Jasmine left, looking smug, I went into the classroom alone. Missus Lambert was sitting at her desk, crying harder than before. I told her what we'd seen with Coach Lambert and April in his office. She thanked me through her tears and said she suspected the volleyball team all along. But then I realized something off. I asked her, are you okay? Like actually okay. Missus Lambert looked up at me with Surprise. She actually smiled a little through her tears and said I was the first student to ask how she was feeling. I apologized for not asking sooner and told her that even though she was a tough teacher, she didn't deserve to be cheated on. She stood up and walked around her desk. Do you still want that a plus, she asked. I said, yeah, of course, because who wouldn't want a free grade? But then her expression changed to something I couldn't read. She explained that since I was the only student who showed concern for her well being, she wanted to give me a special choice. I could take the A+ for myself. But she'd tell every.

My mom smirked. Good to know, I said, pulled back the 6,500 dollar honeymoon fund, cancelled the flights and by morning had six, 7 missed calls plus one message that changed everything. It was a Tuesday when the text came through. Just three words, we all agreed. At first I wasn't sure what it meant, but my stomach already knew. A minute later, my phone buzzed again. This time it was a full sentence from my mom. We all agreed you're not welcome at the wedding. No punctuation, just that smug little dash she always used when she wanted to sound formal, like a smirk in text form. I reread it three times waiting for it to change. It didn't. My sister's wedding, the one I helped pay for, the one I planned half of because Sarah was too stressed to deal with florists and vendors, the one where I wired $1,500 for centerpieces that looked like Pinterest sneezed on a florist shop. I wasn't just invited. I've been the backbone, or so I thought. I didn't respond. Instead, I opened my laptop and logged into the travel portal. Two business class honeymoon tickets under my email, cancel, $3,800 refund. Then I wired $6,500 the Honeymoon Overflow fund I'd sent to mom back into my savings. I felt nothing, no anger, no sadness, just calm, like I'd finally exhaled after years of holding my breath. By eight seventeen PM, Sarah was Calling, then mom, then cousins, turn my phone face down. By morning, 23 missed calls, one voicemail from dad. You need to see this now. Dad doesn't meddle. He's quiet, deliberate. If he stepped in, it mattered. I called. He picked up on the second ring. Kyle, he said softly, they told everyone you chose not to come. I blinked. What? They said you backed out, that you were bitter. Your mom even told Sarah's in laws you threatened to ruin the wedding if you showed up. My laugh was sharp, humorous. So they exile me and then make it my decision. It's worse, dad said. They told people you refused to fund the honeymoon out of spite. I went still, I already did fund it. They don't care, he said quietly. Something cracked in me, not rage, not grief, clarity. That night, dad forwarded me screenshots. Mom, Sarah and aunts in a group chat. Don't worry about Kyle. He's just, it's bitter. No one's ever loved him enough to marry him. He's a ghost. Let him fade. No seat, no speech, no drama. I deleted the screenshots. I didn't need to read them twice. I already knew I wasn't family. I was furniture. So I started dismantling the house. I've been holding up Mom's phone plan, bended Sarah's Venmo unlinked from my bank. Auto payments on her student loan, cancelled every streaming account. Profiles deleted and the venue deposit still under my name. I cancelled it. By Thursday, the Polite email came through, your reservation has been terminated, deposit forfeited unless a new booking is secured. Let them explain that to 118 guests. Friday morning, I got an email from Linda, the groom's mom, formal direct.

My first month at my new job, this girl from my department promised me $1,000 if I could be her fiance for three months. I thought it was a prank. Renee was the girl in the office that made managers forget about their wives. I was the new guy who only spoke to people about code. But then she explained that her hated cousin's wedding was in 90 days and she needed someone tall and handsome so her family would stop pressuring her to find someone. What she conveniently forgot to mention is that the cousin getting married was Sasha, Sasha's cousin ex, who had left me for my best friend. We drew up an actual contract on my laptop right there. No kissing, hand holding, only when necessary. We'd break up a week after the wedding and we'd split any cash, gifts, 60, 40. Since she was paying me, she made me practice my boyfriend voice in the supply closet. You sound like you're reading a hostage note, she said. Fixing my collar. I had to practice calling her babe without cringing. Rehearse how we met until our story was bulletproof. She taught me her dad liked football and her mom would judge my shoes. The first time I met her parents, I said we met at a conference while she said coffee shop. Her mom's eyebrow raised exactly 1 millimeter, but her dad laughed and said, can't keep Your story straight must be true love. They grilled me for hours. I left with them believing I owned a ranch back in Canada. Renee made a show of kissing my cheek on the way out. Very theatrical, very fake. But then two weeks in, things started shifting suddenly. At work, we kept our distance, separate lunch breaks, minimal interaction. But he started bringing me coffee without asking. Just left it on my desk with a sticky note for the performance tonight, oat milk latte, extra shot, which I never told her. The family dinners were exhausting. At first, all performance, hand holding that felt like a business handshake, practiced smiles. But by the third dinner, I wasn't checking my watch anymore. Her dad and I actually talked football. Her mom taught me recipes while Renee watched with this unreadable expression. Family game night changed everything. When we destroyed her siblings at charades, her dad pulled me aside. I've never seen her this comfortable with someone. That night in the car, Renee was quiet. Sorry, she said suddenly, for what I asked. Just all of this, everything I'm putting you through. I thought she meant the fake relationship. Looking back, she was apologizing for what was coming. Our text conversations involved too. First, just logistics, dinner at 7, blue shirt. Then she'd text after family events, you did good tonight. Then random thoughts at midnight. Then you awake at 2:00am, followed by 40 messages about co workers, movies, anything. She Mentioned my idiot ex who fumbled. The best guy ever. And I tense up. Seriously? Who cheats on someone that amazing? She'd push, watching my reaction. Some people make mistakes, I'd mumble. And she'd look away, guilty about something I didn't understand. Yet one night at the office, both staying late, we finally acknowledged it. This is getting complicated, I said. It's just method acting, she insisted, but her hands were shaking. Renee, you brought me soup when I was sick last week. That wasn't for your family. She stood up, frustrated. So what if I care? We need to stick to the contract, said weakly, right? She agreed. But her nephew's birthday party was when pretending became impossible. I did Dinosaur voices to make him laugh. And when I looked up, Renee was staring at me like I'd solved world hunger. Other moms kept asking how long we've been together. And she'd get this soft look. The cake tasting was what broke us both. She started sobbing over chocolate versus vanilla, but I couldn't understand why. I held her in the parking lot.

My roommate Ben was obsessed with this Instagram model named Grace who worked at our local coffee shop. For three months. He'd go there daily, order expensive drinks and stare at her like a creep. He acted conversations in our dorm mirror but never spoke to her beyond medium latte, please. It was honestly painful to watch. This dude was spending his entire food budget on overpriced coffee just to be in the same room as this girl who probably didn't even know his name. One day, Ben discovered Grace was best friends with this bigger girl named Megan who also worked there. Ben came running back with is brilliant plan, bro. You need to ask Megan out, he said, pacing our tiny room like a maniac. If you date her friend, I'll have an automatic in with Grace. Girl code, wingman duties, double dates. It's perfect. I stared at him like he'd lost his mind. Dude, that's messed up. I'm not using some random girl just so you can get a date. But. And reminded me he'd been helping me pass calculus all semester. Without his tutoring, I'd probably fail and lose my scholarship. He also offered to cover utilities for two months. I felt absolutely terrible, but I was broke, broken, desperate. The next day I walked into that coffee shop with my stomach and knots. Megan was working the register and when she saw me approach She smiled this genuine, warm smile that immediately made me feel like garbage about what I was doing. Hey, you're Ben's friend, right? She said. Already starting to make my usual order. I'm Megan. I've actually noticed you guys coming in here a lot. My heart sank. She'd been paying attention to me and here I was about to manipulate her feelings for my roommate's benefit. But I was already committed. So I took a deep breath and asked, would you maybe wanna grab dinner sometime, just the two of us? Her entire face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? I mean, yes, I'd love that. I was actually hoping you'd ask. We exchanged numbers and I scheduled our date for that Friday night. I plan to suffer through one awkward dinner, get some Intel about Grace for Ben, and then politely fade away. Friday came and I picked Megan up from her apartment. She'd put on this beautiful blue dress and done her hair all nice and I felt like the big, this piece of trash on the planet. We went to this little Italian place near campus that had decent prices and dim lighting. But something unexpected happened during dinner. Megan started telling me about her veterinary medicine study is and her passion for animals was infectious. She volunteered at a local animal rescue and had these incredible stories about nursing sick puppies back to health and helping traumatize cats learn to trust humans again. Then she started Talking about her family, how she was the first person in her family to go to college, working two jobs to pay tuition while maintaining a 3.8 GPA. She was funny, too, making jokes about terrible customers at the coffee shop and doing spot on impressions of our professors. By the time dessert arrived, I had completely forgotten about.

She cheated on me and had a child with her lover. Your honor, my client does not wish to get divorced and is asking the court to mandate counseling. She believes the marriage is strong enough to overcome this issue with a little help. That was her lawyer speaking, her being Julie, my soon to be ex wife. If I had any say in it, dot, my lawyer, stood up. Your honor, a year long affair with multiple men resulting in the birth of a child is hardly just an issue, especially when DNA tests confirm the child is not my clients. We see no point in prolonging this farce of a marriage any further. Counseling won't change anything. It is precisely because of the child that I'm inclined to order counseling. The judge responded. A child needs a stable home to grow up in. If you think I'm going to raise that cheating woman's child, I interrupted loudly. Dot, my lawyer, cringed as the judge slammed his gavel. One more word and I will hold you in contempt of court, he shouted at me. I am ordering one month of counseling with two sessions per week. You will attend, Mr Stedman, or face consequences. He glared at me briefly, then hit the gavel again. That's all. Julie, my soon to be ex wife, had a smug look on her face as I walked into the counselor's office. I'm Dr Sullivan, but you can call me Gerald. May I call you Brian? He smiled at me. No, you may not. You will address me as Mr Steadman, I replied. Brian. There's no need, Julie began. And you don't speak to me at all, I snapped at her. I think we need to calm down, Dr Sullivan said. Please.

She Learned about Pride Month at school and decided our entire family needed to become LGBTQ+ advocates immediately. I'm not against it, I just wasn't prepared for how enthusiastically she'd embrace the cause. It started when Jenna asked if we could get a rainbow flag for our front yard to show we support love. I figured why not? It's a nice message. What I didn't expect was Jenna treating that flag like a sacred symbol that need did to be defended at all costs. Last week we were at McDonald's when Jenna noticed they had rainbow colored Happy Meal boxes for Pride Month. She was thrilled and insisted on ordering one, even though she usually gets chicken nuggets and this one came with a cheeseburger she doesn't like. Daddy, we have to support the gay cheeseburger! She announced loudly in the crowded restaurant. Every head in McDonald's turned to stare at us. I tried to quietly explain that the cheeseburger itself wasn't gay, but Jenna was already on a mission. Excuse me, she said to the teenage cashier. My daddy wants to buy all the rainbow Happy Meals to support the LGBTQ+ community. The cashier looked at me like I was either the most supportive parent ever or completely insane. Before I could answer, Jenna climbed onto a chair and addressed the entire restaurant. Everyone, my daddy is buying rainbow cheeseburgers for everyone because love is love wanted to disappear Into the floor. Half the restaurant was staring, and I was standing there holding my wallet, wondering how I'd become the accidental sponsor of McDonald's Pride. Celebrate, Jenna, Sweetie, let's just get one Happy Meal, I whispered. But daddy, what about Equality? You said we should support everyone. She had me there. I've been teaching her about treating everyone fairly, but I hadn't expected her to turn McDonald's into her personal activism platform. The situation got worse when an elderly man at the next table made a comment about all this rainbow nonsense. Jenna's superhero hearing kicked in immediately. Excuse me, sir, she said, marching over to his table with her rainbow Happy Meal box, but rainbows are beautiful and they represent love for all people, even grumpy people like you. The man looked shocked, and I rushed over to apologize, but Jenna wasn't done. My teacher says that some families have two mommies or two daddies, and that's perfectly normal. And some people are transgender, which means they were born in the wrong body, but now they get to be who they really are. She said all this while waving her rainbow Happy Meal box like a flag. And I swear the entire McDonald's had gone silent to listen to my eight year olds impromptu LGBTQ+ education seminar. The elderly man just stared at her, then at me.

Every school has one kid who thinks he's king of the hallways. At my little brother's school, that kid was Tyler. He wasn't the biggest, but he was wiry tall for his grade, and brag non stop about how he knew how to box. He strutted around like he was untouchable, always looking for someone smaller to push her, and my little brother became his favorite target. My brother's autistic. He's gentle, quiet, and takes everything people say to him at face value, which of course, made him easy prey for some like Tyler. At first it was little things slamming his locker shut while he was trying to get books out, shoving past him in the cafeteria line, dumping his pencil case on the floor and kicking the pens down the hall while everyone laughed. Then escalated. Tyler started waiting for him outside classrooms, mocking the way he talked, mimicking him in front of groups of kids. He once unzipped my brother's backpack and flipped it upside down, spilling everything into a puddle of juice on the floor. Teachers saw it. They sighed and told my brother to just ignore him. When he finally worked up courage to tell them how bad it was, they brushed it off as boys being boys. But I saw the bruises when he came home, his sleeves rolled up. I'd noticed faint marks along his arms. He shrugged when I asked, just Rough housing, he'd mumble. But I knew his mood changed, too. The kid who used to talk my ear off about his favorite cartoons wouldn't even leave his room. He didn't want to go to school anymore. He'd lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, silent. That was the moment I snapped. The school wasn't going to protect him. I would. So the next morning, I walked him to school. I wasn't a student there anymore, but I didn't care. I was going to wait in those halls and make sure Tyler thought twice about laying a hand on my brother again. My plan was simple. The moment Tyler showed his face, I'd step in. If it came to a fight, so be it. We made it to his locker. He was tense, fumbling with the combination. And then I saw him. Tyler. Swaggering down the hallway with that smug grin, heading straight for us. My fists clenched, I stepped forward. But before I could do anything, my brother did. The second Tyler got close and reached for his locker, my brother turned, drew his leg back, and kicked him square in the nuts. Hard. The sound Tyler made wasn't human. He collapsed instantly, hands between his legs, writhing on the floor. The hallway erupted in laughter. Kids doubled over, howling. Some even clapped. Phones came out, recording every second of it. My brother just stood there, breathing heavy, staring down at the kid who made his life miserable for The first time in months I saw fire in his eyes. He didn't need me to fight for him. He taken his revenge.

I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called Fam Real instead of just Mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members. Mom, dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth. Everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu, and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. Emma had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day, and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus she always has her headphones in anyway. My birthday dinner. The one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations. I thought we had a good time. Apparently, they spent the whole night annoyed with me. I found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. I asked where everyone was. They told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses. Everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No.. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbor kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin. Dad wrote, sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied, we'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very beginning of The chat. It's started eight months ago, right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied. Best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly closed the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie. How was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were canceled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all acting.

A 13 year old offered me his entire savings just to come to his birthday party, saying you don't have to bring a present or anything. No one else is going anyway. He shoved a piece of paper at me and started backing away. It was a handmade invitation with crayon borders and his name written carefully in the middle, Joshua turning 13. I ruffled up his hair and smiled. I'll be there, kid. His eyes lit up and his lips formed the biggest grin. It's on Saturday. I'll save you some cake, he shouted before running off excitedly towards his parents in one of the grocery aisles yelling, I got one, I got one. I looked back at the invitation in my hand feeling my heartbreak, remembering him say no one else is going. After work. I drove by Joshua's address that night and saw one sad balloon tied to the mailbox and I knew I couldn't just leave things like this. I mentioned the party to my family over dinner and they all got the Joshua look on their faces. We're going, my sister said immediately. Even my parents nodded. I texted a few friends too. That's when things got out of hand. My friend posted in our town Facebook group while I was asleep, this kid is turning 13 on Saturday and literally no one is coming to his party. Anyone free 2 To 4, I woke up to my phone buzzing non stop. Someone had made a group chat called Joshua's Birthday Squad and it already had 47 people already excited for the surprise. Guys, my daughter's using her allowance to buy him a present. Who's bringing balloons? I'll get the cake. Even the local pizza place owner was there offering 10 free boxes on the house. The high school football team was arguing about who got to carry in the cake and a retired magician offered to give the best show in town. People were tagging their friends, their neighbours, their co workers. Get everyone, someone wrote. I sat there stare.

I cried when the garage door opened, because that's when I knew what my dad would do to my baby brother. Inside the garage, he kept his tools hanging on the wall like a display. Leather belts arranged by thickness, extension cords wrapped perfectly. And a wooden paddle he'd made, still stained with red and brown spots. But the worst thing in that garage wasn't the tools. My father had one rule that neither of us dared to break. His one rule was that nobody was allowed to touch the metal chest in the corner. It sat in a corner of the garage for years, never moved, with actual cobwebs on it. But when I was eight and Joel was six, dad caught us looking at the chest. We weren't even touching it, just standing near it, wondering what was inside. His face turned purple, and he grabbed the thickest belt from the wall. You think rules don't apply to you? He screamed, and we tried to run away, but he locked us in. The beating lasted 20 minutes and left bruises that we had to hide from school and our friends so they didn't call CPS. After that, we stayed far away from the chest. But I couldn't stop thinking about it. What was so important that he'd rage like an ape just because we looked at it? Joel thought it had body parts in it, which gave him nightmares for months. The discipline sessions got worse as we got older. If we got anything below a B on our report cards, it meant an hour of screaming in the garage. If we talked back or forgot a chore, the tools came out. Just to make sure we really Learned our lesson, our dad would spray scrubbing bubbles on the wound so they'd

Hi. Um, this is gonna sound really strange. Um, we don't know each other, but I was out running and I found somebody's phone, and I'm trying to track down who it belongs to. And so I was, I just started calling people in this phone, and I wanted to make sure whoever lost it gets their phone back. Okay, so I called you because whoever's phone this is just texted you a couple days ago. So basically, I called you cause I was hoping maybe you could help me find them. Oh, I got you. Um, well, the number you're calling from doesn't come up as one of my contacts, so I'm not really sure whose phone you have. Right, well, no, I, I, I'm not calling from the actual phone because I didn't want to use up their minutes or anything. So can I, can I just read you a text real quick, and then maybe you can look through your text conversations and tell me who sent it to you? Um, sure. Okay. Uh, hang on a second. Okay. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so, um, they sent you a message a few days ago, whoever this is, that said, um, that's fine, but I'm paying next time. You earned it. And then it has a heart and a winky face, so I assume maybe it was your wife or your girlfriend or something, cause that's, that's, that's why I called you. Well, it's not my wife. Cause I'm not married. But, yeah, I, I know whose phone that is. Oh, okay, great. Um, is there any way you could possibly give me their name so I can look up their address to kind of return their phone to them? I'm not really comfortable giving out her information. Um, maybe you could just turn it into the cops or something, and I can get a hold of her and let her know they have it. Okay, I gotcha. I didn't think about the fact that, like, trying to track down a woman I've never met is kind of creepy. No, no, it's cool. I, I mean, it's, it's nice that you're doing the right thing. I just don't think she'd want me giving out her personal info like that. I, I understand. Um, one more thing, though. Um, why does this phone number come up as Chris when it calls you? I'm sorry, what? When this phone that I found, when it calls you or text you, why does it come up as Chris? You just said this was a woman's phone. How. How do you know that? How do I know it's a woman's phone? You just told me it

Hi, everyone. I'm Sarah Miller and my daughter Tiffany just transferred here today. The chat lit up with a string of welcomes and hellos. Just as I was about to type out my own greeting, a huge block of text appeared. Important notice from Tiffany's mom. Girls in the class, please take note. Starting next week, I'll be posting a picture of what my daughter is wearing each day. Please make sure your child doesn't wear the same thing. Also, I request that everyone please switch to the same brand of laundry detergent we use. My daughter has a very sensitive nose and can't tolerate other scents. Finally, my daughter was a C section baby and is a bit timid. So I ask you to tell your children not to bully her and make sure she's always treated with priority. Wow. I couldn't help but think this isn't just a new student. This is a royal princess who's slumming it with us commoners. Some of the moms in the chat were quick to push back. Karen's mom, are you serious? What my kid wears is none of your business. Why should we have to cater to you? Jessica's mom, exactly. And we're supposed to all use your detergent? My son has allergies, too, and we use specific stuff. Yeah. Who made your kid the queen of the class? My kid is special, too. The chat Quickly devolved into a debate. Usually I just chuckled at the ridiculous things these parents said in the group chat. The class teacher was the administrator and she'd usually step in to calm things down. I didn't see a problem, so I just muted the chat to get some work done. And I got a DM. It was from Alyssa, whose daughter Emily was friends with Lily. Hey, Sarah, you got a.

It's adorable, right? Adorable? It says Baby Agatha in bold letters, like it's already decided. I didn't even get a vote. Well, yeah, it's tradition. Every first born girl in my family is named Agatha. You know this and you know that tradition ends here. I'm not naming our baby after a Dickens character. Dickens character? That's so unfair. Agatha is timeless, classic, strong, timeless. It's 2020. Four, Luke, not 1824. She's not a Victorian ghost haunting a candlelit mansion. You're being ridiculous. My mom and grandma are so excited. You're going to break their hearts. Oh, and my heart doesn't matter? I'm the one carrying her for nine months. I've earned veto Power. Veto power? This is a team decision, and the team says, Agatha, case closed. Oh, now it's a team decision when you've already handed out Agatha onesies like they're political flyers? Look, it's just a name. You're turning this into a whole thing for no reason. It's not just a name. It. It's her identity. You want her to start life as a hand me down? She deserves something unique. Unique like what? Luna or Rainbow? We're not naming her after a unicorn. I suggested Ayla. Ayla. That's normal. But no, your family called it disrespectful to their legacy. Because it is. Agatha goes back four generations. That's history. You can't just erase that history. You don't even use your family name. You go by your Middle name? Because you hate being called Horus. That's different. Horus is. Well, Horus. Agatha is beautiful. My mom will lose it if we don't use Agatha. She's already knitting matching hats for the Agatha legacy. Great. She can keep them for her Victorian cosplay group. I'll send them some tea biscuits. This isn't funny. Can't you just compromise? Let's do Agatha as her first name and something modern as the middle name. Compromise? Sure. Aila as her first name, Agatha as the middle. They're solved. That's not compromise. That's just you winning. And naming her Agatha isn't you winning? What's next? You naming our future dog Horace Jr? You're impossible. Fine. Let's talk about this more later. But no Moonbeam, okay? Ever. Deal. But only if you admit that horse and Agatha sound like a haunted couple in a Scooby Doo episode. Fine. But you're still not off the hook. Bring it on, horse.

Womp, womp. What do you mean, womp, womp? You don't even care. She was your girlfriend for two years, Justin. She loved you for two years. Listen, Tammy, this is not my problem. She overreacted and did something irrational. That's on her, not me. Justin, you literally broke her heart. How could you after the two years of her being there for you? When big sis Jessica passed away, that hurt us bad. And she was there for you, making sure you were okay. When you couldn't take me to school because you were too sad to get out of the bed, Emma came to take me. She would always take care of me, like how our big sister would before she passed. She would always buy me food, pack my lunch, and would even come over to watch me and take care of me when nobody was home. She would stay home with me just to play Barbies with me, to make sure I wasn't scared being alone. She was the best girlfriend you ever had. She was the sister I needed after big sis passed away. And now you're the reason why Emma is gone. Because you were selfish and cheated. I don't have time to read a lot. Go cry to someone else. Leave me be. One day you will see. You lost the best thing you had. Stop talking to me, mom. I still can't believe she's gone. I couldn't stop Crying after seeing her in the casket. I know, baby. It broke all of our hearts.

Sadly, I can't do anything since he's a 20 year old man. Mommy, I really think this is my fault. If I would have just shut my mouth, Emma would still be here. But I decided to be a loud mouth. This is all because of me. Baby. No, you did the right thing. Don't ever feel bad about doing the right thing. Yeah. Mommy, could you at least take me to see Emma again? I miss her so much. I want to play Barbies with her. I wish I could, Tammy, but I'm so tired and I have work tomorrow. Auntie, can you send me a rizz app line so mommy can take me? This will for sure make mommy smile.

I do have enough energy for one more Trip, meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my Barbies! I'm bringing my new Barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play Barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play Barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby. I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But, Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister. I looked over the entire house, and she's not here. And that's my problem. How? Oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait, how would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin?

My parents weren't like abusive or anything, but they were super strict. I'm talking no social media, no hanging out with friends on school nights, and my phone had to be turned in at nine PM every night. Literally medieval torture for a teenage girl. The final straw came after this huge fight about my grades. I've been struggling in math, always hated it, still do tbh and got a D on my report card. My parents flipped. They took my phone for a month, banned me from seeing my friends, and made me spend weekends doing extra math worksheets instead of anything fun. I was texting with my best friend Charlotte at school about how unfair it was and she was like just come stay with me for a few days, my parents won't care. Her family was mad chill compared to mine. Her mom let her have boys in her room with the door closed. I was jealous AF so I decided to run away. Now I wasn't completely stupid. I knew I couldn't just disappear forever. I was thinking like a 3 4 day protest to show my parents they were being unreasonable. Maybe they'd realise how much they missed me and stop being so strict. I packed a backpack with like the Absolute Essentials. Three t shirts, my favourite hoodie, a pair of jeans, some underwear, my school makeup bag, and like $43 I'd saved from Birthday money. I also took this silver necklace my grandma gave me that I thought I could maybe sell if I needed more cash. Teen logic lol. I waited until everyone was asleep, probably around 1:00am. Our house had this super creepy wooden hallway, I literally practiced walking through it for weeks before I ran away, finding exactly where to step to avoid making noise. I felt like a ninja that night, swear to god. The plan was to walk to this 24 hour convenience store about a mile away and call Charlotte to come get me. But here's where everything went sideways. Charlotte's phone was dead. Like completely off. No response. I tried calling her house phone. Yes, they still had one, but her dad answered and I panicked and hung up. So there I was, sitting outside the 7 11 at 2:00am, no ride, and starting to low key freak out. The guy working inside kept giving me weird looks through the window. I was just sitting on the curb trying to figure out what to do when this red sedan pulls up. There were two guys and a girl, probably college age. The girl rolled down her window and asked if I was okay. I must have looked pathetic AF because she immediately offered me a ride. Her name was Melissa and she seems super nice, telling me they were coming back from a party and could drop me somewhere. Now I know this sounds dumb Don't get in cars with strangers and all that. But teenage me was desperate. It was getting cold, and I figured having a girl there made it safer. Plus, Melissa had this really gentle voice and kept saying she just wanted to help. I told them I needed to get to Charlotte's house, but didn't have her exact address. Another brilliant part of my plan. The guys were talking quietly in the front seat while Melissa kept asking me questions. How old I was, why I was out so late, if my parents knew where I was. I started noticing we weren't going towards Charlotte's neighborhood at all. We were heading towards the highway when I pointed this out. The guy driving, Steve, I think, said they needed to make a quick stop first. That's when the alarm bells really started going off in my head. Melissa kept trying to keep me calm, saying they just needed to drop something off with a friend, and then they'd help me find Charlotte's house. But then the other guy, Benjamin

I even bought you a yellow nighty, and it was your color when I saw it in the window. I was gonna surprise you, but now you throw it. I bought that weeks ago. How are you still on the phone with them? Do they have a room or don't they? Here, let me talk to them. I'll put you on hold. I'm on hold. I'm on hold. That's right. Tell me you have baby with him. Let him believe that. I've got three Catherine and Morrises in the greater Los Angeles area. She's a new mother. Probably going to be. Catherine and Morris of Burbank, 2018 red Buick Regal. Be advised, in progress of deduction. Believed to be traveling in a 2018 red Buick Regal. She's married to a Daniel Brian Morris. He's got two felony assault charges on his record. Catherine, I know you're afraid right now, but I'm right here with you. Just drive to the hotel. The police will be waiting there to arrest him. You and your baby Are gonna be just fine. Catherine, can you hear me? Are you there? Can. Can you talk? I think Catherine's had enough talking for today. Daniel, you need to pull the car over right now.

And you're telling me this because? Might not make it home. Whatever. Wait, what do you mean? Aren't you gonna ask what I'm up to? Why I'm not coming home? What's there to ask? You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay? No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do, could I stop you? Anyway, it's your call. You've changed so much. Feel like I barely know you lately. The old you would have made me come home no matter how late. Can I ask you something, too? Did the old me annoy you? If we're both gonna be miserable, might as well let you have your fun. Babe, I love you. Don't worry. I won't nag you to come home anymore. No more overthinking, either. If you drink too much, crash at your buddies. I get it now. No more micromanaging you or fighting over little things. Babe, I'm touched you feel this way. I'll love you more and more. Hmm. Have a good time with your friends. Hey. We'll do. Babe. Just got off work. You didn't forget what day it is, right? It's my birthday. Going out with Co workers. Wanna join? I'll pass. Don't know your work friends would be awkward. Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Love you. You sure you won't come? I'm sure. Alright. Did you get me a birthday gift? Nope. You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how We were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while.

I want y'all to remember these faces, because these was the motherfuckers that had a bunker in Alabama filled with kids. At least six kids aged from 3 to 10 years old was taken to this bunker and drugged. And investigators say that there are multiple suspects accused of paying to sexually abuse these children. Now, allegedly, they claim that the kids was being held down here against their will. Like, I really hope they throw the book at these motherfuckers. Three of the four suspects are being held on multiple counts of first degree rape. Multiple accounts of first degree human trafficking. Two out of the four gentlemen are being held on multiple counts against kidnapping. I really hope they throw the book at these motherfuckers. Now, under Alabama law, any suspect that is convicted of having a case with a minor 6 years or younger is automatically life in prison. Like, seriously, how could some motherfuckers do some shit like this?

Henry was once a billionaire, but became permanently paralyzed after a skydiving accident. He can only move his head. He decided to hire a caregiver. Many talented people came for the job. Some graduated from prestigious schools, some were very experienced. But Henry didn't like any of them. Instead, he chose David, a street thug. David actually knew nothing about caring. He had even been in prison for fighting. He came for the interview right after being released, just to get a rejection letter so he could apply for government welfare. But Henry took a liking to him immediately. He offered David a one month trial period, letting him think it over. David showed up the next day, as promised. He planned to just get the rejection letter and leave, but the housekeeper showed him around the entire villa, finally showing him a carefully prepared room. David wasn't initially interested in the job. When he entered the bathroom, he realised this was VIP treatment. David gladly accepted the job.

I met her for the first time yesterday. And she told you she was raped? Well, I blurted it out. Said she was 15, passed out at a party. She was five months pregnant before she knew. That's rape, right? It is if she didn't consent. Do you know if she reported that? She didn't even tell her parents. She said. I mean, it must have been so hard for her. I just wanna do something. Okay, well, we can talk to her. She said she doesn't remember anything. And I don't think she really wants to, but she should. She seemed hurt, drank a lot. Maybe you can help her.

An alleged rape from 2,003, and the victim won't talk? We've left messages, but her daughter may have been conceived from the sexual assault. Which makes her a victim, too. Theoretically. But that's semantic. She wasn't the one who was raped. Have you ran her DNA for a paternal match? We did nothing. Cowards. Anyway, you can indict the paternal DNA from Ashley's sample? Actually, no. We need the alleged rapist DNA. Even then, I can't get an unsubstantiated John Doe indictment. So you want her to remember the details of a sexual assault that she's been trying to forget for the past 18 years? Unfortunately, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.

That's a long time to go along with being sick. I'm positive that this is what we're looking at, Ben. Multiple diagnoses from a dozen doctors that we know of. From six different states, 50 different medications, at least 10 surgeries. Aren't these doctors to blame? No, because the mother is a very smart liar. Master manipulator. From one doctor to the next. She says that they've lost the records, so she fills in the blanks herself. these doctors have no reason not to believe what she's been telling. Don has been medicated Marielle. She's been making her own daughter sick. And she knows how to do it. She's. She's been getting drugs from online or off the streets.

We drank water straight from the bacteria infested fountains in the hallway. In gym class, we had to climb a 3 foot high rope with nothing but a thin mat to break our fall. We used the library's card catalog to do research because there was no Google at the start of the school year. We spent hours wrapping our textbooks with brown paper bags. How many of you have been punished by a teacher like this? We had classes in cramped, portable classrooms that were sweltering hot in the summer. We walked miles to school uphill both ways. Those pencil sharpeners that were always too close to the wall and when you sharpened your pencil, your knuckles would hit the wall. We still use pencils even when they looked like that. How did we send secret messages at school? By passing notes. School attendance registers. I'm guessing it's all digital now. There was no school provided lunch, so we had to bring our own. We Learned about centripetal force the hard way on the rusty old merry go round in the school playground. We Learned cursive handwriting. What about you? What did you experience?

Rogando por ayuda, un demonio le entreg√≥ una flauta de bamb√∫ verde y le dijo que tocarla podr√≠a someter al le√≥n, aunque a costa de su propia vitalidad, el hombre acept√≥ su deber. Sopl√≥ un solo aliento en la flauta. Cay√≥ exhausto, pero funcion√≥. El le√≥n qued√≥ inmovilizado. Perdiendo su fuerza. El hombre jur√≥ que, pase lo que pase, proteger√≠a a su esposa

I never texted him. He's a good student. There was never any need for tutoring. Tutoring, is that what you're calling it? I was looking out for those kids. Yeah, the supply closet. Jordan and Travis come from dysfunctional homes. There were abuse issues. I helped them through it. Again, let's focus on Zach quickly. Okay. My client was set up by someone and we know who. Hold on. You know who Zack's with and you've waited all this time to tell us. Let's not waste any more of it with recriminations. Miss Burnett, Jordan came to me a month ago upset. He's having a hard time performing. He's feeling inadequate. I reassured him that he wasn't, but he told me that he already talked about it with Donald Baineski, his wrestling coach. This coach Baineski, knew about you and Jordan. So you see, Miss Burnap is a victim here, too. A victim. Those photos were personal. Vizinski used them. It was without my permission. Use them how to lure Zack to him. He is the wrestling coach. You hear a lot of rumors about those guys. Yeah. Okay. I showed Coach Basinsky the sex in the photos. He said he put an end to it. He didn't want you to go to the principal or the police. He said the press could catch wind to that. I could lose my shot at a college scholarship. Did you just show him the photos or did you. Give them to him. I airdrop them. He said he needed the proof. Give us a minute, Jordan. I don't know what this is about, but coach, he's a good guy. He always has time for you no matter what. Jordan gave the coach the picks and he used them to catfish his act. He's our man. Okay. So Miss Burnup is telling the truth, which means there are two predators at the same school. It happens, I'm assuming. No luck reaching coach. The cell phone went straight to voicemail. Tara can't trace it. Well, for what it's worth, Donald Basinski's got a stellar resume. He's been a Riverwalk for 12 years. She's five time coach of the year. And if he's a predator, this kid has no idea because predators know who to pick on. Where does this coach live? Floral Park. Go now. NYPD. Two plates, two beers. They were here. Kitchen's clear. Basement. I'm going down. I got pictures of kids over here. All these boys. Who are they? What the hell happened to them?

Frankie's gotten worse. She's lightheaded and really short of breath. I did an X ray. No, John, it's just the flu. Look around. Everybody has it. You should have stayed home. Now link is gonna get it. Honey, she was coughing up pink stuff. Your husband made the right call. It is more than just flu, I'm afraid. Francesca has cardiomyopathy. What? That's what Ivy has, Doctor Hutch. She went into complete heart block and lost her pulse. Remove the oxygen mask and move her to the emergency pacer on her now, right away, Doctor. The real emotional bombshell comes when Nat reveals the disorder is genetic and passed from mother. Ivy's transplant went very well. She's doing great. We'll monitor her and you can see her as soon as she wakes up. And Francesca's heart's been stabilized for now, but we are gonna need to implant a pacemaker as soon as possible. And she has cardiomyopathy. That's what the test show. Just like her sister. How did both of them get this? It could be a number of things, viral, genetic, environmental, like there's something in our house making them sick, mold, or we can't go home. Ivy just got a new heart. And link, I suggest we start with a family medical history. We'll see if there's any pattern of heart disease in the family, particularly in younger relatives. How soon can We start, what are the odds dealing with two cardiac myopathies on the same day? I know and you think you're a trial patient to think about, but Ross can handle it. No, I'm saying what are the odds presenting at the same age in two sisters? It's weird, isn't it? Really weird. Tell you what you do. The girls pacemaker stat. I'll look into the family history and we'll figure it out. Francesca's pacemaker is functioning well. And I reviewed Ivy's post op Echo and saw no signs of graft failure. Now the bad news, unfortunately, the biopsy did not show a viral cause. So what's causing this? We'd like to run more tests, maybe even have someone evaluate your home for other exposures. We have no idea. We don't know what's causing their hearts to fail. But the good news is we caught it and we're treating it.

I'm just keeping it real. You're impossible. These are the most complex brain scans you will ever see. As you will see, these women share brain matter. Separating them is made even more complicated by the fact that there is one shared sagittal sinus to fine blood to the brain. First, we need to determine which lucky twin gets to keep that. And the other twin gets a graft. Dr. Crane, Dr. Weber will harvest the saphenous vein, which will be used as the new sagittal sinus. Meanwhile, Dr. Torres will be making a mold of the cranial bone flap, so then we'll be able to replace the missing part. Of the skull, which we will cover with a flap for now, but I'll play skin expanders, so we'll be able to fully cover the entire defect. We need to move quickly and meticulously to turn one brain into two. With the least amount of deficit. If this surgery scares you, if you're not up to the challenge, let me know. I need everybody confident in there. Get ready.

It might seem nuts, but high heels actually make up for her physical shortcomings. On one hand, her flat feet fit perfectly into high heels. Cynthia Irrivo especially likes the striptes heels produced by pleaser. She felt very comfortable wearing these high heels. She also likes Christian Louboutin high heels. During the interview, she even lifted her feet to show off her signature red soles. On the other hand, high heels can make up for her lack of height. Cynthia Arrivo was only 5 feet tall and used to hold her head high when talking to others. After putting on high heels, she enjoyed the feeling of looking straight at others or looking down on them. It must be mentioned that it took Cynthia Arrevo a month to perfectly adapt to high heels. She even developed strong leg muscles. As a result, she can handle even these white high heels. She can even stand on one leg, defying gravity.

The first Apple II computer went on sale, marking a major step in the home computing revolution. Jimmy Carter was sworn in as the 39th U S. President, famously known for his inauguration prayer. Gas was around 62 cents a gallon, and the average salary was $13,600 per year. You could buy a brand new car for under $4,000. Star Wars Episode 4, A New Hope, was released that year, and kids were obsessed with Star Wars, action figures, Simon electronic game, and Atari Pong. Tragically, Elvis Presley died at age 42, sparking national mourning and tributes across the country. Saturday Night Fever hit theaters, launching the disco craze into overdrive with the Bee Gees soundtrack. Families gathered to watch TV on big box sets with antennas, no remote. The U S. Department of energy was created as oil and energy became national concerns. Three's Company and The Love Boat debuted, pushing the envelope for sitcoms with its innuendo and farce. The Dallas Cowboys beat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 11. And there you have it. 1977 wasn't just a year. It transcended music and pop culture. Would you like to go back?

My wife and I were planning to have a baby, but during a pre pregnancy check, she was diagnosed with cancer and now needs regular injections of an extremely expensive drug. When I went to pay, I was told my health insurance had already hit its limit, so I had no choice but to put the charges on my credit card. I called the insurance company for answers, but they pushed the blame back on me with endless excuses. And my wife heard everything. That night, I woke to the sound of her crying. She felt she was dragging me down and didn't want me buried in debt, but I told her not to worry. I still had a $100,000 retirement payout, all invested years ago in a safe fund, and if I cashed it out, we could make it through this. I finally met with my fund broker, but he sat down and told me the fund I bought had been wiped out by the subprime crisis. I demanded my money back, but he just said, I understand. Hey, I feel your pain, I do. I lost a lot of money too. But that's how investment works, man. I'm sorry. It gives and it takes away. Soon after, an email arrived telling me that investment not only cost me everything, but left me owing the bank $60,000. I went to A lawyer to fight for my money. He said he could help, but wanted $10,000 up front, which I didn't have. A close brother heard what happened and lent me the $10,000, so I went back to the lawyer with hope. He gave me two options admit I lost, give up my claim and settle quickly to avoid paying the $60,000, or join a class action and take the financial company to court, maybe recover my $100,000. But it could take years. I decided to consult the prosecutor before making a choice. But when I arrived at the office, the prosecutor walked right past me, and the secretary said he was too busy to meet. I resolved to settle instead, but no matter how many times I called, the lawyer never picked up again. Meanwhile, my wife sank deeper into guilt. She tidied the room, took one last look at the sunlight outside, left our treasured wedding ring on a note for me, and then press the blade of a fruit knife against her wrist.

I made the appointment with the receptionist on the phone, but by the time I got there, she must have gone home. So what happened? Well, he was just really nice at first. He was professional, and I. I gave him, you know, my history. I'm an only child. My father left when I was a kid, and I just miss my mom so much that I started to cry. And that's when Doctor Hensley came and sat on the couch next to me, and he asked if he could give me a hug. He said that it was normal. It's not. He gave me a hug, and he stroked my hair. And I knew that it was inappropriate, but I was too afraid to challenge him. And that's when he. He pushed me back. He put his hand up my skirt. He pulled down my underwear. And that is when I told him to stop. But he didn't listen. He just forced himself inside of me. And I lay there like a rag doll while he finished.

She had no idea a stranger had slipped into her home. The man held a knife and moved slowly toward the bathroom. Then he realized she was blind. She could not see him at all. To test his suspicion, he pushed the towel. As she opened the door, she grabbed it and wrapped it around herself. Now he was certain she saw nothing. After changing clothes, the woman carried her cat to the kitchen. She still noticed nothing. Her husband was already lying on the floor, silent forever. She kept preparing dinner for him like always. When she reached into the cabinet for a plate, her foot slipped on some liquid. She panicked and touched the floor with her hand. Her heartbeat spiked. Is that water? Her fingers moved upward. She touched a cold body. It was her husband. She froze in shock. Fear rushed to her. She had no idea what had happened in her home. Terrified, she turned and ran. But only a few steps later, the intruder blocked her way. Only then did she realize danger was inside. She trembled as she spoke. The man gave no answer. He kept tossing things near her feet. He watched her panic, enjoying this cruel game. But he did not know she knew every inch of the house. She gritted her teeth and ran back to her room. By memory, with a bang, she locked the door. Open the door. Open the Door. Sarah. Her fingers found the laptop fast. She unlocked it with her voice. Start menu, menu. Open the goddamn door. Open email. Desperate to send for help. But that move enraged the intruder. He rushed toward the balcony window, ready to break in. Call the police. Man is.

Doesn't seem like a needle phobia. Did she have any idea when she came in her emergency contact info? No. What are you thinking? Well, she's extremely fearful, but also she, she repeats her backstory like she's on some kind of robotic tape loop. What do you mean? Look, she doesn't spend a lot of time outside. Clearly, she could have been abducted maybe or she could have just been in quarantine and scared of hospitals. No, you could be right. But I really do think we should look into it. Okay, do what you can, but she wants to leave. So as soon as her back runs, I gotta let her go. Ethan, you're talking about getting PD down here, interviewing her, you know, checking out her story. Then we could take a picture, have them run it through the missing person's registry. It's not ethical to take a picture of her without her consent. I'll figure it out. But if taking a picture could save this woman's life, that's what I'm gonna do. Any luck, PD ran Lisa's photo and they didn't get a match. I mean, it is possible it never got reported, which happens more than you think. What I don't get is if she was being held captive, why would they let her come here alone? Well, her captor might believe that she's been so well conditioned that she just come right back like very much. Let me think. About it. If your only reality is what the people who are controlling you say it is, you know, you wouldn't dream defying it. Lisa's IV is finished and she's asking to leave Ethan. She might be in trouble. We can't just send her back out there. Did PD make an ID? She's not in the system and I can't leave her here, buddy. I gotta tell you, I just, my gut's telling me that's not the right move yet. Can I go now? We are done with your medical treatment. But the hospital is a safe place and it's our job to protect you. Which means that if you are feeling harmed or. I want to leave, Lisa, if anybody is holding you against your will, just let me go. Okay? You should just charge paperwork. Just sign at the bottom. What do I do with this? Why don't you, um, why don't you last print that out for you? Okay. Be right back.

At that moment, the CEO was just about to come downstairs. He knew he probably shouldn't interfere, but his strong sense of responsibility kicked in before the CEO reached the bottom of the stairs. He went down to find the driver and said, I saw you drinking. For everyone's safety, you should tell the CEO you can't drive today. He phrased it in a way that gave the driver an easy out. After dropping off the CEO, the driver hesitated, meeting the old man's almost warning gaze, and ended up calling in sick due to feeling unwell. Naturally, the old man became the CEO's temporary driver. Not long after, he safely delivered the CEO to his destination. Before leaving, the CEO casually mentioned feeling a bit hungry. But the old man remembered that small detail. While waiting, he took the time to grab a packed lunch from a nearby restaurant. It's hard to imagine that this quiet, meticulous man had once been a battle hardened CEO of a publicly traded company. So why was he working here now? Just because he'd seen a job ad? His wife had passed away years ago, and his children were all living their own lives. His days were peaceful, but monotonous. And that monotony left him feeling empty. It seemed life was winding down. Until one day he noticed A company recruiting senior interns right on the street. He dressed carefully and made a job application video exactly according to their instructions. On the interview day, he walked in full of confidence. Not because he thought he was better than anyone, but because there weren't many older applicants. In fact, one even had an oxygen tank. In that environment, he felt he might actually have an advantage. Before retiring, he had been the CEO of a printing company and had spent 40 years climbing the corporate ladder. A truly remarkable career. During the interview, his extensive experience made the young interviewers look almost inexperienced. And just like that, the 70 year old veteran got the position. And in turn, just as he wanted. That night he went to bed full of joy and anticipation. To make sure he got up on time for his first day, he set two alarms, carefully picked out a sharp suit and top quality leather shoes, and brought along his trusted briefcase that had been with him for decades. His excitement to go to work had reached its peak.

I'll admit that one was. that one was kind of common sense. I should have thought of that. you want something harder? how about steel toe boots? that's pretty hard. okay, some of these guys around here, I catch them every single week not wearing their steel toe boots. and if that one's too easy for you, how about you throw in high viz vest while you're at it? cause I've never seen another vest here other than mine. balls in your court.

I've already got steel toes on. I use them predominantly as a hammer or to kick things that piss me off, but regardless, I have them on either way. the vest, not so much. yeah. yeah, I.

He said the charges were gonna be dismissed. You are looking at 10 years in jail. Have you considered a plea? No, because I'm innocent. Someone stole my car and hit that girl. Okay. I was home alone the whole night. I swear I totally believe you. The thing is, I don't know if I believe you. Well, then we appreciate your candor, but we're done here. No, no, wait.

Pork, chicken, fish, insects. Probably picked up that tapeworm somewhere in that smorgasbord. Perhaps. Although tapeworms only take two months to reach adult size, so it's possible that you were infected more recently. Same thing goes for the H. Pylori bacteria that caused your ulcer. Could happen any time, any place. So that you aren't connected? Not medically. But tapeworms can go undetected for years. So if you hadn't developed an ulcer which required surgery, then who knows how long would it take him to discover it? Guess it's my lucky day then, huh? Actually, yeah. At your trip to Thailand.

Like it's time to name a new partner. Again with the partnership. Hey, seriously, I don't get why I'd want to be Parker's partner anyway. I've seen enough of the man already. Come on, partner. It's what you've always wanted. The brass ring, more prestige, more responsibility, more headaches, longer hours, an upstairs office, and the budget to redecorate. I get an extreme office makeover, and your assistant gets a raise and a reserved parking space. Sold. I'm gonna go tell Parker about my new case. He'll love it. Wait, you can't go like that. You need to look like a partner. This is a partner pen. Make sure he sees it. Remember, the big picture is made up of little details. Like Kate Moss's sunglasses or Giselle Bunchen's hobo bag.

However, as he grew older, his appearance changed drastically. He became very thin, losing the cute charm he had as a child. No. 2, Daniel Radcliffe, known worldwide for starring in the Harry Potter series. Daniel Radcliffe was an adorable kid. However, starting with the fifth Harry Potter film, he began to lose some of that boyish charm. He eventually grew to be only about 5 feet, 5 inches, 165 cm, which fell short of many people's expectations of him as a leading man. No.3, Dakota Fanning. Dakota Fanning gained attention for her performance in I Am Sam. As a child, she had a unique beauty and impressive acting skills. However, as she grew older, her figure became more robust and she lost some of the ethereal charm she had as a child. No. 4, Morgan Lily. Morgan Lily was sweet and adorable as a child, appearing in several major films. But as she grew up, she started to grow sideways. And while her features remained fairly attractive, she has lost the youthful spirit she once had.

I can do whatever I want to her. There's no such thing as raping your wife. Not sure you too close? That's separation. She's great in bed. That's the thing about them crazy chicks, which is just what my brother said when he gave her to me. Gave her to you? After he knocked her up with Maddie, he kind of lost interest. He has needs like all men. So what does it do to you, Jane? If you're lying to get back at Gary, you're gonna be in trouble here. Stop yelling. I'll be good. I promise I'll do whatever you want. And we're here as part of an investigation. You hear about Jenny. Is she dead? Why would you say that? Well, she was always trouble, drinking, drugging. I had to pull her off of Santa's lap when she was 7, try to unzip his pants. Oh, no. That must have been hard on you. Well, thank you. People always blame mother. Hey, you didn't happen to save any pictures of Jenny when she was acting out like that, did you? We took Jenny's photos to FBI Agent O'connell. He works at Nick Mick, the largest database of child pornography in the world. I recognized her right away. We searched for her for over a decade. Called her Lacy unknown. Lacey is the name of the stepfather calls her in the videos. How many videos are we talking about? Hundreds and thousands of stills. There's A videos of her being tied up, raped, sodomized. Um, some of them were customized. He would take requests posing her. We kept looking, but after a while we assumed there's no way she survived her childhood. I'm shocked she's still alive.

I didn't even think about running. I crouched down, stretching my fingers as far as they would go, desperate to reach that bowl of dog food. But the chain dug into my neck, holding me back. The food always just an inch too far. The colour was choking me, my breath coming shorter and shorter. Finally, I used my foot, hooked the bowl toward me, scooped it up with shaking hands and devoured it right then. It tasted like a five star meal. But before I'd had more than a few bites, a cry for help echoed through the room. Someone else was here, I answered quickly. Suddenly, the light snapped off. No more communication allowed. I dumped out the food, grabbed the metal tray, slammed it against the wall over and over, trying to tell him I'm here, too, too late. My head went dizzy. The food was drugged. I couldn't hold on. Everything went black. Morning cold water splashed my face. They dragged me out for a walk just like a real dog. The chain was gone, but the collar still clamped tight. I saw no one behind me and bolted. Only a few steps. The colour lit up. It tightened around my throat. A warning blared from hidden speakers piercing my ears. The wire fence was right ahead. I grabbed it. A jolt of electricity tore through me, blackness again. When I woke up, I Was back in the kennel. This time another man was inside. I rushed to him, thrilled, asking what was going on. He said he'd been kidnapped, too. We stayed locked up together. Only one thought in my mind, escape. Next day, we were let out, nobody behind us. We pretended to stroll, crept closer to the fence. No electricity this time. We climbed out, ran like our lives depended on it. But just a few steps later, our colours lit up again. It squeezed my throat. I collapsed. The man turned back, trying to drag me along, but the colour took him, too. We both blacked out. When I woke up, a wall separated us. Our chance was gone. That day, the keeper came with dog food. I lay still, pretending to sleep. The man stood up suddenly, snatched the keeper's stick, then with a metal tray, knocked him cold. What are you doing? I gasped. Getting us out. He searched the keeper, found the keys, unlocked his collar. You'll never make it out right now, I hissed. They're watching us. Trust me, he whispered. This was my plan. But when he tried to take me with him.

He treated himself like a relay baton, passing himself between horses. As soon as the little horse got the postman, it switch to high gear. Speed instantly shot up to 370 and even steep, dangerous cliffs felt like flat ground. As the ace of the postal world, the man's goal was always to deliver the letter as fast as possible. But there was one thing that limited his speed, the stamina of the horse under him. So whenever the horse started slowing down, he would contact the post office ahead of him to prepare a new horse. When they heard the ace postman was on his way, a rookie horse immediately volunteered. Though inexperienced, he had a passion for the Postal Service. Seeing the little horse so eager, the boss couldn't wait to approve him. After a few friendly words of advice, the little horse, full of energy, went to the roadside, warming up and getting into the zone. Now starting the ninth set of calisthenics. March in place. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Stop! At that moment, the postman's old horse, eager to clock out, saw the little horse and quickly handed the man over like a baton. The little horse grabbed him and pressed him against his back, activating turbo mode and shooting off. Experienced old horses watching this couldn't Help but smirk. The little horse, fresh to the job, was fearless and reckless, speeding insanely fast. But he was distracted, not watching the road, and both he and the postman plunged off a cliff. Luckily, a pond below softened their fall. More fortunately, they had two and a half years of breath holding training. But the bad luck didn't stop there. Just as they resurfaced, they fell into an even deeper pool. As bubbles floated to the surface, the postman's greeting to the little horse was definitely full of gold. The little horse, thoroughly dejected, lay motionless. The engine waterlogged, but the postman had a few slick tricks up his sleeve. Fully revived, the little horse was back on his hooves, running like a beast. Until a sudden emergency break flung the postman off the cliff. He slid for five or six hundred meters before realizing something was wrong. But he stayed calm, performed an emergency stop, and spun around, riding the air back toward the little horse. One had to wonder if he and Newton shared some sort of mysterious connection. But just when things seemed to settle, the postman found himself in trouble again. The infamous bandit Jiang Yang was now on his tail. Rumor had it this Bandit could make even the mighty Nezza leave behind three pounds of lotus powder. Before robbing anyone, he had to apply sunscreen. He was a beauty fanatic, after all. Despite his small stature of only half a meter, his Horse under him was no slouch. The height of two and a half meters, he looked down on every preschooler. The postman sensed danger and quickly turned. He saw the bandit closing in fast, so he slammed the brakes, using the little horse's cover to prepare for a one on one showdown. But the little horse, realising something was off, bolted behind the postman. No matter what the man commanded, he just wouldn't listen. After all, he was just a horse. The man gave up trying to order him around and decided to use reason. Fists are the real answer. A saying that proved true. But before he could fight back, he locked eyes with the bandit, awkwardly smiling and politely nodding. Then he turned and ran. The little horse, now fully awake, followed closely. To their surprise, they reached a perfect synchronization, racing together powerfully, shaking off the bandit and charging into the final station. The Bandit, now headed straight for the iron gate, slammed on the brakes in panic, throwing out a two room apartment in the process. Finally, the postman delivered the letter. But just as he did, he was stunned to see a little elf pop out of the bag.

She chose to wear leggings, but she didn't expect him to push open the door and her cat tore her tights without thinking, she kissed her boyfriend, then left him sitting on the couch while she quickly went to the bathroom. Suddenly, her boyfriend called her to watch TV together. The cat settled in the popcorn bowl. She sat next to him, but noticed another big hole in her tights. It made her cry. He didn't notice, so she hugged him to distract him. She grabbed a popcorn and handed it to him with a smile, she rushed back to the bathroom, but the cat followed her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend tried to grab some popcorn and something wet touched his hand. He smelled it and disgusted, ran to the bathroom. She already had a headache. She tried to fix the problem, grabbed some clips and started patching the holes one by one. She could barely breathe. Her tights came completely undone. To her surprise, she heard another knock at the door. With no choice, she grabbed tape and wrapped it around her legs, hiding all the fat. Though the surface looks smooth, the pain was real. Her boyfriend kept knocking, so she used a hair dryer to melt the tape, making everything stay in place. Not even the cat could scratch it. Now her legs were as smooth as Jade. She opened the door confidently, but didn't expect her Boyfriend to praise the cat instead.

But after just three seconds, the male lion collapsed. Exhausted, he didn't want to continue at all. The lioness was completely unsatisfied. She looked at him feeling frustrated. Then by accident, she grabbed a little rabbit. She thought, well, why not a snack? The rabbit panicked. Don't eat me. I promise. I can make you happy. The lioness found it funny and decided to give him a chance. The rabbit was confident, thinking he was super charming, but he was tiny. The lioness barely felt anything. He tried all sorts of special moves, but she was getting impatient. Just then, a cheetah walked by. The lioness panicked. She didn't want anyone to see what was happening. She pressed the rabbit under her body. The rabbit struggled, still trying hard. The lioness's face showed a mysterious smile. The cheetah was completely confused. Before the cheetah could figure it out, a hunter appeared. The cheetah ran away and the lioness carried the rabbit to safety. At last, she let him go. The rabbit collapsed, soaking wet. Then the male lion showed up again. The lioness lifted the rabbit and said, this little guy is fun. I'll keep him around. The rabbit froze thinking. That's one crazy story to remember. Under the warm sun of the grassland, the wind blowing gently, the rabbit couldn't believe what just happened. And so the absurd but hilarious story of the lions and the little Rabbit continued to spread across the grassland.

He casually grabs a bundle of hay, rolls it into a cigarette just to light it up. Then he rips off someone's roof and uses the fireplace as a lighter. But that's not all. After lighting the cigarette, he leans back on someone's grain storage, slowly enjoying his smoke. This caused a massive panic among the villagers. To calm everyone down, the king immediately puts out an announcement calling for warriors to take down the giant. Days go by and no one shows up.

He immediately orders the boy to come to him. The king asks if it's true that he killed seven flies with one hit. The boy proudly says yes, and he puts on an over the top performance to prove his point. Seeing how dramatic he was, the king believed him instantly, so the boy was tasked with taking down the giant. Hearing this, the boy is stunned. He starts to explain, but the king suddenly adds if. If you succeed, I'll give you my daughter's hand in marriage.

What does he know about fighting giants? Just then, the ground shakes and a massive figure looms over him. Realising the danger, he looks up, but almost gets stomped by the giant's massive foot. Panicked, he runs as fast as he can. He reaches a house, hoping to slow the giant down. But the giant steps over the small obstacle like it's nothing. With nowhere to hide, the boy jumps into a pumpkin. The giant, seeing this, grabs the pumpkin without hesitation. The boy is trapped inside, and both he and the pumpkin are swallowed whole. Fortunately, as the pumpkin rolls around, he grabs onto the giant's hanging beard. This makes the giant think he's joking. The giant gulps down water, sending the boy down into his stomach. But the boy manages to escape, and once again the giant spots him. Nowhere left to hide, the boy takes out his Scissors to fight back. Angry, the giant slaps him, but the boy hides in the giant's sleeve. The giant, enraged, reaches into his sleeve. But this is exactly what the boy wanted. As the giant pulls his hand out, the boy sews it shut with a needle and thread. With the job done, he heads straight for the giant's head, throwing a rope to his nose. The giant In pain, can't fight back as the boy wraps him up from head to toe. Finally, with a sharp tug, the boy flips the giant over, securing his defeat. The giant, now controlled, becomes the power source for the amusement park, blowing air to keep it running.

That lunatic picked up my teeth one by one, calmly press them into her own gums, then placed them inside her own mouth. When I saw her walking toward me, I felt my soul about to flee my body. She tore off her rubber gloves and covered my mouth. And in that moment I realised she looked exactly like me. She ripped the engagement ring from my hand, and in an instant I understood everything. She wanted to become me, to steal my life and my fiance. I could never let that happen. Like a pea shooter, I fired at the switch again and again. The handcuffs on my wrists sprang open, but my feet were still trapped. I turned to the side, grabbed a chainsaw, shielded the sparks with its blade, and cut through the chains on my ankles with all my strength. Once free, I rushed to a mirror. My teeth were a disaster, like those of an 80 year old woman. There was no way I could get married like this. So I decided to make myself a new set of teeth. I dug through trash and found plenty of wisdom teeth and cavities, thankfully enough in number. I sculpted and colour them bit by bit in my gums. Then Polish them until they were tolerable to look at. They tasted disgusting. I wiped them clean, refine them one by one until the shape was perfect. Finally, I brush them inside and out, and the result was almost identical to my former expensive teeth. Exhausted as I was, my new teeth gleamed brilliantly. I picked up pliers and pried the door open in three seconds. By the time I finished everything, the wedding was already over. Dusk was falling, reminding me to hurry. I climbed a wall covered in vines, inhaling mouthfuls of dust, and just as I was about to smash the window, I saw my fiance freeze mid action.

Fue entonces cuando descubrieron la verdad, esta empresa financiera no se dedicaba solo a dinero, eran quienes financiaban los collares. Experimentaban con mutantes como si fueran ratas de laboratorio y apoyaban a corporaciones dise√±adas para destruirlos. As√≠ que el underground de mutantes ten√≠a un objetivo, destruir esta empresa desde su base. Detr√°s de esa enorme b√≥veda de acero estaba la clave, y ella fue la elegida para derribarla. Con un grito rompi√≥ en pedazos la pesada puerta de hierro. La b√≥veda se abri√≥ y en segundos, cada centavo fue transferido a la cuenta de thunderbird. Pero justo cuando estaban a punto de escapar, sus ojos se volvieron fr√≠os. Los recuerdos inundaron su mente y desat√≥ su poder de nuevo, ese poder invencible que pod√≠a dar la vuelta al mundo mismo. En ese momento ya no era la ni√±a indefensa traicionada por su familia. Era la fuerza destinada a reescribir el campo de batalla.

Tan pronto como entr√≥, comenz√≥ a roer la casa del canguro. Todo lo que el ternero ve√≠a lo tragaba, incluso el vestido y el globo del p√≥ster fueron absorbidos y comidos por el ternero.

Tom√≥ herramientas para intentar atar al ternero al c√©sped, pero el ternero comi√≥ la cuerda y hasta el pie del canguro. El canguro pens√≥ que el ternero le hab√≠a comido los dedos inesperadamente, pero al levantar el pie, descubri√≥ que ten√≠a dos dedos extra. En ese momento, el ternero tambi√©n se comi√≥ la llanta de repuesto del coche. Para evitar que destruyera su hogar, el canguro at√≥ al ternero al armaz√≥n de hierro del molino de viento. Pero justo cuando iba a irse, escuch√≥ un ruido extra√±o. Al voltear, descubri√≥ que el ternero se hab√≠a comido todo el armaz√≥n de hierro, aunque el Molino segu√≠a colgando en el aire. Para solucionar el problema, el canguro empuj√≥ un carrito tratando de sacar al ternero y arrojarlo lejos mientras le dec√≠a que no comiera, el ternero ya se hab√≠a comido el carrito.

Justo cuando pens√≥ que por fin se hab√≠a librado del problema, el ternero se comi√≥ la pantalla del televisor. El canguro no ten√≠a salida y decidi√≥ enviar al ternero lejos.

I was on Facetime at 1:00am with my girlfriend when my mom burst through my door without knocking, finding me mid laugh with Nadine on my phone screen. Are you serious right now? Mom shrieked, grabbing my phone while Nadine's confused face disappeared into darkness. This is completely inappropriate. It's a school night. Dad appeared behind her, shaking his head like I committed some federal crime. They didn't care that I had straight A's, that this was my chance with my crush, or that these late night calls were the only thing keeping her interested in me. You're 16. You don't need to be talking to girls at all hours. It was insane. Complete device lockdown after 9 p m. Phone physically placed in their bedroom every night. Wi-Fi router programmed to kill my connection. Even my laptop taken away just in case. Mom installed one of those parental control apps that sent her alerts if I even touched any device after curfew. Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I Couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my closet. Cracked screen, terrible battery. But it could work. After my parents 9:30 p m. Check, I waited until 10:15 to be safe, then pulled out the hidden phone. Nadine's face appeared, pixelated and laggy, but she was smiling. I thought your parents murdered you, she whispered, and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. We developed an intricate system based on my parents patterns. Mom always did checks throughout the night. I became a master of deception. The moment I heard her footsteps on the stairs. I'd whisper, she's coming to Nadine, kill the screen, slide the phone under my pillow, close my eyes, and control every micro expression on my face. The hardest part was when mom would just stand there staring, and I'd have to remain completely stone faced, breathing steady and deep, like I was truly asleep. Once mom actually walked over and stood directly over me for a full minute. It was torture. Then, weirdly, Nadine asked me, babe, are you okay? You keep coughing. I hadn't even noticed I was doing it, but she was right. My throat felt scratchy and weird. Maybe you're getting sick, she suggested. But. And I smelled it. Something sharp and chemical cutting through my room. Hold on, I whispered. And when I opened my bedroom door. My stomach dropped. Gray smoke was flowing along the hallway ceiling like a river, getting thicker by the second, pouring from the direct

Wait until they see what a year in China taught me. I start seventh grade with a renewed boost of confidence after spending a year with my grandparents in China. Walking into the school, I spot my worst nightmare. I knew this moment would come eventually. There's Shane, still the same 5 feet 8 inches tower of teenage cruelty, flanked by his usual suspects, Minion 1 and Minion 2. Such loyal followers. I'm still only 5 feet 2 inches and probably look exactly the same to them. Same. See? Brown hair, same hand me down clothes, same kid they used to stuff into lockers every Tuesday. Like clockwork. Well, well, well, look who's back, Shane announces loud enough for half the hallway to hear. We missed our little toilet bowl cleaner. Minion one actually claps his hands together like he's genuinely excited. Dude, remember when we made him eat that sandwich off the bathroom floor? They're laughing about it like it's their fondest memory. And I feel that familiar burning in my chest. Except this time it feels different. Controlled. My grandfather's voice echoes in my head. Anger is fire. You can let it burn you, or you can forge steel with it. Minion two steps closer, invading my personal space. Hope you didn't get too comfortable wherever you went, because nothing's changed here. He shoves my shoulder, testing to see if I'll react the same way I used to. Cowering and apologizing instead, I steady myself and look him directly in the eye. Everything's changed, I say quietly, but Minion 2 just laughs and walks away with his friends. Same scared little mouse. Shane calls over his shoulder. See you in P E. Bathroom, boy. P E. Class arrives like a death sentence, and of course coach pairs us up for defensive exercises, which basically his excuse to let kids beat each other up legally. Shane immediately volunteers to be my partner, grinning like Christmas morning. This is going to be fun! He tells Minion 1 and Minion 2, who are partnered nearby. I've been saving up a year's worth of frustration. He starts small, an accidental elbow to my ribs during warm UPS. Oops! Sorry Mouse Boy, didn't mean to hurt you. When I tell him I'm not weak anymore, he literally doubles over laughing. Not weak? You're the same 70 pound scarecrow who cried when I gave you a wedgie! That's when he crosses the line. During partner exercises, he's supposed to hold the punching pad steady, but instead he keeps jerking it away so my punches miss and I stumble forward. Maybe if you ate some actual food instead of whatever they feed mice. The rage is building in my chest, but I hear Grandpa's training. The river that moves mountains doesn't rage. It flows with purpose. Coach steps away to help another student with their form, and that's when Shane decides to get Creative. Minion 1 comes and hands Shane a bucket, which he dumps over my head. Water splashes down, soaking my clothes. Here you go, mouse boy, you looked a bit thirsty. Minion 1 and Minion 2 are recording with their phones now, probably planning to post it on social media. I'm dripping wet and Shane gets in my face, but still I hold back. Then he spots my friend Jace across the gym and smiles. Shane's now

While doing my nightly patrol, I noticed a black Hundai swerving in the highway doing 95 miles per hour. When I finally got the driver to pull over and step out of the vehicle, my jaw dropped. It was my wife, drunker than an Irishman, staring right at me. But instead of looking guilty or ashamed, she lunged at me. You cheater, she yelled, clawing her nails at my face. I tried to restrain her, but she just kept hitting me and trying to gauge my eyes until I had no choice but to handcuff her by force. I placed her into the backseat and took off for the police station. The whole ride the cray, she kept saying our marriage was over and refused to elaborate why she thought I cheated. My heart genuinely broke bringing her in. I thought she was having another psychotic break. Then she saw a picture of my coworker Dana's face on the wall and started yelling, that's her. That's the one you're sleeping with. I was genuinely confused. Me and Dana sometimes patrol together, but that was it. I stayed in that station talking to my wife for hours, trying to plead that I never cheated, but she wouldn't listen to a word I said. I was eventually forced to just leave her in the cell and head home. When I came back in the morning, my wife was still there. And that's when I saw Dana in the break room. She rushed to me immediately. Oh, my god. Are you okay? Your wife is so crazy for saying all of that about us. Is there anything I can do to help? I told her, yes, there was. I took her to my wife and asked Dana to explain that we never slept together. You're both lying. I found your lipstick. In his patrol car, my wife slurred. Dana, who was stepping back, looking genuinely scared. And before anyone else could get a word in, my wife's parents arrived at the station. Father jabbed his finger into my chest. You piece of garbage. How dare you arrest your own wife? Her mother was right behind him, tears streaming down her face. How dare you sleep with your coworker? The whole station was now watching. The chief even stepped out and I had to convince him I was handling this. That's when Dana stepped forward. She was usually a hothead in confrontation, but her hands were up peacefully. For some reason, sir and ma'am, there's been a huge misunderstanding. Your son in law and I are just colleagues. My father in law whipped around to face her. We know all about you. Late night shifts, text messages. Jennifer showed us everything. I grabbed my mother in law's arm. What text messages? I've never texted Dana outside of work schedules. My wife suddenly gripped the bars. January 15th, February 3rd, March 22nd, all dates you were texting. Should I Keep going. I pulled out my phone, scrolling frantically through my messages, but I found nothing. I don't know what you're talking about. Tina touched my shoulder gently. This is so confusing for you. Maybe someone spoofed your number. My father in law got in my face. Get her out of that cell now. We're taking her home. I told him politely that doing this in the police station wasn't the brightest move. His face went red. That's when the desk sergeant intervened. Sir, she blew a point one nine. Your daughter is facing DUI charges. Bail hearing isn't until noon. Then we'll wait. Her mother spat. And our lawyer will be hearing about this false imprisonment. Dana pulled me aside while they went to sit with my wife. Listen, I think you should go home, check on your son. This is getting really ugly and you look exhausted. She was right.

Missus Broward targeted me from Day 1 of sophomore English, and I never understood why. While other kids got gentle corrections on their essays, she'd hand mine back covered in red ink with comments like lack of sophistication and clearly unprepared for this level. When I raised my hand to ask questions, she'd sigh dramatically and say, we can't stop class every time someone slow doesn't understand basic concept. The worst part was the supply requirements. Every week she'd announce we needed specific materials, a particular brand of index cards, special coloured pens that cost $12 each, and a leather bound journal at $45. If you don't have the proper supplies, you can't participate. And that means automatic failure for the day. She'd announce, staring directly at me. I'd show up with generic cards from the dollar store and she'd shake her head, these won't do. I specifically said Oxford Brand. Then she'd eat her lunch in front of the class during our study period, making a show of throwing away half a sandwich or an entire apple. I'm just not that hungry today, she'd say, tossing perfectly good food in the trash while I sat there with my empty stomach growling. When parent teacher conferences came around, she told my mom right in front of me, some students just aren't cut out for Advanced Placement classes. Perhaps we should consider moving her to regular English, where the expectations are more manageable for her background, the audacity was unreal. My mom worked three jobs just to keep us afloat. And this woman was basically saying poor kids don't belong in advanced classes. I felt about 2 inches tall walking out of that conference, but something inside me snapped. That day, I decided right there and then that I wasn't going to let her or anyone else's expectations define my future. Spent every lunch period in the library, checked out college prep books and started applying for every scholarship I could find. My guidance counselor, Mister Torres, believed in me when nobody else did and helped me navigate the application process. Senior year, I got a full ride to state for my education degree, specifically so I could come back and change things for kids like me. College was tough. I worked in the dining hall to cover expenses, but I graduated with my teaching degree and immediately applied back to my old high school. They hired me as an English teacher and walking back into those halls felt surreal. Missus Broward didn't recognize me at all, but her attitude toward new staff was just as toxic as her treatment of students. Young teachers think you can save the world, she'd sneer during faculty meetings. Wait until reality hits and you realise this job isn't about making friends with students. I watched her humiliate kids the exact same way she'd humiliated me, throwing away food while Students went hungry, demanding expensive supplies and making comments about students from certain backgrounds. But this time, I was documenting everything for three.

Everyone knew Blake and Rosalie were going to last forever. Like, seriously, this guy had her military dad laughing so hard he choked. The first time they ever met, while the rest of us had never even heard him speak, Blake invented Random Flower Day, where once a month he'd show up with a bouquet of exotic flowers shipped from a different country around the world. Each time our girlfriends would literally use him as an example during every argument. This is what a real man looks like. He organized flash mobs for her birthday, Learned to cook her grandmother's recipes and treated Rosalie like it was her birthday every day. Then Rosalie's mom got diagnosed with Lupus and Blake didn't even hesitate. He switched to night shifts at his accounting firm so he could drive her mom to treatments during the day. He even sold his beloved motorcycle, the one he'd rebuilt with his dad, just to over the copays when Rosalie's family hit their insurance limit. While the rest of us were complaining about meeting our girlfriend's parents once a month, Blake was at every single family dinner, helping Rosalie's mother cook, helping her dad fix the roof, and teaching her little brother to drive. Three years in, Blake proposed. He got down on one knee at her favorite restaurant with her whole family there with her grandmother's ring he'd personally restored and gave This speech about how she saved him from being a workaholic with no purpose. Whole restaurant started clapping. Rosalie was crying so hard she could barely say yes. The wedding planning was insane. Blake handled everything. She got stressed about vendor calls, seating arrangements, dealing with her crazy aunt who demanded vegan options for everyone. The day finally came. It was a beautiful beach and packed with 300 guests. Rosalie looked incredible walking down that aisle. Her dad tearing up next to her and Blake standing at the altar with tears already running down his face. The efficient Blake's best friend went through all the traditional stuff, the readings, the vows. Rosalie went first and by the end, everyone was dabbing their eyes with tears. Then came the big moment. Do you, Blake, take Rosalie to be your lawfully wedded wife? The whole beach was silent. Everyone waiting for that enthusiastic yes we all expected. Blake looked at Rosalie for what felt like forever. Then he took a deep breath and said, clear as day. Two hours ago, I would have hoisted you up in the air and screamed yes, but now you disgust me and I never want to see you again in my life. He turned and walked away. Rosalie's face went from confused to horrified in about two seconds. Literally collapsed right there in her wedding dress. The best friend stood there with his mouth open. Blake's mom started running after him, screaming his name. Rosalie's bridesmaids. Rushed to her, trying to get her to breathe. The whole beach erupted. People were standing up shouting, asking what the hell just happened. Blake just kept walking, got to the car park where a cab was waiting for him and drove off. Nobody could make sense of it. His groomsmen were blowing up his phone, getting nothing. Rosalie had to be sedated.

Monica and I were getting married in 10 weeks. I was signing our wedding venue contract when she stopped me. We should date other people before we get married. The pen fell out of my hand. I laughed because I thought she was joking. I'm serious. It will make us stronger. She showed me an article on her phone about open relationships. She had saved it two months ago. Two months? She'd been planning this while I was planning our honeymoon. Her phone kept buzzing with texts. She grabbed it and smiled at whatever she was reading. She said we needed to explore ourselves before getting married. She said we'd be more confident in our choice. She even mentioned that her best friend Jenna, never took risks and had a boring life. The whole time she was talking, her phone kept lighting up with messages. Kept checking them while talking to me. Something was wrong here. Fine. If you think dating others will help us, let's do it. Her face lit up completely. She looked like she'd won something big. She immediately started texting someone back really fast. I could hear her nails clicking on the phone screen. She thought I would just wait at home while she dated other people. She had no idea what was about to happen. What? The first date night came. Monica spent three hours getting ready. She wore a brand new black dress she'd bought Just for tonight. Her coworker Kyle picked her up, and she practically ran to his car. Then Jenna called and asked if I wanted to get dinner. Monica said you guys are opening things up. She said quietly, yeah, she's with Kyle right now. Jenna went silent for a long time. I knew something was happening with them. At dinner, Jenna barely touched her food. Monica's been lying to me, too, she said. Remember her work conference last month? She never went. Her hands were shaking. How do you know? I saw her location on Find My Friends. She was at Kyle's apartment the whole weekend. When I asked her about the conference, she gave me all these fake details about sessions she attended. I reached over and touched her hand. She didn't pull away. We should keep this between us, I said. Don't tell anyone about the open relationship. Let Monica think everything's working perfectly. Jenna nodded. We need to document everything she's done. Get evidence. We were both angry and hurt. This was about justice. That night, I heard everything through our bedroom wall. Monica had brought Kyle back to our apartment. Every sound, every word, everything. She was completely oblivious that I could hear them. I texted Jenna, can I come over? Twenty minutes later, I was on her couch while she made us tea. She doesn't even realize you can hear, Jenna said about the noises. She's too caught up in Kyle to think about anything. Else, we spent hours planning how to expose Monica's lies. When I left at 4 a m, she gave me her spare key. In case you need to escape again. After that first week, Jenna and I met daily to collect evidence. Screenshots of Monica's fake conference receipts, photos from Kyle's social media that proved her lies. She'd bring me lunch when I forgot to eat during our planning sessions. Two sugars. No.

My best friend, Trent, paced around the room nervously. What do I do? I think our roommate is in love with me, he muttered. I bursted into laughter. Gemma? I highly doubt it, I said. Our roommates, Gemma and Ali, definitely hadn't shown they were interested in Trent at all. From what I'd seen, Gemma was naturally friendly and Ali was quiet and closed off. But Trent insisted. He pushed a crumpled piece of paper to my chest, laughing, read it and weep. I scanned through the paper that definitely very clearly stated my dazzling Trent, and I was shocked. He was right. Someone had a huge crush on him. Are you sure it's Gemma? I asked. Trent nodded and explained how there had been obvious signs. He offered me coffee when I came over. He said, that's basically asking me out. I reminded him she offered everyone coffee, but she laughed at all my jokes. Then she asked about my weekend plans. That's basically girl code for checking if I'm single, Or she's just asking about your weekend plans like a normal person, I suggested. Then he pulled out actual evidence, a poem on the kitchen counter with romantic lines like brown eyes sweeter than honey and a laugh that makes Monday mornings bearable. That's totally me, he yelled. I shrugged. I don't see it, I joked. He rolled his eyes. And haven't you noticed every time I visit There's always a gift waiting for me. Yeah, I remember that. A box of his favorite brand of herbal tea that no one else drank showed up on his table the day we were out, along with a bookmark with a quote from a movie he mentioned liking and a stress ball that showed up right before his big job interview. Trent had spent weeks building up the courage to talk to Gemma about it, waiting for that one sure sign that Gemma really felt that way about, about him. Then that sign arrived tonight. Trent had stayed late to help me with a project when we heard singing through the walls. One of the girls had been singing Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me in the most angelic voice. Then we heard it. She actually sang his name, adding Trent right into the lyrics. Trent jumped off the couch like he'd been electrocuted. I told you she likes me, he half whispered. He decided right then he was going to confess his feelings. Thanks, too. The next day he showed up at our apartment with a bouquet of roses and a poem he wrote on his own. Trent nervously walked over to Gemma, who was chilling on the couch watching Netflix. He looked up at the flowers and smiled. Wow, nice flowers. You look great, she said, calm and friendly like always. Trent cleared his throat. I know about the poems and the gifts and the song. Gemma's smile. Turned into confusion. Trent, what is this? What's going on? Gemma stared at Trent for a long moment. Wait, are you talking?

Dad announces at dinner that he's getting remarried to Elise, this woman he's been dating for four months. Finally, you kids will have a real mother figure. While I'm traveling for work, he says. Like I haven't been raising my seven year old brother Ethan since mom died three years ago. Elise moves in the next week and immediately starts rearranging our entire house. I need to establish my authority, she tells dad while moving Mom's China to the garage. First morning, I try explaining our routine. Our dog biscuit needs walking at 6:30 sharp or he'll have accidents. Ethan takes his ADHD meds with apple juice at 7. Never orange juice. It makes him sick. And he naps at 4 p m. Or he'll have meltdowns all evening. Elise cuts me off. I'm the adult here now, not some 16 year old playing house. I'll determine what happens and when. Your father wants me to be a mother, not follow some child schedule. I look at dad, who's checking his phone. Listen to Elise. She knows what she's doing. She raised her own kids. Where are her kids now? I ask. That's not relevant. Elise snaps. Fine. Dad leaves for his two week business trip. That afternoon, Elise announces new rules. Breakfast at 9, no more cuddling that spoiled Dog. And Ethan's too old for naps. Real mothers don't follow ridiculous schedules made by Teenagers first day one, Elise decides biscuit can wait until 8:00am for his walk because she needs her beauty sleep. Biscuit, a 90 pound German Shepherd with a bladder condition, destroys Elise's designer luggage collection while she's in the shower. Suitcases covered in dog urine. The smell never comes out. Day two she gives Ethan his meds with orange juice because she forgot to buy apple juice. He projectile vomits across her laptop while she's on a zoom call with her book club. The laptop's fried. She refused to give him a nap because second graders don't need babying. By six PM, Ethan's having a full meltdown, throwing everything he can find. Her grandmother's vase she brought over. Shattered. Day 3 she decides our backyard pet funeral tradition is morbid and throws away Ethan's dead goldfish instead of letting us bury him. Ethan calls 9 1 1, sobbing that his stepmother is destroying evidence of murder. The police show up. Elise has to explain to three officers why she threw away a goldfish named Detective Bubbles. Week two gets worse. She changes Ethan's pick up time without telling the school. They call the police, thinking he's been kidnapped. She feeds biscuit different food because his prescription and diet is overpriced. He gets explosive diarrhea all over her new white couch she bought to modernize our living room. She tries to discipline Ethan by taking away his comfort items. He locks himself in the bathroom for six hours. The fire department Has to remove the door. They recognize our address from the goldfish incident. Everything under control here? The firefighter asks. Elise's eye is twitching. Children need discipline. She keeps muttering. She posts in her Facebook mommy group about demon stepchildren, and someone screenshots it and sends it to Dad. Day 12, everything implodes. Elise decides she knows better than Ethan's therapist and skips his appointment to take him shopping for proper clothes. Ethan has a

So I started dating a guy older than him. See how he likes it? I'm 22 and my dad is 48. Last year after my parents divorced, he started dating this 20 year old girl named Becca. Yes, she's literally two years younger than me. Disgusting, right? At first I thought it was just some midlife crisis fling. But then he started bringing her to family dinners and introducing her as his girlfriend. She'd sit there giggling at everything he said while I'm sitting across from them wanting to throw up. The worst part was watching my dad act like some teenage boy around her, buying her jewelry and taking her on fancy trips while my mom was still fighting for alimony money. Who would even try to give me advice about college in my dating life. Like, girl, you literally just graduated high school two years ago. She'd be like, oh, honey, you should totally try this new face mask I saw on TikTok while I'm thinking about how she's closer to my age than my dad's. The breaking point came when my dad announced they were moving in together. He called a family meeting with me and my little brother to tell us Becca would be around more often. My 16 year old brother just stared at his phone the whole time while I sat there fuming. That's when I decided to give my dad a taste of His own medicine. I started scrolling through dating apps, specifically looking for older guys. I found this 55 year old guy named Robert who owns a construction company. He's divorced, has kids older than me, but he's actually pretty cool and treats me well. Plus he looks way better than my dad, even though he's older. I started bringing Robert to family events. The look on my dad's face when I introduced my boyfriend at my cousin's birthday party was priceless. Robert showed up in his nice truck wearing a button down shirt, shook my dad's hand firmly and started talking about his business and his two kids who are 24 and 26. My dad kept shooting me these confused looks all night. Becca kept whispering to him, asking if Robert was really my boyfriend. Robert was being super.

My friends saw us walking together this morning and they told everyone, you're babysitting me. She was practically hyperventilating. They made babysitter jokes all day. They said I probably still wet the bed. I laughed at that, which was the wrong move. Kaylee, I'm just making sure you're safe. I don't care. I'm in seventh grade. All my friends walk alone. I don't need you. She put her hands in her face and I could see her shoulders shaking. Everyone thinks I'm a total loser now. Claire doesn't even wanna be seen with me.

She demanded, getting ready for school. I said, confused? You said you weren't going to walk with me anymore? Her Voice was getting panicked. I'm not walking with you. I'm walking to school. You can go ahead if you want. Her face went red. That's the same thing. People will still see us. We argued for five minutes before she finally gave up. Fine, but I'm walking way ahead, like way ahead, and you better not follow too close. She stormed out first, practically running. I waited about 30 seconds, then left. We made it one block before she turned around and started yelling, you're too close. Slow down. She just kept going. I can hear your footsteps. Slow down. But when she saw Claire's mom's car driving by, she completely lost it. Get further back. Hide behind something. Do something. She was practically sprinting now, her purple backpack bouncing as she tried to put more distance between us. I said further, she shouted, without even looking back. By the time we hit the main road, she was so far ahead I could barely see her. I watched her turn the corner by the pharmacy, her purple backpack visible for just a second. I looked down to check my phone. One second, maybe two. When I looked back up, she was gone. Just gone. No purple backpack, nothing. Kaylee, I called out but not too loud because honestly, I thought she was messing with me. She probably ducked into a.

Dinner was painfully awkward. It had been two years since mom left and my dad's girlfriend Britt had tried too hard to impress us, making Dinosaur nuggets and smiley face Mac and cheese like we were 5. My brother flipped his plate and glared at her. First you try to take dad away and now you're bribing us with nuggets, he asked coldly. Colton, Dad yelled. Britt smiled. You're right. Next time I'll add spaghetti, she joked. Table fell silent. Dad coughed awkwardly and stood up to take a call. That's when Brit leaned forward and looked at me and my siblings with a serious expression. Look, I know this is weird, she said. What will it take for you guys to actually like me? My older brother leaned forward too, eyeing her down and said in his toughest 13 year old voice, do everything we say for one month. Brit didn't even hesitate. Deal what's first. What she didn't know was that my brother was already prepared to go to war with her. And what we didn't know was that Brit was prepared to. My brother announced the first impossible challenge, best us at every video game we own. I knew he'd start here. Colton was undefeated at Fortnite in our entire school. But Brit showed up the next day having studied YouTube tutorials all night. She destroyed him five rounds straight. Then did the floss dance over His defeated character. My little sister innocently cheered while my brother insisted it didn't count, that he was just warming up. Best of 10, he said, and she won eight out of 10. When my brother looked sad, she showed him the trick she Learned. That way you'll destroy everyone else, he winked. The next challenge was pure physical. Old people can't do obstacle courses, my brother grinned, building one in the backyard with everything from tire runs to rope climbs. But when Brit showed up in full Crossfit gear, we knew we were done for. She ended up beating my brother's record by 30 seconds. Now do it backwards, he demanded. She did it backwards now blindfolded. I saw my brother mouth, what the heck when she actually did it blindfolded using only our shouted directions. Honestly, we were impressed. Is that all you got? She teased. This week you have to pick us up from school instead of dad, but you gotta wear embarrassing costumes. And she did. Turns out Brit was a retired cosplayer. She showed up to school in an Optimus Prime costume, then a fully geared up attack on Titan costume and a bunch more insane outfits. My friends kept saying, your mom's cool, don't you dare smile, my brother hissed at me. I'm not, I protested. I totally was. The endurance challenge was my brother's last stand, an anime Marathon of one piece to see who could stay awake. My sister fell asleep on Brit's shoulder. Around hour six, Colton and I crashed. After 14 hours, Brit paused the show and covered us all with blankets. She carried my sister to bed and took off her shoes. She tucked me in on the couch, whispering.

Best us at every video game we own. I knew he'd start here. Colton was undefeated at Fortnite in our entire school, but Brit showed up the next day, having studied YouTube tutorials all night. She destroyed him five rounds straight, then did the floss dance over His defeated character.

When my brother looked sad, she showed him the trick she Learned. That way you'll destroy everyone else. He winked. The next challenge was pure physical. Old people can't do obstacle courses. My brother grinned, building one in the backyard with everything from tire runs to rope climbs. But when Brit showed up in full Crossfit gear, we knew we were done for. She ended up beating my brother's record by 30 seconds. Now do it backwards! He demanded. She did it backwards. Now blindfolded. I saw my brother mouth what the heck? When she actually did it blindfolded, using only our shouted directions. Honestly, we were impressed. Is that all you got? She teased. This week you have to pick us up from school instead of dad, but you gotta wear embarrassing costumes. And she did. Turns out Brit was a retired cosplayer. She showed up to school in an Optimus Prime costume, then a fully geared up attack on Titan costume, and a bunch more insane outfits. My friends kept saying, your mom's cool, don't you dare smile! My brother hissed at me. I'm not! I protested. I totally was! The endurance challenge was my brother's last stand, an anime Marathon of one piece to see who could stay awake. My sister fell asleep on Brit's shoulder around our six. Colton and I crashed. After 14 hours, Brit paused the show and covered us all with blankets. She carried my sister to bed and took off her shoes. She tucked me in on the couch, whispering

My best friend, Trent, paced around the room nervously. What do I do? I think our roommate is in love with me, he muttered. I bursted into laughter. Gemma? I highly doubt it, I said. Our roommates, Gemma and Ali, definitely hadn't shown they were interested in Trent at all. From what I'd seen, Gemma was naturally friendly and Ali was quiet and closed off. But Trent insisted. He pushed a crumpled piece of paper to my chest, laughing, read it and weep. I scanned through the paper that definitely very clearly stated my dazzling Trent, and I was shocked. He was right. Someone had a huge crush on him. Are you sure it's Gemma? I asked. Trent nodded and explained how there had been obvious signs. He offered me coffee when I came over. He said, that's basically asking me out. I reminded him she offered everyone coffee, but she laughed at all my jokes. Then she asked about my weekend plans. That's basically girl code for checking if I'm single, Or she's just asking about your weekend plans like a normal person, I suggested. Then he pulled out actual evidence, a poem on the kitchen counter with romantic lines like brown eyes sweeter than honey and a laugh that makes Monday mornings bearable. That's totally me, he yelled. I shrugged. I don't see it, I joked. He rolled his eyes. And haven't you noticed every time I visit There's always a gift waiting for me. Yeah, I remember that. A box of his favorite brand of herbal tea that no one else drank showed up on his table the day we were out, along with a bookmark with a quote from a movie he mentioned liking and a stress ball that showed up right before his big job interview. Trent had spent weeks building up the courage to talk to Gemma about it, waiting for that one sure sign that Gemma really felt that way about, about him. Then that sign arrived tonight. Trent had stayed late to help me with a project when we heard singing through the walls. One of the girls had been singing Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me in the most angelic voice. Then we heard it. She actually sang his name, adding Trent right into the lyrics. Trent jumped off the couch like he'd been electrocuted. I told you she likes me, he half whispered. He decided right then he was going to confess his feelings. Thanks, too. The next day he showed up at our apartment with a bouquet of roses and a poem he wrote on his own. Trent nervously walked over to Gemma, who was chilling on the couch watching Netflix. He looked up at the flowers and smiled. Wow, nice flowers. You look great, she said, calm and friendly like always. Trent cleared his throat. I know about the poems and the gifts and the song. Gemma's smile. Turned into confusion. Trent, what is this? What's going on? Gemma stared at Trent for a long moment. Wait, are you talking?

After telling us that she had mandatory district training for three days starting Monday, my English teacher pointed at me and announced, you'll be teaching the Shakespeare unit while I'm gone since you actually understand the material, unlike everyone else who thinks the movie counts as reading. I stared at her in complete disbelief. Shouldn't we have a substitute teacher? Sure, for this? She shuffled papers, avoiding eye contact because she definitely knew this was wrong. Substitutes are incompetent and I don't have time to train someone on my specific curriculum. I pushed back immediately, but I'm not trained either, and I'm literally a student. She was already halfway out the door, clutching her tote bag. Just follow the lesson plan and make them understand Romeo and Juliet, since there's a test when I get back, have a great weekend. Goodbye. She practically ran from the room before I could protest further. And suddenly I understood exactly how badly this would backfire. Monday morning, I walked into class dragging a suitcase full of zombie makeup and fake blood. We're doing Romeo and Juliet Love in the time of zombies where the Montagues are zombie hunters and the Capulet are secretly infected. Jackson volunteered for Romeo and I told him his character collected zombie teeth as trophies. Sophia got Juliet, who was slowly turning but fighting it for love. We rewrote the balcony scene at the quarantine breach. But soft what light or yonder window breaks, it is the east and Juliet hasn't eaten anyone yet. Jackson delivered while Sophia not on her own arm. For practice, the nurse became a scientist and Friar Lawrence ran an underground zombie shelter. By lunch, everyone had memorized more Shakespeare then they had all semester. Tuesday we created hazmat suits from garbage bags for the Montagues and painted decay on the capsules with whiteout and permanent markers. The party scene became Romeo discovering Juliet wasn't quite human when she tried to bite him during their first kiss. She literally tried to eat your face and you're still into her, someone shouted as Mercutio, who believed the government created the virus. Love conquers all, even the undead, Jackson replied, while Sophia perfected her zombie twitch by watching possum videos. The janitor walked in and saw 30 students covered in fake blood, staging what looked like a biohazard event and immediately left, muttering about his paycheck. Wednesday got completely out of control when I invited other classes to watch without permission. The fight scene turned into Mercurio getting infected while Romeo had to decide whether to kill his best friend before he turned. We used pool noodles as weapons and ketchup packets for blood, which exploded everywhere, coating walls and ceiling and red slatter. A plague on both your houses became. I'm literally plagued by both your houses and it's highly contagious. While the infected Mercurio chased students down the hallway, moaning about Government conspiracies and demanding brains. The cafeteria staff locked their doors when they saw him coming and someone pulled the fire alarm thinking there was an actual emergency happening. The principal arrived after getting six emergency calls about a possible biohazard in the English wing. Plus reports that student.

My dad was the kind of dad who wore my terrible friendship bracelets to his business meetings. We went camping every month and worked on his old Mustang every Sunday. He always knew exactly what to say when life got hard. But then something happened and suddenly my dad was a complete stranger living in our house. Out of nowhere, he stopped coming to my games, even when we were going to the playoffs. When I asked why, he just stared at his laptop and said he had work to do. He started locking himself in his home office the second he got back from his job at the accounting firm and wouldn't come out even when mom knocked to say dinner was ready. He installed three new locks on the office door, which seemed insane for a room that just had tax documents and spreadsheets. When I tried to show him my report card with straight A's, he barely glanced at it before walking away without saying anything. The camping trip we planned for months suddenly got canceled because he said he needed to stay home. He stopped making eye contact and started flinching when mom touched his shoulder. He started sleeping on the couch instead of in their bedroom. His boss called the house asking if everything was okay because dad had been making weird mistakes at work and forgetting important meetings. I noticed he started paying cash for Everything. Instead of using his credit cards and he bought a new phone that he kept hidden in his jacket pocket. He would drive somewhere every night after he thought we were asleep and his car would be gone for exactly 45 minutes. He'd come back looking more terrified than when he left. He removed all our family photos from his wallet and his desk at work, according to his secretary who called mom to ask if they we're getting divorced. When I asked him to help with my science project about hereditary traits, he turned white and said he couldn't help me with anything anymore before locking himself back in his office. Mom tried to talk to him about what was happening, but he told her she needed to stop asking questions for her own good, which made her cry for the first time I'd ever seen. He started getting phone calls that made him go completely silent and he just listen without saying a word before hanging up and staring at nothing for hours. He withdrew $20,000 from their savings account and when mom confronted him about it, he said it was already gone and there would be more coming out soon. He stopped eating dinner with us and would only grab food when nobody else was in the kitchen, like he was avoiding being near us. The weird part was he kept buying me things like expensive baseball equipment and a new bike and gaming system, but He'd leave them outside my door without a note. He started writing letters and sealing them in envelopes with our names on them but keeping them locked in a safe he'd installed in the office closet. He changed all his passwords and remove mom from their joint bank accounts saying it was for Protection but wouldn't explain. Protection from what? When my birthday came, he didn't even acknowledge it until midnight when he left a card under my door that just said I'm sorry for everything that's about to happen. Started following him on those 45 minute drives and discovered he was going to the same abandoned warehouse on the edge of town. He would sit in his car staring at the building for exactly 10 minutes, then drive around the block three times before coming home. One night I saw another car there and dad.

Dinner was painfully awkward. It had been two years since mom left, and my dad's girlfriend, Britt, had tried too hard to impress us, making Dinosaur nuggets and smiley face Mac and cheese like we were five. My brother flipped his plate and glared at her. First you try to take dad away, and now you're bribing us with nuggets? He asked coldly. Colton! Dad yelled. Britt smiled. You're right. Next time I'll add spaghetti, she joked. Table fell silent. Dad coughed awkwardly and stood up to take a call. That's when Brit leaned forward and looked at me and my siblings with a serious expression. Look, I know this is weird, she said. What will it take for you guys to actually like me?

So I introduced him to my actual boyfriend. For 8 months, sane, acted like my boyfriend in every way possible. We hung out four times a week. He'd sleep over constantly, even had his own drawer at my place. He'd get visibly jealous whenever other guys talk to me at parties, always finding excuse, this is to interrupt conversations or pull me away. He bought me flowers just because, remembered my coffee order perfectly. And we'd spend entire weekends together binge watching shows and cooking dinner like a real couple. My friends all assumed we were dating. My family invited him to barbecue. Even his mom would ask about his girlfriend when she called. But whenever anyone directly asked if we were together, Zane would laugh it off awkwardly. Oh, no, we're just really close friends. I'm not ready for anything serious right now. It stung every single time, but I kept hoping he'd come around. I thought maybe he just needed more time to feel comfortable with labels. Last Friday night changed everything. We were at Kelsey's birthday party and this girl, Alexis from his work showed up. She was clear flirting with him all night, touching his arm, laughing way too loud at his jokes. Finally, she looked me up and down and asked directly, so are you his girlfriend or what? Without hesitation, Zane immediately said, oh, no, we're definitely not together. I'm completely single. Actually, he even stepped lightly. Away from me. When he said it, the humiliation hit me like a truck. Everyone with an earshot was staring. Kelsey looked mortified. For me, I felt my cheeks burning with embarrassment. But instead of running away, crying like I want.

I'd always been the smartest kid in my class, but my family was broke, like really broke. My parents worked cleaning jobs at the airport and always told me, we'll get you there somehow whenever I talked about college. But I knew the numbers didn't add up. My, my mom made $8 an hour and my dad made nine. There was no way. My junior year, my counselor, Missus Douglas, pulled me aside. She had this serious look on her face that made my stomach drop. Lena, you made it to the finals for the state academic scholarship. She said. There are only three students left. I couldn't breathe. This was it. Full ride to any college in the state. I went home and told my parents and my mom actually cried. She hugged me so tight I thought my ribs would crack. We knew you could do it, baby, she whispered. I spent three weeks working on that final essay. Stayed up three nights straight, revised it 10 times, had my English teacher look at it twice. I wrote about growing up, watching my parents come home exhausted every single day, about studying by flashlight when the power got cut off, about wanting to be the first person in my family to graduate college. Two weeks after I submitted it, Mrs. Douglas called me into her office again. This time she looked sad. Lena, I'm sorry. The Committee chose someone else. I didn't cry. I just nodded and said okay. But inside, I felt like someone had punched me in the chest. I walked out of her office, sat behind the school cafeteria by myself and stared at the parking lot. All those cars belong to kids whose parents could just write checks for college. That night, I told my parents. My mom hugged me again and said, there will be other chances, sweetheart. But I could see it in her eyes. She knew this was probably my only real shot. The thing is, missus Douglas had lied to me because I had won. I'd actually won the whole thing. But she knew something I didn't know about the run.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exactly three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, college funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keep. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself in A hospital bed with an I V. In her arm. Starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to Grandad's funeral three weeks later with guardian ship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn is perking up right now thinking this is about trust distributions, he said, and Mom's eager face shifted to confusion, then everything is going according to plan. What none of you know, Grandpa continued, is that I've been recording every conversation in my hospital room for the last six months because I needed evidence. Mom started to stand. This is ridiculous. Evelyn, sit down. Yes, you. I know. You're standing right now about to claim I was senile. She froze midstand and slowly sank back down. You told my granddaughter your cancer returned. Stay for right. Experimental treatment that costs exactly what the trust pays annually. Creative math. Mom was frantically scrolling through her phone while dad tried to grab it to see the documents himself. Wesley, are you still claiming you're losing the house? Dad spun toward the screen. The house I paid off in 2008. The remortgage That went straight to Prairie casino. I have the withdrawal records, Wesley. $400,000 in 18 months. Terrible blackjack player, by the way. Annika jumped up, already crying. He was clearly mentally compromised. Ah, Annika, right on schedule. Let me guess. You're about to cry about your infertility. He chuckled to himself. Your abortion was 14 months ago. $3,200 on my credit card. Monica screamed. That's a vicious lie. Also, you're not infertile. You're on birth control. The pills are in your medicine cabinet, behind the vitamins. The funeral home erupted. Now Grandpa's voice continued calmly, my granddaughter, if you're holding guardianship papers right now, and I know you are, because you always want the best for everyone, read page 4, sub section C out loud. My hands trembled as I flipped through the pages. And an irreversible transfer of parental rights. The guardianship was never meant to be permanent. Your mother's friend drafted those. Stand up, Joe. A man in the fifth row reluctantly stood, face bright red. Mom! Was shrieked.

My mother slid a paper across the kitchen table and said, tell the judge your father touched you or you'll never see your little brother again. My parents have been divorcing for three months after dad caught mom with her boss. But this, this something else entirely. I won't get custody without leverage, mom explained. Your father makes 300,000 a year, I make 40. Unless you say this happened, we'll be homeless. My eight year old brother Archie sat next to me eating cereal. I noticed him winces when he reached for his spoon and caught a glimpse of purple bruising under his sleeve. Mom had said he fell off the swings yesterday. I already told Missus Jenkins at school about what your dad did, mom said with a wink and my stomach dropped. Missus Jenkins was the guidance counselor. There's no going back now. Cleo. The thing was I knew exactly what mom was capable of. Last week she'd been drunk by noon and I'd seen her raise her hand toward Archie. So I shoved him into the bathroom with his iPad and locked the door. Then gave mom two of her Xanax and made up a story about breaking her favorite vase to redirect her rage onto me instead. It worked. It always worked when I was there. Archie had whispered to me that night, his small voice breaking, Mommy hurts me when you're at Dad's. I Recorded it on my phone, not knowing what else to do. I've already scheduled therapy appointments for your trauma, she said, sliding more papers across the table. Just stick to the script. The papers had practice questions. Where did he touch you? How often? What did he say to keep you quiet? If you don't do this, mom said, her voice dropping to that dangerous whisper I knew too well. I'll take Archie and disappear. You'll never find us. The threat hit me like ice water. I looked at my little brother, remembering how I'd feel his bruised ribs against my back. He curled up behind me. That night, I lay awake staring at family photos on my phone. Dad teaching me to ride a bike. Dad at every single recital, every soccer game. The next morning I went to dad department. He looked terrible. Hadn't been sleeping, hadn't been eating right. The school called, he said, confused. They asked me if everything was okay at home. They wouldn't tell me what was wrong. Cleo, is someone bullying you? Whatever happens, I'm here for you. I almost broke down right there, almost told him everything. But Archie's bruises flashed in my mind. Mom had scheduled a therapy session that afternoon, but when we got there, I realized that there, this was just her friend, Donna, who used to be a counselor. I hid my phone in my backpack and hit record. The key is details that feel real but can't. Be disproven. Donna coached crying helps practice crying on Q. She actually taught me techniques. Thinking about dead pets, pinching myself where it wouldn't show. The school documentation helps that teacher paying attention to you. Perfect dance of you seeking father figures. My skin crawled as mom practiced my testimony with me. It was summer vacation when I had my innocence torn from me. I wanted to throw up, but I kept recording.

Missus Lambert walked into class with tears streaming down her face and slammed her coffee mug on the desk so hard it broke. If one of you can find the woman my husband is cheating on me with, I will give you an A+ for the semester and you can stop doing work. Just please help me catch her so I can deliver justice. Someone in the back raised their hand slowly and asked if that was really all they had to do. Missus Lambert nodded and laid out three rules. One, we couldn't get caught snooping around. Two, we couldn't break into anyone's homes. 3 we could work in teams if we wanted. The bell rang right after, and my best friend Kenji grabbed my arm and pulled me into the hallway. He said, I got a plan. This will be easy money. Trust me. Missus Lambert's husband was Coach Lambert, who taught Jim and coached girls volleyball. Kenji figured he was probably sleeping with one of the volleyball players since he spent so much time with them after school. We decided to start our investigation. That afternoon, during volleyball practice, we snuck into the gym and hid behind the bleachers. With a clear view of the court. Coach Lambert was running drills and yelling at the girls to hustle. He seemed normal at first, but then we noticed he kept touching the team captain's shoulder when explaining plays. The Practice went on for an hour, and nothing suspicious happened. We were about to give up when Coach Lambert called the captain, April, into his office. She jogged over, bouncing her ponytail, and followed him inside. Through the window, we could see her tying her hair up in a bun while he made sure no one was looking, then turned off the lights and pulled down the blinds, blocking our view completely. Kenji and I looked at each other, knowing she was giving him the gawk. Gawk 3,000. We quietly left the gym and started heading back to Mrs. Lambert's classroom to claim our A plus. We were practically running down the hallway when we heard footsteps behind us. Two kids from our class tackled us to the ground before we could react. They pinned us down while their teammate, Jasmine, sprinted ahead toward Mrs. Lambert's room. We struggled, but they were bigger and had caught us off guard. By the time we got free and made it to the classroom, Jasmine was already inside talking to the teacher. After Jasmine left, looking smug, I went into the classroom alone. Missus Lambert was sitting at her desk, crying harder than before. I told her what we'd seen with Coach Lambert and April in his office. She. She thanked me through her tears and said she suspected the volleyball team all along. But then I realized something off. I asked her, are you okay? Like, actually okay? Missus Lambert looked up. At me with surprise. She actually smiled a little through her tears and said I was the first student to ask how she was feeling. I apologized for not asking sooner and told her that even though she was a tough teacher, she didn't deserve to be cheated on. She stood up and walked around her desk. Do you still want that A plus? She asked. I said, yeah, of course, because

I was working as a photographer for kids parties to make some extra cash in college. The birthday boy was Nico, turning 8. His mom booked me weeks ahead and seemed super stressed about everything being perfect. She kept mentioning how important this party was, how Nico's dad was finally going to show up after missing basically everything for two years. When I got to Chuck E. Cheese that Saturday, Nico was bouncing off the walls with excitement. He had on this brand new Superman shirt and kept telling everyone who'd listen that his dad was coming. He promised this time. He said to his friend Ben, he's gonna see me blow out the candles. His mom put on a brave face, but I could see her checking her phone every few minutes. He'd ordered this elaborate race car cake because apparently that's what Nico and his dad used to bond over before the divorce. The party started at two PM by 2:30, all the kids were there except the dad. Nico kept running to the entrance, pressing his face against the glass doors. Maybe he's stuck in traffic, he told his mom. She just nodded and suggested they start with games. I took photos of pin the tail on the donkey, ski ball competitions, the works. In every shot, you could see Nico's eyes darting toward the door. His smile got faker as the hours passed. Around four PM, his mom brought out the cake. Nico looked at her with these huge, hopeful eyes. Can we wait five more minutes? He's probably parking. She agreed. But five minutes turned into 15. The other kids started getting restless. Some parents were already showing up for pickup. Finally, his mom lit the candles. Nico stared at that empty chair next to him, the one they'd saved for his dad. And you could literally watch his heartbreak in real time. He made his wish and blew out the candles, but there was no joy in it. That's when his phone buzzed. His little hands shook as he read the text. His face went completely white. He showed it to his mom and I watched her jaw clench as she read it. What did it say, Ben asked. Nico's voice was barely a whisper. He said he got caught up with work stuff and maybe next time. No sorry, no explanation, just maybe next time. Worst part, this wasn't even the first time. His mom later told me this was the fourth birthday in a row his dad had bailed on. The other kids tried cheering him up, but Nico just sat there staring at that race car cake. When it came time to open presents, he went through the motions like a robot, fake smile, polite thank yous. But his spark was completely gone. On the drive home, I heard him telling his mom through the back seat that maybe his Dad had an emergency. Maybe something really important came up. Still making excuses for the guy who kept breaking his heart. When they got home, I helped carry the leftover cake and presents inside. Nico disappeared into his room with this one unopened box, a race car set he'd specifically asked for. His mom told me he was hoping to build it with his dad. An hour later, she found him asleep on his bedroom floor, still in his Superman shirt, arms wrapped around that unopened box like it was a lifeline. I deleted most of the photos from that party. Couldn't stand looking at them, but I kept one. Nico making his wish over those eight candles, hope still flickering in his eyes before reality crushed it.

Kimberly stumbled into my office sobbing so hard her whole body shook. Miss Moreno, I'm pregnant, she choked out. My parents will kill me. They'll disown me. I can't tell them. I moved my chair closer and lowered my voice. Breathe with me, in through your nose, out through your mouth. How far along? Four months, she whispered, clutching her oversized hoodie. I kept hoping the tests were wrong. She glanced at her stomach as if it might answer for her. I asked if she'd seen a doctor. She shook her head hard. They'll tell my parents I'm on their insurance. They check every explanation of benefits. They'll know. I slid pamphlets across my desk, adoption resources, local women's clinics and parenthood, and explained options in a neutral voice, pressing the importance of medical care. There are confidential clinics, I said. Sliding scale. No insurance needed. She pushed the papers away. They track my phone. They check my bank. If I'm not where I'm supposed to be, they call the school. Her fear was practical, obsessive. I asked about the father. James is at MIT, she said, voice breaking. He doesn't even know. I documented the conversation, scheduled a follow up and gave her my number. She left clutching two pamphlets. Like talismans, felt uneasy, very aware of how fragile things could go wrong. Kimberly started coming in twice a week. Each visit showed her unraveling. Her face, thinned cheekbones. Sharpened with baggy hoodies, her jeans hung loose despite the roundness at her middle. Are you eating enough, I asked once. I'm fine, she insisted, fingers trembling. Just morning sickness. But morning sickness at 4 in the afternoon, irritability and weight loss and pregnancy set off alarms in my head. I warned her about malnutrition, about risks to the fetus. At our fifth session, she said, I've been researching. Her eyes avoided mine. There are clinics that understand my situation. I explained the danger of unlicensed providers and back alley procedure and marked reputable clinics on the pamphlet. She took them, but I can see she'd already made up her mind. Two weeks later, she arrived frantic. Her hoodie couldn't hide the belly anymore. She looked six months along and exhausted. I found a place, she said. They'll help me and my parents will never know. When I asked for details, name, location, licensing, she deflected, muttering about privacy and special circumstances. I documented everything, appearance, evasive answers, and the clinic she wouldn't name. Let me drive you to Planned Parenthood, I begged. They have counselors, she snapped. I said, I'm fine. Stood up unsteadily and left. She stopped coming. I checked with t. She was still in class, but increasingly unwell. Confidentiality rules tied my hands about contacting parents unless there was imminent danger. I called her once. It went to voicemail, my chest tightened, the way it does when you know it.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, as plenty of volunteers, I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The day when did you stop trusting the fun parent. My daughter and her best friend are besties for life. One time I asked my daughter, Maggie, 8, if she wanted to get married. And she said, Mommy, I'm already married to Stacy. Greg, Stacy's dad, was the fun parent who built blanket forts until midnight and made pancakes shaped like their initials. Maggie literally counted down days until her next sleepover there. But then the next invitation came and Maggie said she was too tired, which seemed odd for a kid who never stopped moving. The following week, I found Stacy's mom's invite about Saturday's sleepover crumpled in Maggie's backpack hidden under her library books. When I asked about it, she mumbled something about forgetting and wouldn't look at me. That same day, I found a camera in her bag, one of those expensive digital ones. And when I asked where it came from, she froze. It's for a class project, mom. For what class? I don't know. Just leave me alone, she screamed. It was the first time she had ever raised her voice in weeks. Maggie went from my little tomboy who lived in Dinosaur shirts and thought brushing her hair was optional to suddenly begging for pedicures, asking if she was pretty enough, obsessing over scented lotions at target. She stood in front of the mirror for 20 minutes one morning just staring at herself. And when I asked what she was doing, she said, making Sure I look right. He was 8 when Stacy's mom called about the upcoming sleepover. That Friday, Maggie overheard and started crying so hard she couldn't breathe. Just ran to her room and slammed the door. The next Monday at school pickup changed everything. Greg waved from across the parking lot like always, calling out, hey, Maggie. And my daughter grabbed my hand so tight her nails dug in, hiding her whole body behind me. Her entire body was shaking in the car. She kept checking the mirrors to make sure his car wasn't behind us. She wouldn't wear her favorite Dinosaur shirt anymore, the one she'd worn twice a week for months, saying she needed to look grown up because she was almost an adult. I also noticed she suddenly had money, random dollars in her piggy bank. She couldn't explain. I found it, she'd say. But none of it made sense because an eight year old doesn't just find $50. When my husband and I gently asked if Mister Greg had done something, she shook her head so violently I thought she'd hurt her neck. She just kept saying no, no, no, over and over. More things kept appearing in her room, a magnifying mirror I'd never bought. Concealer from a brand I don't even use so much. Nail polish she could open a salon. And these homemade friendship bracelets, but weird ones with be.

Monica and I were getting married in 10 weeks. I was signing our wedding venue contract when she stopped me. We should date other people before we get married. The pen fell out of my hand. I laughed because I thought she was joking. I'm serious. It will make us stronger. She showed me an article on her phone about open relationships. She had saved it two months ago. Two months she'd been planning this. While I was planning our honeymoon, her phone kept buzzing with texts. She grabbed it and smiled at whatever she was reading. She said we needed to explore ourselves before getting married. She said we'd be more confident in our choice. She even mentioned that her best friend, Jenna, never took risks and had a boring life. The whole time she was talking, her phone kept lighting up with messages. He kept checking them while talking to me. Something was wrong here. Fine. If you think dating others will help us, let's do it. Her face lit up completely. She looked like she'd won something big. She immediately started texting someone back really fast. I could hear her nails clicking on the phone screen. She thought I would just wait at home while she dated other people. She had no idea what was about to happen. What the first date night came. Monica spent three hours getting ready. She wore a brand new black dress. She'd Bought just for tonight. Her coworker Kyle picked her up and she practically ran to his car. Then Jenna called and asked if I wanted to get dinner. Monica said, you guys are opening things up. She said quietly, yeah, she's with Kyle right now. Jenna went silent for a long time. I knew something was happening with them at dinner. Jenna barely touched her food. Monica's been lying to me, too, she said. Remember her work conference last month? She never went. Her hands were shaking. How do you know? I saw her location on Find My Friends. She was at Kyle's apartment the whole weekend. When I asked her about the conference, she gave me all these fake details about sessions she attended. I reached over and touched her hand. She didn't pull away. We should keep this between us, I said. Don't tell anyone about the open relationship. Let Monica think everything's working perfectly. Jenna nodded. We need to document everything she's done, get evidence. We were both angry and hurt. This was about justice. That night, I heard everything through our bedroom wall. Monica had brought Kyle back to our apartment. Every sound, every word, everything. She was completely oblivious that I could hear them. I texted Jenna, can I come over? 20 minutes later, I was on her couch while she made us tea. She doesn't even realize you can hear. Jenna said about the noises. She's too caught up in Kyle to think about Anything else? We spent hours planning how to expose Monica's lies. When I left at 4:00am, she gave me her spare key in case you need to escape again. After that first week, Jenna and I met daily to collect evidence, screenshots of Monica's fake conference receipts, photos from Kyle's social media that proved her lies. She'd bring me lunch when I forgot to eat during our planning sessions. Two sugars? No.

My mother only wanted to starve one of her children, me, not my perfect sister with her size 0 homecoming dress, just me, the eldest daughter who took up too much space. When I was 11, we were all sitting around the table when my dad asked, why is Lauren's my name plate empty. Before I could speak, I felt Mom's perfectly manicured nails dig into my shoulders. She already ate. Had a big snack after school, didn't you, honey? My dad ruffled my hair, distracted. And from there, my mom got crafty. My dad's 16 hour shifts meant meal time was her territory. By the time I turned 13, the routine was carved in down. Every morning at 6:00am while dad was in the shower, mom would make me stand on the scale she kept hidden in her closet. 65 pounds she'd announced that particular morning, her voice tight with disappointment, up two pounds from yesterday. No breakfast or lunch today. But mom, the doctor said I'm growing. I was then cut off by the sound of her pulling out the lunch boxes. My little sister Ava's got a sandwich, cookies, apple juice. Mine got three celery sticks and a single rice cake. Mom, please, I'm shh. He pressed a finger to her lips. Do you hear that? That's dad's shower turning off unless you want Ava to skip meals. Too. You'll smile and say goodbye like a good girl. And I never told my dad directly, but I gave signs. Is it normal to feel dizzy when you stand up? I asked him once over dinner, my mom's laugh was light and airy, like an empty stomach growling. You know how dramatic teenage girls can be. I was the same at her age. By winter, things were falling apart in ways even mom couldn't hide. My hair was coming out in clumps, putting them in the bathroom sink because I was too tired to clean up. And after I got caught fainting at school, my punishment was watching the family eat pizza while I had ice water. Dad texted that he was coming home early and mom scrambled to make me a plate that looked normal from a distance. When he walked in, he relaxed. Good, everyone's eating. That was when I stopped fighting. I looked in the mirror one morning and didn't see the skeleton everyone else saw. I saw what mom had been telling me for years, too much space, too much flesh, too much everything. You're right, I told her at breakfast. I'm disgusting, don't deserve food. For the first time in two years, she looked uncertain. Well, maybe just a quarter of an apple. No, I'm too fat for food. You were right, mom. You see, we both knew if I didn't eat anything, I would die. I was too depressed at that point to Care anymore. But to mom, it would mean lawsuits, four dates, potential life in prison. Dad noticed at dinner that night. Where's Lauren's plate? I'm not hungry, I said, my voice flat. The room went silent except for my stomach. It was growling so loud it sounded angry. She's mom started, but for once, she didn't have a lie ready. I haven't seen Lauren eat in three days, dad said. Slowly like he was putting pieces together.

We're in a rut, he said. We're basically roommates at this point. I was shocked. He went on about how I was always too tired to sleep with him anymore. But of course I was too tired. I was the only one working while taking care of two kids plus other chores he refused to touch. We've lost our spark. I mean, when's the last time you even worked on yourself? I wanted to ask, when's the last time he planned a date or bought me flowers? But I stayed quiet. He pulled out his phone and showed me articles he'd saved about ethical non monogamy. Other couples do this, and it makes them stronger, he said. We're secure enough in our relationship to handle it. Think of it as an adventure we're taking together. I stared at him for a long time. This man I've been with for 12 years, who I'd given two kids to, who hadn't taken me on a real date in three years, wanted to sleep with other people. If it will make you happy, I finally said, too exhausted to fight back. He came home from the gym practically floating. This yoga instructor gave me her number, he said, like a teenager who just got in his first date. He complimented my deadlift form, and we got to talking. Guess I've still got game. That's great, I said. Dryly continuing to fold laundry, he rolled his eyes at me. Can't you at least act a little happy for me? I ignored him. He immediately typed in the number she gave and sent a text. It was great meeting you today. I'm thankful for the number you've given, he said almost robotically, without an ounce of charm. No response. He sent a follow up three days later, asking, would you like to grab coffee this weekend? Still nothing. And for the rest of the week, he was constantly checking his phone, waiting for her to suddenly want him, when clearly she had given him a fake number. But that's when I realised he was serious about being open. This wasn't just some midlife crisis fantasy. He really wanted to do this. And it was a little humiliating. So I downloaded a dating app, thinking, if we were doing this, then we're both doing this. And while all his other dates turned into disasters, mine was different. My coworker mentioned her brother was single, he owns a bookstore. She said he's kind of nerdy, but really sweet. So I visited his bookstore just out of curiosity, and we ended up really hitting it off. He asked about the novel I'd started writing years ago, the one my husband called a waste of time, and said that it was the most interesting concept he'd heard in a long time. I blushed while we continued discussing it, and this guy was seriously Unreal, he remembered small details from our conversations and texted me good morning without me having to ask. And when we browsed at books, he never rushed me. But when I came home from my fourth date with him, my husband didn't look very happy any longer.

My cousin laughed. Wait, that was yesterday. My aunt showed photos, everyone smiling. My sister muttered, maybe take the hint. I stayed silent, but what I did next. Wiped their smiles. I should have known something was wrong the second my cousin laughed. It was the night after my nephew Liam's seventh birthday. I'd stayed late rinsing plates, still buzzing from the way his face lit up when I gave him the Lego set he begged for. For once, I felt included. So I said it without thinking. Can't wait for the big family dinner tomorrow. Tara froze, then burst out laughing. Wait. You don't know that was yesterday? My stomach dropped. My aunt casually pulled out her phone, swiping through photos. A long table with fairy lights, champagne, toasts, speeches. The annual reunion dinner, the one my mom always hosted, the one I've been at every year. And somehow I wasn't there. Oh, this is right before dessert, my aunt said. That's when your mom gave her speech about being surrounded by all her blessings. Her words shattered me. I turned to my sister. She didn't look up from the dish towel. Maybe take the hint next time, she muttered. Silence. My throat locked. I set the sponge down, picked up Liam's birthday card stuffed with a gift card, and slipped out the door. On the drive home, her words echoed a hint. Not cruel, not Angry? Just fact. Like I've been stupid to keep showing up. That night, I replayed every forgotten invite, every missing group chat, every photo I wasn't in. It wasn't mistakes, it. It's policy. I wasn't family. Fine. Then they could live without me. For years, I've been funding everything behind the scenes. College, savings for me as kid, emergency dental work, mom's roof repairs. All hidden as anonymous grants from my LLC. I never asked for credit, just wanted to help. The morning after, mom called in a panic, the AC is out eight grand. The guy you usually work with said the fund didn't come through. Did something happen? I dissolved the program. I said flatly, I'm sure everyone who was at the dinner can figure something out. I hung up. Within a week, every fund I'd set up was frozen. The safety net was gone. Two weeks later, my inbox filled with frantic voicemails. I ignored them. Then I remembered I still had admin rights to the family group chat. The one I'd created years ago. The same chat I hadn't been added to in months. I renamed it. Maybe take the hint. Then I removed every single member. No explanation. Just silence. But the lake house was the crown jewel. Legally, I owned half. Mom sold me her share years ago. They still treated it like communal property. Summers, reunions, weekends. I never blocked them. I even paid for the DOC last year. Not anymore. Mourning day. Their biggest tradition. I filed a partition clause restricting access unless new agreements were signed. Of course, Tara hadn't opened her mail. So Friday, I parked my truck across the driveway and waited. By noon, three cars rolled up. My sister, my mom, Tara. Kids tumbling out with floaties. Laughter died when they saw me. You're here.

For two years, I thought Kevin was just really dedicated to his job. He'd come home at 7:00am looking exhausted, shower, then sleep until three PM he always said the night shift paid better and there was less drama with the doctors. Made perfect sense to me. He's a respiratory therapist and I know those jobs are tough. Every Thursday night he'd pack his little lunch bag with those terrible gas station sandwiches he loves, grab his coffee thermos and kiss me goodbye. See you in the morning, babe, he'd say. And I'd already be half asleep. Sometimes I'd wake up around 2:00am and text him cute messages like hope your shift isn't too crazy with heart emojis. He always replied right away, which I thought was sweet. Last Tuesday, I had food poisoning from some sketchy sushi and felt absolutely terrible. Kevin had already left for work, but around midnight I was throwing up so badly I thought I might need to go to the er. I called the hospital main line and asked them to page Kevin in respiratory therapy. The night operator put me on hold for like 10 minutes. When she came back, she sounded confused. Ma'am, we don't have anyone named Kevin scheduled in respiratory tonight. Are you sure you have the right department? I told her his last name, described him everything. She checked again. No Kevin working anywhere in The hospital that night, my stomach dropped and it wasn't from the food poisoning anymore. I hung up and immediately called Kevin's cell. It went straight to voicemail. I called three more times. Nothing. I threw on clothes and drove to the hospital parking garage where Kevin always parked his beat up Honda. It wasn't there. At this point, I'm starting to panic and coming up with all sorts of crazy explanations. Maybe he got transferred to a different hospital. Maybe there was some emergency. I drove around for two hours checking other hospitals nearby. Nothing. Finally went home and waited until 7 a. M. When he usually got back right on schedule. I heard his car in the driveway. He walked in looking tired as all.

They sponsored the Cubs were just making inroads everywhere. But the real business success was ignoring New York and LA and basically picking the other 48 flyover states that Nike and Adidas did not care about at all. They embrace hunting and rural lifestyle and youth sports and went so hard on their DNA which was this click clack, really Agro, really focused in football. While Nike and Adidas strategy had always been going after teen athletes, under armour just went younger. They went after the 10 year old athlete.

I would like everyone to meet John Callis, who goes by Jack. So Jack here is obviously a Baltimore Ravens fan. And on Sunday, the Ravens beat the commanders. And after the game on Sunday, this viral video was taken where Jack and his buddies are walking down the street saying they're looking for stragglers, basically just anyone wearing a commanders Jersey. And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy in which after the fact he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page where it listed his job.

They were 10 and 3, and they lost in the first round. But at the end of last season, Nico wanted about $4 million in nil money, even though he was already slatted to make about 2.2 million a year. And mind you, this kid had Tennessee by the balls. He was gonna be their starting quarterback for the next two years. But for whatever reason, he transferred to UCLA out of the SEC for less money. And as you can imagine, Tennessee fans were pissed. So Nico thought the grass would be a whole lot greener at UCLA. Well, come to find out, it's not, because UCLA is now 0 and 3 to start the season. And they got blown out last night by New Mexico, who they paid $1.2 million to play. Which was at home, by the way. And this is what the crowd looked like. There's nobody there. Meanwhile.

Malavea had a holdout because he wanted more nil money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico and he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move.

Usain Bolt versus Joey Chestnut. Each of these guys has to eat one hot dog as fast as possible and then run 100 meter dash. Who wins? And guys, this competition is not close at all. First of all, shout out to the PGA Tour. I believe they were the first ones to come up with this hypothetical. But let's actually be tactical and analytical about this, because this competition is going to be won and lost. In the hot dog portion. Obviously we have Joey, who's the undisputed Glizzy Goblin. He's putting down a hot dog in about 1.2 seconds. Before you saying this is where he's gonna struggle. I think after people see Joey eat a hot dog, they underestimate how fucking hard it is to finish an entire hot dog with a bun. I literally just saw an average Joe try to do this. He finished one hot dog in about 30 seconds. I'm going to be super generous to you saying here, because he's a competitor and a superhuman, and say he finishes one dog in 15 seconds. That gives Joey a 13.8 second head start on the hundred meter. Now, of course, regardless of the hot dog portion, Usain is going to absolutely cook Joe.

Now, during this game, Georgia had a pretty big play. The guys running down the sidelines. But guess who was celebrating while he was running down the sidelines? Parker Jones. Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time, if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game. Was it stupid? Absolutely. You gotta be.

They first had Sterling, then their son bronze, whose legal name is actually Patrick Mahomes the third, and now golden. But come to find out that this tradition all started in college when Pat got Brittany a dog and named it steel after the Steelers. So when you really think about it, this whole naming tradition of a hall of Fame quarterback came from the Steelers. So they have a dog named steel, then they got another dog, named it silver, and they just said, shit, I love metal. And now their three kids are also named after metal.

Because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term. They can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team, and he's actually been practicing with Texas A M. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL, because one, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not likely.

Does this look like the stance of a running back who's gonna make the next three hours of your life living hell? Like if I didn't know who this man was and I walked onto that field, I'd thought I would be in for a cake walk that day. But he does this every single play. He's just standing there menacingly, just completely flat footed, hands down by his sides, not giving a single fuck, but just thinking inside of his brain how he's about to absolutely decimate that defense. So again, pre snap, the guy looks like this, not very intimidating and then he just proceeds to do shit like this, just completely running all over the field, jumping over guys, breaking tackles, stiff arming dudes into the shadow realm, just doing everything possible to make the defense look like they're 12 year olds. And next thing you know, he's five yards ahead of you about to run into the end zone. I mean, just look at this dude's face right here. A guy is like, who the fuck is this dude and how did he get past me, bro? Was just standing in the backfield like this two seconds ago looking like a kid who walked into his parents room at 3:00am saying, mom, I threw up. Everything about this guy.

We all remember a couple weeks ago when Michigan upset Ohio State right in. That game was followed by Michigan planting a flag at Ohio State, which then caused all this chaos, and it was just badness. Well, it was just announced yesterday that this guy has had enough of the flag planting at Ohio Stadium. So this guy right here is Josh Williams, and he's a state representative for Ohio. And yesterday he announced a new Bill for the state of Ohio that would make flag planting in Ohio a felony. This man is so tired of Ohio State losing and the other team planting a flag at midfield that he wants to make it illegal and a felony nonetheless. Thanks, Baker Mayfield. The Bill would prohibit planting a flagpole and flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field the day of a college football game. And to name this act the O H I O. Sportsmanship Act. Notably, this Bill specifically references Ohio Stadium, so would not include flag.

Now, this wife here is in the Ravens marching band and that's how they met. Apparently. I would imagine Steve met this woman when he was dressed up in the marching band for the Ravens for some reason. But in this viral post, the guy attached a video of him allegedly talking to Steve and he said, hey, Steve, I know you're, hmm, my wife. And Steve goes, sorry.

Well, it turns out that Steve is a freak. The wife here had Steve disguised as 3 in her phone. And here's just one text thread between the two of them, allegedly.

And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy in which after the fact he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it. Like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm on a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you all you need.

In that offer being a four year, ten and a half million dollar deal to play football at Michigan. Now, just for reference here, Brock Purdy, he got paid $3.7 million for his rookie contract, both for four years. Now, nobody knows what the hell's gonna happen, right? But this morning, Bryce posted this picture to his story. And the guy in this picture is Philip Wright, who used to be committed to Michigan, but is now committed to LSU. Now, to me, this seems like he's gonna stay at LSU, but I have no idea. But the fact of the matter is that recruiting in 2024 is insane. But now it's just got me wondering how much LSU offered him. And will he

A website that has saved millions of lives over the past years is now gone forever. As you can see here, the domain has been seized. This domain has been seized by Homeland Security Investigations. First time offenders convicted of criminal felony copyright violation face up to 5 years in prison, fines, restitution and forfeiture. And we all know that there is one, maybe two men behind this. This motherfucker right here, Dana White, has been after these guys for years. Even back in 2020, this dude was throwing out threats at press conferences. A reporter asked him about piracy and he was like, yeah, we fucking got one. You turn that shit on this Saturday, brother. We got you. And I'm sure the other guy behind it is this dickhead right here. What an asshole this guy is.

So what you're looking at here is a football player from the Colorado School of mines, they're a D2 football team obviously in Colorado, who went viral a couple years ago for their ridiculous looking headshots. So here are some of the best ones for this season released yesterday. First up, we got Braylon Tate, put a little gray in his beard and his hair. Joseph Capra looking like he's saying it's just a phase mom. Declan Ford here who's probably gonna get sued for copyright infringement because I can't tell if this is him or if it's the damn Rizzler. Then Jalen Thomas who put a little blue in his beard. A lot of them did this, such as Brock who only put it on his eyebrows. And the Brady here who's uh, he's definitely got some personality. Sean Gilbert here splitting his hair right down the middle, simple but effective. Aaron Gallagher with the picture of the century handlebar mustache and a Bandana on the head, 10 out of 10. And then there's Chandler Poignancy who looks like he should be a member of British Parliament. Here you here you looking motherfucker Braden with a wild hairstyle. Ty with some great beard trimming. Dominic who's going for the Wolverine look. Christian, who I don't think I would want to see in a dark alley at 11 o'clock at night looks.

So this is the brand new Philip Beard Stadium for the Buford Wolves down in Georgia. And holy shit, this place might be the most advanced high school football stadium in the entire world. The entire place holds 10,000 people. It's obviously a turf field. They have a jumbo Tron box seats, again for high school football in security, anything you could ever imagine. And again, it cost $63 million to build a high school. Now just for reference, this stadium you're looking at behind me is a Division 1 F B s school. This is Sam Houston Stadium. It only holds 4,000 more people than Buford. But I think the best feature of this new stadium is this thing right here.

The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange, a bright orange and there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white, different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest and innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014 and they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the high.

And David's been thinking a lot recently, you know what, I love Kansas so much, I'm gonna give them $300 million, the single largest donation in college sports history. In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it. And it's once again proving that college football is a pay to win game. Now, if you wanna win the Big 12 as much as David does here, Baylor better put 300.

In the first two weeks of the NFL season, we've seen not one but two separate quarterbacks who have turf toe, and they're gonna be out for a while. No. 1 yesterday, obviously being Joe Burrow because he doesn't have an offensive line. And No. 2 last week, Brock Purdy. Like Joe Burrow's about to be out for three months because of this toe injury. But what in the hell is turf toe? apparently it's a very excruciating injury with a cute little nickname. So basically what turf toe is, is when you bend your big toe back so far, all the stuff that holds the joint together, either one gets stretched or torn. And it's this little joint slash ligament thing right here in your toe. But the best way to describe it is like this, imagine taking your thumb and bending it straight back until it snaps. Now, 1, I'm no doctor, and 2, I've never had turf toe, but from what everyone says, every single time you take a step and you have turf toe, it feels like someone is taking a knife and jamming it under your toenail every single step. So as you can imagine, it is not a pleasant injury whatsoever. And I think I gotta start a petition to rename.

Well, we found out what another guy would do this weekend. And the story is something. So over the weekend, this story went viral on X where this guy alleges that Steve Smith has been railing his wife. And this is the wife in question. Now, this wife here is in the Ravens marching band and that's how they met. Apparently. I would imagine Steve met this woman when he was dressed up in the marching band for the Ravens for some reason. But in this viral post, the guy attached a video of him allegedly talking to Steve and he said, hey, Steve, I know you're, hmm, my wife. And Steve goes, sorry. Now, of course, that pissed the husband off and he started going on a tirade cause Steve here is known as a family man. He's got a wife and 4 kids, always with his wife at events. He's a family guy. Well, it turns out that Steve is a freak. The wife here had Steve disguised as 3 in her phone. And here's just one text thread between the two of them, allegedly. And I mean, Jesus, Steve, boy, these two were texting all the time. He's sending selfies to her. I mean, Jesus. And then the husband proceeded to go into his wife's Facebook account and then post this with all the receipts, basically just.

Well, it was just announced yesterday that this guy has had enough of the flag planting at Ohio Stadium. So this guy right here is Josh Williams, and he's a state representative for Ohio. And yesterday he announced a new Bill for the state of Ohio that would make flag planting in Ohio a felony. This man is so tired of Ohio State losing and the other team planting a flag at midfield that he wants to make it illegal and a felony nonetheless. Thanks, Baker Mayfield. The Bill would prohibit planting a flagpole and flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field on the day of a college football game. And to name this act the O H I O. Sportsmanship Act. Notably, this Bill specifically references Ohio Stadium, so would not include flag planting at all.

So the man you're looking at right here, his name is Parker Jones and he's a walk on red shirt sophomore for Georgia football. And yesterday, Georgia was playing Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Now, during this game, Georgia had a pretty big play, the guys running down the sidelines. But guess who was celebrating while he was running down the sidelines? Parker Jones. Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game. Was it stupid? Absolutely. You gotta be better than that. But I mean, you can't tell me.

Their number exactly the same. Their colors exactly the same. Even the sleeves that they wear during games, exactly the same. Your pre game warm up hype routine, exactly the same.

I just keep showing pictures to show you how uncanny it is how much they look alike. Same haircut, relatively the same glasses, same hair, even down to the headband.

In the Netflix documentary they make on this guy is gonna win like 5 Academy Awards. If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, this guy's name is Nico I Amaliwa. Last year, Nico played for Tennessee, which is one of the best teams in the SEC. And this guy actually LED Tennessee to the college Football playoffs. They were 10 and 3 and they lost in the first round. But at the end of last season, Nico wanted about $4 million in N I L money, even though he was already slatted to make about 2.2 million a year. And mind you, this kid had Tennessee by the balls. He was gonna be their starting quarterback for the next two years. But for whatever reason, he transferred to UCLA out of the SCC for less money. And as you can imagine, Tennessee fans were pissed. So Nico thought the grass would be a whole lot greener at UCLA. Well, come to find out, it's not because UCLA is now 0 and 3 to start the season. And they got blown out last night by New Mexico, who they paid $1.2 million to play, which was at home, by the way. And this is what the crowd looked like. There's nobody there. Meanwhile, Tennessee is 2 and 0.

So this here is Alvin Henderson and he is a four star recruit out of Elba, Alabama. Now he's committed to Auburn. And this man is 5 foot 9, 200 pounds and a running back. So obviously last night, it's early in the season, Friday Night Lights, Alvin takes the field to win this game versus Mackenzie. Alvin had 40 carries for 435 fucking yards and 10 touchdowns. 435 yards and 10 touchdowns. Some kids don't even do this in a season. If I started NCAA 25 and put Georgia versus Toledo, I don't think I could do this. So seeing that he had 40 carries for 435 yards and 10 touchdowns, you're probably like, damn, they must have beat the shit out of the other team, right? Yeah. So, uh, no, they lost the game. The final score of this high school football game was 80 to 78, 158 points scored in a single game. Now granted this game did go into overtime, but 158 points in one game is preposterous. But with this performance out.

I worked in marketing for a long time at Nike across American football, American basketball, Nike women. You wanna know some of the craziest differences between athletes at the highest level in America and athletes on these global stages? In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call them cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange. A bright orange. And there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white. Different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest in innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014. And they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the highest level.

In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange, a bright orange and there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white, different combo.

In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it.

I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot, is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move.

But over the past four years, there's been many attempts and even petitions with millions of signatures trying to get the team to change the name back, until finally, new owner Josh Harris said, that's not gonna happen. But then last week came along this guy. This guy right here is Steve Danes, and he's a senator in Montana, and he says that changing the name and the logo in 2020 was an example of woke gone wrong. But last week, the US Senate of energy and Natural Resources voted on the Bill HR 49 80 four. And essentially, what this Bill is trying to do is allow residential and commercial real estate where the old RFK Stadium used to be, which would then allow the commanders to build a new stadium. However, this Bill was only approved after the committee had conversations with the NFL and the commanders, and basically, the conversation seemed to be, okay, we'll give you the land, you can build your stadium, but you have to reinstate the old logo. And the plan is to get the logo reinstated and then have some of those proceeds go to Native Americans in sports and other things in the Native American community. It's also pretty important to Note that

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. So today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets at 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55%,

But in this viral post, the guy attached a video of him allegedly talking to Steve and he said, hey, Steve, I know you're, hmm, my wife. And Steve goes, sorry.

No.. 1 yesterday, obviously being Joe Burrow because he doesn't have an offensive line. And No. 2 last week, Brock Purdy. Like, Joe Burrow is about to be out for three months because of this toe injury. But what in the hell is turf toe? apparently it's a very excruciating injury with a cute little nickname. So basically what turf toe is when you bend your big toe back. So far, all the stuff that holds the joint together, either one gets stretched or torn, and it's this little joint slash ligament thing right here in your toe. But the best way to describe it is like this. Imagine taking your thumb and bending it straight back until it snaps. Now, one, I'm no doctor, and 2, I've never had turf toe, but from what everyone says, every single time you take a step and you have turf toe, it feels like someone is taking a knife and jamming it under your toenail. Every single step. So as you can imagine, it is not a pleasant injury whatsoever. And I think I got to start a petition to

But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football.

So today, we're gonna be talking about the UMHB Crusaders down in Texas. It's the university of Mary Hardin Baylor, which is a Christian university and a D3 school. But yesterday, they posted this picture to X, which was their team GPA. The team had a GPA average of 2.72, with 15 players having a perfect 4.0 and 51 players having a 3.5 or above. Now, at first look, you're like, 66 players with the GPA over 3.5. Like, that's good. But then that left us with some questions. If 66 players on the team have really good GPS, how did you get such a low average? Now, for what it's worth, a team GPS that is good is considered 2.3 or higher. So this 2.72, not too bad. Then people started to do some digging on this team. They found that the UMHB Crusader football team has 192 players. 192! There are 18 quarterbacks on this football team. Can you imagine being the 18th string quarterback on your team? Not only did we find that there's 190

Who went viral a couple years ago for their ridiculous looking headshots. So here are some of the best ones for this season released yesterday. First up we got Braylon Tate, put a little gray in his beard and his hair. Joseph Capra looking like he's saying it's just a phase, mom. Declan Ford here, who's probably gonna get sued for copyright infringement because I can't tell if this is him or if it's the damn Rizzler. Then Jalen Thomas, who put a little blue in his beard. A lot of them did this, such as Brock who only put it on his eyebrows and Brady here, who's. He's definitely got some personality. Sean Gilbert here, splitting his hair right down the middle. Simple but effective. Aaron Gall with the picture of the century handlebar mustache and a Bandana on the head. 10 out of 10. And then there's Chandler Poggenpohl, who looks like he should be a member of British Parliament. Here ye here ye looking motherfucker! Braden with a wild hairstyle. Ty with some great beard trimming. Dominic, who's going for the Wolverine look. Christian, who I don't think I would want to see in a dark alley at 11 o'clock at night. Looks like a cartoon character.

So this man right here is Shamar Stuart from Texas A&M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet. Because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term. They can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team, and he's actually been practicing with Texas A M. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL, because, one, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not likely. No. 2. He

He was top 10 in passing in the Big 12. But yesterday was just announced that Jake is transferring from BYU because he got suspended for violating the honor code. This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which of course is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023 and then in February of 2024, they were exchanging light hearted.

The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps,

Not only that, every position looks really good in this helmet. It has excellent Protection, it is super comfortable, and it looks super drippy bro. What more can you ask for? Beginning at number two we have the ride O speed. This helmet may not be as good as the speed flex, but it will get the job done. Honestly bro, what makes the speed super nice is that it feels lighter than the speed flex. Honestly bro, this is one of those helmets that you can literally make one of the drippiest looking helmets on the football field. Last but not least, we have the Ryde L Exo nom.

Two, if you and your position coach don't get along, it's time to go, because odds are he's already looking to replace you. This could also mean that he gives other players opportunities he wouldn't normally give them instead of giving them to you, even if you're the better player. And also common for guys to say, oh, my coach is tripping, that's why I didn't play. Everybody kind of looks at them a little bit crazy. But no, sometimes the coach genuinely is tripping or just downright lying to people. You wouldn't believe how much, oh, yeah, you're starting this week. you're gonna play a lot this week.

And let's be honest here, I don't know what it is, but this helmet just doesn't look as good if you're over an extra large in your size helmet. This. The F7 is a very compact helmet. Making this helmet super big just makes it look bulky. I don't know what it is, but SHUT only gives you an option of a lineman style face mask on the extra largest and above, which makes your helmet look more like the SHUT vengeance instead of an F7. Beginning at No. 2, this is obviously a no brainer. We got the price. This helmet bro, is expensive. Don't get me wrong bro, you are paying for quality. Expect to pay at least 500 to 700 dollars if you wanna buy this helmet. If your school provides SHUT F7 helmets, big props to you. If you find this helmet that is cheaper in person you are lucky. Majority of time is gonna be sold out in person so you gotta pay for it online. Paying for this helmet online is gonna run you a couple of dollars. Last but not least, we got breaking in this helmet.

NFC is where godly rosters get Qbs overpaid. And he's exactly right. If you're a rookie quarterback, you don't wanna play in the AFC right now, like it or not. Anyway you slice it, the four best quarterbacks all play in the AFC, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Joe Burrow. To make the Super Bowl, you have to be two of these guys. But in the NFC, that's not the case. There's very few Qbs, if any, you can point to in this conference that are true game elevators. The reason some of these teams are successful is because they're extremely well rounded rosters that have LED to their quarterbacks getting overpaid and their flaws getting exposed come playoff time. We know what happened with Dak Prescott. We know what happened with Daniel Jones. We know what I think is gonna happen with Sam Donald. We know it's gonna happen with Brock Purdy. This is just what it looks like. Now, the problem with those Qbs in the NFC right now is they can't out Superman. Whoever comes out of the AFC, when the chips are down, the system fails around them, they're not gonna be able to beat the Lamar Jackson's, the Patrick Mahomes, the Josh Allen's, the Joe Burrows of the world. And that's why whoever comes out of the AFC this.

And that's because history repeats itself. Three years ago, we had the Bengals and the Rams, the orange for the Bengals and the yellow for the Rams. Two years ago, we had the Eagles and the Chiefs, the teal for the Eagles and the red for the Chiefs. Last year with the Forty Niners and the Chiefs, the red for the Forty Niners and the purple for Taylor Swift because she was the main topic at this time. And then she, we have the Chiefs and the Eagles, the red for the Chiefs and the green for the Eagles. So it happened four years in a row. But now next year we have this. We have this right here. And what two teams do you think these are? And I'm not gonna lie to you guys, I see a lot of blue here. I see a blue on blue match up. The only thing that's throwing me off is this little San Francisco bridge and background right here. But even with that, I think the Super Bowl only has one answer and that is the Buffalo Bills versus the Detroit Lions. Blue versus blue. This could finally be the Super Bowl that everyone wants. You get Josh Allen versus Jared got this would be electric. If you guys do want free money on this year's big game, make sure you Sign up for Underdog Fantasy Better and Sleep Earth Code NFL combo.

The NFL has made it so that you could buy NFL Network and NFL Red Zone and stream it onto your TV for only $15 a month. But here's the thing. You're thinking $15 a month across the whole year, that's way too expensive. No, you only need to buy it from September to December. That's really it. I mean, the last NFL red zone is like January 7th or 8th, I think it is. So about $60 total for NFL red zone for the entire season. Especially if you're like a college kid, you know, you're living with your buddies and you all split it. This is an absolute deal. This is the NFL making a good step in the right direction. And next, what we need is a platform where you can stream every single game with zero blackouts. Because when I bought Sunday Ticket my freshman year of college and I had no cable, I was heavily disappointed because I couldn't watch Bears games on there because they were locally black.

No meddling, no owner for years. I always saw it as a weakness. Now I see it as a strength. Three straight quarterbacks. Star, star, star. All three farves in the hall of Fame. Rodgers will be and love looks like he's on his way. Think it's a coincidence Aaron Rodgers is 4 and 11 and now irrelevant? You think it's a coincidence that Sam Donald is having an unbelievable year? And in Carolina, in the Jets he was a tire fire? Aaron could have played earlier. Jordan Love could have played earlier.

And the answer is he had him from Day 1 and his name was Tyreek Hill. Matthew Stafford walked into Detroit and his best wide receiver from Day 1 was Calvin Johnson. Sure, the Lions weren't world beaters, but they immediately locked down their QB receiver duo for the future. Philip Rivers was drafted to the Chargers in 2004 and from day one his best receiving target was Antonio Gates. Not to mention prime Malcolm Thomas in the backfield. Holmes hasn't gotten an ounce of sympathy from NFL fans in the media because he inherited the greatest offensive cheat code of the late 20 in Tyreek Hill and arguably the greatest pass catching tight end in Travis Kelce. But every QB goes through a phase where they have a lot of weapons and then they don't. I think Tom Brady is a great example of this. And Mahomes actually did this in his last two Super Bowl wins. Tom didn't start with the great offense then got Randy Moss, but was still able to win at the highest level after Randy's departure with guys like Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, and Jake Hogan. Of course Rob Gronkowski. Does Lamar have the better offensive support?

I think at quarterback, Patrick Mahomes retired today. He's a hall of Famer. I think Aaron Rodgers, I always like better than Farve, is a slam dunk hall of Famer. Travis Kelsey could retire today. He's in. So is his brother Jason. At center, Trent Williams, maybe the best left tackle ever. He is on a short list. Aaron Donald, again, second best interior d lineman I've ever seen to Reggie White and it's close. Miles Garrett and Von Miller on the edge. They just play different and look different. Bobby Wagner has been a nine time all Pro. He's a hall of Famer. And Justin Tucker, the six or seven players to me that look like it's the waiting room. Joe Burrow is just different. He can go toe to toe with Mahomes and he doesn't feel inferior. Justin Jefferson is, is. Randy Moss to me like one of those level players. I think Nick Bosa, the edge for the Niners, Micah Parsons.

Jack only took a sip, not realizing it would turn him into her. He cut his jeans into shorts, revealing a seductive waist. Then he set a timer because the effect would only last for half an hour. Jack did this to take advantage of his wife's beauty. The wealthy man was very pleased with his appearance, quickly gave Jack a sports car. Jack eagerly accepted the deal, but then he noticed the timer had only five minutes left. He rushed out. When Jack returned home, the timer ended exactly and he returned to his original form. His wife wanted to ask him about the car, but Jack clearly had no intention of revealing anything. She noticed the thick hair on his legs, instantly understanding how he got the car. The next day, his wife asked Jack to take care of the kids, but he refused. She felt utterly powerless at that moment. The wealthy man called again to arrange a meeting, overwhelmed with excitement, asked his wife for more breast milk. She refused flatly, but Jack ignored her objections, set another timer and left for the meeting. When the magnate unexpectedly proposed to him, Jack accepted without hesitation. Back home, he immediately asked his wife for milk. An hour later, his wife handed him a bottle, but it only contained 10 milliliters. It was barely enough. The man demanded 100 bottles and pushed his wife into the Room. What he didn't know was she had used pig milk instead. He still didn't realize his face had transformed into that of a pig.

The little cake was washed away by the rain, while the slice of bread was riddled with holes from the falling drops. The food panicked and scattered. Every moment, another piece lost its life. For Miss Bread, the rain was deadly. One drop was enough to dissolve her completely. In that critical moment, a protective box shielded her from the storm, and they saved her. The food fled in terror towards shelter. In the chaos, a wine bottle shattered and peanuts were trampled. Just as they neared safety, a torrent surged in, sweeping all the food into the water. Luckily, the Sausage Brothers and Miss Bread hid inside a waterproof box, narrowly escaping disaster, and also hopped frantically trying to escape. Seeing the devastation outside, Miss Bread grew terrified. Little sausage Jack was brave, leaping onto a bag to save the mango and coconut, and carried them safely to shore. Meanwhile, Miss Bread was in the box, about to be swept into the sewer. Just when they thought all was lost, the chewing gum remembered. Great power comes with great responsibility. It pressed a button and slid into the drain, its elasticity blocking the entire pipe. The food seized the chance to climb over it, and with all their strength, they escaped the danger. After the rescue, the sausage tried to pull the gum back, but could only retrieve a small piece. The gum's sacrifice left him heartbroken. But it said, this is the most meaningful death I've had. And with those final words, it disappeared.

I'm not some pro photographer, but my friends and family always hit me up to shoot their stuff for free. Usually I don't mind because I actually love taking portraits. But sometimes people are such complete jerks that it makes me wanna throw my camera at their face. A few years back, this coworker, Ashley, asked me to do a family shoot on Mother's Day. I figured I had time before seeing my own mom and she said she'd cover brunch at this winery, so why not? We carpooled out there and I'm thinking it's gonna be Ashley, her husband Rick and their two kids, easy money. We get there and I see like 30 people standing around. Turns out it's Rick's entire extended family, his parents, both grandmas, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins, literally everyone, 27 people total. I'm immediately freaking out because I told my mom I'd be there by 3 and it's already noon. I pull Ashley aside and tell her I gotta leave in three hours max. He's like, oh, Rick will keep everyone moving. Don't worry. Famous last words. Brunch drags on forever. These people are drinking mimosas and telling stories like we got all day. I'm checking my phone every five minutes. Finally, at like 1:30, we start photos and I have maybe an hour and a half to work with. I asked Rick to help keep his family organized and he's like, absolutely, let's do this. So I Plan out the shots, group smaller families, couples, kids, standard stuff. Should take an hour tops if everyone cooperates. That's when Rick completely lost his mind. This dude starts screaming at people like a drill sergeant. I'm talking full on yelling at his 70 year old mom to move your ass faster and telling his 5 year old.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She he missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. Lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find That very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenagers, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very.

My teacher made us all have a signed seating and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone. Just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk, just one word, look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hand started shaking so bad I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag and I'd probably be first. I could pull the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me, the bathroom pass. I could ask to go to the bathroom, walk past it to the office, warn them quietly. They could call the police, lock down the school, do it properly. My throat felt like sandpaper when I raised my hand, Mr Peterson, can I use the bathroom? He barely looked up, just nodded and pointed to the pass by the door. I stood up, my legs feeling like jelly, trying to look normal, casual, like I wasn't about to potentially let 29 people die or get myself killed trying to save them. I grabbed the wooden bathroom pass, my hands sweating so much it almost slipped. As I reached the door, I heard another voice. Hey, can I go, too? I turned around and it was him. My heart stopped. Just wait until he gets back. But he was already standing up. It's an emergency. Sadly, something in his voice made our teacher wave.

Her mother in law smirked. Only close family gets a table. No place card for me. Sis giggled. Guess you don't count. I took my gift, said, then I'm leaving. Sis went pale. Wait. I knew walking into my sister Emily's wedding, I'd be background noise. She was always the golden child, the princess who got what she wanted, even when it came at my expense. I was used to it, but I wasn't prepared for how far they'd go to make sure I knew I didn't belong. The first slap came when I realized I wasn't in the wedding party. Not unusual, I told myself. Some siblings aren't. Then I Learned Emily's coworker, childhood neighbor, even her fiance's cousin's girlfriend were bridesmaids. That stung. The second slap was the seating chart. I went to grab my card, except it wasn't there. Not with my parents, not with my cousins, not anywhere. The wedding planner scanned her clipboard, then gave me that tight, pitying smile people wear when they know something's wrong. Oh, Alex, right here. She pointed. My heart sank. My seat wasn't in the grand ballroom with the chandeliers and champagne. It was outside, a lonely two top shoved near the coat rack where guests would dump jackets and ignore me all night. At first, I laughed. It had to be a mistake. But no, that was my assigned spot. Like I was luggage, I stormed into the Bridal suite. Emily was glowing, all teeth and diamonds. Our mother hovering like she was hand Maiden to a queen. Why is my seat in the hallway? I asked, holding up the card. Emily giggled. Actually giggled. Oh, that we had to prioritize. Close family. I stared. I am close family. Mom swooped in, sugary and sharp. Alex, don't make a scene. This is Emily's special day. I wasn't making a scene. I was trying to understand why my own family had literally shoved me out the door. Then Emily delivered the kill shot. You kind of aren't really immediate family anymore. The words landed like ice water. You moved out, you don't visit much. You're not married. It's just different now. Not immediate family. Because I dared to grow up? Because I wasn't still orbiting her. Before I could answer, another voice cut in. Emily's new mother in law. A woman I barely knew but instantly recognized, the kind who thrives on drama. She eyed me up and down with a smirk. Oh, so you're Alex. I was wondering who that little seat belonged to. My smile was tight enough to crack my teeth. Yep, that's me. The sibling who apparently doesn't count. She chuckled, full of fake sympathy. Well, you know how weddings are. Only the most important people get the best spots. And that's when it clicked. This wasn't a mistake. It was deliberate. And Emily was letting her laugh about it. Something inside me snapped. I Plastered on my sweetest smile and leaned toward the mother in law. Honey, you know what Emily said about you the other night? Emily froze her. M I L. Tilted her head. Oh, yeah. She was terrified you'd ruin her wedding photos with, uh. What was it? Emily? Oh, right. Your tacky dress. The room went silent. M I L's face hardened, Emily smile cracked. I kept going. Casual as poison. And she was so stressed about speeches. Said if you gave

This is Michelle Hempstead. Michelle had two dogs, a Rottweiler and a Pomeranian. Apparently, these two were great friends. In fact, the Pomeranian usually kind of took control, was kind of in charge of the Rottweiler. Even on July 29th of 2024, Michelle was feeding the two out of a 20 piece McDonald's chicken nugget. Usually, this was no problem. Sometimes she allegedly would even put a nugget or some food in her mouth and feed it straight to her Rottweiler. In particular, the palm and the Rottweiler had their own little thing. The Rottweiler, named Trig, would kind of do this chomp thing when he was telling palm, the Pomeranian, that he was gonna get the chicken nugget that she would throw up in the air for them. If palm wanted to get it, then palm would make a little snip and noise that would let Trig know that he wanted it. This time, however, both of them jumped for it. Neither one of them took the cue of the other. They got into a little fight. Michelle wanted to stop the fight, so she got in the middle of it. And while doing that, Trig clamped down on her arm. He unfortunately severed an artery. Now, Michelle got out of the situation, crawled over her balcony and towards the park for help. But unfortunately, she lost too much blood too fast, and she lost her life. What's Even sadder is just four weeks before this, in June, Michelle had just lost her daughter. Now, since Michelle was the sole owner of these two dogs, and she is now passed, the dogs were seized and disclaimed for destruction, meaning that now that they didn't have an aunt and owner, or they weren't claimed, they could now be put to sleep.

And we now have the results of the polygraph test that were given because of their disappearance. According to the court documents, their mother, Malaya passed the polygraph test as well as their stepfather Daniel. Their step grandmother Jamie also took a polygraph test. However, they said she wasn't suitable for it and they could not render an answer. Since their disappearance, there has been an extensive search for these children. And really the only material things that have been found is Lily's blanket that was about a kilometer from the family home on a tree. And they also found a piece of her blanket at the end of the driveway in a trash bag. There was also a potential footprint that police found. However, nothing came from it. If you haven't heard of this case, here is a quick timeline. Monday, April 28th and Tuesday, April 29th, both Lily and Jack went to school. Wednesday was a stay at home day. They didn't have school. And then Thursday, May 1st, around 6:00am, their mother messaged the school and said that Lily and Jack would not be going. She claimed that Lily had a cough. 2:25 That same day was the last verifiable sighting of Lily and Jack. They were seen on surveillance camera at a dollarama at night. The kids were put to bed in The same clothes they had on that day. And Jack had a diaper because he wasn't fully potty trained. The following day, May 2nd, Malaya, their mother, contacted the school again and said they would be staying home. At some point, Lily and Jack wake up and then Daniel and Malaya were in their bedroom. She said they were in and out of sleep. She was feeding the baby because they also have a child together. Lily pops into the room and they're hearing the children and then all of a sudden it's silent. At 10:01, Malaya calls the police and says she believes her children wandered away from the home. She said both children are possibly autistic. Apparently, they noticed that the kids boots were gone and Daniel decides to get in his vehicle, drive around and try to find the kids. And this is all what's being claimed by the parents. He said he went all around looking for them and that he didn't take his phone and he didn't even check the phone for the time. He was just searching for the kids.

I was working at GameStop during the PS five launch when this teenager walks in with his mom. Kid marches straight to the counter and demands, I want that PS five right now. I explain we're sold out. There's a waiting list. His mom immediately jumps in. Sweetie, maybe we can call other stores. This brat starts yelling, this is stupid. We have money. He kicks the display case, knocks over our Pokemon card rack. Other customers are staring. His mom just keeps apologizing, offering to pay for damages. I tell him to calm down or leave. He laughs and pulls out a wad of cash, waves it in my face. See this? This is more than you make in a week. His mom tries to put the money away, but he jerks back. Mom, stop. This loser needs to see what real money looks like. That's when he spots this quiet kid, maybe 12, carefully counting crumpled bills at the used game section. The entitled teen walks over and starts taunting him. Look at the this broke loser counting pennies, he announces loudly. Probably can't even afford a game. The quiet kid looks up embarrassed, tries to move away, but the team follows him, still waving his cash. What are you buying, poor boy? A five dollar game from 2015. I step over. Leave him alone. The team, he spins around fanning out hundred dollar bills. Oh, look, the minimum Wage hero wants to save his boyfriend. His mom finally speaks up. Honey, maybe we should just go to Best Buy. No, he shouts. I want the PS five from here. This idiot probably has one hidden in the back for himself. He pushes past me toward the employee area. I block him. He shoves me hard, nearly knocking me into the game wall. Don't touch me, peasant. My dad will buy this whole store just to fire you. The other customers are backing away. Now the entitled teen notices everyone staring and gets even louder. What? He's probably stealing systems. I bet he makes minimum wage and lives with his mom. He turns back to the quiet kid who's now sitting on the floor collecting his scattered money. The team drops the 20 dollar Bill next to him mockingly. Here's charity, bro boy, maybe now you can afford something decent. He kicks the rest of the money sending bills flying across the store. Pick it up, poor kid. Maybe you can afford a candy bar instead. The quiet kid starts crying, crawling around collect taking his money. The teen's mom finally tries to intervene. Sweetie, that's enough. Let's just leave. But her son pushes her hand away. I'm not done. This store owes me a PS five. He marches back to me, gets in my face. I know you have systems in the back. I stay calm. Sir, we don't have any PS Fives. I've told you three times. You're Lying. He slams his fist on the counter. Check the back room again. I'm not going anywhere. You need to leave. He pulls out his phone, dials a number. Dad, yeah, I need you to come here. This GameStop employee is refusing to sell me a PS five. I can hear yelling through the phone. No, dad, dad, I didn't break anything. Well, maybe a little, but he started it. More yelling. The teen hangs up, furious. My dad's coming here. You're so fired. He looks around wildly, spots the quiet kids still organizing his money and gets a nasty idea. Hey, bro, boy, stand up. The kid looks terrified but doesn't move. The teen walks over and towers over him. I said, stand up. You're going to tell everyone how this loser employee was mean to me? The quiet kid shakes his head. The teen grabs his shoulder, yanks him to his feet. Say it. Say he was rude to customers. Leave him alone, I warned. Moving closer or what you'll call security. This is a mall GameStop moron. There is no security. The team pushes the quiet kid toward the counter. Tell him you saw the employee being unprofessional, the kid whispers. I don't wanna lie. Then you're as pathetic as he is. The team shoves him hard into a game display. The quiet kid hits the metal shelf, games scattering everywhere. That's my breaking point. I walked over, picked up every Bill and counted it out loud.
