But once he pulled her out, he realized she was nothing more than a doll. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and he and his coworker continued their commute to the mall. Along the way, he casually wiped the doll dry and picked up a necklace lying beside her. The moment he touched it, the doll transformed into a real woman, but as soon as he set it down, she turned back into a doll. When he arrived at his workshop, stared at the doll's stunning features, secretly wishing she could become real. After checking to make sure no one was nearby, he couldn't resist leaning in for a quick kiss, and he went back to sorting the merchandise and absent mindedly removed the doll's necklace. Jesse, who had slept for a thousand years, suddenly awoke. She let out a sneeze, startling Jason so badly he tumbled onto the floor. Jesse, however, was thrilled because Jason looked exactly like her prince from a millennium ago. Just then, several workers from the delivery truck showed up. Jesse immediately froze, pretending to be a lifeless doll. After confirming the doll wasn't damaged, they left without suspicion. Jesse's stomach suddenly growled, so Jason drove her out to get food. She gazed at the world a thousand years later, amazed by everything around her. She even began eating enthusiastically.

He could pull treasures from his dreams directly into the real world. With this incredible gift, he amassed an enormous fortune. But a terrifying beast relentlessly hunted him through every dream, and each time he barely escaped back into reality. Yet this particular dream heist went terribly wrong. Just as he was about to seize all the cash, a grotesque monster materialized behind him and slammed him to the floor. Mike scrambled to his feet, battling the creature while desperately shoving money into his bag. And with a sharp kick, he sent the monster stumbling away. Then he used his mind to vacuum the remaining bills into his grasp, escaping the dream world only seconds before the Beast could grab him, bringing the cash into reality with him. That night, he instantly became the richest man alive, using crates of money to attract multiple girlfriends. But even with a life of absurd luxury, he still felt unsatisfied. He ventured into a cavern overflowing with treasure, his gaze locked onto a priceless golden belt around the waist of an old man sitting in the shadows. Mike lunged forward, ripping the belt straight from the old man's body. The elder burst into rage, and with a single finger pressed to Mike's chest, Mike realized the danger in an instant and fled for his life.

Then the doctor knocked out all of his teeth. After that, he was pushed together with a small cart into a massive shrinking chamber. Once he was settled inside, the doctor slowly closed the chamber door. Using a special key, the doctor activated the machine. Next, he set the internal temperature to 200 degrees. 30 minutes later, the door opened again. This procedure could reduce a normal adult to 1/200 of their size in an instant. To address Earth's overpopulation crisis, a doctor created this shrinking technology. It could compress an ordinary person to just 10 cm tall. This would drastically ease the pressure caused by overcrowding. Miniature residents produced in four years less trash than a full sized human generated in a single day. More importantly, in this tiny world, one thousand dollars held the value of 10 million. 1,000 square meter luxury villa cost only $99. As a poor man, he was naturally tempted by such an irresistible offer. So the next day he took his wife to visit the miniature paradise. They planned to undergo the shrinking procedure together. Before the process began, every bit of body hair had to be removed. Next, all their teeth had to be extracted. Teeth don't shrink. If left in, they would explode inside the skull. After completing all preparations, they too were pushed into the enormous shrinking chamber.

I had chronic neck pain from constantly tensing up around her. I'd stopped going to family events and Tom was getting angry about me isolating myself from his family. I was taking prescription pain killers for the headaches and spending hundreds on chiropractor visits. Denise had literally given me a neurological condition from repeated head trauma. But everyone still acted like I was overreacting to playful affection. The explosion happened at Tom's parents 30th anniversary party. It was a huge event with probably 70 people, including extended family and their friends. I taken preventive pain medication and was trying to stay in crowded areas where Denise couldn't easily reach me. But she was determined to get her hit in. She followed me to the bathroom and waited outside. When I came out, she smacked me so hard I saw stars and stumbled forward into the wall. I heard something pop in my neck and pain shot down my entire left side. That's when Tom's cousin Bradley turned the corner and saw me on the ground holding my neck with Denise standing over me laughing. Bradley helped me up and asked what happened. Denise said, oh, Lucy's being her usual dramatic self, pretending I heard her with a love tap. Bradley looked at her strange and said, I just watched you hit her full force in the head. That wasn't a love tap. That was battery. Denise tried to laugh it Off. But Bradley wasn't having it. He said, actually, I've been watching you do this all night. You've hit her four times already and it's only been an hour. That's not affection. That's abuse. Denise said Bradley was overreacting, too. But then Bradley said something that changed everything. You know what's interesting, Denise, you only hit Lucy. I've been paying attention for the last year and you don't playfully smack anyone else. Not Tom, not your parents, not your kids, not your friends, just Lucy. That's not a quirky personality trait. That's targeted harassment. People started gathering around because Bradley's voice was getting louder. Tom came over asking what was wrong. And Bradley said, your sister has been physically assaulting your wife for years and you've all been laughing about it. I just witnessed her hit Lucy hard enough to injure her neck and she's standing here smiling about it. Mom tried to defend Denise saying it was just how she showed affection. But Bradley pulled out his phone. Actually, I've been recording her doing it all night for evidence. Wanna see the compilation, full story on channel link below.

Then they handed me a folded letter with my name on it. Inside was a legal document titled notice of disownment with their signatures already dry at the bottom. When I asked what this, my mother simply said, you know why? And turned back to taking photos of my brother in his new car. That was last year. This morning, they showed up unannounced at my apartment, faces pale after hearing what I had done. My mother perched on my second hand sofa like she was afraid to leave an impression. My father remained standing, the vintage Rolex absent from his wrist. The trust fund, he said flatly, your grandfather's trust fund. You found a way to access it. Poured myself water, taking a slow sip. I didn't find a way. I always had a way. Grandpa made sure of that. Grandpa Elliott knew exactly what kind of people my parents were long before I did. While they showcased Brian's barely passing grades with expensive gifts, Grandpa quietly attended my science fairs. When I won the state mathematics championship, my parents were at Brian's baseball tournament. Grandpa was the only one who stood and applauded. He'd been the only one at my medical school acceptance dinner who seemed genuinely proud when he died during my second Year, they called it sudden. At the will reading, my parents sat smug, already planning how they would spend their inheritance. What they didn't expect was the trust fund, seven figures grown from decades of investment named solely to me. My mother had been livid. Brian has plans, too, she'd insisted. We'll contest it. Elliot was of sound mind, the attorney replied. He updated this trust three months ago with specific instructions. What nobody knew was that Grandpa had created a second trust, controlling 51% of the family business my father supposedly owned. Silent majority ownership activated only if two conditions were met. I completed medical school and my father turned his back on his children for money. The disownment papers signed weeks before Christmas qualified perfectly. Over the next year, I discovered everything. My father.

So I started acting extremely cold with her. She completely lost it. We've been married 12 years when she sat me down after our third therapy session and said the words that killed me. I only see you as my best friend now. I'm not attracted to you anymore. For three years, she'd been refusing intimacy. I thought it was stress from raising our two kids. Turns out she just been tolerating me this whole time. She even said she built up resentment toward me because I spent too much time with the kids instead of her. The therapist kept asking her why, what changed? When did the attraction die? Every answer was, I don't know. She couldn't give me a single reason. Then one night everything got worse. Came home drunk around midnight and basically crawled into bed begging me. I said no at first, but she kept pushing and crying until I gave in. Biggest mistake of my life. Next morning she woke up and wouldn't even look at me. I feel disgusted with myself, she said. Her voice cold. I have a rule about never sleeping with friends. That's what you are to me now, a friend. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. I asked her what I could possibly do to fix this. What was so unattractive about me? Her answer, I don't know. You're just not what I Want anymore but you're a great co parent and provider. She wanted to keep our roommate dynamic as she called it. Basically, I handle half the parenting, pay most of the bills and she gets to live her life without any of the marriage part. That's when something inside me just switched off. I told her, fine, we're roommates now. Starting immediately, I started implementing what they call the 180, complete eat emotional detachment. I stopped doing any of the little things I used to do for her. No more morning coffee made her way. No more helping with her work projects. No more picking up her dry cleaning. No more being her emotional support. She asked me to help her move some furniture in her home office. I said no. She looked absolutely shocked. Are you serious right now? Why are you being so petulant? You're in charge of your own life now. I said calmly, just like.

She admitted Tyler had been checking in on her every day since the sickness incident, sending her articles about toxic relationships. He'd even made her write down a list of my controlling behaviors. This dupe I made her controlling, the birthday gift I'd saved up for manipulation. She fell for all of it. I'm so sorry, she sobbed. I want you back. I'll do anything. My blood boiled. While I'd been destroying myself with guilt, Tyler had been executing a calculated takedown, and she'd been his willing puppet. Then she said the part that made me see red. I'll keep our relationship secret from Tyler this time. He won't be a problem. She still didn't get it. I told her I'd take her back on one condition. We had to text Tyler right now, tell him off for controlling her life, and tell him she was getting back with me anyway. She argued. She called it extreme, but eventually she did it. Sent me the screenshot. The second I saw it, I hung up and blocked her. Two days later, Tyler called from a random number, started screaming at me, calling me a liar, saying Macy was too good for me. Then he called me a bitch. I snapped. You're nothing but a backup boyfriend who will spend his whole Life driving other guys away. And guess what? When it mattered, Macy chose me over you. He burst into tears, hung up. Last week, my friend threw a party. Macy showed up with Tyler, both ready for a fight. She walked up while I was talking to another girl and accused me of cheating, calling me a phony in front of everyone. Tyler stood behind her, smirking. Actually, I said you should consider yourself lucky I gave you a chance at all. You're a spineless puppet. And Tyler's so insecure, he had to use a burner phone just to talk to me. You two are perfect for each other. I hope you end up together, because no one else should have to deal with people like you. Tyler started screaming. Macy dragged him out. The party erupted in cheers. Update three months later, I just found out Tyler and Macy are officially dating. Guess I was right about them being perfect for each other. I'm engaged now. To someone who doesn't have a psycho best friend controlling her life. We're getting married next summer.

I worked at the same insurance office for almost 10 years. Every single morning I'd stop at Jerry's Coffee on Fifth Street, order my usual black coffee and add what I thought was cream from the self serve station. My co workers always made fun of how strong and bitter my coffee was. They take one sip and make faces like I was drinking motor oil. How do you drink that garbage? My best mate Ashley would say watching me gulp down my morning cup. I just laugh and tell her I liked my coffee with character, strong and bold, just like me. The whole office knew about my weird coffee preference. Even during meetings, people would joke about how I could probably strip paint with whatever I was drinking. For almost a decade, this was my routine. Same coffee shop, same order, same weird looks from everyone who tried it. I thought I just had different taste buds or something. Maybe I was just tougher than everyone else when it came to bitter drinks. And one Tuesday morning, Jerry's Coffee was closed for kitchen repairs. A handwritten sign on the door said they'd be back in a week. I panicked a little because I'm not great with change. But I spotted another coffee place just two blocks down called bean. There I walked in and ordered my usual black coffee. Please, the young Barista with purple hair smiled and handed me the cup. Then I asked for cream on the side, just like I always did at Jerry's. She pointed to a small metal pitcher next to the sugar packets. I poured in my usual amount and took that first sip. My mouth almost dropped open. The coffee was smooth, creamy, actually enjoyable to drink. Instead of feeling like punishment, I thought maybe this place just had really good coffee beans or something. When Jerry's reopened the next week, I went back to my normal routine. But something was bugging me. Now, why did that other place taste so different? Was their coffee really that much better? I decided to pay closer attention to what I was doing. I walked up to the self serve.

I first noticed them in the cereal aisle, a well dressed woman carrying a crying little girl, maybe 3 years old. The child's face was red, tears streaming. But something about her cries seemed desperate, different, not like a tantrum. I'm a kindergarten teacher. After 15 years, you develop a sense for these things. The woman kept whispering. It's okay, sweetie, almost there. But she wasn't doing any of the natural things a parent does. No rubbing the back, no gentle bouncing, no terms of endearment that felt personal. I followed at a distance, pretending to shop. The girl's cries started changing, becoming more panicked. I want my mommy, she whispered. You said Mommy was here. The woman shifted uncomfortably. We are, honey. Just a few more things. Her eyes darted to the exits. When they reached the dairy section, I saw another woman with a cart full of groceries. She was younger, probably early 30s, talking frantically on her phone. I don't know, John. She was right here. I just turned around for a second to grab her juice. He knows not to wander off. No. She was wearing her favourite butterfly clip. The purple and silver one. Yes. And her yellow polka dot dress. My stomach dropped. The crying girl was wearing exactly that, a yellow polka dot dress and a butterfly hair clip, purple and silver, just like the one the younger woman was now Clutching in her free hand, I stepped closer to them, acting like I was reaching for milk. The girls next words confirmed everything Mommy had.

He talked about it like he was building a team. But when I was born and the nurse said it's a girl, my dad didn't even come near me. He walked out of the room, didn't talk to my mom for two days. She laughed when she told me that I didn't. That moment set the tone for the rest of my life. My brothers were treated like kings. My dad took them to fancy schools, bought them new bikes and always made sure they had the best. I was sent to a small, poor government school, no library, broken chairs, big classes. But I worked hard anyway. I studied under street lights when the power went out. And somehow I got better grades than all of them. But even when I came home with medals and top marks, they brushed it off. My grandma once said, smart girls are still just girls. My dad said, let's see what she does with all that studying. Girls just end up in kitchens anyway. Still, I kept pushing. At 18, I got a full scholarship for writing. I was the first one in the whole family to earn that kind of opportunity. I brought the letter home, heart racing. My mom. Smiled softly. My dad glanced at it and said, so you're finally leaving. I packed my bags. No hugs, no goodbyes.

My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

She called me at midnight. How are you doing this? I am going insane and I still have my phone. I told her the truth. I stopped missing it after week 3. Day 65, the family had a barbecue. Everyone was on their phones. I was the only one actually present. My nephew asked me to play catch. We threw the ball for an hour. Day 70, my Aunt Sharon admitted she checked her phone 247 times that day. The average was 96. She looked exhausted. Day 75, Sophie told me she deleted Instagram, said I inspired her. We started a book club with my neighbors. Eight people showed up. Day 80, Emma called the lawyer. Her voice was shaking. I cannot do this anymore. Watching him made me realize how addicted I am. I forfeit. Day 85, Brad dropped out, too, said his wife threatened divorce because he was on his phone during family dinner every night. Day 89, just me left. The lawyer called. You won? Come get your keys tomorrow. At night, I could not sleep. I kept thinking about Uncle Michael, about what he really wanted. Day 90, I walked into the lawyer's office. The whole family was there. Emma looked defeated. Brad looked ashamed. I told the lawyer I did not want the house. Sell it. Split the money between everyone equally. My aunt gasped. Emma started crying. Why would you do that? Because Uncle Michael was not testing who could live without a phone. He was testing who was willing to change. And I already got what I needed. Emma handed me her Audi keys. Anyway, you earned this. I sold the car, paid off my student loans, took Sophie to that restaurant where I had the panic attack on day 8. We laughed about it, ordered without looking anything up. She moved in with me. Six months later, we still do not have smartphones. Best cold bet I ever accepted. Uncle Michael knew exactly what he was doing.

My uncle died and left his beach house to whoever could prove they deserved it most. The whole family showed up to his lawyer's office expecting some treasure hunter riddle. Instead, the lawyer said, Michael wanted you to compete. Whoever can go 90 days without their phone wins the house worth 2.3 million. My cousin Brad laughed. That is insane. I need my phone for work. My aunt Sharon said, this is ridiculous. How are we supposed to function? How? But I looked at my phone. The screen time report said 11 hours a day. I was the worst one there. I will do it. Everyone stared. My sister Emma smirked. You cannot even go two hours without checking Instagram. Bet. If I win, you owe me your Audi. Deal. She thought I would crack in a week. Day one felt like withdrawal. I kept reaching for my pocket and grabbing air. My hand would go numb without that familiar weight. Day three, my hands were shaking at dinner. I had to sit on them to stop checking. Day five, I woke up in a cold sweat because I dreamed I accidentally opened Twitter. Day eight, I had a full panic attack at a restaurant because I could not not look up the menu online. The waiter had to talk me through the options like I was a child. Day 10, Emma started her campaign. She texted the family group chat, he is definitely cheating. Check his laptop. No way he is lasting. The lawyer confirmed I had not touched any device. My mom vouched for me that I was using a flip phone only for emergencies. Day 15 was the hardest. My best friend got engaged and everyone was celebrating in the group chat. I found out three days later when someone called me on my dumb phone. I almost quit right there. Day 20, something shifted. I started actually talking to my neighbours. Mister Patterson told me about his time in Vietnam. I had lived next to him for six years and never knew. Day 25, I went to a coffee shop and met a girl named Sophie. We talked for two hours. No phones, just conversation. She did not believe me when I said I had not touched my phone in weeks. Day 30, I invited Sophie to dinner. We played board games. She said, this feels like the 90s. I did not realize how much I missed actual connection. Day 35, my boss called me into his office. Your work quality has doubled this month. What changed? I told him about the bet. He said, whatever you are doing, keep doing it. Day 40, Emma was getting nervous. She invited me to every family event.

So I invited the victim over for dinner without telling my daughter. My 14 year old Sophie had always been popular, Ree Council, SIBO team, the friend everyone wanted. So when I got an email from school about concerning behavior, I assumed it was a mistake. Then I saw the front, kill yourself. Nobody likes you anyway. Even your mom probably wishes you were dead. Do everyone a favor and disappear. A fashion after message to a girl named Rachel sent from Sophie's Instagram account. My hand shook as I scrolled. This wasn't my daughter. The Sophie I knew volunteered at animal shelters and helped younger kids with homework. But the Tibetan Sams didn't lie. During family movie night, during her study group, even during church, I didn't confront her immediately. Instead, I did something that still makes my husband think I'm insane. I found Rachel's mother on Facebook and invited them to dinner that Friday, telling her I wanted to connect with families in Sophie's grade. Just some people from school, I said. Watching her nod absently while texting on her phone. Friday arrived. When the doorbell rang, I asked Sophie to get it. I'll never forget the color draining from her face when she saw Rachel standing there with her mother. The silence stretched until Rachel's mom cheerfully said, isn't that nice? Dinner was excruciating. Sophie barely spoke while Rachel picked at her food. Eyes down, I Kept the conversation flowing, asking Rachel about her interest, her classes, her artwork. With each question, Sophie seemed to shrink further into her chair. Rachel's quite the artist, her mother said, though someone at school keeps ripping down her drawings from her locker. Sophie's fork clattered to her plate. After dinner, I suggested the girls go to Sophie's room while we adults had coffee. Sophie's eyes pleaded with me, but I remained firm. Go on, show Rachel your new art supplies. Twenty minutes later, I.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve. Have been helping mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody. She looked me in the eyes and said, I would never keep your children from you for six months. She actually kept her word, and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days, and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup, and there was a for sale sign in the yard, and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying, we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job, and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour, dissociating, because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles. Away for months while looking me in the eye every Friday. The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered, and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me wanna run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp already wearing work clothes, even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me cause she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I'd gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding, when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort, and then suggested I might want to start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting Coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

Chuck Norris had a court appointment, but the judge didn't dare to show up. Chuck Norris doesn't turn on the shower. He stares at it until it starts crying. When Chuck Norris was young, he didn't play in the sand. He played in the concrete. The universe expands because everything is trying to get as far away from Chuck Norris as possible. Chuck Norris, in fact, uses a stunt double, but only for crying scenes. Chuck Norris got a hole in one with a bowling ball.

My real name was Anakin Skywalker Smith. Not a nickname. Not my middle names. That was my actual legal first and middle name printed on my birth certificate. My parents met at a Star Wars convention in 1997, got engaged at another convention, had a Star Wars themed wedding, and when I was born in 2,002, they thought naming me after the main character would be the ultimate tribute to their favourite franchise. They love Star Wars so much they had a room in our house dedicated to collectibles. Spent thousands on replica lightsabers. Went to every movie premiere in full costume. When I was little, it didn't matter because kids didn't get the reference yet. Elementary school was manageable because most kids hadn't seen the movies. Teachers would smile awkwardly when they read my name, but nobody made it a big deal. Then fourth grade happened and the revenge of the Sith came out. Suddenly, every kid in school knew exactly who Anakin Skywalker was and what he became. A kid named Marcus stood up in the cafeteria and yelled, there's Darth Vader! And the entire lunchroom lost it. Within days, kids started making breathing sounds when I walked by, doing force show gestures, calling me the chosen one in this mocking tone. Someone put a Darth Vader mask in my locker. The jokes never stopped. Middle school destroyed me. Every single teacher who called roll Would pause at my name. Some would even laugh, thinking it was funny, like my parents did something clever. Kids who didn't know me would hear my name and immediately start quoting the movies. I ate lunch in the library because the cafeteria was constant harassment. Someone started a petition as a joke to get me to change my last name to Vader. It got a 150 signatures before a teacher confiscated it. I begged my parents to let me go by my middle name, Skywalker, but my dad said that's even worse. And my mom insisted I should be proud of such a unique, powerful name. They genuinely thought they'd given me this amazing gift. By eighth grade, I stopped introducing myself entirely. I just say, call me whatever you want, because I knew the second I said my real name, people would either laugh or immediately start making Star Wars references. I started skipping class.

Oh, she's exaggerating. That's not what happened. Nobody wants to hear about that. After dinner, Nathan asked if we could talk outside. My stomach dropped. This was it. The lecture about how I was making things awkward, how I needed to be more supportive of my sister's happiness. We stood on the back porch, string lights casting shadows across the yard. He was quiet for a long moment. I ask you something. His voice was careful. Does she always treat you like that? I didn't know how to answer. My throat felt tight. He continued. Because I've watched her tonight. The way she talks over you, dismisses everything you say, makes these little comments that sound like jokes but aren't. He paused. And you just take it. Why? She's my sister. That's just how we are. That's not normal. His jaw was tight. I've been around your family for months now, and I'm just now realizing. She does this constantly, doesn't she? And everyone just lets it happen. I shrugged, trying to seem unbothered. It's fine. I'm used to it. That's the problem. He ran his hand through his hair. You shouldn't have to be used to it. Then he said the words that changed everything. I proposed to her thinking she was kind, generous. The person she is when we're alone. His voice cracked slightly. But after tonight, after really watching how she treats you, I realized something. The person I thought I was marrying doesn't exist. She's performing. And when the performance drops, this is who she really is. He looked directly at me. You're exactly who I wish she was. Patient, genuine. Someone who doesn't need to tear others down to feel important. My heart was pounding. Nathan, don't. I'm not saying this to make things weird. I'm saying it because I can't marry her. Not after seeing this. He pulled the engagement ring off his finger. I'm ending it tonight. She'll blame me. She'll blame everyone but herself. But that's not your problem anymore. He walked back inside minutes later, shouting, bar, doors! Gravel! My sister called 37 times. I didn't answer. Three days later, she showed up at 2:00am, makeup smeared, shaking. You seduced him. You ruined my life. I looked at her and felt nothing. Good night, Claire. I closed the door. Six months later, I ran into Nathan at a coffee shop. He smiled. Still taking it? I smiled back. Not anymore.

Growing up, she made sure I knew my place. You're the practice sister. The one guys date before they find someone like me. She'd say it at family dinners, at parties, anywhere with an audience. When I got my first boyfriend at 16, she told him I had commitment issues. Broke up with me two weeks later. When I got into community college, she announced at Thanksgiving that not everyone can handle real universities. Meanwhile, everyone hung on her. Every word about law school rankings and internship offers. The pattern never changed. Any achievement I had got minimized. Any relationship I started got poisoned. She'd befriend my boyfriends, plant seeds of doubt, and comfort me when things fell apart. You're just not relationship material, she'd say, rubbing my back. Some people are meant to be alone. By 25, I'd stopped trying, stopped dating, stopped sharing anything good that happened in my life because she'd find a way to ruin it. Then she met Nathan. Perfect Nathan, with his finance job, his tailored suits, parents, summer house in Cape Cod. She paraded him around like a trophy she'd won. Posted couple photos constantly with captions about finally finding someone who sees my worth. At Sunday dinner, she'd make him tell stories about expensive restaurants and weekend trips. She'd touch his arm possessively. Whenever I walked into The room. Like I might steal him just by existing. Six months in, they got engaged. The ring was massive. She made sure everyone saw it, holding her hand up to the light at every opportunity. The engagement party was at our parents house. She. It invited everyone. Nathan's colleagues, law school friends, distant relatives who barely knew us. That morning, she cornered me in the kitchen. I need you to tone it down tonight. Nathan's colleagues are here and I can't have you embarrassing me. She looked me up and down. Maybe wear something plain. Black is good on you. And try not to talk too much about your job. Nobody wants to hear about retail management. I wore black, stayed in the corner, smiled politely when people talked to me, gave one word answers. But Nathan kept glancing at me during dinner. Not in a creepy way, more like he was trying to figure something out. Like he was seeing something he hadn't noticed before. My sister noticed too. She got louder, more animated, touched his shoulder, constantly interrupted me every time I started.

I have this terrible habit of doing everything last minute, and I mean everything. Homework done during lunch, project night before, studying for tests. What's studying? I just walk in, pray, and somehow scrape by with a C plus. My parents hated it. Teachers would literally beg me to just try for once. But honestly, it kept working. So why change? Then 8th grade hits and they announce the big one, this massive final exam that decides if you even move on to high school. Like fail this, you're repeating the entire year. Hello. Everyone in my grade was panicking. Kids were making study schedules three weeks out, forming study groups, buying practice book. My friend Terrell dude made flashcards, physical flashcard in 2024. I'm talking color coded, laminated, organized by subject like he was preparing for the SATs. Meanwhile, I'm over here telling myself, yeah, I'll study. I got time. Week before the exam, I discovered this new show, binge the entire thing in three days. Two days before, my cousin wanted to play basketball all afternoon. Did I say no? Absolutely not. We were out there for hours. I came home sweaty, exhausted and still haven't cracked open a single notebook. The night before, I'm sitting at my desk, notes stacked up, textbooks open, highlighters ready. I'm ready to lock in. Then I remembered I was stuck on this one level in my game, just one level. I Told myself one level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2:00am. I'm half asleep and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. I went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning, I drag myself to school running on four hours of sleep and vibe, literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flash cards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. I open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing. Science, picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully, because there's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in and my teacher just looked at me disappointed, headshake that says I'm not even surprised. I went home fully prepared to tell my parents I'm staying in middle school another year, already planning my excuse, my apology speech, the whole thing. Two weeks later, grades drop online. I'm sitting there on my phone terrified to even Look, heart pounding, palm sweaty, I slowly scroll to my name, closed my eyes, opened them, saw 84%. And 84 I passed. Not only passed, but got a whole B. I just sat there.

Silently, my eight year old son was having nightmares about his math teacher. She makes me stay after class and says I'm stupid, he whispered one night. Tears streaming down his face. His little body trembled as he described how she'd make him erase and redo his work repeatedly while other kids went to recess. I was skeptical at first. Missus Whittaker had excellent reviews and a teaching award displayed prominently in her classroom. Parents fought to get their kids into her class. But when Jake's grades plummeted and he started faking stomachaches every morning, I knew something was wrong. The final straw was finding him hiding in his closet on a Monday morning clutching his math workbook and sobbing. Please don't make me go, mom, please. His voice was so small it broke my heart. My husband thought Jake was exaggerating. Kids don't like strict teachers, he said with a shrug. She's probably just pushing him to excel. At the parent teacher conference that week, Missus Whittaker was all smiles and professionalism in front of my husband. Jake just needs to apply himself more. He gets distracted easily. Her voice was honey sweet as she showed us his sloppy work. But I caught something my husband missed, the way Jake physically recoiled when she reached toward him, as if expecting a strike. On our way out, she placed her hand on Jake's shoulder and squeezed. We'll work harder next week, won't we? The Fear in his eyes confirmed everything. The principal dismissed my concerns without evidence. She's been here 20 years, Missus Collins. We've never had a complaint. He leaned back in his chair, barely hiding his annoyance. Children sometimes misinterpret constructive criticism as personal attacks. That night, I researched my options while Jake slept fitfully in our bed. Switching classes mid year wasn't allowed. Homeschooling would take weeks to arrange. The school board wouldn't act without proof and it would be my son's word against a respected teachers. So I bought a tiny voice recorder and carefully put it into the inner pocket of Jake's backpack. I showed him how to press the button under his desk each morning, making it seem like a secret game between. This is just to help me understand your day better, I explained, feeling slightly guilty about making him complicit. Our little secret. Okay. Three days later, I had what I needed. The recording captured Missus Whittaker's sweet voice while other teachers were present, but when alone with struggling student.

But the pain he felt wasn't his. It belonged to a woman. Turns out they shared the ability to feel sensations. Meaning the pain was mutual. 20 years ago, when Marco was in elementary school, he suddenly felt his heart race, his body trembling, and nerves on edge. The others around him were confused. But Marco saw a ski slope and a girl out of control in a loud crash. Marco passed out in the classroom while the girl fell in the snow. That was their first sensory link, though no one noticed at the time. As the years passed, Marco went from teenager to a mature man. One day, while driving, he saw the same scene again at the same time, thousands of miles away. Kelly also noticed her vision blur. What the hell? Marco slammed on the brakes. After all these years, that strange voice in his mind was clearer than ever. He was sure it wasn't just some hallucination. Once they both calmed down, they realized they were sharing the same vision. The oddest part. Even though they were 1,000 miles apart, with a two hour time difference. They could hear each other and experience each other's sight. Two complete strangers inexplicably connected.

Through a private investigator's research, I got the basic info on 4 criminals. The first one loved working out. He drank a ton of protein powder every day while eating an apple. I suddenly thought of the perfect plan. Then I started cutting apples again, took out the seeds and ground them into powder because apple seeds contain cyanide. Just 1.5 grams is enough to kill a person. Then I sneaked into the criminal's house and poured the seed powder into the protein powder he planned to drink. When he took it the next day, he instantly started convulsing and foaming at the mouth. Luckily, his brother was home and rushed him to the hospital. In time, they saved his life, but he ended up permanently disabled. The second criminal was a pervert. So I hired two women to lure him into a car, then knocked him out. When he woke up again, he just wanted to pee to relax. But when he looked down, he saw his precious part was gone, freaked out and fell onto a pipe and died on the spot. Meanwhile, the police investigation came out. His home was filled with pieces of apples and his computer search history showed how to make cyanide. He was conveniently arrested and sentenced to life for murder. And He was the third criminal who assaulted my daughter. Then I went to the hospital and told the paralyzed man everything I had done. I said this was revenge and all four of them would pay.

It eased her arm pain for a moment, but it greatly slowed her efficiency. My mother's tens of thousands of daily motions. I had already left her with serious work related injuries. So for the next 10 years, I never stopped observing and thinking of ways to ease her burden. Until one day my bicycle chain suddenly fell off. When I struggled to put the rusty chain back and gently push the pedal, spinning wheel gave me an idea. After days of non stop experimenting, I used two wheels and a few old boards to build the first prototype of a loom. When two friends came to the warehouse to see it, they thought it was silly and ridiculous. Neighbors laughed at me. Even my parents told me to do something proper, like finding a good girl to marry so she could inherit the weaving skill and help my mother with the work. A sweet marriage did make me pause the research. But only six months after the wedding, my wife's arm hurts so badly she couldn't lift it. Seeing something was wrong with her broke my heart. I knew letting her rest was only temporary, so I reignited my drive to build the machine. After learning how the machine worked, my wife realized I was right to stay determined. So she chose to fully support my work. But I told her I had No money to continue the sake of my dream, she gave me her lifelong savings of 1,000 rupees. Without hesitation. From that moment I devoted myself fully to the research. This time I kept quiet and told no one. Months later, the simple loom was finally done. I invited family and friends with full confidence. When the power was switched on, the machine started running. But it exploded after only a few seconds. The blast destroyed not only my work.

Little did she know, this act would make her regret it for the rest of her life. Just as the woman poured food into the man's bag, countless black vines suddenly emerged from inside. By the time Anna realized something was wrong, it was too late. The vines instantly crawled all over her body. Then, under the man's control, Anna was suspended in midair. Seeing this, the man decided to stop pretending. He took off his tattered clothes and removed the Mark from his forehead. His arms became more muscular, and even his messy long hair transformed into a stylish short cut. It turned out he was the legendary Demon King Jack. Just then, a swarm of bats appeared in the sky. A giant bat landed beside Jack, and Jack was its master. Anna was placed on the bat's back while he sat in the pilot's position, preparing for takeoff. The giant bat then leaped from the cliff's edge, flapping its enormous wings and ascending rapidly. Just when Jack thought it was all over, a giant eagle suddenly charged at him. Jack quickly dodged the Eagle's attack by swerving to the side. He originally wanted to shake off the Eagle, but Jack had underestimated its speed, so he decided to use superior piloting skills to lose it.

I accepted a plea deal to avoid prison. Ten years later, her husband uncovered the lie that destroyed my life and the truth completely shattered hers. When I was 20, I signed a plea deal for something I didn't do. The alternative was 20 years in prison. My 16 year old sister Jessica accused me of things so vile everyone looked at me like a monster. We used to be close. I fixed electronics in my room, old radios, broken cassette players. Jessica would help me holding wires while I soldered. She was the only one who understood. I kept my door locked to protect my equipment. That locked door later became evidence of secrecy. Everything changed when Troy Beckett started circling her. He was 18, drove a black Mustang. I caught him pressuring her to skip class. She's 16, you're 18. You see the problem? He shoved me. I shoved back harder. Rumors started. People said I was too protective. Jessica stopped talking to me. One night I found her crying. When I tried to hug her, she flinched. She never flinched before. Days later, police knocked two officers and a CPS worker. Your sister reported inappropriate behavior. She says this has been going on for years. What? No, that never happened. They showed me photos of my work bench, soldering irons, zip ties for cables, looks like restraint gear. They didn't believe me. My attorney laid it out. Trial and lose 20 years or plead guilty. Probation, registration, no prison. After three sessions, I broke five years probation, my name on a public registry. My parents didn't show up to sentencing. Jessica didn't either. I couldn't live near schools or parks. I found a basement studio, no windows, mold in corners, $700 a month. Every job application, have you been convicted of a felony? I'd check yes. Watch faces change. Applied to over 100 jobs. Both callbacks rescinded after background checks. I worked night shifts at a warehouse, minimum wage. When word got around, co workers stopped talking. I ate lunch alone in my car. Five years of survival. Then 10 years later, I got a call. Ronnie, I'm Kyle, Jessica's husband. I found something you need to know. We met at a coffee shop. I thought Jessica was cheating. I went through her laptop. He.

She told me I had a strong defamation case if I could prove Ashley was lying. We started gathering evidence. Mike gave a written statement that I stayed at his place the night of the party. We had time stamps for my Uber rides showing I went straight from the party to Mike's apartment. My credit card showed I bought breakfast near Mike's house the next morning. There was no gap in the timeline where I could have been with Ashley. Patricia requested Ashley's medical records through legal discovery. Ashley fought it hard, but the judge ordered her to comply. Turns out Ashley wasn't even pregnant. She'd never taken a pregnancy test, never saw a doctor. The whole thing was completely made up. Patricia also found Ashley's search history from the week before she accused me. She'd been googling things like how to break up a family and can you go to jail for false accusations? We took all of this to court in September, filed a defamation lawsuit asking for damages. Ashley showed up with some cheap lawyer who clearly wasn't prepared. We presented everything. The timeline, the medical records, the search history, Mike's statement. Ashley's lawyer tried arguing that she was confused and made an honest mistake. you can't accidentally make up an entire pregnancy and assault story. The judge wasn't buying it. During her testimony, Ashley completely fell apart on the stand. Started changing her story, contradicting herself. Finally, Admitted she made everything up because she'd actually cheated on Derek with his coworker and needed a cover story. She thought if she could make me look like the bad guy, nobody would question her. When she eventually claimed Derek wasn't the father, the courtroom went silent. Derek was sitting in the back, and I watched his face go completely white. My parents were there, too, and my mom started crying. The judge ruled in my favor, ordered Ashley to pay me $50,000 in damages plus my legal fees. Also issued a restraining order. Ashley and Derek broke up that same day. He called off the wedding and kicked her out of his apartment. Two weeks later, Derek showed up at my door. He looked terrible, like he hadn't slept in days. Started apologizing and saying he should have believed me, that he was sorry for hitting me and cutting me off. My parents sent letters, too, saying they made a horrible mistake and wanted to rebuild our relationship. Part of me wanted to forgive them immediately because they're my family, but another part of me was still furious. I believed a lie without even hearing my side. They abandoned me when I needed them most. Derek's standing in my doorway now, asking if we can grab coffee and talk. Says he'll do whatever it takes to make this right. I honestly don't know what to do.

She got nothing. I met Jessica at a coffee shop downtown when I was 25. She seemed perfect, smart, funny, always knew exactly what to say. We got married after dating for two years and everything felt right. My family has money, not crazy billionaire money, but my grandparents set up trust funds for all their grandkids. Mine was worth about $3 million and I was supposed to get full access when I turned 30. Jessica knew about the trust fund because I told her early on I wanted to be honest about my financial situation. She always acted like it didn't matter, said she loved me for me, not for money. Looking back, I was an idiot. About six months before my 30th birthday, Jessica started acting different. She'd stay late at work almost every night, said her boss was demanding and they had big projects coming up. She stopped wanting to hang out on weekends. When I'd suggest going to dinner or watching a movie, she'd say she was too tired. I figured it was just stress from her job. Then one Tuesday, I came home early because I wasn't feeling well, found Jessica on our couch with her laptop. And when she saw me, she slammed it shut so fast she nearly broke the screen. I asked what she was looking at and she got defensive that I was being paranoid and controlling. That should Have been my first real warning sign. Two weeks later, Jessica sat me down for a serious talk. She said she wasn't happy anymore, that we'd grown apart, that she needed space to figure out what she wanted. I was confused because we'd literally just celebrated our anniversary the month before. Everything seemed fine. I asked if there was someone else and she swore there wasn't, said she just needed time to think. A week after that conversation, my buddy Eric sent me a screenshot. It was from Jessica's Instagram story posted from some beach resort. She was holding hands with this guy I'd never seen before. In the photo, you could clearly see a hotel room key card on the table next to them with the name of the resort. I reversed image, searched the resort and found out it was in the Bahamas Jessica had told me she was.

The mom just stares at me like I told her kid to go kick rocks, then turns around and walks away in a huff. Then it gets worse. This teacher, who doesn't even work with this class, he's just there because her own kid, goes to the school, comes up and asks for the same thing. Can my son have a cup of whipped cream? And again, five other kids immediately start asking for the same thing. I give her the same explanation. There's still a line going out the door and down the hallway. I've got maybe two and a half cans of whipped cream left. If, if I start handing out cups, we're going to run out and the kids at the end of the line won't get any for their drinks. So no, I can't do that. She walks away without saying anything. I turn around to help the next kid in line make their cocoa. When I turn back around, that same teacher is holding the whipped cream can and spraying it directly into a cup for her kid. She just took it, didn't ask again, didn't wait for permission, just grabbed it off the table when my back was turned and did it anyway. And that opened the flood gates. Every kid who saw that immediately started asking for their own cup. For the next 45 minutes, I had to keep saying no over and over and over again, while kids gave me dirty looks and parents whispered to each other. One dad even made a comment under his breath about some volunteers being difficult.

The teacher asked our parent volunteer group to bring cookies and hot chocolate for this winter event thing. I figured why not make it a little special? So I grabbed marshmallows, whipped cream and sprinkles from the store. Nothing fancy, just the usual toppings you throw on cocoa. The event starts and kids are lining up. First girl in line walks up, looks at everything and goes, I don't want hot chocolate. Can I just have a cup of whipped cream? She's literally holding a chocolate chip cookie in her other hand and eating it. So I know it's not an allergy thing. She just wants a cup of straight whipped cream like it's a snack. Before I can even answer, five of her friends immediately start going, me too, me too, I want whipped cream, too. I can see exactly where this is going. I've got maybe three cans of whipped cream total and there's like 60 kids at this event. If I say yes to her, every single kid in that line is going to want their own cup of whipped cream and the last 20 kids won't have any for their actual cocoa. So I tell her no. I explain that I only brought enough whipped cream for people to put on their drinks. If I give her a whole cup, everyone's going to want one and we won't have enough. I even offer her a cup of water if she's thirsty. She just glares at me and stomps away. I think that's the end of it. Wrong. Five minutes later, this woman comes marching up to the table. My daughter said you refused to give her whipped cream. I'd like a cup for her, please. And just like before, the second she says it, a bunch of other kids start yelling.

At arraignment, the judge watched the video. One of the most disturbing pieces of evidence I've seen. A 5 year old being assaulted by adults while begging them to stop. Denise got bail at $75,000. Patricia hired a digital specialist who traced the video. 200+ people. Legal letter sent, you're in possession of documented child abuse. Delete immediately or face liability. Video vanished within three days. Denise fired from her job. Harold forced to resign. Sheila lost her volunteer position. Mom lost her church position. Trisha found text from three days before Denise to her husband. I'm swapping the cake with dog food. It'll be hilarious to humiliate the brat. This destroyed any harmless prank claim.

All five guilty. Denise, two years in state prison. Harold 14 months. Mom and dad 10 months each. Sheila, one year county jail. Six months later, Rosie and I celebrated, just us, cupcakes and her favorite movie. This is the best party ever, Mommy. Better than last year. We don't talk about last year, Doctor Kim said that was a positive sign. Rosie is 9 now, therapy once a week. She has friends, does well in school. Nightmares occasionally, but she knows I will protect her. Last week, she asked for a birthday party with school friends. Yeah, but only people who are nice. No family last night. Mommy, if anyone tries to ruin it, you'll make them sorry, right? Absolutely. She smiled and fell asleep. Denise works night shifts now. Her kids barely speak to her mom lives alone. Friends avoid her. Harold's wife divorced him. My family thought they could hurt my daughter without consequences. They were wrong.

But I'd seen the other tabs about alimony calculators and articles about how unemployed spouses get more money. I felt sick to my core when I saw she'd been reading about how drug users lose everything in court. That night, I couldn't sleep and Googled Xanax and Food Taste and it said bitter, which is exactly how my orange juice had tasted lately. When I'd mentioned it to Jenna, she said it was just a new brand. I heard her on the phone in the garage at 3:00am whispering about timing and how everything needed to be ready. When I asked who calls at 3:00am, she said it was about my case. But that made no sense. I bought three home kits and they all came back positive. But the strange part was the levels were going up instead of down. The next morning, Jenna made her special scrambled eggs and watched me eat every single bite, then patted my head and said, all of it, good boy, like I was a dog or something. After she left for work, I was looking for my car keys in her purse, found a pharmacy receipt from right before my drug test for a Xanax prescription. I drove straight to a private lab and paid $800 for rush results. The tech called two hours later and told me to come back immediately because the Xanax levels in my system were high enough to kill someone. Jenna's car was In the driveway when I got home, which was strange because she never came home early. I walked in first with the cops behind me. She was in the kitchen making dinner and smiled when she saw me. She said, hey, baby, feeling better? I said I got news about the results. Her whole face lit up and she asked if they'd overturned it. That's when the officer walked in behind me and she went pale. She actually tried to run, but he blocked the door. She started screaming, he's setting me up. He's the addict, not me. The officer stayed calm and said he needed to collect some items for evidence. He bagged everything from the kitchen while Jenna stood there shaking. When he asked if she took Xanax, she admitted it was for anxiety and got the bottle, which was nearly empty, even though it was a month supply from two weeks ago. The officer read my lab report out loud showing Xanax levels increasing daily but only after eating in the morning, never at dinner. Then he asked why she'd googled how long does Xanax stay in someone's system two weeks ago. She went completely silent before turning to me with tears and saying, baby, tell them this is a mistake. Jenna got five years for attempted murder. Her lawyer quit after reading the evidence. She still writes from prison claiming she loves me.

Rent was one 800 dollars. I paid one 300 dollars. She paid $500. I responded once. I'm respecting your independence. You've got this. By day five, she showed up at Jake's apartment. I don't know how she found out where I Was maybe she called my mom. Jake's girlfriend Rachel answered the door and immediately called for me. Olivia looked destroyed, hair unwashed, eyes puffy, wearing the same hoodie from three days ago. Noah, please, can we talk? You took it too far. It was just a. What about the apartment hunting? That wasn't real. We were just browsing. Marcus was helping me understand my options. Options for what? For if you ever left me, I needed a safety net. So you were preparing to leave while I was preparing our future. Got it. She started crying harder. The least Marcus and I looked at fell through. His credit score is 5, 10. They won't let him co sign. I can't afford our place alone. I need you. And there it was. Not I love you, not I made a mistake. Just I need you. Sounds like you should have thought about that before tweeting about your rights. Closed the door. I heard her crying in the hallway for 10 minutes before Jake threatened to call the cops if she didn't leave. She's been staying with her mom ever since. Marcus stopped commenting on her posts exactly three days after the lease fell through. Guess his interest in helping her move had conditions attached.

After I asked her to stop texting her ex, I retweeted it with respecting your right to be single and moved my stuff out. She showed up at my new place crying that I'd taken it too far. We've been together 18 months, living together for the last 6. I thought we were solid. Then Marcus started appearing everywhere. First it was likes on her Instagram Story, send comments and the DM started around 6 weeks to go. I'm not the jealous type. I've got female friends, she's got male friends. We're adults. But when I woke up at 3:00am to get water and found her on the couch in the dark smiling at her phone with that soft she used to give me, something felt wrong. Who's texting you this late, I asked. She jumped like I'd caught her stealing. Just Sarah girl drama. Then she locked her phone and went to bed. But I'd seen the name at the top, Marcus. I didn't bring it up. Two weeks went by. The texting got worse. She'd be on her phone during dinner, during movies. Once we were literally mid conversation about her mom's birthday plan. Every time I glanced over, she tilt the screen away. Then came the laptop incident. I needed to print my resume for a job interview. Her MacBook was closer than mine. I opened it and her messages app was still logged in. The notification popped up right as I was about to print. Marcus, can't wait to see the place tomorrow. Think you'll love the balcony view. My stomach dropped. I just stared at it. What place? We had a place together. When she got home from work that evening, I was calm. I had 6 hours to think about it. Hey, I saw a message from Marcus up on your laptop. Something about seeing a place tomorrow. Her face went completely white, then red. Then she grabbed her phone from her purse like it was a weapon. You went through my messages. That's a huge violation of privacy. They literally just appeared while I was printing. What place is he talking about? She started pacing. This is exactly why I need options. You're so controlling, always questioning who I talk to. Options. What does that mean? I'm allowed to look at apartments if I want. I'm allowed to have a backup plan. What if this doesn't work out? I need to know I have somewhere to go. My chest felt height. Are you planning to leave? She didn't answer, just stared at me with this find expression. Then she did something I'll never forget. She pulled out her phone, typed for about 30 seconds and showed me her screen before posting it. The tweet read, I'm not property. I'm a person with rights. No one gets to control who I talk to or what I do with my life, my body. My choice. Then she hit post. Within minutes, her friends were in the comments. You deserve better, girl. That's toxic masculinity. Run, sis. I sat there for maybe 5 minutes just watching the likes roll in. Then I opened Twitter, screenshot her tweet and, quote, retweeted it with respect.

He's more athletic, more social, more driven. It makes sense to prioritize. Get out of my house, I said quietly. You're being ridiculous. Then Jennifer from the PTA shifted uncomfortably and said, I mean, the scholarship program is very impressive. Another parent added, maybe we could combine the celebrations. They were agreeing with her in my backyard at my daughter's party, agreeing my child mattered less. I looked at Mia. Silent tears streamed down her face. I smiled. Not a nice smile. Sure, you're absolutely right. I'll leave. My mother blinked. What? You want this to be Dylan's party? Fine. Mia and I will leave. You can all stay and celebrate without us. I turned to Mia. Baby, go pack a bag. We're going on an adventure. While she packed, I called my college friend Rebecca, who owns an events venue. Remember that standing offer? I need it today, right now. Come over. I'll start setting things up. We drove away as my phone exploded with calls and texts. How dare you abandon your daughter's party. You've embarrassed the whole family. I blocked them all. An hour later, Rebecca's gorgeous barn venue was being transformed. Emergency caterers arrived, rebounds castles, a face painting team, a florist creating ocean themed centerpieces with LED lights. Mia's eyes went wide. Is this really for me? Version 2.0? I better in every way. I texted parents who'd supported us. New location. She deserves better. 20 kids showed up, the ones who mattered. Mia was radiant again. The hurt was still there, but underneath, joy, real joy. My family called the police claiming I'd kidnapped my own daughter. The cops dismissed it immediately. Three months later, my mother finally apologized, actually apologized not for how I felt but for what she did. We're rebuilding slowly. Vanessa never apologized. We haven't spoken since. But Mia, she got into a marine biology mentorship program. She's thriving. She knows she's worth walking away from toxic people, even family. That birthday taught her something I'd failed to teach in 11 years. She's not in competition with anyone. She's enough exactly as she is. And that lesson was worth burning every bridge.

It's my son's Celebration today. My mom added, let's be honest, her son is way better than your daughter. I smiled and said, sure, I'll leave. My daughter Mia spent two weeks planning her birthday party. She picked ocean decorations because she's obsessed with sea turtles. She wrote invitations and careful handwriting. She was radiant that morning in her blue star dress. I specifically didn't invite my sister Vanessa or my mother, not out of spite, out of survival. For 11 years, they turned every milestone into a comparison contest between Mia and Vanessa's son Dylan. Dylan walked first, Mia talked first. Dylan made soccer team, Mia made honor roll. Back and forth, exhausting, endless. I'd stop sharing Mia's achievements with them years ago because they'd just find ways to diminish them or pivot back to Dylan. It hurt less to keep her victories private. Two hours into the party, the doorbell rang. Vanessa stood there with Dylan and my mother all dressed up like they were attending a different event entirely. Surprise, my mother chirped, pushing past me. We couldn't miss Dylan's cousin's birthday. I didn't invite you, I said. That was just an oversight. I'm sure we're family. They walked straight into the backyard. Mia froze midgame, her face falling as she saw them. My mother clapped her hands demanding attention. Now that we're all here, we have Exciting news. Dylan just got accepted into the Metropolitan Young Scholars program, extremely prestigious. You're so proud. That's great. I managed. But this is Mia's birthday party. Oh, come on, Claire, don't be selfish. We can celebrate both. You haven't said happy birthday to her once since you arrived. That's when Vanessa exploded. Why is that parasite's little brat even the focus here? It's my son's Celebration today. He's the one who actually accomplished something. The backyard went silent. Mia made a small sound like she'd been slapped. My mother nodded in agreement.

These were words I'd never heard from her before. Her friends started acting weird around me, too. At a group dinner, her roommate Jessica kept giving me these looks, like she felt sorry for me. When I asked what was going on, she said I should talk to Emma. But every time I tried, Emma would def. Actors say I was being paranoid. Kyle's behavior got stranger. He'd text me, asking to hang out one on one, which he'd never done before. When we met for coffee, he'd ask questions about my work schedule, when I'd be home, whether I lived alone. The questions felt off somehow, too specific. But I couldn't figure out why. Emma broke up with me on a Thursday. She said she needed time to focus on herself, that our relationship had become unhealthy. I asked what changed, and she said Kyle had helped her see things clearly. She said he pointed out patterns of controlling behavior. I didn't even know I was exhibit. The accusations came rapid fire. Things I'd supposedly said or done that I had no memory of. I tried to argue, but she wouldn't listen. She said Kyle had been there for her when I wasn't, that he understood her better than I did. The way she said his name had this defensive quality, like she was protecting him from criticism. Two weeks later, I smelled smoke at 2:00am. I ran downstairs and found my kitchen on fire. Small flames spreading from a pile of rags. So in something that smelled like gasoline, I grabbed my fire extinguisher and put it out before calling 911. The fire inspector found evidence of forced entry through my back door. Three days after that, Kyle showed up at my house. He was agitated, pacing on my porch, demanding I stay away from Emma. I said I hadn't contacted her since the breakup. He didn't believe me, said Emma had told him I'd been harassing her. I pulled out my phone to show him there were no calls or texts, and that's when he lunged at me. The security camera footage showed everything. And what the police found on his phone revealed the truth about what he'd really been doing for months. The rest of the story is on my channel or linked below.

He then tried to burn my house down and assaulted me, so I got him in prison. I met Emma three years ago at a coffee shop, and we've been dating for two years when things started getting weird. Her best friend Kyle had been in her life since high school, and I'd always gotten along with him fine. He was at every birthday, every holiday, every group hangout. Emma trusted him completely. The stairs incident happened on a Tuesday night. I was at Emma's apartment helping her move furniture when Kyle showed up unannounced. I was coming down the stairs carrying a lamp when I felt hands on my back. I tumbled forward, hit the landing hard, and cracked two ribs. Kyle was at the top of the stairs looking shocked, saying I must have lost my balance. Emma believed him. Immediately after that, things changed. Emma started responding to my texts hours late. She'd cancel plans last minute, saying she was tired or had to help Kyle with something. When we did hang out, she seemed distracted, checking her phone constantly. I asked if something was wrong, and she said everything was fine. But her voice had this edge to it I'd never heard before. Kyle started showing up everywhere. If Emma and I were grabbing dinner, he'd text asking to join. If we were watching a movie at my place, He'd call saying he needed to talk to her about something urgent. She'd always take the call in another room, and I could hear her voice through the door, but couldn't make out words. I noticed Kyle's car parked outside Emma's apartment at odd hours. 3 a m. On a Wednesday, 6 a m. On a Sunday. I didn't mention it because I didn't want to seem jealous or controlling. But then Emma started saying things that didn't sound like her. She tell me

See, here's the thing about working at places like this. You learn everyone's business, whether you want to or not. Parents dump their kids here and then spend the whole time on phone calls discussing private stuff, thinking we're not paying attention. Bryce included. I'd overheard him on multiple calls with his girlfriend complaining about money, his car payments, and how he was only taking this management job temporarily until something better came along. Also mentioned several times how he was using the employee discount to throw his nephew's birthday party here next weekend and how he was planning to hook himself up with free food and decorations. So when Bryce's nephew's party rolled around, I was working the front desk. Bryce spent the whole morning setting everything up, ordering way more food than the party package included and loading up on decorations and party favors. When his sister showed up with the birthday kid, she tried to hey and Bryce waved her off, saying it was all taken care of. That's when I printed out an itemized receipt for everything he'd taken. The party package, extra food, decorate, extended time in the private party room, extra party favors, all of it came out to around $300. I walked over with the biggest smile and handed it to his sister. Hi, I just wanted to make sure you had your receipt for everything. Bryce ordered quite a bit. Extra for the party today. His sister looked confused and asked what the total was. When I told her, she looked at Bryce like he'd lost his mind. You said this was going to cost like $50? Bryce's face went completely red. He tried to laugh it off and say there must be some mistake, but I just smiled and said, oh, no, everything's correct. Bryce ordered all these extras and company policy says all food and decorations have to be paid for. Employee discount only applies to the basic party package, which was totally true, by the way. The employee discount he was planning to use was only 10% off the basic package, not a free for all on extras. His sister ended up paying for everything, but she was pissed at Bryce for misleading her about the cost.

My dad had been promising to take me fishing for over a year. Every time I brought it up, he'd say the same thing. When I get a weekend off, buddy. Soon. But weekends came and went. My birthday, too. Eventually I just stopped asking. I was in seventh grade when my classmate Jake invited me over for the first time. His house was small and cluttered, with toys scattered around and dishes in the sink, but it felt warm somehow. Jake's dad was sitting at the kitchen table when we walked in, still wearing his work uniform from the auto shop. You must be Brady, he said, standing up to shake my hand. Jake's been talking about you all week. We went to Jake's room to play video games, but his old console wasn't working right. His dad came in and sat on the floor with us, messing with the wires until he got it running. Then he made us hot chocolate and sat there cracking jokes while we played. When I mentioned I'd never been fishing, Jake's dad's eyes lit up. We go every Sunday morning. You should come with us. I didn't say anything, but my heart jumped. I've been begging my dad to take me fishing since I was 10. That night, I went home and quietly asked my dad again. Can we go fishing this Sunday? Just for A few hours. He looked up from his laptop with that familiar tired expression. I've got quarterly reports due Monday morning. Maybe next weekend. All right? I promise we'll do something soon. I nodded and went to my room. But Sunday morning at 6 a m. I heard a knock on our door. Jake's dad was standing there in his fishing gear, holding an extra rod. Ready to catch some fish? He asked with a big smile. I left a note on the kitchen counter. Gone fishing with Jake's family. Back by dinner at the lake. Jake's dad showed me how to bait the hook, how the cast without tangling the line, and how to be patient. We didn't catch much, just a couple small bass. But I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. I felt important. Jake's dad asked me about school, about what I wanted to do when I grew up, about my favorite movies. He actually listened to my answers. When I told him about the science project I was working on, he got genuinely excited and started giving me ideas. Around noon we packed up and drove back. The whole all ride home, Jake's dad was telling stories about when he was a kid, making us laugh until our sides hurt. When I got home that evening, my dad was in his office, still working on those reports. Looked up when I walked in. How was fishing? He asked. It was amazing. I Said we caught two bass and Jake's dad taught me how to tie different knots. My dad nodded. That's great, buddy. I'm glad you had fun. There was this weird silence for a moment. Then he said, you went with them to the lake? I shrugged. Yeah, it was only a 30 minute drive. My dad's face changed. He closed his laptop and really looked at me.

You don't get its silly perks. I work at one of those indoor trampoline parks where parents drop their kids off and pretend they don't exist for two hours. The job comes with some pretty sweet perks that nobody talks about. Free access to the trampolines after hours, employee discounts on birthday parties. And the best part, I get to eat leftover pizza from kids parties that parents never bothered to pick up. Plus my co workers are actually cool. We're all college kids or people between real jobs, so we just vibe and make the best of it. Enter Bryce, my new manager who got hired three months ago. This guy clearly thinks he's running some Fortune 500 company instead of watching kids bounce around on trampolines. First week on the job he called a staff meeting to discuss professional development and brand image. I'm talking about a place where the main job requirement is knowing how to work a cash register and occasionally telling kids not to do backflips off the foam pit walls. Bryce started implementing all these new rules no phones during shifts, even when it's dead empty on Tuesday afternoons. No talking to co workers unless it's work related. No eating the leftover party food because it looks unprofessional. And the worst part? Started scheduling mandatory team building exercises on our days off. But what really set me off was when he started making comments about how my job wasn't Real work and how I should be grateful for the opportunity to gain work experience and customer service. literally said this while I was cleaning puke out of the phone pit because some kid ate too much cake before jumping around last week. He really crossed the line. I've been working there for 8 months, longer than anyone except the assistant manager, Katie. This family came in for their kids birthday party and everything was going fine until their cake fell off the table. The mom was freaking out, the birthday kid was crying, and I felt bad for them, so I offered to comp their pizza order since we mess up food order sometimes anyway and usually just eat the mistakes. It was like 20 bucks. No big deal. The family was super grateful, the kid cheered up, and everyone had a good time. Bryce pulled me aside later and goes, your silly little job here has rules, and you don't get to make executive decisions about comping food. This isn't a charity, it's a business. Then he wrote me up for exceeding authority and unprofessional decision making. That's when I decided. Bryce

My coworker placed it and she starts to do the tattoo. As soon as she starts, the guy screams in pain and jumps up. What the hell is in that thing? Is there a needle in there? That freaking hurts. What? This guy was in his 30s or 40s. How do you not know how tattoos are done? He said, I don't know, just thought it was some permanent ink or something. The guy went outside for almost an hour to drink and I guess hyped himself up. He got the outline done at least, but couldn't take the pain anymore and didn't get it filled.

I haven't said a word the whole trip. So I asked how I could make the situation better. She said she didn't like how I kept playing with a fidget stick in the middle of my car. I drive a manual. She then told me that I didn't need to use that because her car didn't have that and claimed to be a mechanic. 3. I used to work in a grocery store and this elderly woman said 25 cents a pound. I can get them 4 pounds for a dollar at Safeway. 4. I was in a college class and we were talking about agriculture. Me being from a farming town, I was explaining how important certain aspects of farming are, interesting and super important. This one student was not budging and she was refusing whatever I was saying. I asked her why she was so against farming and she said, I think we should get rid of all of them. We don't need them. I asked her if she liked to eat and she said we would be fine. We could just get food from the stores. I asked her how she planned on getting that food into the store. She responded with, well, they already make all the food in the store as it is, right? Why do we need farms? They're stealing money from our local businesses. So in a nutshell, she thought everything, flowers, fish, chicken, loaf bread and like everything was made in the stores and that's why we don't need farms. 5. If I could find a country that didn't take immigrants and I'd move there.

The one that got me grounded for a month. My dad had this iron clad rule in our house. Whoever complained about dinner had to cook the next night's meal for the entire family. It was his brilliant strategy to shut us up about my stepmom Raylan's absolutely catastrophic cooking. For two solid years, nobody dared say a word. Her meatloaf could legitimately break windows. Her chicken was drier than the Sahara Desert, and her famous casseroles tasted like she mixed random leftovers with sadness and baked it at 450 degrees until it surrendered. But we all just sat there choking down every bite like good little soldiers because nobody wanted to face the humiliation of trying to cover six people. Then came that unforgettable Tuesday night when Raylan decided to get creative with deconstructed tacos. I'm using air quotes here because what she actually served was literally just wilted iceberg lettuce, cold ground beef straight from the pan, and stale hard shell tortillas that crumbled if you looked at them wrong. Everything was on separate plates like some kind of sad, depressing buffet. My ten year old sister Opal, took one look at her plate, tried to eat everything, and was still visibly hungry. Afterward, she's started tearing up because her stomach was growling. And that's when something inside me just completely snapped. Raylan, this isn't dinner. This is what happens when a grocery store display gives up on life. The entire dining Room went dead silent. Dad's fork froze halfway to his mouth, and I could practically see the gears turning in his head. Raylan's face turned bright red, and my older brother Paxton was staring at me like I just signed my own death warrant. Dad slowly put down his fork, cleared his throat, and said with this smug little smile, well, congratulations, kiddo. Looks like you're cooking tomorrow night's dinner for all of us. But here's the thing dad had absolutely no clue about. For the past six months, I've been working weekend shifts at my Uncle JoJo's Italian restaurant downtown. Not just busting tables or washing dishes, but actually learning everything from knife skills to sauce preparation to proper seasoning techniques. Josway had been teaching me real cooking because he said I had natural instincts and could potentially work in professional kitchens someday. Every Saturday and Sunday, I'd spend eight hours learning how to make fresh pasta, proper marinara, from scratch. Authentic Italian techniques passed down through three generations. The next evening, I walked into our kitchen with a game plan. I'd stopped at the grocery store after school and bought actual fresh ingredients with my restaurant money. Real ground beef, fresh tomatoes, white onions, authentic Mexican spices, masa harina for tortillas, and everything needed for proper street tacos. I spent three hours hand pressing corn tortillas, slow cooking carnitas until they were fall apart tender, making fresh PICO de Gallo with perfectly diced ingredients, crafting homemade salsa Verde.

So I've been a vegetarian since I was like 13 because my body just hates meat. Red meat especially makes me sick, like really sick. Doctors told my parents to just let me eat other stuff for protein and everyone was cool with it except my Aunt Carol. She thought I was full of it, just being dramatic for attention or whatever. This is the same woman who told my parents I was faking my asthma attacks until I ended up in the er one night barely able to breathe. She, she also refused to get her own kid, Stephanie, glasses for two years because she thought Steph just wanted to look cool. Turns out Stephanie couldn't see the board at school and was failing everything. But sure, Carol, great parenting. Our whole family did this thing where we'd rotate who hosted dinner every week. It was usually fine because most people would just make me a separate thing or I'd bring my own food. When it was Carol's turn, she kept insisting she'd make something I could eat. She was being weird about it, too, like overly nice and kept saying how she wanted to make sure I felt included. I should have known something was up. So we all show up at her place on a Friday night, the table set and she's made burgers. He brings mine out on a separate plate and makes this whole announcement about How? It's a special veggie burger just for me. She even showed me the empty package from some brand I'd never heard of. I was starving because I'd skipped lunch that day. And the burger actually looked pretty good, had all the toppings I liked, lettuce, tomato, pickles, the works. I sat down next to Carol at the head of the table because that's where the empty seat was. Everyone started eating and I basically inhaled my burger. Like I'm talking three bites and it was gone. I was so hungry, I didn't even really taste it that much. Carol was watching me the whole time with this weird little smile on her face. At first I thought she was just happy I liked her cooking. My mom even commented on how nice it was that Carol made something special for me. About 5 minutes passed, maybe less, then my stomach started doing that thing, that feeling when your body just decides something needs to leave immediately? Yeah, that feeling. My stomach cramped up and I felt this wave of heat rush through me. That's when it hit me. The texture of that burger was wrong. It wasn't veggie at all. It was meat. It was beef. Carol had fed me a regular burger and lied about it. I looked over at her and she was still smiling, not even trying to hide it anymore. She had this smug look like she just proven some big point, like She caught me in a lie and now everyone.

She walked past me and stopped in front of my brother. The room applauded until I asked my father one question. Then my wife went pale and my brother collapsed. My wife took my brother's hand. He stood up, smiling that cocky smile I'd seen my whole life. They walked to the dance floor together. Two hundred guests watched them sway to the music. I stood at the head table, completely still. My best man leaned over. Dude, what the hell? I didn't answer because three weeks ago, I'd found the months of messages between my wife, Sarah, and my brother, Derek. I wish it was you I was marrying. 10 years we've hidden this. I'm tired of pretending. After the wedding, we'll figure it out. Just play along for now. They've been having an affair for a decade, since before Sarah and I even started dating. She'd chosen me as the safe option, the stable one. But she'd never stop sleeping with Derek. And tonight, at our wedding, she was making her move. I'd known for three weeks, and I'd planned for three weeks. The song ended. Sarah and Derek pulled apart, both glowing. The crowd applauded. Sarah walked back toward me, a triumphant look in her eyes. I picked up the microphone. Beautiful dance, I said, my voice calm, really touching. Sarah smiled. Derek raised his Glass to me. Actually, I continued, since we're sharing secrets tonight, I have one, too. Sarah's smile flickered. Dad, I said, turning to where my father sat, do you remember that business loan Derek asked you for three years ago? The one for $50,000? My father looked confused. Of course. Why? Why did he ever pay you back? Dad's face darkened. No, he said. The business failed. I nodded. Interesting, because I have the bank record showing that business never existed. The room went quiet. Derek's face went pale. What are you doing? He said, his voice tight. I'm sharing, I said pleasantly. Like you and Sarah have been sharing for 10 years. Gasps rippled through the crowd. Sarah's hand flew to her mouth. The $50,000 dad gave you. You spent it on hotel rooms, gifts for Sarah, all while she was dating me. I pulled out my phone and connected it to the projector. I have every receipt, every text message, every lie. The screen lit up behind me. Text messages between Sarah and Derek filled the wall. I can't wait to be with you for real. He'll never suspect anything. After the wedding, we'll figure out how to tell him. My mother stood up, her hand over her heart. Derek, is this true? Derek couldn't speak. But that's not even the best part, I said. Sarah, do you want to tell everyone or should I? She was crying now. Please stop. Stop. We're just getting to the good Part I advanced the slideshow. A photo of a marriage certificate appeared, Derek's name and another woman's name.

I paused, looked around and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate and my mom's hands started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked. Voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No, grandma's voice cut through the air like a knife. Explain it now. I've been sending 3 thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years? I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait, is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up, my mom hissed. It was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer bag You bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years, four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbooks. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations. Sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car. You from me, I said. My voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like, really. I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor because it looks like you watched me destroy my health working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I remembered all those phone calls home begging for help with textbooks, with rent, with groceries. All those times they said money was tight. They couldn't help. I needed to learn responsibility. How much? Grandma's voice was ice cold. I did the math out loud, my voice getting stronger with each No. 3,000 * 12 months times 4 years. $144,000. My mom started crying. We were going to pay it back when you graduated. With what money? I laughed, but there was no humor in it. You don't have that kind of cash lying around. You spend it all on Savannah's lifestyle. Savannah finally looked up from her phone, realizing this was about her. Wait, so I have to give the car back? Are you serious right now? I turned to her. You're Worried about keeping a car that was bought with stolen money while I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner. That's when Uncle Stewart, who'd been unusually quiet, spoke up. Monica, please tell me you didn't actually steal from your own daughter. My mom's mascara was running down her cheeks. We thought, we thought we could replace it before she found out. Replace it how? Grandma demanded, by letting her work herself to death. I remembered the night last semester when I fainted at work from exhaustion. The manager had to drive me to urgent care because I couldn't afford an ambulance. I'd called my parents crying, telling them I didn't know how much more I could take. They told me to push through it. That success requires.

To make her friends laugh, I just replied, okay, I understand and hung up. The next morning her mother called her screaming hysterically, the house, dear god, what did you just let him do to the house? I was reviewing invoices at nine forty seven PM when the phone lit up. My wife Lila. I answered out of habit, still half focused on a spreadsheet. But the moment I heard laughter in the background, cheap wine clinking glasses, the echo of a restaurant, I knew something was off. Then her voice came through loud, exaggerated, dripping with fake sympathy. Mark, it's over. Don't text, don't call, just move on. Okay. Her friends howled. One even yelled. He actually picked up. I stared at my screen for exactly three seconds then said, okay, I understand and hung up. 13 seconds total. That's how long it took her to end a seven year marriage. No yelling, no questions, just silence. Then I opened a folder on my desktop labeled exit 11. Months of quiet preparation sat inside. You see, I Learned early that Lila loved chaos and hated paperwork. So while she collected followers and filmed self care hauls, I I collected signatures, notarizations and digital authorizations. Every document had a date, every account had a clause and every asset, house, car, even her joint business credit was in my name. Her prank wasn't an insult, it was an opportunity at ten O five PM, I revoked her card access. At 10:20, I paused every shared subscription she'd ever claimed. As for work, Netflix, Canva, even the forty seven dollar monthly beauty box she never opened. At 10:33, I scheduled the locksmith for 8:00am sharp. Then I made tea, chamomile. No shaking hands, no playlist, just methodical silence. Lila thought control meant volume. She never understood that true control sounds like nothing at all. The next morning, she probably woke up at 10:00am, head full of mimosas and tried to buy her truffle omelette at the cafe on Third Street. Declined. She'd have rolled her eyes and tried another card, declined again. Then she'd call her mom, half laughing. Mark's being dramatic. Her mother wouldn't laugh. She never liked me, but she respected my precision. I can picture her whispering, you actually told him it was over on speaker. Lila would SC, it was a joke. Her mother's tone would drop. Then you better pray. He thought so too. Meanwhile, I was two hours away signing the final authorization with my lawyer. By 11:00am, the house deed had transferred legally and irrevocably into the August Foundation, a trust supporting single fathers rebuilding after divorce, the same foundation I created two years ago just in case. At one PM, the locksmith texted, job complete. By three PM, the realtor uploaded the listing photos. New, really renovated 4 bedroom on Willow Lane. Move in ready? I didn't smile. I just closed the laptop. Packed A duffle bag and left. That evening, my phone buzzed non stop. Voicemails, texts, even a few missed calls from Lila's friend.

She got really mad, started yelling at him about how he knows she doesn't consume animal products, how it's not just a preference, but something she cares about. He kept saying it was just a joke and she was overreacting. That's why he asked me to meet him outside instead of going to the house. She told him she didn't want to see him for the rest of the day. Dad looked at me across the table and said, that's funny, right? Like he wanted me to agree with him, to laugh about it. I just sat there for a second. Then I pulled a face and said, don't think so, dad, because I really couldn't see how it was funny. His whole expression changed. He looked annoyed, maybe even angry. He said people these days can't take a joke anymore, that everyone's too sensitive. Then he said I'm his son and I'm supposed to side with him, that I shouldn't be judgmental since it was harmless. Just milk and coffee. No big deal. I told him it wasn't harmless, though. She's vegan for a reason. He made her consume something she specifically avoids on purpose just to mess with her. He waved his hand like I was being dramatic, said it's not like She's allergic. It's just a choice. I said, yeah, it's her choice. And he ignored it to prank her. He got quiet after that. Finished his coffee without looking at me. Then he said, I've changed. That I used to laugh at his jokes when I was younger. I told him I was a kid then. I didn't really get that his pranks upset people. Now I'm older and I can see when something's mean instead of funny. He didn't like that answer. We left the cafe 20 minutes later. He dropped me off at Mom's house early. Didn't even come inside. Just said, see you next week, and drove off. When I got inside, mom asked why I was back so soon. I told her what happened. She shook her head and said, your dad never grew up. Some people think pranks are a personality trait instead of just being annoying.

I've always been my sister's biggest cheerleader. We're only 14 months apart and basically twins. Growing up, she taught me how to perfect my jump shot. I helped her study for the SATs. We've had each other's backs through everything. when she made it to the state basketball finals and asked me to come, I showed up with a foam finger, her Jersey number painted on my face, and absolutely no shame. This was the game that could get her a full ride to Duke college. Scouts were everywhere. The gymnasium was completely sold out. I managed to squeeze into the front row of the student section, right behind the team bench. The atmosphere was insane. Everyone was on their feet, screaming. But I took it to a whole different level. Every time my sister touched the ball, I went ballistic. That's my sister! Let's go, Maya! I was jumping up and down so hard, the bleachers were shaking. About 10 minutes into the first quarter, I noticed this guy sitting in the section across from me. Letterman jacket, perfectly styled hair, surrounded by what looked like the entire football team. He kept shooting me these dark, angry looks. First I thought maybe I was being too obnoxious, so I tried to tone it down just a little. But then during the first time out, I heard him talking loud enough for his whole section to Hear! Someone over there needs to shut up about my girl. Like, we get it. She's talented, but she belongs to me. My stomach dropped. Look down at my sister on the court. She was listening to coach, completely locked in on the game. Was he talking about her? I wanted to march over there and ask him directly, but something about his vibe made me uncomfortable. Instead, I convinced myself he had to be dating some other player, because if that was my sister's boyfriend, she had terrible taste. Second quarter started, and my sister was absolutely on fire. She hit three straight three pointers. I couldn't help myself. I went right back to screaming her name, waving that foam finger like my life depended on it. This was her moment. But every single time I cheered, that guy would stare me down with this intense, scary expression. His friends kept trying to calm him down, whispering in his ear. At one point, I saw two of them physically hold him back when he started to stand up. I. I was getting genuinely scared. But there was no way I was going to let some random controlling freak stop me from supporting my sister. She needed me. This was the biggest game of her entire life. Final buzzer sounds. We win, 67 to 63. The whole team explodes onto the court. Students and parents start flooding down from the stands. I jump over the barrier and sprint across the Court looking for my sister. I finally spot her near the free throw line, surrounded by teammates. She sees me coming and breaks away from the crowd. I run straight into her arms, and she lifts me off the ground, spinning me around. We're going to Duke! She screams in my ear. I'm sobbing, she's sobbing. It's this perfect sibling moment. Suddenly, someone yanks me backward by my shirt.

I've been an ER nurse for nine years and had seen every kind of ink imaginable, but this one made my hands go numb. The guy on the gurney had come in with chest pains around two a m. Standard protocol stuff. I was taking his vitals when I lifted his left arm to check his pulse and saw it. A faded blue anchor with the letters RM under. My Uncle Ray had that exact tattoo. Same spot, same design. He'd gotten it in the Navy in 1987. Ray died in a car crash when I was 12. At least that's what my parents told me. The clipboard hit the floor. The patient opened his eyes. Okay, yeah, sorry. I bent down to grab it, but my vision was swimming. Just clumsy today. He grunted and closed his eyes again. I forced myself to keep working, wrapping the blood pressure cuff around his arm. But then I noticed his hands. The way his pinky finger curled slightly inward on the right hand. Ray had broken that finger in a bar fight, and it never healed straight. My dad used to joke about it at every family dinner. Sir, what's your name? My voice came out wrong. Marcus Webb. Not Ray Morrison? Of course not. Ray was dead. Closed casket funeral. My mom crying for weeks. But then he did this thing where he rubbed his left Eyebrow with his thumb when the doctor asked him a question. Ray did that exact movement when he was stressed. I watched him do it four more times during the examination. The doctor ordered an EKG. While setting up the leads, I had to pull his shirt up slightly. That's when I saw the second tattoo. A small compass rose on his ribs. Ray got that one the same day as the anchor. I knew because I'd seen the photos in my grandmother's album 100 times before she died. But there was something else. A newer tattoo just below it. Fresh, maybe 6 months old. It was a date. 0 8 15 2,019. My blood went cold. That was the day my cousin Bethany disappeared. Police said she ran away. She was 17. My aunt never recovered. She drank herself to death two years later. My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely attach the electrodes. You sure you're all right? The doctor asked me. Fine. Just tired. Marcus, if that was even his real name. Kept his eyes closed through the whole thing. But I couldn't stop staring at his face. The shape of his nose, the way his hairline receded at the temples. Even the small scar on his chin. From when Ray supposedly fell off a motorcycle at 19. The EKG came back normal. Probably just anxiety. The doctor said we'd keep him for observation. Anyway, I stepped out into the hallway and made myself walk. To the nurse's state. Pulled up his file. Insurance was under Marcus Webb, but the emergency contact made my stomach drop. The phone number listed was my grandmother's old landline, the one that got disconnected when she died eight years ago. I went back to his room. He was awake now, staring at the ceiling. Those tattoos, I said quietly. The anchor and compass. Military. He looked at me, and for just a second, something flickered across his face. Fear, maybe. Or recognition. Yeah. Long time ago. What branch? His jaw tightened. Navy. But I don't really talk about it. The way he said Navy, the exact inflection, the slight rest. It was Ray's voice. Pulled up a chair and sat down. Kept my voice steady. The date on your ribs. What's it mean? His whole body went rigid. None of your business. Bethany Morrison disappeared that day. He sat up fast, ripping off the EKG leads. Who the hell are you? Your niece, Claire. The color drained from his face.

I'm 16 and I live with my mom during the week. Every Saturday, I go see my dad at his place. But last Saturday, he texted me to meet at this cafe downtown instead. That was weird already because we always hang out at his house. When we sat down, I ordered an iced latte. Dad made this snorting sound and grinned at me. I asked him what was so funny. He leaned back in his chair and said, he pulled a prank on my stepmom. That's when I knew something stupid happened. Dad loves pranks. Always has. When I was younger, he'd play videos of cats screaming on his phone just to watch our cat freak out. He'd play dog barking sounds, too. The cat would run around the house looking for the other animals. Dad thought it was hilarious every time. He also used to flip the light switch off when I was in the bathroom. I'd be standing there in complete darkness yelling at him to turn it back on. He'd wait like 30 seconds before flipping it back. Did it at least 10 times over the years. The worst one was with my mom. This was before they divorced. Dad found this fake rubber snake at a dollar store. He knew mom was terrified of snakes since she was a kid. One night, he put it right next to her pillow while she was Sleeping. She woke up and saw it in the dark. Started screaming so loud, I heard it from my room downstairs. Dad was laughing in the hallway. Mom didn't talk to him for three days after that. So when he said he pranked my stepmom, I already knew it wasn't going to be good. I asked him what he did. He started smiling and said he made her a latte that morning. She's vegan and only drinks oat milk. He knows this. She's told him a hundred times. But he made her latte with whole milk instead.

I shouldn't have to tell you that my girlfriend's body belongs to me, he said. I stood up. If the situation was reversed, I'd tell you to go to whatever doctor you needed, I said. His face went red. That's different and you know it. He said, you're making excuses because you know what you did was disgusting. I took a deep breath and got ready to tell him the truth. Charles, those abnormal cells on my cervix were cancerous. I said, I have cervical cancer. He stared at me for about 10 seconds. So you should have thought about that before you cheated on me, he said. I made him repeat it because I couldn't believe what I just heard. You should have thought about that before you spread your legs for another man, he said, slower and louder. Now you're trying to use your cancer to manipulate me. I asked if he was actually serious, dead serious. He said, you made your choice when you let him examine you and now you have to live with the consequences. I told him the consequence was cancer and I needed treatment from a specialist. Yeah, and whose fault is that? He said, if you had found a female doctor from the start, maybe this wouldn't have happened. I stared at him in complete Shock. You think I got cancer because a male doctor examined me? I asked. He shrugged. I'm just saying that actions have consequences. Maybe if you had asked my permission first, we could have prevented this. I felt something inside me break completely. I literally have cancer, I said. He rolled his eyes. And I have a girlfriend who cheated on me. He said. We both have problems and they are both your fault. I walked to the bedroom and grabbed my phone and keys. Where do you think you're going? Charles yelled after me. I came back to the doorway. I'm leaving. We're done, I said. He laughed. You're not going anywhere, he said. We're going to sit down and talk until you admit what you did was wrong. I looked at him standing there like he had any authority over me. If you actually think a medical exam for cancer is cheating, then you're going to die alone. He tried to follow me, but I held up my hand. Don't come any closer, I said. I got in my car and backed out while he stood on the porch yelling about how I was being dramatic. He texted me that night saying he'd be willing to take me back if I promised to only see female doctors for my cancer treatment. I blocked his number and confirmed my appointment for the following week.

My sister had been neglecting her even before abandoning her. Then came the bank letter. The mortgage was three months behind. Without intervention, foreclosure would begin. I paid it, drained my savings, let my own apartment lease expire, moved into my childhood home full time because I had no other choice. Six months passed. I filed for guardianship, built my case with photos, receipt, medical records, evidence that I'd become her mother by showing up every single day. Then they came back. A lawyer's email. My parents were contesting the adoption. They'd experienced a family emergency in Spain. The note had been misunderstood. No mention of nine months of silence, no explanation for disconnected phones, just a carefully constructed narrative, painting them as victims and me as an opportunist. But I'd hired a private investigator. He found property records, a villa in Valencia purchased by my father six months after they left. Social media photos of them toasting at beachside restaurants. Lauren working as a hostess, dating the restaurant owner's nephew. No sick relatives, no, no emergency, just a new life they chose over the one they abandoned. When they showed up at my door, I opened it just wide enough to speak through the chain. Can we see Olivia? My mother asked as if she'd just returned from a weekend trip. No, I said simply. This is my house now and she's my daughter. Their lawyer tried To negotiate, I refused everything except one condition. Lauren surrenders all parental rights. Two days later, the signed papers came back. Included was a handwritten note from my sister. I'm sorry. You'll be a better mother than I could ever be. No questions about her daughter, just another abdication packaged as a compliment. The house became mine. Olivia became mine. The life we built together, painful and unexpected as it began, was officially, legally ours. Years from now, when she asks about her mother, I'll tell her the truth gently, that some people aren't ready to be what their children need. That families are built through staying, not just through birth, through showing up day after day. That she saved me as much as I saved her. Not the life I planned, but the one I now couldn't imagine living without.

I walked into my apartment Wednesday and froze. My coffee mug was in the dishwasher, but I thought I had left it in the sink. When I went to work that night, I ordered pizza and put the leftovers in the fridge. But Thursday night, three slices were gone. I figured maybe I ate them late at night and forgot, but then I found a dark hair on my pillow. My hair is blond. My sheets also felt warm when I got into bed, like someone had been lying there. I called my best friend. I. I think someone has been in my apartment. I told her. She laughed. You have been working too much. You're being paranoid. I figured maybe she was right, but then my couch started smelling like cigarette smoke. My bathroom towel was damp when I came home, even though I had not used it that morning. My TV watch history also showed programs I had never watched, and random things kept getting moved around. I felt like something was wrong, but I had no proof. On Friday, my boss let me leave work early. I was excited because I thought maybe if I came home in the middle of the day, I would stop feeling so paranoid. I parked down the street and walked to my building. I unlocked the building entrance quietly and took the stairs to my third Floor apartment. I reached my door and pressed my ear against it. I heard my TV playing and my heart started pounding. I slowly turned my key and the deadbolt clicked. I pushed the door open and my apartment smelled like cigarette smoke and cheap Cologne. The TV was on, but nobody was on the couch. My leftovers from last night were sitting on the coffee table, half eaten, with the fork still in the container. A beer bottle sat next to it. I don't drink beer. I pulled out my phone and started recording. I walked toward my bedroom and noticed that the door was half open and my bed was unmade. Someone had been sleeping there. I heard a drawer open, then humming. Someone was going through my dresser. I pushed the door all the way open. My

As a kid? When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule, no video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant, the closed captioning setting. I realised I could play games completely silent with subtitles on, no sound effects, no music, no voice acting, just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of stealth gaming. I'd wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds. I couldn't just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head and left the game running. He opened my door and I held my breath, pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I could see The light from my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble. He walked over to my TV. I was dead. Caught red handed, game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this. My mom's footsteps came up the stairs. I was sweating under the blankets. Look, my dad whispered.

I'm getting married next summer. When Jason proposed, I thought it would be nice to ask his niece Avery, to be a bridesmaid. She's 15 and the only kid on either side of our families. We'd only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago. We drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg, Greg's wife Monica and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun, way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparky ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed, oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine. For once, she laughed like it was a joke. But Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said it. It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up, hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things exactly like that to me at every family gathering, and it crushed me every single time. I still remember hiding in the bathroom at my cousin's wedding because she kept making comments about how I looked like a boy. I didn't even think. I just reacted. Hey, Avery, I forgot to tell.

My girlfriend Bianca is a model. I'm an accountant. When she agreed to a second date, my brother literally asked if I was paying her. Eight months in, everything was perfect. She was funny, spontaneous. Literally everything a man dreams of. We'd stay up talking until 3:00am. She'd surprise me at work with lunch. Made me feel like I was the only guy in the world. Then I moved into her place. Little things started changing. The way she'd phrase questions that weren't really questions. How her suggestions felt less like suggestions. Still perfect on the surface, but the way she looked at me was different. Then Christmas morning changed everything. We're opening gifts in bed and she hands me this perfectly wrapped box with a huge smile. Inside is a leather looking dog collar with Bianca's engraved on a silver tag. We both burst out laughing. For when you're being a bad boy, she joked, kissing me. I tossed the gag gift in the closet with the ugly sweater my mom sent. A week later, she's making dinner when she brings it up. You never wear my gift. Her voice is flat and serious. I laugh, thinking she's joking, but she's not. I put thought into that. You obviously don't care about what I give you. She locks herself in the bedroom. Two hours of silence. I knock on the door, she screams, just admit You don't love me. After hours of me waiting outside the bathroom, she comes out, eyes red. You really thought my gift was a joke? I wore it that night just to make her happy. The smile that spread across her face was worth the weirdness. Good boy, she said, running her fingers along the leather. Something in her tone made my stomach turn. But she was happy again, affectionate again. That's all that mattered. Next. Hey. I get home from work and she immediately freezes. Where's your collar? Like asking where my watch was. I laugh it off, thinking she's joking, but she's genuinely upset. You only wear it when I force you. That's what I mean to you. The guilt hits different when someone you love thinks you don't care. So I put it on. Comes routine walk in, collar on. Small price for peace. I thought it would only be a temporary thing that she would forget about after a few weeks. Then two weeks in, she starts saying good boy constantly. When I'd bring her coffee, when I'd agree with her, when I'd put the collar on without being asked, I mention it. Feels weird. It's just cute. She says, don't you want to be my good boy? The way she asks, like saying no. Feel like saying I don't love her. Then the commands start. I'm heading to the kitchen for dinner. Sit, she says from the couch. I freeze. What? Sit here next to Me. Her tone is playful, but her eyes aren't. I sit confused. Good boy. My skin crawls. Later, I'm making my plate. Did I say you could eat yet? She's not joking. Beg for it. I laugh nervously. She doesn't. I'm serious. Beg or don't eat. I stand there, plate in hand, calculating if this is the hill to die on. My stomach. My growls, please can I eat? She smiles. Good boy. I start documenting everything in my phone. The commands get worse. Stay when I try to leave arguments. Speak when she wants me to agree with

Then the camera turned, Connor was at it again, spiking another drink. Zoe approached them on the video. What are you doing? Connor looked nervous. Jimmy stepped forward smiling. Relax.

I was staring at the screen. My hands were shaking. I don't remember any of that. The officer looked at Jimmy. So you drugged multiple students, including this young man. Then you threatened Missy Reeves when she tried to stop you. Then you assaulted him while he was incapacitated. Amy was stammering, I was drunk. I didn't mean to. You were sober enough to threaten her, assault him and come to school today to press charges against her, Mr Reeve Stood up, his voice shaking. You drug student and you tried to get my daughter arrested for stopping you. The police arrested Jimmy right there, handcuffs, same as Connor. The officer told me I should get checked out at the hospital, said some of the d rugs they used can have lasting effects. Three other girls from the party came forward after said they felt drugged, too. Two of them had been hospitalized. Jimmy became the meme of the school, got his ah whooped by a girl a foot shorter than him.

Mr Reeves looked at me confused. I was confused, too. Why was I being summoned? I grabbed my bag and headed toward the door. Mr Reeves followed me. Why are they calling you? I don't know. Were you at the party? Yeah, but I don't remember anything after like ten PM I don't know why they want me. Mister Reeves looked worried. Now we walked to the office together. I pushed open the door to the principal's office. Jimmy was already sitting there. So was the principal and a police officer with a notepad. I looked around. Why am I here? The officer didn't answer. Just said, you'll understand in a moment. We're waiting for Mister Reeves. I sat down. My leg wouldn't stop bouncing. Jimmy wouldn't look at me. A few minutes later, the door opened. Zoe walked in. She saw me and her eyes went sad. Immediately, Jimmy stood up. Zoe, look, I'm really sorry about whatever Connor did. I swear I had no idea. Stop lying. Her voice was hard. I'm not lying. Yes, you are. She pulled out her phone, then she looked at me. I'm sorry you have to find out like this. Find out what? But Zoe didn't answer. Just hit Play on a video. The screen showed the party last night, Connor moving through the crowd with a drink in his hand. He stopped next to a girl, waited until she looked away, then poured something into her cup. My stomach dropped. The camera panned. Jimmy was standing right there watching, laughing. Oh, my god. The video kept playing.

But Jimmy wasn't laughing. His face was serious, his black eye. Basically speaking for I'm pressing assault charges. Zoe punched my face at the party last night. The laughter died immediately. I felt my stomach drop especially hard. You see, Zoe was my girlfriend. I'd gone with her to the party last night. But I think I drank too much and didn't remember a thing from it. What's crazy is Zoe wasn't at school today. Wouldn't answer any of my texts or calls either. Jimmy walked over to hit desk and sat down, touching his eye gently, like he wanted everyone to see it. 20 minutes into class, the door opened. The principal walked in with two police officers. Everyone went silent. We expected them to go to Jimmy, but instead, they walked straight to Connor, Jimmy's best friend. Connor Danes. You need to come with us. Connor's face went white. What? Why now? Please. One of the officers pulled out handcuffs. Connor stood up slowly. I didn't do anything. They cuffed him right there in front of everyone and walked him down the hallway. The second the door closed, everyone's phones came out. Texts, lying. Connor just got arrested. What did he do? Probably Something from the party last night. Whispers starting. Rumors spreading fast. Someone said assault, someone else said drugs. But Jimmy just sat at his desk, staring straight ahead, the class clown, saying nothing. After class, a group of students surrounded him in the hallway. Dude, what happened to Connor? Jimmy shook his head. I don't know what he did, but whatever it was, I want nothing to do with it. I was standing there listening, trying to make sense of it. I

Senior year, this kid Josh thought he was untouchable because his dad was on the school board. He'd show up twenty minutes late every day. Interrupt class, talk back to teachers, the whole deal. His dad donated a new football scoreboard and renovated the teachers lounge. So administration basically let him do whatever he wanted. Mr. Walters was different, though. He was this older guy, maybe late fifties. Been teaching history for thirty years. He was one of those teachers who actually cared. Stayed after school to help students. Brought in donuts on test days, wrote recommendation letters. But he had zero tolerance for disrespect. For the first month of school, Josh tested him constantly. He'd walk in late with food. Mr. Walters would Mark him absent. Josh would argue his case. Mr. Walters would just keep tea. It was this quiet war nobody talked about, but everyone noticed. Josh's friends thought it was hilarious. They'd laugh every time he strolled in late like it was some kind of performance. And one Tuesday in October, we're learning about the Vietnam War draft. Mr. Walters is explaining how young guys, barely eighteen years old, got called up whether they were ready or not. Had no choice. Shipped overseas within weeks. Actually getting emotional about it because his younger brother died over there in 1968. The whole class is locked in. Actually paying attention for once. You can hear people breathing. That's when Josh strolls in 30 minutes late. Not five minutes, not 10 30. Full minutes into a 50 minute class. He's got a Starbucks venti cup in one hand, phone in the other, AirPods still in his ears. Mr. Walters stops mid sentence. He's holding up this black and white photo of soldiers in a jungle, and he just freezes. The classroom goes completely silent. Even Josh's friends aren't laughing. Josh doesn't even look up. He's checking his Instagram as he walks to his desk in the back row, taking his sweet time. Mr. Walters very slowly puts down the photo. He walks to the center of the room, arms crossed, and just watches Josh sit down, take out his AirPods one by one, and set up his stuff like nothing's wrong. Finally, Josh notices everyone staring. He looks up at Mr. Walters and goes, what? My bad. Traffic was crazy. Nobody breathes. We all know something's about to happen. Mr. Walters nods slowly, like he's thinking. Then he says in this eerily calm voice, Josh, do you know what they called people who showed up late in Vietnam? Josh leans back in his chair, smirking. He thinks this is going to be some boring history lesson he can ignore. His boys in the back are grinning. What? The word just hangs there in the air. Josh's smirk falters for a second, but he tries to recover. Mr. Walters walks toward him slowly. And I swear, the temperature in The room drops ten degrees. See, in war, you don't get to blame traffic. You don't get a Starbucks run. You show up when you're supposed to. Or people die because you weren't there to cover their position mission. Josh shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Okay, but it's just class, man. Relax. Worst thing he could have said. Mr. Walters stops right at Josh's desk, looks down at him. Just class. He looks around at all. Thirty two of us sitting there. These students showed up on time. They're here to learn about people who sacrificed everything. They respect the material, they respect each other. And they respect me. But you, you walk in here

I teach 10th grade English at a public school in Ohio. Three weeks into the fall semester, one of my brightest students, Devon, stopped showing up to class. He'd been getting straight A's, always participate. The kind of kid who actually did the reading. When he came back two weeks later, the school counselor, Miss Inguyen, pulled me aside in the hallway. Devon's father passed away suddenly. Heart attack. He's having a really rough time. Just wanted to give you a heads up. I waited until after class that day and pulled Devon aside. Hey. I heard about your dad. I'm really sorry. Listen, don't worry about any of the work you missed. We. I already took the state exam, so as far as I'm concerned, you're done with the requirements. Just focus on getting through your other classes and taking care of yourself. He nodded, didn't say much. I could see he was barely holding it together. For the next two months, Devin showed up to my class every day. He did every assignment I gave, even though I told him he didn't have to. Solid E+ work. Not his usual A's, but considering everything, I was just glad he was functioning. Then, in early December, I got an email from Miss Nguyen asking me to attend a meeting about Devon. I checked my grade book. He was doing fine in my class, so I had no idea. What this was about. I walked into the counselor's office and saw four other teachers sitting there. Missus Harrington from history, Mr. Lopez from math, Missus Lynn from science, and Coach Davidson, who taught health. Miss Inguyen started the meeting. Devon is failing four out of six class classes he's in danger of repeating the entire year. The only classes he's passing are English and PE. I wanted to bring everyone together to figure out a plan. Missus Harrington jumped in immediately. He's missed over twenty assignments in my class. I told him he could make up ten of them, but he hasn't turned in a single one. At a certain point, we have to hold students accountable. Mr. Lopez nodded. Same situation in math. He won't stay after school for tutoring. Won't ask for help. Just sits there. I looked at Miss Minion. What exactly did you want my input on? He's doing fine in my class. Missus Harrington turned to me, clearly annoyed. That's exactly the problem. You're enabling him. I don't see why we even needed you here. You just let the kids skip out on work. That's not helpful. That's not teaching. The room got quiet. I leaned forward. His dad died eight weeks ago. You really think 20 history worksheets about the French Revolution matter to him right now? Structure matters. Missus Harrington said, these kids need to learn that life doesn't stop just because something bad happens. That's a valuable lesson. He's 16. I Said he just lost his father. The valuable lesson he's learning right now is that half his teachers care more about their grade books than his dead parent. Coach Davidson shifted uncomfortably. Mister Lopez stared at his hands. Missus Harrington's face went red. That's completely unfair. I offered him extensions. The door opened. Devon walked in.

She should never have been born. I ignored him. That same night, he kidnapped my daughter and tried to bury her alive. The police caught him. That was two weeks ago this morning. The judge went pale when my father in law revealed his true motives. Harold Whitman, 98 years old, stood in that hospital room staring at Emma like she was contaminated. A disgrace to our family name, he said, then shuffled out. My husband David made excuses. He's old, confused his medication. I should have trusted my instincts. Two days later, David collapsed in our living room, drugged. Emma was gone. They found Harold in the woods at 4:00am, standing over a hole with a shovel. Emma was six feet down in a wooden box he'd built, barely breathing. Why, Detective Martinez asked him. Harold looked at her with pale blue eyes. You wouldn't understand. I know what she is. The preliminary hearing was supposed to be routine. Senile old man, attempted murder. Case closed. Then Harold stood up in court and said, I've been tracking her family for 73 years, the Caldwell women. I know what they are. My blood turned to ice. How did he know my Maiden name? Harold pulled out a worn folder. Sarah's great grandmother, Margaret Caldwell, married in 1923. Within five years, her husband was dead. So were two Business partners, seven deaths total. He held up photographs, black and white images of women from different decades, different clothes, different hairstyles, same face, my mother's face. The Caldwell women don't age normally, Harold said. They live longer, stay younger, and they kill always. It's in their blood. I wanted to scream that he was insane, except Missus Patterson next door, died last spring, heart attack at 60. She threatened to report us to the city. My coworker Jenny died in a car accident six months ago. Brakes failed. She'd been flirting with David constantly. David's ex girlfriend, Rachel, died of an allergic reaction after we got engaged. I've been at the same restaurant that day watching her, wishing she would just go away. Ask Sarah how many people died around her, Harold said. People who got in her way. Three women, three deaths, three threats to my perfect life. That baby will grow up to do exactly what her bloodline has done, Harold continued. She'll kill innocent people. I couldn't let that happen again. The judge called a recess. I walked outside, hands shaking, not from fear, from realization Harold was right about everything except one thing. He thought Emma would become a killer someday. But the hunger was already in me, growing stronger. And Harold had.

They were so excited they even drew pictures. But on Christmas Day, when we got to my parents house, there were no gifts for them. Instead, everything they wished for was sitting in front of my brother's kids. I didn't say a word. I just packed our things. The next morning, I woke up to 17 calls and a single text from my grandma. What it said made my stomach drop. I'm Jordan, 34, with two kids, Liam, 7, and Maisie, 5. My dad's former military, firm handshake, twenty dollar in a card kind of guy. So when he called asking what the kids wanted for Christmas, I was shocked. Maybe he's finally trying. Liam and Maisie grabbed the phone, rattling off Lego sets and a pink karaoke machine. Dad laughed, took notes, said I'll see what Santa can do. The next day they drew pictures. Liam sketched a red bike with flame decals. Maisie drew a microphone surrounded by stars. Christmas morning, we drove to my parents house around noon. My brother Brandon's SUV already there. We walked in, the living room floor was a wrapping paper graveyard. Brandon's twins were knee deep in toys, remote control cars, tablets. And front and center, the red bicycle Liam had drawn, same model, same flame decals, same white training wheels. Next to it, the pink karaoke microphone, glittery stand, disco light. Liam froze. Dad, is that Mine. My dad came around the corner, looked at my kids, smiled. Oh, you made it. Merry Christmas. Maisie tugged my sleeve. Is it mine, daddy? Tara knelt beside them. Why don't we go sit in the kitchen? We stayed 22 minutes. Liam kept his coat on the whole time. Maisie barely spoke. No one asked why we were leaving. That night I couldn't sleep. At 6:43 a. M, my phone exploded, 17 missed calls. Mom, Brandon, Dad. Buried under them, a text from my 87 year old grandma. They told the kids the gifts were from your dad, not Santa. My dad used their wish lists. The shop for Brandon's twins then took credit. I didn't respond. I spent the morning numb watching my kids play quietly, pretending not to notice. Then Brandon called. Voicemail, thanks for leaving early yesterday. Gave the boys more time without having to share. Oh, and mom said your kids didn't get much. So we've got extra stuff if they want to come over. No.

Donating sperm pays $150 per visit, but nobody warns you about the actual process. I thought it'd be simple. Show up, do your thing, collect a check. Wrong. First appointment took three hours. They drew seven vials of blood, height, weight, blood pressure. Then came the physical exam where a nurse had to check everything, and I mean everything. She measured things I didn't know could be measured. The whole time she's making notes on a clipboard like she's inspecting a used car. Then she casually drops this bomb. You have exceptional motility and concentration. I had no idea what that meant until she showed me a chart on the wall. Apparently my sperm count is in the top 2% of donors they've seen. She circled a No. 280 million per milliliter. Normal is 15 million. I'm sitting there in a paper gown being told I produce but gets a premium sperm. They made me sign this massive consent form. One section asked what to do with your samples if you die before using them. Options included destroy them, donate to research or transfer to another individual for their personal use. That last one haunted me. Who wants a dead stranger's frozen sperm? Why is that even an option? The donation room was where things got truly bizarre. They walked me down this hallway, handed me a key and pointed to room 3, 5 separate locks on the door, industrial grey couch made of This plasticky vinyl material that stuck to your skin instantly. There was a lamp in the corner. For some reason, just a regular table lamp. No overhead lighting, just this sad little lamp. Full cabinet under the sink. With it, at least 30 bottles of lube, different brands, different types. They restocked after every patient. Next to the cabinet was a red emergency button with a sign press if additional supplies needed. Who runs out of an entire cabinet of lube? What kind of Marathon sessions were happening in here? The entertainment setup was professional grade, 50 inch TV mounted on the wall, surround sound speakers in all four corners like they designed a home theater specifically for this purpose. Remote control looked like it operated a spaceship. 47 buttons, no labels. Took me 15 minutes to figure out how to switch inputs. When I finally got the TV working, I discovered their video library. Hundreds of titles organized by category. Problem, 80% were gay content. Not judging. Just wasn't expecting it. Spent another 10 minutes scrolling to find something that worked for me. The whole time I'm thinking about the people waiting.

There had been something slightly crunchy in it, but I'd assumed it was nuts or maybe candied fruit. When we got to the ER, Niko's ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. No waiting, no paperwork. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. As soon as the nurse saw us, the first question she asked me was, do you have reactions to precious metals? Then nurse asked as she prepped an IV, what? No, I don't think so. My voice came out higher than usual. Why would you ask that? She exchanged a look with Niko's, but didn't answer. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine, which seemed extreme for food poisoning. They made everyone leave while they X rayed my abdomen. Can you even find my waist? I've been losing weight and training my ABS recently, I joked. But the handsome doctor didn't laugh. His face was serious. There's definitely a metallic object in your stomach, he whispered quietly. Before I could even process what he said, an elderly woman appeared in the doorway. It was Sophia's grandmother. I recognized her from the photos in our apartment. Her eyes were red rimmed, like she'd just finished crying. Is it still intact? She asked the doctor in heavily accented English. The room went silent. Sophia finally looked. At me, and the anger in her eyes made me shrink back. You ate my flurry, she said, each word dripping with barely controlled rage. For what? She sighed like she was sick of my BS and continued, in Greek tradition, we have a lucky coin that we put into sweet bread. When you're the one to eat the slice of bread with the coin, you will gain the luck of a thousand generations. My mind was spinning. A coin? I'd swallowed a coin! Sophia's grandmother stepped forward, showing me the old photograph. But what you swallowed wasn't just any coin. It was an 1823 Greek Phoenix because chimed in, worth over $30,000. I felt the blood drain from my face, and the doctor cleared his throat and handed me a bottle of laxative. You'll need to strain everything to recover the coin. I smiled.

Then they quickly started the yacht. And as the rope tightened, the two were dragged into the sea by tremendous force. They surfaced quickly, struggling to break free from the restraints, but the cunning robbers gave them no chance, accelerating the yacht even further. Worse, the waters were filled with sharp coral. To protect his girlfriend, bond flipped his body, using his back to absorb the impact from the coral, not expecting that the blood streaming from his wounds attract two men eating sharks. Luckily, bond reacted in time, twisting his body to dodge the shark attack. At that moment, the thug on the yacht also noticed the sharks and quickly ordered his men to drive back toward them, planning to use the two as bait for the predators. For bond, this presented a perfect escape opportunity. As the yacht turned, they submerged and wrapped the rope around the rocks. The yacht completed its turn and accelerated at full speed. Bond held the rope tightly, trying to prevent it from moving, hoping to withstand the strain. The people on the boat mistook this for catching a shark and pushed the throttle further. Finally, after Bond's persistent effort, the rope snapped under the yacht's power and the suddenly springing buoy knocked one of the thugs into the sea. Hearing the commotion, the two sharks surfaced and devoured him, allowing bond and his companion to temporarily escape mortal danger.

She didn't need to work or manage the house. Her only task was to maintain her beauty. The table was very small, less than 2 meters in surface. She remained there for three years and seven months.

Over time, she began to feel special, as if everyone below were her servants. She loved the attention and praise. Since childhood, she had drawn attention, even modeling for fashion magazine, which made her feel superior to everyone else. First, the husband brought gifts every day, roses, expensive necklaces, new clothes, climbing the ladder to hand them to her personally. But over time, the husband changed. Gifts no longer came daily, and his words began to show carelessness. Woman started to doubt that he still loved her. One day, she wore a stunning new dress, hoping to catch his eye, but he didn't even glance at her, turning the table away to focus on work.

The boy began to wonder. Perhaps the girl was trapped inside the wall, and the rest of her body might be in the neighbor's room. He immediately ran to the neighbor's house, hoping to rescue her. But the neighbor, hearing his story, shook his head and said, you're imagining things. There's nothing here. Disappointed, the boy returned to his room. Yet doubts lingered in his mind. Perhaps the neighbor was hiding something. Determined, he quietly entered the neighbor's house through a window. But when he looked at the wall, he froze. It was perfectly clean, as if nothing had happened. The boy was not afraid. He brought the girl some food and even took a selfie with her. At night, while watching videos, strange thoughts returned to his mind. He decided to help the girl fully escape, first trying to tap the wall with a small can. But it failed, so he grabbed a hammer and began pounding the wall. The neighbor was startled by the sudden noise, ran to the window to see what was happening.

He accidentally swallowed a nail. Suddenly nauseous, he gagged. Then the incredible occurred. What emerged wasn't the nail, but an egg. The audience sat utterly stunned, then began hurling coins at him. The boy couldn't believe his eyes. His debut performance earned half a month's living expenses for him and his mother. He rushed home, shouting, mom, shake me! His mother gently jostled him, and coins poured forth endlessly. Seeing his mother smile, the boy made a vow. Someday he'd transform those coins to gold. But as years passed, he faced harsh reality. Barely surviving with street magic. Shame filled him for failing his childhood promise. That's when Houdini conceived a brilliant scheme. Next day, he walked into a police station. Play all his savings down with a bizarre request. The warden thought him insane. Houdini lifted his shirt, taunting the warden, saying his punch felt like cotton. The warden threw a powerful blow. Houdini remained completely unharmed, even demanded another strike. Enraged, the warden jailed him. But this was precisely Houdini's plan. His true scheme was to escape and make his name legendary. Before entering the prison, Houdini's wife kissed him, passing something secretly. The suspicious warden checked Houdini's mouth, but found nothing. Still, he warned, if you fail to escape.

In desperation, it even called its three puppies to help dig alongside it. Every five minutes, the dog barked into the debris, trying to rouse its buried owner. Finally, the young girl slowly opened her eyes. Hearing the constant barking from outside, Anna's consciousness slowly returned. She turned to look at her grandfather, trying to wake him up. Seeing this, the dog Mary barked even more urgently. But no matter how hard she tried, the grandfather wouldn't wake up. Suddenly, Mary heard something and quickly ran from the ruins, starting off at full speed following a shout she had heard. She reached two rescue workers, grabbing onto their clothes. The rescuers thought Mary was just playing with them, so they pushed her aside. But Mary refused to leave. One of the men, noticing the unusual behaviour, knelt down and asked Mary if her owner was trapped. Mary's expression turned serious and she immediately turned to run back. Seeing this, the two men quickly followed her. Mary LED them straight to where her owners were, barking continuously to signal that there were people trapped beneath the rubble. The two men immediately began their rescue efforts and soon discovered both the grandfather and granddaughter inside. Given the urgency of the situation, they didn't hesitate for a moment and began clearing the debris. Mary watched from the side and barked once in gratitude. Helicopter having received the distress signal. Arrived at Mary's location without delay. By the time it landed, the grandfather and granddaughter had been rescued. The rescue helicopter quickly descended, carrying a boy who was visibly emotional, his grandfather and sister lying below. The helicopter hovered over them, lowering the rescue ropes to assist.

But here's the catch. There's no internet, no entertainment of any kind, and only a single double bed for both of them to sleep on. Their only food is a nutritional liquid distributed by the organizers. And the challenge must be completed together. If even one person quits halfway, the other can finish the entire ordeal and still only walk away with 1 million. The moment the man pressed the red start button, the countdown officially began. Thinking about the fortune waiting at the end of 50 days, two cheered excitedly inside the room, already planning how they'd spend the money and dreaming of a bright future. First, the new environment. Fresh, almost fun. But as the days dragged on, one after another, they realized the challenge wasn't nearly as easy as they had imagined. Every night, the lights would shut off on schedule, forcing them to sleep. And at sunrise, they would be awakened automatically. Their meals were always the same blend.

The donor was Jenny, declared brain dead earlier that day and chosen to give her face to someone still fighting. On the way to the operating room, Jenny's mother stayed by her side without leaving for a second. At that moment, when she saw dozens of doctors and nurses gathering to bid Jenny a final farewell, the mother was overwhelmed with emotion. She leaned down and pressed one last kiss on Jenny's forehead before handing her over to the medical team.

Soon, once every instrument was in place, the face transplant procedure was ready to begin in full.

Not to mention the 1375 you got on your SAT's. Thanks to you. I'm so proud of you. Did you keep this this whole cooking thing a secret from me for so long? I don't know. It's easy. You know, I also got a lot of practice cooking with my brothers. I wish I ate like this when I was a kid. Spaghetti and sauce. No, a home cooked meal.

How did the paramedics find them? Someone called 9, 1, 1. Something is wrong with my parents. They went to sleep and now they won't wake up. Maura, do you know your address? 6, 12 west Adam street. Maura wasn't just watching us sleep. She was afraid we weren't gonna wake up. She was trying to protect us. You are a very brave girl, but you don't have to be brave all the time. You are safe here and always watch us, okay? Night. Night, Maura. Night. Night.

Venom warned Eddie that an unknown creature was approaching them. They had to leave quickly. But Venom thought running on foot was far too slow. Suddenly, Eddie spotted a horse in the desert. It was their best option. Eddie approached the horse, and Venom quickly took control of its body. With the boost of its dark power, the horse could reach speeds of 500 kilometers per hour. They dashed across the desert at incredible speed. After two hours of running, Venom stopped by a river to rehydrate. But the police had already locked onto their location. Soldiers blasted Venom with a powerful sonic wave. The frightened horse threw Eddie into the water. Venom immediately jumped in after him. But the soldiers weren't planning to let them go. One soldier tried to trap venom with a fishing net. But Venom escaped effortlessly. Eddie hoped to use the river to get rid of the pursuers. But he didn't know there was a cliff just 100 meters ahead. At the critical moment, Venom took over Eddie's body again. It wanted to save Eddie's life. But doing so would throw them into even greater danger. The Venom Hunters had already found their location.

So my husband threw them out. But what they said next changed everything. My parents always treated me like the family servant while my brother got everything. Growing up, I'd mow lawns while he played video games. I do laundry while he hung out with friends. When I complained, my dad would say I was being ungrateful. I left at 19 and never looked back. I met my wife in grad school. She saw how my family treated me and was horrified when I told my parents we were getting engaged at 25. They said she was beneath me, that I was making a mistake. We got married anyway, just her family there. They moved to Florida about eight years ago. Honestly, our relationship only works with distance. We text sometimes, but it's always tense. Last month, my wife and I bought our dream condo, two bedrooms downtown, everything we wanted. We were thrilled but kept it quiet from my parents. They're paying for a storage unit nearby and I knew exactly what would happen if they found out. As far as they knew, we rented a studio near my wife's office. Yesterday afternoon, I was working from home when my college buddy Ryan knocked. Behind him were my parents running like they pulled off a surprise. Ryan ran into them at target and thought it'd be nice to bring them over the moment They walked in and saw our open concept living room, the granite counters, the balcony view. My mom's smile died. She looked around slowly, face getting redder. Then she exploded. She screamed about how selfish we were, all this space and we never offered to help with. She yelled about how we've been getting along so well lately. Why would I lie? She said. I was sneaky and ungrateful, just like always. I stood there frozen. Ryan looked horrified. My mom kept going. Family helps family. You clearly don't care about us. That's when my wife came home. She walked in, saw my mom gesturing wildly, saw my face and her expression hardened. She set down her bag. Stop yelling in our home. My dad quiet until then, face bright red. Your home, he spat. You mean the home my money helped buy? The room went silent. I felt my stomach drop. I turned to face my parents. What money? My mom's angry expression shifted to something smug. She crossed her arms. We've been sending your brother $1,500 every month for eight years to help you both. We assumed he was splitting it like we asked. My wife's jaw dropped. I couldn't breathe. Eight years, $1,500 a month. That's $144,000. My brother bought a boat last year. He went to Japan twice. He drives a Tesla. And I'm standing in my first home that we scraped together for, learning he pocketed money meant for both of us. My hands shook. As I called my brother on speaker.

This is how a Turkish donar tower comes to life. The chefs start by slicing beef into thin, even pieces. Not too thick, but not too thin, either. After coating the slices with a special blend of seasonings and letting them marinate, they stack them layer by layer. It's just like building a house. A solid foundation is key to building high and keeping everything perfectly balanced. Sometimes they use tools to press it all tighter. Once the tower reaches a certain height, the chefs begin to shape it, trimming the edges to give it cleaner, more defined. Look, these cuts aren't just for appearance. They help the heat distribute evenly, so the roasted meat comes out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. And it's not just beef towers. There are chicken ones, too. And each one is made with the same care and patience. But no matter the meat, watching a donor tower being built is surprisingly satisfying. Almost like watching a savory sculpture come to life.

I'm not leaving. The man brings in a top tier exorcist. He holds holy water and chants an incantation. Holy water and his own spit spray all over the room, but he can't see a thing. The female ghost is standing right in front of him. He can't even see me. A little more left. You're mopping that up. A priest exorcism ends in failure. The second wave is a mysterious team from the east. They light candles and hold ritual artifacts, performing some kind of ancient ceremony. They claim everything will go smoothly, but they just end up setting off the smoke alarm. The scene is pure chaos. The eastern team fails, too. The third wave is a professional ghost catching squad. Dad, we got it all set, sir. We have the spirit. Oh, a butter dish. The chubby guy pretends to do something with an empty box. The female ghost still doesn't move an inch. The man can only think of one last person. That mysterious clerk from the bookstore. That's it. You just sit there. You want bells and whistles or reading? It's hostile. Wants you out of here. The ghost Elizabeth is intrigued. She thinks there's something special about this kid. The boy wants her to leave this place. That's right. The kid has a gift. The young man pauses and says something that shocks them both. There's an energy filled with resentment shooting from the ghost straight into your Body. Now, the human and the ghost are both stunned. Yeah.

Then all of a sudden they wanted me again. After I passed the bar exam to become a lawyer. I texted my family the date and time of my swearing and ceremony. My dad replied saying he couldn't make it because my brother Silas had a golf tournament at the same day. My mom said she'd be at the tournament too. Silas sent a laughing emoji and wrote, it's just a ceremony. You already passed. We'll celebrate later. I stared at my phone and typed back, understood. The ceremony was beautiful and I sat there in a room full of new lawyers with their families cheering and taking pictures. I was alone. The woman next to me had her entire extended family there and they kept apologizing for being too loud. I told them it was fine and tried not to cry. Afterwards, the law firm I joined took photos of all the new associates for their website and newsletter. I smiled in my professional headshot and pretended I wasn't heartbroken. My boss pulled me aside and said, where's your family? I wanted to meet them. I said they couldn't make it. And he looked confused but didn't push. I started working criminal defense and I was good at it, really good. I won cases that senior partners said were unwinnable. I worked 80 hour weeks and built a reputation. My family never asked about my Work. At Thanksgiving, my dad spent an hour talking about Silas's promotion at his sales job. And when I mentioned I'd won a major case, he said, that's nice and change the object. Silas asked if I was dating anyone. And when I said I was too busy with work, he said, you're always going to be too busy. That's your problem. My mom nodded and said, he's right. You need balance. I said, I have balance. I'm building a career. My dad laughed and said, Silas has a career and still makes time for family. Maybe you should take notes. On Christmas, my dad gave Silas an expensive watch and gave me a gift card to target. When I opened it, Silas smirked and said, at least you can buy yourself something nice. I left early and my mom texted me later saying I'd ruined Christmas by being dramatic. I stopped going to family dinners. After that, my dad would text saying I was being distant and I needed to make more effort. Didn't respond. My mom called once and said, your father is hurt that you won't come around anymore. Family is supposed to forgive. I said, family is supposed to show up and hung up. Six months after my swearing in ceremony, I got a call from my dad at 2 in the morning. He said, Silas has been arrested. You need to come to the police station right now. I was exhausted from a long day. In court. But I got dressed and drove 40 minutes to the station. Silas had gotten into a bar fight and assaulted someone badly enough to send them to the hospital. The charges were aggravated assault and he was looking at serious prison time. My dad grabbed my arm when I walked in and said, you have to fix this. You're a lawyer. You can make this go away. I said, I'm a criminal defense attorney. I don't make things go away. I defend people in court. He said, so defend him. He's your brother. I looked at Silas sitting in the holding cell and he wouldn't even look at me. My dad said, we're family. You owe us this. I said, I owe you this. Where were you six months ago when I got sworn in? My dad said, this is.

There's no fight. All that happened was my daughter gently suggested that my life is meaningless. Oh, here's our little angel now. If you have a problem, you should take it up with her. Apologize to your mom, dad. Not just for you, but for me, too. Today I had to eat an apple. I'm not gonna apologize to mom because you had to eat fruit. Everything she does, she does for this family. It's her job. And she doesn't get any employee discounts. And all her customers Jerk's. Every one of them. You may not Wanna do what your mom does when you grow up? But you gotta learn to respect it.

Doctor said, these will help your headaches. She smiled. I'd never mentioned headaches. I pretended to swallow them and had them tested. They came back as poison. That's when I handed the report to my divorce lawyer. The pills sat beside my coffee cup like tiny white threads. Doctor said, these will help your headaches. Claire smiled. Her hand rested on my shoulder. I'd never mentioned headaches. That sweet of you. I picked up the pills. When did you talk to Doctor Morrison? Yesterday. I called about your symptoms. What symptoms? I brought the pills to my mouth, pretended to swallow with orange juice, Tuck them under my tongue. All better, I smiled back. Claire kissed my forehead. Good. Take them every morning, doctor's orders. The moment she left for Pilates, I spit the pills into a napkin. Something was wrong. We've been married three years. Happy, I thought. But lately things felt off. She'd insisted I update my life insurance, $2 million. He suggested I add her name to my investment accounts. She'd started asking about my will. I called my friend Marcus. He's a pharmacist. Can you test something for me quietly? What kind of something? Pills my wife gave me. She says they're for headaches. I don't have. Marcus called me at midnight. David, these aren't headache pills. My stomach dropped. What? What are they? Thallium acetate. It's a poison. Causes organ failure over weeks if you've been taking these daily. His voice was tight. You'd be dead in a month. The room spun. The symptoms look natural, fatigue, nausea, kidney failure. Doctors would think it was cancer. I couldn't breathe. My wife was trying to kill me. I called my lawyer, Richard Chen. He connected me with Catherine Walsh, top divorce attorney in the state. I showed them everything, the pills, Marcus's lab report. We need more, Catherine said. One instance isn't enough. We need a pattern. So I played along. Every morning, Claire handed me pills. Every morning I pretended to take them. I collected them all, 17 pills over 17 days. I also installed cameras, tiny ones, kid bedroom. On day 12, I caught her. She was in the kitchen crushing pills, mixing them into my vitamins, talking on the phone. He's getting weaker. Another few weeks and it'll look natural. The voice on the other end was male. Derek, her yoga instructor. Can't wait to spend his money. Derek said, that house in Malibu is perfect. We'll be there soon. Claire laughed. Once he's gone, I had everything. Catherine called me three days later. I filed the divorce petition this morning. But there's something else you should know. What? Claire's hosting a charity gala tonight at the Fairmont, 200 guests, hospital donors, her nursing colleagues, the mayor supposed to speak. My chest tightened. And I think you should attend. With the police. The Fairmont Ballroom was packed when I arrived. Crystal chandeliers, string Quartet. Claire in a Designer gown. She saw me across the room. Her smile faltered. I walked toward her. Detective Martinez and Detective Chen followed 10 feet behind in plain clothes. David Claire's voice was bright, fake. I didn't know you were coming. Surprise. Her nursing colleagues surrounded us. Her boss, Doctor Patterson, the hospital board president.
